Rauch,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Perhaps the most comprehensive work to date in analyzing global metal cycles has been (1) the estimation of global metal stocks and flows from natural and anthropogenic sources by Nriagu, Pacyna, and colleagues (e.g., Nriagu 1979, 1990; Nriagu and Pacyna 1988; Pacyna et al. 1995) and (2) the estimation of anthropogenic stocks and flows by Graedel, Gordon, and colleagues (e.g., Graedel et al. 2004, 2005; Klee and Graedel 2004; Johnson et al. 2005; Gordon et al. 2006). Although useful to their disciplines, none of these studies provide a detailed, comprehensive “anthrobiogeochemical” cycle. An “anthrobiogeochemical” cycle is a biogeochemical cycle with its peripheral system boundaries expanded to incorporate the cycling systems of the anthroposphere. In the present context, the term is meant to emphasize the significant role humans play in mobilizing metal mass on the global scale, as opposed to humanity’s more minor role in mobilizing the grand nutrients. Without a comprehensive cycle, it is difficult to discuss how the past, present, and potential future use of metals in human society compare to the sustainable mobilization and use of Earth’s natural biogeochemical flows. Preliminary global anthrobiogeochemical cycles aimed at remedying this lack of knowledge integration of human and natural impacts have now been developed for aluminum (Al), silver (Ag), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) (Rauch and Graedel 2007; Rauch and Pacyna 2009). Aspects of this story of human impact include the (1) relative total mass mobilization (the mass of material moved from one anthrobiogeochemical reservoir to another) by human and natural processes and (2) metal emissions to air, water, and soil. One of the most comprehensive analyses to date, Nriagu and Pacyna’s (1988) seminal paper on global anthropogenic metal emissions to the environment, has been updated to the year 2000 for Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, and Zn, and expanded upon by representing how the natural cycle of metal interacts with these emissions (Rauch and Pacyna 2009). These anthrobiogeochemical cycles of Al, Ag, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn also diagram the relative sizes of mass flows in anthropogenic technological cycles versus natural hydrological, biological, and geological cycles. People have today become true global geomorphic agents. While it took 5,000 years for human society to mobilize the amount of material approximately equal to the mass of the Catskill Mountains, people are on a pace to double that figure by the end of the twenty-first century (Hooke 2000). Metals are an integral part of this total mass movement as they act as technological nutrients without which modern society could not function. This ever increasing utilization of metal cannot exist without consequences to the natural mobilization and cycling of metals. By analyzing spatially the flows of the Klee–Graedel Human vs. Nature Dominance Index (Klee and Graedel 2004) for Cu, Zn, Al, and Fe, the spatial variability of human impact on these metal cycles can be approximated. These four metals were selected because they constitute society’s major industrial metals and as a consequence have significant metal mass flow quantities. Other metals, such as gold (Au), may potentially have more aggregate material mass movement associated with mining (mining is one of the six mass flows in the index), but as defined, the Human–Nature Dominance Index only examines the direct movement of metal mass on an element by element basis and does not account for indirect effects. If it were to, the associated material mass mobilized via Au mining would be allocated among the remaining elements of the periodic table, not to Au itself. Spatial resolution of key reservoirs in both the anthropic and natural realms provides further insights into the perturbation of Earth’s metal cycles beyond what can be elucidated by nonspatial global anthrobiogeochemical cycles alone. The results show that the patterns of dominance are both what one would expect, with high human impact in dense urban centers and mining sites, and what one would not necessarily deduce (the human impact on Al and Fe is much larger than on Zn and Cu in these urban areas) (Rauch 2010). Anthropogenic activity not only releases metal to the environment via unnatural vectors, it also moves metal from its natural setting into human consumption. Depleted from virgin ore deposits, this relocated metal mass is accumulating in in-use stocks and waste repositories, becoming a significant secondary resource of metal. The size of these secondary deposits is reflected in the market size of the recycling and reuse industry, at least in the USA, where it now exceeds the size of the mining industry both in terms of employment and revenues (R. W. Beck Inc. 2001). To increase understanding of these secondary deposits, work on mapping the quantities of in-use Al, Fe, Cu, and Zn stocks at the global scale at 1 km resolution has been completed (Rauch 2009). These deposits, concentrated in the wealthiest regions of the world, are compared to the locations of traditional ore deposits. While ore deposits are more spatially concentrated, they are more equally dispersed between developing and developed countries. The implications of the research introduced and discussed in further detail below are generally threefold. First, in managing metal emissions into the environment, it is helpful to understand the vectors, and magnitude of such vectors, so as to be able to prioritize the allocation of management resources. Anthrobiogeochemical cycles provide this information. Second, the relative differences between the spatial distributions of primary and secondary metal deposits show the material metal wealth transfer occurring from the poorer to the richer nations of the world, highlighting a potential long-term inequity in global metal resource distributions. And finally, the research clearly demonstrates that human society has now itself become a force of nature in the geological movement of metal material on Earth. The remainder of this article delves into three areas of the human–nature connection of global metal mobilization. First, anthrobiogeochemical cycles are discussed, and the vantage these cycles provide in understanding major metal mass mobilization is presented. The data generated by constructing these cycles are then examined through the lens of a human–nature dominance index, both spatially and nonspatially. Finally, the greatest imbalance observed in these global anthrobiogeochemical cycles, that of ore depletion and in-use stock accumulation, is further discussed and analyzed.",9

The price rise was interrupted for some commodities when the United States and Europe entered recession in the last quarter of 2007, but prices of others continued rising a little longer until mid-2008. As seen from Fig. 1, the steep downturn in the world economy in the autumn of 2008 exacerbated the already initiated fall in commodity demand and resulted in severe declines in prices.
 Commodity price indices, by group, 2002-May 2009. Source: UNCTAD Commodity Price Bulletin  In the wake of the commodity boom and bust, a number of articles and reports have appeared that attempt to make the case that the surge in commodity prices and the subsequent fall were caused by speculation. Specifically, they argue that the nature of commodity markets has changed as a result of financial investors redirecting funds into these markets in order to diversify portfolios and offset declining yields of stock and bond markets. This “financialization” of commodity markets led, it is argued, to steeper price rises than would otherwise have been the case, and to a steeper fall once prices started falling. In the following, this claim is reviewed. The aim here is not to provide a detailed statistical or econometric analysis of events, but to present an overview of the arguments in a form that is hopefully accessible to non-specialists. One of the reasons for thinking this may be useful is that the arguments of the proponents of the speculation hypothesis appear to have prevailed among non-experts, as well as in commodity trading circles, in spite of it having been rejected in most of the authoritative statistical and econometric studies carried out. This is understandable in view of the intuitively convincing nature of some of the arguments used by supporters of the speculation hypothesis. By way of contrast, academic economists and financial market regulators who have concluded that the hypothesis should be rejected have not made their views—admittedly based on less accessible reasoning—widely known. While the scope of the article is applicable to all commodities and uses examples for a broad range of products, the market for crude oil is often referred to. There are three reasons for this. First, the rise and subsequent fall in crude oil prices attracted a great deal of attention and for many people, this was probably the only aspect of the commodity price boom that they noticed. Second, the crude oil market is broadly representative of commodity markets both with respect to price formation and interaction with the rest of the economy. Third, the quality and availability of data for crude oil are better than those for most commodities. It should be noted that the discussion in the following is concerned with events during the period leading up to, and including, the peaks in commodity prices reached during the 2007–2008 period. Interesting developments have taken place in commodity markets since then, but they are outside the scope of this article, mainly because it would otherwise grow to impractical dimensions. The section, “The financial speculation argument”, sets out the arguments used by the proponents of the speculation explanation. The section “The nature of commodity markets” provides some basic descriptions of commodity markets. It is concluded from the description that the speculation argument is to some extent based on false analogies with other markets. The section “Some simple statistical evidence“reviews some simple statistical evidence, and the section “Brief review of published studies” provides a brief review of published studies, concluding the basic examination of the arguments. Finally, the “Conclusions” section sets out some conclusions.",4

Historically, mining has often been an important driver for regional development, but the local benefits of investments in mineral development appear to be diminishing compared to past experiences. Past mineral development projects often faced poor transport links and usually had little alternative to establishing town sites near the mines to accommodate workers and their families (Crowson 2008). The populations of such towns required various goods and services supplied locally and in this way, communities would emerge around mines. Local employment would consist of not only direct employment at the mine, but also indirect employment in suppliers to the mine, and of jobs sustained by induced consumption spending. But basing ones expectations of the regional impact of contemporary mining projects on past examples might prove a fallacy in hindsight. Eggert (2001), for instance, argues that while mineral development in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century typically served local or regional populations and industry, falling transport costs during the more recent decades have enabled mines to be located further away from final consumers and mineral processors, and the previously regional mineral markets have hence become global. In addition, technological progress has led to increasingly specialized input demands which cannot necessarily be supplied competitively by local firms (Radetzki 1982). Eggert (2001) argues that the backward and forward regional economic linkages of contemporary mines are weaker than they have been in past mineral development projects. More frequently than in the past, inputs are purchased outside of the region, and hence will not benefit local businesses. Radetzki (1982) argues that most of the returns to capital and to entrepreneurship may flow not only out of the region, but out of the country as well. This paper focuses on analysing the potential regional economic impact of the so-called Kaunisvaara Iron Ore Project, which is currently being developed by Northland Resources in Pajala—a municipality of approximately 6,300 people, located in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. The county covers nearly one quarter of Sweden’s total land area and is sparsely populated with a total population of approximately 249,000, or less than 3 % of Sweden’s total population. Figure 1 illustrates the geographic location of the Kaunisvaara Project. Scandinavia and the geographic location of the Kaunisvaara Project The local government in Pajala has had to tackle demographic decline during the last decades, as its population has decreased by nearly 50 % since the late 1960s. Local officials are hopeful that the positive aspects of the Kaunisvaara Project, such as new jobs and increased tax revenues can improve the socio-economic outlook and that the project might also contribute to improving the negative population development. The mining industry has maintained a strong presence in Norrbotten County since the late 1800s when the iron ore producer Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag (LKAB) was formed. The current operations are concentrated to the towns of Kiruna and Gällivare (located to the west of Pajala), where LKAB and Boliden Mineral AB together employ around 3,125 persons. While it may be tempting to look at the contribution of mining to the development of these towns, which currently have a combined population of 41,502, the arguments outlined above suggest that these towns may offer poor yardsticks for assessing the regional economic impact of the Kaunisvaara Project. Quantitative assessments based on current data are motivated to increase the understanding of the potential impacts and to enhance the public sectors ability to plan for and adapt to a new economic situation. In an attempt to provide such an assessment, we employ the Swedish regional economic impact model (rAps) to estimate medium- to long-term local and regional economic benefits of the Kaunisvaara Project, focusing mainly on the contribution of jobs in Pajala and Norrbotten County. The paper extends upon earlier work that was presented in Ejdemo and Söderholm (2011). There are two main differences between the paper at hand and our earlier study: (1) The previous study considered a preliminary planFootnote 1 for the mining operation which indicated an on-site (direct) employment of 1,071 persons at full production. The plan for the project has since been revised and the paper at hand considers the new plan which indicates a total of 500 on-site workers. Notably, the previous plan for the project included the construction and operation of a pellet plant, which has been excluded in the revised project. (2) In our earlier study, we assumed that the demand for labour was met by a considerable increase in in-migration to Pajala. This expansive demographic assumption was imposed to indicate a potential impact on the local economy if a fly-in-fly-out solution to labour demand could be avoided. The assumptions that are used in the paper at hand conform more closely to the prevailing demographic trend and assume a more modest direct impact on the demographic development. The paper proceeds as follows. “Model, data inputs, scenarios and assumptions” section briefly describes the applied regional economic impact model and summarizes the main characteristics of the Kaunisvaara Project. We outline the scenario-based approach, the input data and the main underlying assumptions of the study. “Model simulation results” section outlines the main results, first on the local level (i.e. Pajala municipality) and then followed by the regional level (i.e. Norrbotten County). The focus of the paper is largely on the contribution of jobs and in particular on the strength of multiplier effects in a few different scenarios, but we also address the effect on taxable incomes on both the local and county levels. Finally, some concluding remarks and implications are summarized in the “Final remarks” section.",11

Currently, copper is mined in Lubin, Rudna, Sieroszowice, Polkowice mines and rock salt in Sieroszowice mine. The subsequent mining areas, i.e. “Glogow Gleboki” and others, are now prepared for extraction. Copper deposit occurs on the depth of from 700 to 1,500 m below the surface. Apart from those deposits, it is a region where rich lignite deposits are encountered. They occur on the depth from tens to over 400 m below the surface. In many cases, due to the land development, it is not possible to use the open-pit mining method. However, the progress in clean coal/lignite technologies, especially the method of underground coal gasification (Kozlowski 2008; Stachowiak et al. 2011) enables to plan their extraction.",3

The companies are forced to interact with other market players on a global level, and their activities cross borders very frequently. Recent decades have dramatically changed the economic environment of every business branch, and thus, the sources of company value creation have changed as well. International expansion is nowadays a necessity that accompanies entrepreneurs at earlier stages of development than in the past, and its role in value creation and building a successful company is essential. On the one hand, geographically diversified activities are a good source of competitive advantage for a company over international competitors entering the domestic market. On the other hand, due to recent intensive changes, the risk of international expansion outside the home market has diminished significantly, and the presence of foreign competitors on a given market has increased. Still, there is no single pattern of how to go international. This phenomenon is very individual, and it depends on both the internal situation of a given company and the conditions of business environment. Today international expansion has become a natural direction of companies' development. This article describes the issues of value creation through international expansion of an enterprise. In the first part, the authors analyze different forms of the process of internationalization of a company. The second part presents sources of value creation focusing on their appropriate identification within such company and describes the influence of global expansion on its growth. The last part analyzes a Polish entity—KGHM Polska Miedź S.A.—as an example of a mining enterprise that has just started its international expansion and has identified this process as a key factor value creation for its shareholders.",2
25,2,Mineral Economics,08 January 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-012-0028-7,"Vertical integration, choice of the strategic development of the mining companies",March 2013,Jan Kudelko,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Specific form of the company's strategic choice is the vertical integration, which means the consolidation, in one company, of different activities being the part of the same production process and selling chain. This situation is encountered due to the internal development of the company or as a result of the strategy of acquisition or merger. Strategies of vertical integration consist on identification of processes being outside the core company activities and enable to divide the units, related with the company, into groups essential for its activity. Processes of joining with these units or taking over their functions make for the added value creation due to the extension of the value chain, with simultaneous maintaining the production–market system. Due to the direction of the merger of companies, we have to types of vertical integration: backward towards suppliers and forward one towards buyers (Bucheli 2007; Davis and Duhaime 1992; Hoffler and Kranz 2011; Joskow 2003; Stuckey 1983). When the company has strong, but not the strongest competitive position and when the growth phase is close the saturation, the vertical expansion is recommended (Pierscionek 2003). We have then the limited development of specialization. Vertical integration means making use of the strong and stable market position through taking over the profits of sub-assemblies and parts to the own product, producers, as well as builds up the market position as a result of quality improvement, costs reduction, and shortening the delivery time (Ericsson 2008; Garrette and Dussauge 1996). Taking into consideration the intensity and organizational and legal form we have: Total integration, where all links of chain form one company Quasi-integration, having a form of agreements, shares, contracts, etc. In many industrial companies, which encountered the sales decrease, vertical integration is a popular practice, and its introduction gives the chance for spreading the activity into new areas. Vertical integration towards suppliers has numerous advantages and helps to obtain the benefits such as (Balakrishnan and Wernerfelt 1986; Krupski et al. 1998; Drazek and Niemczynowicz 2003; Jurdziak 2005): Possibility of building the market advantage based on supply confidence. It is very important on the monopolized suppliers market. Creation of the competitive advantage due to the low operation cost as a result of access, for example, to cheap raw materials. Not only the certainty of deliveries is an important issue, but also their low cost which is possible to achieve due to the own resource base. Possibility of limiting the transaction costs, resulting from relations between two firms. Possibility of increasing the competitiveness due to the higher quality reached due to its efficient and effective control and the selection of the appropriate materials and components. Access to the technology or innovation of merged companies. Additional effect of such system is a possibility of keeping the full confidence of technology used. The disadvantages of vertical integration are as follows: Reduction of company flexibility Problems with managing the complex company Problems with optimal production Big capital required Total integration may be replaced by quasi-integration, having the following typical forms: Purchasing the minority shares of suppliers (or customers) Granting the related firms with the loans and credit warranties by basic company Granting the credits before concluding a purchase Contracts ensuring the exclusiveness of delivery Delivery of dedicated installations Joint research and development activity Vertical integration is one of the strategic options of mining companies' development. Due to the type of company's activity and market offer, they choose specialization strategy (smelting) or diversification strategy (mining, processing, smelting). Specialization strategy is often accompanied by slimming the company and in extreme cases only the basic function is carried out, for example mining the mineral or only its processing. In the case of diversification strategy, there is often a concentration of activity, which means holding many functions in one or several economic chains. “Slimmer” organizations correspond with strategy of narrow specialization while the so-called concentrated companies are typical for diversification strategy. It is, however, only a model situation and in practice the intermediate status is possible. Vertical integration is in the contrast with specialization, since it joins (by capital or contract) several links of the value chain. Each link can have its own outside markets (Fig. 1). Models of vertical integration (own study)",1
25,2,Mineral Economics,29 August 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-012-0020-2,The perseverance of the ongoing metal and mineral boom,March 2013,Marian Radetzki,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"My “three booms” article from 2006 (Radetzki 2006), analyzing the three major commodity booms since the Second World War, beginning in 1950, 1973, and 2004, respectively, concluded that all three were triggered by fast macroeconomic expansion and an ensuing upward jump in commodities demand that, in turn, raised commodity prices. The first two booms were of short duration. After about 2 years, they were both punctuated by recessions that suppressed demand, leading to price falls. The third boom, however, which started in 2003–2004, was still riding high early in 2008, and at that time, there was no recession in sight. A concern of considerable importance to mineral-dependent economies has always been to clarify how long an ongoing mineral boom will last and what forces other than a recession might conceivably end it. To help resolve this concern, I wrote a short note together with four colleagues, which was eventually published in Resources Policy (Radetzki et al. 2008). The note argues that, in the absence of a demand reducing recession, the boom could persevere for up to about 15 years, given the extended process needed to bring new production capacity in place and so restoring balance between supply and demand at prices around long-run equilibrium. The first part of the present paper reproduces the main arguments of that note. A deep recession did, in fact, occur in 2008–2009, in the wake of the international financial crisis, and observers coined it as the deepest setback to the world economy since the 1930s depression. Yet, after a surprisingly short and not very deep decline, metal and mineral prices in real terms have continued to ride at historically very high levels. They still do in the spring of 2012, as this is being written. The second part of the paper explores the nature of the 2009 recession to understand why it did not kill the commodities boom. A concluding section summarizes and provides a forward outlook.",8

However, after the turn of the century, China holds a significant role as an importer of iron ore. China's import of iron ore rose almost nine times from 70 Mt in the year 2000 to almost 620 Mt in 2010 (see Fig. 1). Labson (1997) already, analyzing the world trade of iron ore using econometrics, forecasted Asia to be a significant consumer of steel in the beginning of the twenty-first century. Among other things, Labson (1997) projected that China alone by the year 2000 had to import at least 58 million tons of ore to meet the higher demand and consumption of steel in the region, a fourfold increase in 10 years. Now, when 10 years has passed of the twenty-first century, we know that this was an underestimate. China's import of iron ore in the year 2000 was close to 70 million tons with a following almost ninefold increase during the first following 10 years. Chinese imports of iron in million tons between 1980 and 2010. Source: Raw Materials Group It is unlikely that a major increase like that will pass unnoticed. Therefore, this paper will try to give a picture of the impact that this tremendous increase of Chinese import have had in the international market. We will investigate if, how and where, the production of iron ore has increased over the years and if there have been any major changes in trading patterns and trading partners among primarily the major iron ore-producing countries, Australia and Brazil. Aside from analyzing production and global trade patterns of iron ore in general, the paper will discuss if China's increased imports have had any influence on the price of iron ore, as Sukagawa (2010) puts it: “Needless to say, China is a major factor influencing the current existing situation in the market. We have experienced an unprecedented series of iron ore price increases over the past 2 years.” This paper will cover events and trends up to 2009/2010 and will thus not include the transition of price formation following the increased importance of the spot market. The spot market's evolvement has lead to the abandoning of the annual benchmark system that previously set the important global prices in the end of each year for deliveries the following year (Raw Materials Group 2011).Footnote 1

As the label implies, under the fixed paradigm mineral resources are deemed to be a fixed stock. Adherents start out from the observation that the earth is finite, and there must therefore be a fixed amount of minerals. As these minerals are mined, so what remains diminishes, and one day the stock is used up. Some sense of when this might happen can be obtained by comparing the stock with the yearly draw on the stock (the flow). Although this may appear something of a caricature, one frequently encounters examples of this sort of thinking. It is essentially the thinking behind ‘peak’ minerals, the idea that constraints imposed by the physical availability of minerals will inevitably result in mineral production reaching a peak and then declining. The idea was originally advanced by M. King Hubberd in relation to oil, but it has more recently come to be applied to hard minerals, too. One recent study found that out of 57 mineral commodities tested, 11 showed clear signs of having already experienced production peaks. These included lead, potash, phosphate rock and zirconium (Bardi and Pagani 2007). The analysis was conducted, it should be noted, without any explicit reference to price effects. The same sort of thinking is also implicit in the notion of a ‘static life index’. It is not uncommon in the literature on resources to find tables in which data on reserves or resources have been divided through by annual production to give an indication of remaining life expectancy. In Table 1, which is based on reserves data from the US Geological Survey, it can be seen that such an exercise can result in reserve life expectancies of anything from a couple of decades to several hundred years. This approach has some fundamental, and fairly obvious, shortcomings. For a start, the computation of ‘reserves life’ takes no account of the fact that many mineral commodities can be recycled, or that, in their uses, they can be substituted for, or rendered unnecessary, by technological change. Considering resources data, as opposed to the reserves data shown in Table 1, life expectancies for some commodities can be so long as to be meaningless. There is also the awkward fact that the cost of producing a commodity would naturally rise to ensure rationing and conservation long before it was exhausted physically. Finally, and most fundamentally, reserves and resources are dynamic concepts. The stock of minerals that they represent is a function of advancing knowledge about geology, the technologies that are available for the recovery of useful products from them, and the price people are prepared to pay for them. The evidence of history is that reserves grow apace with production, which is to say mineral reserves are being proven up as fast as they are being used. There is some logic in this. Mining and exploration companies will generally only prove up reserves for which they can foresee a practical use. Accordingly, the life expectancy of most minerals has remained broadly unchanged over the 60 or so years for which we have data (Fig. 1). Metal reserves life, 1940s to present. Values have been taken towards the end of the decade indicated. Data for 1980s and 1990s are ‘reserves base’ data. Source: USGS (various) This same process can, incidentally, be observed at work at an individual mine level, too. Table 2 shows the reserves of the former Rio Tinto mine, Palabora Copper, in the Northern Transvaal, South Africa, when it was started up in 1966. The second column shows the reserves as of 2003, a time when operations were being transferred underground to recover ore from beneath the original open pit. Over the intervening period, the amount of copper expected to be recovered from the mine during its life had grown three and a half times, this as a result of improved knowledge of the geology and improved work practices, which permitted the working of lower ore grades. This is by no means unusual. Another Rio Tinto mine, Bingham Canyon in the state of Utah, the largest copper mine in the USA, has been worked for over 100 years, and the company is still finding new reserves there. The second way of thinking about depletion is termed the opportunity cost paradigm. Under this, the availability of mineral commodities is assessed not in absolute terms but in terms of the sacrifice that society must make for more of a mineral commodity. In a market economy, we measure this with price. What we spend on one product is not available to us to spend on another, and what we spend on our chosen product is not available to be spent on anything else. Under the opportunity cost paradigm, depletion is deemed an economic concept rather than a geological one and minerals’ availability a function of costs and prices. It can be represented schematically as a cumulative availability curve (CAC), a plot of total quantity of mineral available at various prices over time (Fig. 2). Such curves may be used to describe how the exploitation of a mineral typically starts with the lower cost (higher grade) materials, which are relatively limited in nature (point PQ). As demand rises (from D to D
1) and these resources are worked off, so costs and prices increase (to P
1). As it does so, so the amount of material available at these prices also substantially increases (to Q
1). Cumulative availability curve (CAC). Source: Adapted from Tilton (2003, 2006) The problem with this representation is that we do not have the data that would allow us to draw up such a chart on any sort of reliable basis, to convert, in effect, a conceptual CAC into a meaningful quantified long-run supply curve. We only have short run supply curves to work with, and these capture only a small part of the total available resource. Moreover, we cannot be sure that the long-run supply curve does not suffer from significant discontinuities and inconsistencies. Tilton, for example, citing Skinner, points out that the cost of producing copper would rise dramatically were we ever to reach the point where we needed to recover copper from silicates rather than from sulphides or oxides (Tilton 2003, 2006). Nor can it necessarily be presumed that the highest grade and lower cost deposits always get to be worked first. Uranium production in the 1940s and 1950s came from high-cost resources that became uneconomic with subsequent lower cost discoveries. Notwithstanding these limitations, the cumulative supply curve remains a useful way to think about resources longer term. It does, however, need to be recognised that the curve has a tendency to move around; to flex up and down. With the development of new technologies, lower grades of ore and different types of deposits become amenable to exploitation, and the availability of mineral at any particular price point increases. At the same time, there is a raft of factors that can push the curve higher, including increased input costs such as energy, labour or royalties, diminishing the availability of mineral at any given price point. There are also factors that are difficult to incorporate into this model of depletion but which nonetheless may be extremely important to mineral availability in the shorter term. Notable amongst these is the matter of access to resources which are known to exist, which may be governed by political restrictions or environmental regulation, a point discussed later.",25

K. Attuquayefio,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Balancing effective environmental governance with the extraction of mineral resources is a major challenge confronting governments, mining companies and local communities. Mining activities bring variety of actors whose interest may stand opposed. Environmental governance mediates not only between the opposing interests but also between them and nature. Environmental governance brings together a range of state and non-state actors to engage in discourses and interaction through which processes and mechanisms evolve to the interest of individuals and groups as well as determining the nature of environmental outcomes. Map of Obuasi Municipal Assembly Map of Birim North District Assembly Mining is an important social and economic activity in many African countries. About 69 % of African countries rely on the mining industry as the largest export sector (Sinkala 2009). Mineral exports contribute between 25 % and 90 % of the annual export earnings of 13 African countries (Ericsson 1991). In Ghana, the mining sector accounts for an average of 11.88 % of government revenue for the period 1990 to 2008, about 5 % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the period 1993 to 2008 and an average of 39.1 % of total merchandise export for the period 2000 to 2008 (Minerals Commission 2010; Miles 2002). The artisanal small-scale mining (ASM) sub-sector also contributes on the average about 12 % of the total gold produced and 89 % of diamonds production from 2000 to 2008 (Minerals Commission 2004). In the last three decades, the activities of mining have expanded in many mineral-producing and mineral-exporting African countries. The expansion in the activities of mining across the continent of Africa is motivated by neoliberal policies which encourage the movement of transnational private capital into the sector and new technologies such as surface and open-cast mining. At the launch of structural adjustment in the 1980s, African countries with good mineral potential were aided by the World Bank and other bilateral actors to direct their energies at creating favourable conditions for attracting transnational mining companies. A response to this advice resulted in the liberalisation of the sector accompanied with huge incentives such as open-ended offshore retention, tax holidays and exemptions of custom and excise duties on equipment imported for mining.",16

Andrews,Carlos J. Gavilan Moreno,Robert W. Nairn,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Mining has played a vital role in the discovery, settlement, and development of the U.S.A. (Robertson 2006). Due to more than two centuries of mining, the U.S.A. has numerous abandoned mining districts having tens to hundreds of square kilometers of land with extensive degradation in the quality, diversity, health, and productivity of soils, vegetation, wildlife, and water. The Picher mining district, located in northern Ottawa County, Oklahoma (Fig. 1), was part of the Tri-State mining district, a 3,080-km2 area in southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas, and northeast Oklahoma that was the most productive site of mining for sulfide ores of lead and zinc in the U.S.A. from the late 1830s to the 1970s (Gibson 1972; Gibson 1982; Robertson 2006). The Picher mining district, included in the initial National Priority List of Superfund sites as the Tar Creek Superfund site by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1983, is plagued by some of the most severe or widespread environmental degradation of any of the tens of thousands of abandoned mining sites in the U.S.A. (Ferderer 1996; State of Oklahoma 2000; Robertson 2006). The district is on the northwest side of the Ozark Uplift and is underlain by 30 or more meters of shales of Pennsylvanian age and a sequence of more than 300 m of carbonate rocks of Cambrian, Ordovician, and Mississippian age (McKnight and Fischer 1979; Marcher and Bingham, 1971). The area is drained by numerous creeks and the Neosho and Spring Rivers (Gibson 1972). Topographic relief in the district is gently rolling, comprised of small hills and incised stream valleys (Gibson 1972, 1982). Hills in the area are heavily wooded with mixed stands of white oak, blackjack oak, hickory, and sycamore trees, with the mild, temperate continental climate of the district facilitating year-round mining (Gibson 1982). Location of Tri-State mining district and the Picher mining district in Oklahoma Mining of these Mississippi Valley type deposits started in cherty limestones and dolomites in the Missouri portion of the Tri-State mining district, gradually progressing westward in the late 1800s and early 1900s to the Kansas and Oklahoma parts of the district. Initially, mining concentrated on recovery and smelting of the lead–sulfide (PbS) mineral galena due to its ready identification in the field, easy separation from the host rock due to its great density, low temperatures at which it can be smelted, high purity of the ore, and demand for lead for bullets, paints, pipes, and many other uses (Gibson 1982). When zinc smelters opened in 1872 in St. Louis, Missouri and in Illinois, the zinc sulfide mineral sphalerite, which had been discarded as waste rock, became a profitable commodity. As the price of zinc rose from $3 per ton in 1872 to $27 per ton in 1888, zinc mining surpassed lead mining in the district and mines increased in depth from the water table, which occurred about 15 m below land surface, to more than 90 m below land surface, with zinc ore being more abundant below the water table (Gibson 1972). Miners followed veins and cavities of the richest ore, commonly cutting stopes 23 m or more in height (Fig. 2). After the larger mining companies ceased operations in the 1950s, “gougers” (small private miners) continued to mine small ore deposits through the 1960s (Fig. 3), sometimes removing support pillars in the process. Photographs of mining in the Picher mining district (photographs from F.J. Cuddeback) Photographs of tailings and tailings excavations taken by the authors in the Picher mining district When mining stopped ca. 1970, as much as 165–300 million tons of mine tailings, some of which had been reprocessed one or more times to recover metals, remained in the Picher mining district (State of Oklahoma 2000; Netzeband 1936). By 2000, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimated that 60 million cubic yards or 75 million tons of mine tailings remained in the district (State of Oklahoma 2000). By 2008, with continued removal of tailings, estimates of tailings remaining in the district were about 24 million cubic meters or 47 million tons (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2008). Mine tailings in the district have primarily been considered to be a nuisance that potentially exposes humans, wildlife, and the surrounding ecosystem to hazardous metals such as cadmium and lead and to silica dust, a potential cause of the lung disease silicosis. From the time of mining to the present, boulders and finer tailings remaining in the mining district (Fig. 3) have been progressively mined, primarily for use as low-cost ($0.50–1.50 per cubic yard (approximately 1.4 metric tons)) aggregate for use in hundreds of miles of unpaved and asphalt-paved roads, rip-rap to prevent streambank erosion, railroad track ballast, and in concrete (Murdock 1929; Cobban 1934; Fenimore 1934; Langerhans 1934; Smith 1934; Netzeband 1937). Additional uses of smaller size fractions of mine tailings from the district have included sand for coating stucco, blasting sand, rock sawing sand, filler in composition roofing, gravel in tar/gravel flat roofs, and sand spread for traction on icy roadways (Netzeband 1937). Those finer tailing fractions, which were widely used across the region, are more likely to have contained greater concentrations of metals, including relatively toxic metals such as lead and cadmium. By the late 1940s, as mining was becoming economically marginal, estimated reserves of 2.4 million tons of zinc concentrates and more than 300,000 tons of lead concentrates (in the form of galena and sphalerite) were believed to remain underground in the Tri-State mining district (Tri-State Ore Producers’ Association 1946). As noted by Bell and Donnelly (2006), mineral deposits abandoned when they become uneconomic to mine may be reworked in the future when mining technology and demand makes their extraction worthwhile again. This paper was written to investigate that possibility of reprocessing the easily accessible mine tailings remaining on the land surface in this district. In 2004, students and faculty from the School of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science at the University of Oklahoma, in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, conducted field experiments indicating that incorporation of unsorted tailings into asphalt used in road pavement was an effective way to reduce runoff of metals from unconsolidated tailings-covered roads and to encapsulate hazardous metals primarily associated with fine particles in the tailings. A disposal method that has been tested for the metals-rich fine tailing particles is re-injection into mine workings to remove tailings from the land surface (Meyer 2005; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2008). Possible problems with re-injecting tailings into the mine workings include potential influx of large amounts of easily transported metals-rich fine particles in local ground water and connected streams and the preclusion of other potential uses of the tailings. As part of studies to determine potential uses of mine tailings and cycling of metals in the environment in the mining district, analyses were made of concentrations of lead, cadmium, zinc, and other metals in unsieved and sieved tailings and of fine tailings remaining in flotation ponds by students and faculty from the University of Oklahoma (White 2006; LaBar 2007). Analyses of unsieved tailings collected from the Kenoyer North pile (Fig. 4) from 2005 to 2006 indicated that concentrations of lead in those tailings exceeded a 500-mg/kg cleanup standard for residential parts of the mining district specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Metals concentrations have typically been reported to be more concentrated in fine particles (<2-mm diameter) in local mine tailings, with larger particles being dominated by chert and dolomite (Fig. 5). Map of selected collection sites for tailings analyzed by the University of Oklahoma from 2004 to 2007 Concentrations of lead, cadmium, and zinc in a mine tailings sample collected from the Kenoyer North tailings pile in Ottawa County, Oklahoma To determine metals that might be present in mine tailings in the district, one tailings sample from the Kenoyer North pile (sieved to remove particles greater than 2 mm in diameter) and two fine tailings samples from a millpond southwest of Cardin, OK (Fig. 4) were digested with nitric acid, heated by microwave (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1994), and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) at the USGS Mineral Research Laboratory in Lakewood, CO. Metals analyzed by ICP-MS included: silver, aluminum, arsenic, barium, beryllium, bismuth, calcium, cadmium, cerium, cobalt, chromium, cesium, copper, iron, gallium, germanium, potassium, lanthanum, lithium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, sodium, niobium, nickel, phosphorus, lead, rubidium, tin, scandium, thorium, titanium, thallium, uranium, vanadium, yttrium, and zinc. Detection limits for those metals ranged from 0.003 to 100 mg/kg, with most metals having detection limits less than 1 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 6, the three samples analyzed for this paper had similar concentrations of cadmium, lead, and zinc as other tailings samples collected in the mining district by the University of Oklahoma students since 2004. Concentrations of these metals are similar to those described in Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (2003) for unsorted tailings and fine particles sieved from tailings from two other tailings piles in the mining district. Boxplots of concentrations of cadmium, lead, and zinc in tailings samples analyzed by the University of Oklahoma (OU) (LaBar and Nairn 2007), by a U.S. Geological Survey Laboratory in 2005–2006, and in millpond tailings analyzed in White (2006) To evaluate potential economic values of metals in tailings and tailings fines, current or recent metals prices were obtained from Kitco and MetalPrices.com in October 2012 (Kitco 2012a, b, c, d). As shown in Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 7, tailings in the Picher mining district contain values of aluminum, titanium, lead, and zinc substantially exceeding the $1.00–2.00 per metric ton that has been paid for unwashed tailings used in various types of aggregate. Estimated value of lead and zinc per metric ton of mine tailings, sieved tailings fines, and millpond tailings from samples collected near Cardin, OK, in 2005 Concentrations of lead (in the millpond samples) and zinc were notably greater than those reported by Kabata-Pendias and Pendias (1984) for clay and clay loam soils in the United States (Table 3). Aluminum and titanium may be useful by-products of the smelting process for lead and zinc. Values of these four metals ranging from about $12 to more than $117 per metric ton in fine particles from the Kenoyer North tailings pile and the millpond tailing samples (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 7) far exceed the current market value for unwashed tailings of $1.00 to $2.00 per ton. Such value, with potential for increased value with time, indicates that there may be better use for these metals-rich fine particles than disposal in underground mine workings or incorporation into asphalt and other aggregates. Although the majority of lead and zinc consumed in the U.S.A. already comes from the U.S.A., most of titanium and much of the aluminum consumed in the U.S.A. comes from other Nations (Fig. 8). The U.S.A. would benefit from additional supplies of those metals, particularly considering the availability for reprocessing of millions of tons of these metals at the land surface near major transportation routes. Sources of lead and zinc consumed in the U.S.A. in 2006, in thousands of metric tons Gradual recovery of the prices of lead and zinc with economic recovery (Fig. 9), possible future events such for decreased imports due to increasing transportation costs and future conflicts, and continued improvements in ore processing technologies indicate potential for reprocessing tailings in the Picher mining district for remaining lead and zinc contents. Because the metals-rich tailing fines are on the land surface and finely ground, at least some of the costs typically associated with mining of metals ores would not be incurred in reprocessing these materials. The proximity of the mining district to a major interstate highway, rail lines, and the Kerr-McClellan-Arkansas River system connecting to nearby major industrial centers such as St. Louis, Missouri; Kansas City, Kansas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma and more distant points of use can reduce transportation costs of these materials to potential points of reprocessing or end users. Lead and zinc prices from 2002 to 2011, from Kitco (2012a, b, c, d) and MetalPrices.com (2012) Conserving several million tons of metals-rich fine tailings in covered, monitored landfills may be useful as a part of a national strategy to maximize use of readily available base-metal resources in the U.S.A. Obtaining tens of dollars for metals content per ton of tailings, rather than a dollar or less per metric ton also seems likely to benefit the local economy, which is depressed as is typical for abandoned mining districts. Perhaps treating these metals-rich materials as liabilities, rather than as assets of substantial value, has been short-sighted. The economic viability of recovery of metals from tailings in this district is affected by several factors including: plant cost, utilities cost, metals concentrations in tailings, refined metals spot prices, and transportation costs. The cost of a processing plant capable of processing 80,000 tons/year is estimated to range from 16 to 20 million US dollars. Given an approximate remaining amount of 8 million tonnes of tailings with 4.5 % zinc content, the amount of recovered zinc should be 3,600 tonnes per year. Given that a concentrate produced by the Waelz process (Ruetten, 2010) would contain 50 % zinc content, the amount of concentrate produced would be 7,200 tonnes per year, with the produced material being 0.09 tonnes per fine tailing tonne processed. Given those estimates, worst case and best case scenarios of plant receipts can be based on a possible range of tailing concentrated prices. If the cost of concentrate production, in a existing plant, is 165 USD/tonne of fine mine tailings, and the price of Waelz concentrate is about 2,800 USD/tonne, it is estimated that earnings will be about 82 USD/tonne of fine mine tailings. Annually, such a plant is estimated to earn 0.59 MUSD. In a best case scenario, the earnings of such a plant could be as much 2.1 MUSD per year. If a bigger plant is used, the cost will increase less than linearly, and the earnings will be linear with production. That is, if the plant capacity were to be increased to 160,000 tons of fine mine tailings, the earnings would range from more than 1.5 MUSD to more than 5.0 MUSD. Similar computations can be made with having to purchase coarse tailings for 1 USD/tonne. At a processing rate 400,000 tonnes per year, plant earnings would be 0.4 MUSD per year. If the production were doubled, the earnings would be more than 1 MUSD per year. Taken as a whole, potential annual earnings from the process could be between 1.0 and 2.5 MUSD per year and if plant production was again doubled, to between 2.5 and 6.5 MUSD per year. Given these assumptions, a tailings reprocessing plant at the abandoned Picher mining district is likely to produce profits over the range of foreseeable zinc concentrate prices, with the initial investment in plant construction likely to be from 3 to 5 years, which may not be feasible or attractive to potential investors. However, if the value of titanium in the ores is considered, the feasibility or profitability of such a plant is likely to be improved. Titanium in the fine mine tailings comprises about 70 % of the total titanium in the tailings. About 8,176 tonnes of Ti could be recoverable, being concentrated in the Waelz process metallic material as titanium oxide. Another potentially recoverable metal is aluminum, about 165 tonnes of which would be recoverable using the same process. Given the value of these metals, the price of this processed ore would be about 50–100 USD/tonne. The Ti and Al in the tailings, in addition to the well-known Pb and Zn content, substantially improve the economic feasibility of recovery of metals from these tailings. The Ti and Al could be extracted with an electrolytic process. The final decision will depend on a test, because the solubility of the Ti and Al compound will be the key parameters for determining recoverability of those metals. Given these limitations, the only way to recover the Zn, Pb, and Cd economically and to solve the environmental problem is to use an existing Waelz process plant, which will eliminate the need to recover the initial investment in plant construction. Further testing of the metals content and recoverability with separation and smelting tests, however, may indicate higher concentrations of metals that may increase economic feasibility of metals recovery from these tailings. If results of further testing support metals recovery from these tailings, then testing at an existing plant using the Waelz process would be useful. Another strategy, in which the fine tailings containing 4.5 % zinc are sold as ore for 30–50 US dollars per tonne, also may be feasible. In such a scenario, the coarse tailings might be sold for 0.4 million US dollars and the fine tailings might be sold for 2.4–4.0 million US dollars. Constructing a screening plant to process 80,000 tons/year would cost about 5 million US dollars, but there are several such plants already operating in the district, so such additional investment may not be unnecessary. Operating costs for separation would be 30–50 US dollars per tonne or 2.4 to 4.4 million US dollars per year. Selling the fine tailings to an outside processing plant would have the best return period, but that strategy might not be as profitable as operating a Waelz process plant in or near this mining district. The abandoned Picher mining district, a major source of mining for ores of lead and zinc during the first half of the twentieth century, contains tens of millions of metric tons of mine tailings of varying metals content. From the 1920s through the early twenty-first century, tens of millions of tons of those tailings have been removed for relatively low-value uses as aggregates or re-injection into mine workings. Despite being reprocessed one or more times, tailings in the mining district contain substantial amounts of metals, ranging in concentrations up to tens of thousands of milligrams per kilogram (parts per million). The value of lead and zinc in the tailings of this abandoned mining district probably are not sufficient to justify recovery of metals from the tailings at current market prices. However, if recovery of aluminum and titanium are determined to be feasible, then metals may be profitably recovered from these tailings, perhaps producing several million dollars per year. Current metals values and potential future increases in prices support the conclusion that current sales of mine tailings at prices less than a few dollars per ton or disposal of metals-rich fines into underground mine workings are unlikely means of obtaining full value for this resource. Such practices, particularly underground disposal, also may have unanticipated environmental consequences, distributing these potentially toxic metals to the environment in unforeseen ways. Obtaining greater value for the residual metals in the tailings would not only reduce the national trade deficit, but would benefit local communities, which have lost thousands of residents since metals mining ceased, and which remain economically depressed relative to national median income, housing values, and infrastructure (Robertson 2006; Bureau of the Census 2011). Extraction of aluminum, titanium, lead, and zinc in fine tailings particles and mill tailings in the Picher mining district may be feasible at current prices or at increased future prices. Developments in mineral-extraction technologies also may increase the likelihood that substantial further value could be obtained for materials currently considered to be wastes. Reserving some portion of these metals-rich fine tailings in contained landfills may be prudent as part of a National reserve of easily accessible base metals.",16

Tilton,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the past decade, productivity in mining has fallen around the world. Both the size of the decline and the fact that it follows on the heels of some two decades of rising productivity have accentuated the concern over this development. Falling productivity means that more labor, capital, energy, and other inputs are needed to mine and process a ton of copper, aluminum, iron ore, or coal. This in turn pushes production costs up and eventually mineral commodity prices up as well. Many contend that this is the new reality for nonrenewable resources. The benevolent past trends of rising productivity and falling real costs and prices, it is argued, have come to an end, thanks largely to two new developments. The first is the depletion of high-quality mineral resources and our inability to find comparable replacements. As a result, society must now rely on lower grade and more costly deposits. The depletion of our high-quality resources has accelerated over the past decade, thanks largely to China’s rapid economic development and the strain on mineral commodity production that it has fostered. Even if economic growth in China slows, a likely possibility, growth in global mineral production is likely to remain brisk as India, Brazil, and other developing countries take up the slack. The second development adversely affecting productivity, costs, and prices is the decline in the pace at which new, cost-reducing innovations arise and diffuse in mining. In the past, new technology has offset the cost-increasing effects of mineral depletion. In the future, this is not likely to be the case in part because (as just noted) depletion is becoming more severe and in part because the easy technological advances have been made. This school of thought, of course, has not gone unchallenged. Past prophecies regarding declining opportunities to innovate and develop new technologies have failed to materialize. Moreover, some of the recent decline in productivity and rise in costs are clearly cyclical, rather than long-term or secular, in nature. The surge in mineral commodity prices, for example, has allowed high-cost mines with low productivity to enter the mining industry or to remain in operation. Still, high mineral commodity prices over most of the past decade coupled with their quick and dramatic recovery in 2010 following the worse recession in the industrial world since the Great Depression lend support to those who maintain trends in productivity, costs, and prices are now traveling a new course. This study explores this issue and in the process addresses the following questions: What have been the important causes for the recent collapse in mining productivity? Are the causes largely cyclical or secular in nature? Should we expect the historical trends of rising productivity and falling real costs to return when mineral commodity prices decline? What is the nature of cause and effect between mineral commodity prices and productivity? In particular, do changes in mineral commodity prices have an important influence on mining productivity in the short run, while cause and effect runs in the opposite direction in the long run? That is, over the long run, are changes in mining productivity a major determinant of mineral commodity prices? How does the quality of the mineral resources being exploited change over time and why? Does depletion have a cyclical as well as secular influence on mining productivity? Similarly, do innovation and technological change have a cyclical as well as secular influence on mining productivity? These are important questions for firms and countries that produce mineral commodities, for those that consume mineral commodities, and for human society as a whole. As the Nobel laureate Paul Krugman (1994, p. 13) once noted: Productivity isn’t everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country’s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker. We also know that the long-run threat posed by mineral depletion to modern civilization depends largely on a race between the cost-increasing effects of having to rely on poorer grade, more remote, and more-difficult-to-process resources and the cost-reducing effects of new technology. Over the past century or two, despite the dramatic explosion in mineral resource extraction, new technology has successfully kept the cost-increasing effects of depletion at bay. There is, of course, no guarantee that this favorable situation will continue indefinitely into the future. Indeed, if the recent drop in mining productivity reflects a long-run secular trend, this implies that new technology is now struggling to offset the adverse effects of depletion. Mining productivity also has important implications for the terms of trade of mineral-producing countries, such as Australia, Canada, Chile, Peru, Mongolia, Russia, and others. Over half a century ago, Prebisch (1949) and Singer (1950), working independently, published two very influential articles, in which they argued that the terms of trade (the ratio of the prices of a country’s exports to the prices of its imports) of primary product-exporting countries fall over time. Their work provided the intellectual basis for the autarkic economic policies introduced by many developing countries during the 1960s and 1970s; most of which produced disappointing results. It also set off a debate over the terms of trade of primary product-producing countries that continues to this day. If the recent decline in mining productivity is secular rather than cyclical, the favorable shift in the terms of trade toward mineral-exporting countries could persist for some time. Finally, an understanding of the determinants of the recent decline in mining productivity and the extent to which they are secular and cyclical is crucial for both producers and consumers of mineral products. This is because productivity trends (along with factor input prices) determine the costs of producing mineral commodities and their prices. As a result, forecasting future prices in the short run (the next year or two), in the long run (over the next several decades), and in between requires a good understanding of productivity trends.",20

Campbell,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Rare earth metals have moved from obscurity to very public prominence in recent years as the availability and strategic concerns about rare earth metals have grown dramatically. Well into the 1980s, rare earth metals were not considered a major strategic concern for businesses or governments (Maull 1984). Rare earth metals were largely used in low-valued, low-purity mixtures and were readily available from the large Mountain Pass Mine in the USA (bastnäsite ore) and monazite ore sites in locations like Australia and Malaysia. By the early 1990s, production of rare earth metals had become much more concentrated as monazite sources were phased out and replaced by the expansion of bastnäsite ore production in China. Higher purity uses of rare earths metals had become more substantial by this time requiring specialized processing skills that limited the potential suppliers. The role of China in the market was growing rapidly, but rare earth metals were still not considered a major strategic concern (Nappi 1993). By the late 1990s and 2000s, this view had changed radically as rare earth metals became highlighted as a significant strategic concern (National Research Council 2008; U.S. Department of Energy 2010; European Commission Enterprise and Industry 2010). There are several reasons for this change in view. Rare earth metals are proving to be vital inputs for developing green technologies and evolving high-tech uses, including the military, with ever-growing demand. There are limited sites today where rare earth metals are mined commercially. This limit has led to the mining and processing of rare earth metals to be largely a monopoly of China. Rare earth metals are mined together with other metals leading to supply complications that do not respond quickly to price changes. Events during the 2008–2013 time period have intensified the market and strategic concerns about the usage of rare earth metals. China began limiting its production and export quotas of rare earth metals and raising taxes on exports. The reasons given by the Chinese government for these actions were to increase environmental protection and to promote the capture of more of the value-added of rare earth production domestically, specifically in new green technologies where it has a goal to be a world leader (Information Office of the State Council 2012). In addition, the Chinese government has been seen as willing to use rare earth export restrictions for political purposes. China has been accused by Japan of restricting rare earth supplies to Japan during a political confrontation over a disputed territory in September 2010. As a consequence, the demand for specific rare earth metals has surged at times because of the additional demands created by stockpiling and speculation in response to uncertainty of supplies in the future. Accordingly, the Chinese domestic price and international market price of rare earth products have seen rapid and dramatic increases over short periods of time. The market situation and prices of rare earths are complicated further by the mixing of the individual metals in varying proportions in the source minerals and by the need often to mine rare earths with other mineral products as a by-product because of the limited options in commercial deposits. These events have led to a number of actions: investment speculation in rare earth metals, the seeking and opening of alternative rare earth metal sources, and calls by governments around the world to intervene into the market of rare earths to protect perceived strategic and industrial interests. This new strategic concern about rare earth metals is clearly illustrated by the number of papers and studies written about rare earth use and supplies (examples include Hurst 2010; Parthemore 2011; Massari and Ruberti 2012). The aims of this paper are to evaluate the evolving market of rare earths and its behavior and to examine the likely trends of the market as it moves forward. In particular, why has China emerged as the dominant force in the rare earth supply chain and is it likely to continue in the future? Is there a need for other governments to intervene and implement policies to address the situation or will the market handle it adequately? In other words, are rare earth metals really the strategic problem they have been made out to be or has the case been overstated? The paper has five sections. The first section explains the sources of rare earth metals. The second section provides a brief overview of the evolving use of rare earth metals. The third section examines the role of China in the market for rare earth metals. The fourth section provides an analysis of the pricing of rare earth metals and its behavior. The fifth section puts all the parts together to provide insights into the behavior of the rare earth metal market and what it means for those producing and using rare earth metals. The paper ends with its conclusions and recommendations.",47

The focus here is on perhaps the most vulnerable class of resources in this belief system: non-renewable resources and, more specifically, metals. The “Non-renewable mineral availability” section reviews some of the basic literature on mineral availability and the peak resources hypothesis applied by those concerned about resource sustainability to non-renewable resources. The “Copper as an example” section looks at the peak resources hypothesis applied to copper. We find no evidence of “peak” copper in spite of claims to the contrary. Copper reserve life, i.e., how long society can continue consuming copper from known reserves, is basically unchanged over 80 years that we are able to estimate them in spite of enormous increases in consumption. The fourth section examines this apparent contradiction by examining the microeconomics of mining companies’ decisions to explore for new reserves on which macro reserve data are based. The concluding section argues that these data are generally misconstrued by advocates of the “peak” hypothesis.",4

Can mining be a catalyst for diversifying economies? Emerging experiences and lessons. This was the working question guiding the debate at the seminar that brought the authors of the papers and commentaries of this Special Issue and other colleagues together. The starting point of the seminar was the emerging debates and policy instruments pointing at a role for mining as a catalyst for potential economic diversification. The objective was to gain knowledge and a perspective on the fragmented understanding both in terms of conceptualisation and of experiences in the sector on the question of how cross-sector linkages supporting economic diversification have been and could be built. The question has gained momentum in the light of the increasing number of countries in which the resources sector represents a major share of their economies, driven by the high prices of the last decade and the expansion of production into new geographies. In spite of the recent slowdown of prices and demand, it is estimated that over the long term, the prospects of demand driven by new industrialising countries with growing consuming societies is unprecedented (McKinsey 2013; see though current challenges to iron ore prices in Financial Times 2014). The major challenge for resource-driven economies looking at options for diversification is not the rate of growth, but the quality of growth, and the urgent need to promote inclusive growth, particularly for young people, in ways that integrate environmental concerns (Kaplinsky 2013). Resources are initial non-renewable natural assets that can be transformed into other forms of sustainable capital and can play a vital role in catalysing development. 
Inclusive growth that places priority in eradicating poverty, fully mainstreaming all the dimensions of sustainable development and changing patterns of production and consumption is at the heart of the Rio +20 Outcome Document, The Future We Want, and guides the process for the formulation of Sustainable Development Goals (which merge the Millennium Development Goals due to expire in 2015) that inform the next Post-2015 Development Agenda. Mining is set to have a crucial role in mobilising resources for such agenda at country levels (UNCTAD 2014; UNDP 2012). This Special Issue of Mineral Economics brings together some of the materials and discussions of the referred seminar. It includes different types of contributions: review papers, research papers and comments. While the first ones have gone through the peer-review process typical of academic conventions, the commentaries provide views from practice. This Editorial Paper provides a review of the findings of the papers and commentaries of this Issue as well as of presentations at the seminar, explores a few emerging trends and reflects on some of the implications and challenges in unleashing a transformational role for the resource sector. The seminar was organised jointly by the Centre for Energy, Petroleum and Mineral Law & Policy, University of Dundee (CEPMLP) and the Raw Materials Group and took place at the Natural History Museum in London on 24 and 25 June 2013.Footnote 1

It argues that this is the most recent of the three key questions that have guided the policy debate on minerals and development since the 1980s. Figure 1 shows the three questions. The three key policy questions on minerals and development since the 1980s The first question was ‘how to attract foreign investment’. This question emerged when many low- and middle-income countries experienced severe economic crises in the aftermaths of the economic shocks that they had suffered from around the early 1970s. The second question was ‘how to avoid “resource curse”’. This question was prompted by the studies published from around the mid-1990s putting forth the proposition that countries producing mineral resources were more likely to experience negative economic, political and social outcomes. This proposition triggered a search for answers on how such negative outcomes could be avoided. The third question, ‘how to build linkages’, has received attention more recently and seeks further industrialisation and economic diversification on the back of the exploitation of natural resources. 
Attracting foreign investment, Avoiding ‘resource curse’ and Building linkages sections review each of these three questions. Industry responses section discusses the industry responses that each question has prompted. Discussion section discusses the findings.",15

Traditionally, in the era of the seven sisters,Footnote 1 such goods and services would be purchased from the company’s home country. However, the development of North Sea petroleum resources, particularly in the Norwegian sector, saw a change in this pattern of purchasing good and services. From the early 1970s, instead of the required goods and services being procured from the oil company’s home countries, the Norwegian government sought to capture the monies spent through the establishment of cross-sectoral linkages. Rather than the costs associated with the exploration of petroleum exploration and production (known as production cost spending)Footnote 2 being spent in Norway, the Norwegian government required the companies to spend such costs in Norway wherever possible. This concept of developing industrial and technical goods and services required for the production of petroleum is also known as ‘local content’ provisions and is considered to promote cross-sectoral linkages and economic diversification. The Norwegian government, through the use of both economic and legal tools, required the purchase of local goods and services. The economic aspects required to implement Norwegian local content strategy has been analysed by many economists.Footnote 3 This paper instead focuses on the legal tools that were utilized by the Norwegian government to capture such production cost spending. In particular, it examines how the development of a cohesive, consistent and comprehensive policy can assist in developing such local content provisions. It then identifies and analyses the key legal provisions that the Norwegian government utilized in order to secure linkages and economic diversification in Norway during the 1970s and 1980s. Part of this analysis includes how the Norwegian government utilized the grant of access to petroleum through the petroleum license as a method of ensuring local content. Finally, this paper examines how the ascension of Norway to the EEA altered the capacity to utilize legal instruments to implement local content and promote economic diversification. In examining the success of Norway’s economic diversification, this paper also focuses on Australia’s failure to follow the same pathway, even though advantages of such were identified over twenty-five years ago.",11

The basis for this belief is that mining in itself, except for artisanal small-scale mining, is capital intensive and needs few employees in relation to the capital invested. Moreover, mining is considered to have few linkages to the rest of the economy and is often thought of as an “enclave”. In recent years, the validity of the enclave characterization has been increasingly questioned, as the linkages between mining and other economic activities have become better understood and as it has been increasingly realized that the employment effects can be influenced by company actions and government policy. One of the first attempts to document the broader employment effects across a wider geographical range was the Resource Endowment Initiative of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), which studied such effects in four case study countries (Chile, Ghana, Peru and Tanzania), including the effects of one large mine in each country. The report synthesizing results of the case studies notes “One common characteristic of all four mines is that they employ large numbers of people. Despite the highly mechanized nature of modern industrial mining, the absolute number of people employed (either directly or indirectly) is substantial.” (ICMM 2006, p. 34). The importance of local linkages is also evident from a study on the Yanacocha mining project in Peru (Aragón and Rud 2011). The increased attention has influenced policy prescriptions. One of the more prominent examples of the growing interest in linkages is the African Mining Vision, which aspires to provide a framework for continent wide policy making with respect to the mining industry. The analytical report underlying the African Mining Vision devotes a whole chapter to linkages and contains several ideas on how to use linkages to support economic diversification and industrialization (United Nations Economic Commission for Africa 2011, p. 101–114). It is worthy of notice that the report focuses almost entirely on what one could somewhat loosely classify as linkages that are believed to be amenable to industrial policy, that is, direct production linkages between sectors or “sidestream linkages” that try to capture other types of interaction between companies. It is almost completely silent on an issue that is the subject of the present paper, namely the employment effect and potential development opportunities resulting from the economic stimulus provided by mine employees’ expenditures. In this, the report is not alone. Little political attention has been given to this aspect, and in terms of research, it very much remains a poor cousin to linkages between corporations, whether based on input–output analysis or clusters/supply chain analysis. The article will argue that the effect of employees’ expenditure is at least as important to employment as the industrial linkages and at least potentially as important to diversification and economic development. Consequently, more research and policy development efforts could yield a rich harvest in terms of constructive and feasible policy prescriptions. Initially, some of the terms and concepts used will be defined. Following that, some of the practical difficulties in estimating employment effects of the kind discussed will be reviewed. Three practical examples will be presented, all of them illustrating both the challenge of estimating employment effects and the magnitude of the effects themselves. Finally, the implications for policy formulation will be discussed, including the reasons for the relative neglect of the issue. The focus throughout is on large-scale mining and on sub-national effects. Although it is recognized that small-scale mining might offer good—indeed, sometimes better—illustrations of the non-corporate income and development effects of mining, this is very much a neglected field of research and there are very little data available. Regrettably, it is therefore left aside. It is also recognized that mining employee expenditure is important at the national level, for instance, in the form of payroll or personal income tax payments that finance development efforts. However, analysing these impacts raises issues of an altogether different nature and they are therefore not included in the present analysis. Finally, although the analysis uses mining projects as examples and although the discussion will refer exclusively to mining, the arguments presented are just as relevant to any other large-scale, capital-intensive undertaking.",3

Although some mining companies are trying to stick to an annual fixed price FOB, this system is disappearing. It seems to be replaced by a negotiation of prices based on various, more or less established indexes based on spot prices. It is hence important to remember that part of the iron ore trade is made based on spot prices. The evolution of iron ore prices between 2005 and 2011 is shown in principle in Fig. 1. This figure has been constructed by using the prices during the last years of the benchmark system (i.e. FOB) and adding an estimate of the average freight cost for fines at about 65 % Fe from Brazil to the Far East. After the discontinuation of the benchmark system, estimates of spot prices for Indian 62 % Fe delivered to China have been used. The benchmark price is also indicated in Fig. 1.

Source: World Steel Dynamics (2011) This estimate can be compared to studies by World Steel Dynamics (World Steel Dynamics 2011) and reproduced in Figs. 2 and 3. Figure 2 confirms our estimates in Fig. 1. Figure 3 is more interesting in that it explains how iron ore prices are moving. There are two major facts to keep in mind when studying this figure. Firstly, China is by far the largest iron ore importer. In 2009, according to UNCTAD (UNCTAD 2010 iron ore statistics), it imported 628 Mt out of a world total of 937 Mt. Secondly, China is also relying on domestic production. It is, as we know from our visits and meetings in China,Footnote 1 costly because it is based on many relatively small and, often, difficult deposits of low-grade ores which necessitates costly preparation and beneficiation, depending on the nature of the deposits and the structure of the crude ores. As a consequence, iron ore export prices to China varied between 150 and 200 USD/t of fines with a grade between 62 and 65 % Fe in the beginning of 2011. In this region, the market seemed to be in a kind of equilibrium between the imported ores and the ores from domestic producers. Iron ore prices in China, domestic and imported ores.

28,1,Mineral Economics,25 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-014-0048-6,The real option value of mining operations using mean-reverting commodity prices,June 2015,Kuangyuan Zhang,Antonio Nieto,Andrew N. Kleit,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Traditional valuation of mining projects relies on the discounted cash flows (DCF), or the net present value (NPV) method. These methods are taken as standard tools and used broadly in mining feasibility studies. Nevertheless, these valuation methods fail to cover the uncertainties embedded in commodity prices and operational costs, and often result in an under-evaluation of mine value. The other problem with DCF or NPV is that operational flexibilities are not considered such as delaying the investment or expanding production rate under certain market conditions. In addition, DCF or NPV may not be relevant for valuation of a mining reserve that has not started to produce and is not generating any revenues (Botin and Castillo 2013). Mining operations’ uncertainties rises from specific parameters such as commodities price, fluctuations in operating and capital cost, geological properties, production recovery rate, mining technology progress, etc. The investment decision of mining activities also involves the feature of irreversibility as (1) there is considerable amount of sunk cost involved in the mining processes, rendering it fairly costly to withdraw the investment; and (2) once processed, the materials are gone; (3) the irreversibility that can also arise from government regulation such as expiry of mining lease or permit, institutional arrangements such as investment in labor because of high costs of hiring, training, and firing employees. Dixit and Pindyck (1994) suggest that an irreversible investment opportunity is much like a financial call option, which offers the holder the right but not obligation, during a specified amount of time, to pay a strike price and in return, receive a financial asset. A mining company with an investment opportunity has a similar option to invest right now or in a future time, in return for the commodity products. Evaluation methods covering timing flexibility or ROV method are generally believed to be more accurate and realistic than nonflexible evaluation techniques, i.e., DCF or NPV (Brennan and Schwartz 1985; Cortazar and Casassus 1998; Bengtsson 2001; Samis et al. 2006; Dimitrakopoulos and Sabour 2007). By taking advantage of understanding the likely trends in commodity market, the owner of a mining operation can achieve additional expected profit by choosing an optimal price threshold. The real option method can assist the owner of the mine to (1) assess the value of a mine by considering the uncertainties and operational flexibility embedded in the project and (2) making managerial decisions such as starting mining, abandonment, expansion, and contraction of production rates accordingly to changes in market condition. This research addresses the case of starting mining. A substantial portion of mining project uncertainty comes from the volatility of the commodity price (Hall and Nicholls 2007). In this paper, a mean-reverting (MR) process is used to model gold price. The MR process is based on microeconomic theory and argues that commodity prices are constrained by the average mining cost. Thus, the ups and downs of a commodity price are not permanent, as the price tends to revert toward a long-term equilibrium. By addressing the long-term equilibrium, MR model is considered to be more appropriate than the widely used Geometric Brownian motion process for commodity prices (Pindyck and Rubinfeld 1991). Figure 1 presents the real price of gold from 1968 to 2012 (with the price in December 2012 set at 1). In Fig. 1, the nominal gold price is from London Bullion Market, and adjusted by US Consumer Price Index to obtain the real gold price. It can be observed that there has been considerable value associated with delaying investment for a gold mine during the time span from 2000 to 2012 as the price skyrocketed during the period. Moderate volatility of gold price also implies an incentive for delaying the investment and waiting for future price information to arrive. Thus, potential value can be achieved by waiting because of the possible increase of commodity price. In contrast, waiting too long to start mining may result in a lower profit—even when the price rises—because of the discounting of future cash flows. Thus, there is an optimal threshold for the commodity price beyond which it is optimal to exercise the option to start mining. Consequently, the relevant question to be asked is how to determine this price threshold. Real gold price from 1968 to 2012 (gold price data from London Bullion Market and CPI data from US Bureau of Labor Statistics) This manuscript is organized as follows: “Review of the literature” section contains a review of the relevant literature. In “Mean-reverting process for commodity price” section, the mean-reverting process is adopted to model the price of gold. The coefficients of the process are used to generate 10,000 simulated paths of gold prices for future 35 years. “Real option method and optimal timing” section proposes the option-exercising model and four illustrative paths are selected to explicate the option-exercising mechanism. “Extensions of the model” section is composed of two extensions of the real option method: comparing the ROV and NPV by (1) differentiated mining cost and (2) differentiated starting price used in the simulation. “Conclusion” section concludes by discussing the implications of the results.",44

28,1,Mineral Economics,30 April 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-015-0064-1,What drives resource prices? A qualitative review with recommendations for further development of the Hotelling model,June 2015,Tobias Gaugler,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Finite resources (e.g., oil, coal, metals, and minerals) were formed over millions of years and do not renew themselves with sufficient speed for modern consumption. An adequate supply of finite (energy and non-energy) raw materials is important for developed industrial regions. In this context, the price of raw materials and its future development are of great social and economic interest. To this end, a large number of studies has been conducted on this topic. A basic distinction can be made between the two most common research methods: The first approach tries to explain the development of commodity prices based on a theoretical model. On the other hand, there is a broad line of research using empirical studies to examine price changes of raw materials. Recently, new trends affecting raw materials prices can be observed. As new additional (mainly empirical) studies are available, an up-to-date qualitative review is required. Our paper tries to bridge this current research gap and also attempts to integrate both theoretical models and empirical research. In order to draw conclusions about an adequate supply of finite resources, it seems reasonable to focus primarily on raw material prices. Price, and especially its changes over time, can be seen as an aggregated indicator for a raw materials availability. However, it must be pointed out that some factors are not considered in the pricing of a commodity. For example, negative environmental impacts related to the degradation of raw materials – as well as other external effects – are not taken into account in the price of commodities. Furthermore, market imperfections due to government influence (taxes, subsidies, trade restrictions) might exist for specific raw materials. Nor can it be assumed that an efficient market exists solely for raw materials with low trading volumes. Thus, different distortions might exist, which would affect the “true” price of a raw material. However, since the price of a good is the only objective criterion in economics, it should play a center role. Using various practical and scientific methods, an attempt is made in this paper to better understand the influences and issues which impact raw material pricing. To provide an overview of relevant literature, we first examine the development of theoretical model approaches, followed by a discussion of fundamental empirical studies, and ending with the literature review, where existing meta-analyzes are introduced. Classic economic theory has always included studies on the scarcity and effect of resources on general production factors. As long ago as 1798, Malthus demonstrates in a qualitative study that an exponential growth in population, accompanied by limited availability of the production factor, would lead to a shortage of nutrients in the soil in the long term. Ricardo, on the other hand, (1817, section 5.21) relaxes the assumption of absolute scarcity, assuming there would be a “decreased rate of production” from land available for food production, but still comes to the conclusion that the growth of a society would come to a standstill in the absence of resources. Presenting a neo-classical perspective, Gray (1914) refers to Ricardo several times in his article “Rent Under the Assumption of Exhaustibility”, including his views on the extraction of finite resources. By looking at a single individual mine, Gray arrives to the same general conclusion as Hotelling (1931) in his basic model of raw material supply: in the case of no extraction costs, the price of a finite resource grows in line with the rate of interest (Krautkraemer 1998, p. 2066). In contrast, Pindyck (1978) concludes from his theoretical analysis that raw materials prices follow a U-shaped curve. He surmises that an initial price drop is the result of initial discovery of large quantity of raw materials, but that later price trends change direction as these materials are extracted and exploration efforts are both undertaken and successful. In summary, it is clear on the basis of theoretical research alone, that only partial assumptions can be made. Furthermore, at first glance it does not appear possible to draw firm conclusions about actual price movements for finite resources. Published empirical studies examining resource price movements are often fundamentally contradictory in their conclusions. For example, an examination of the prices for finite resources during the period of 1940 to 1976 suggests that raw material prices do increase, but that the amount by which they should increase differs greatly, depending upon which modeling approach is taken (Berck and Roberts 1996). However, raw materials prices can also change on a largely random basis (from 1922 to 1974) and are described by McRae (1978) as a “random walk”. In contrast, Smith (1979) suggests that, in the period examined from 1900 to 1973, price trends for natural resources were predominantly negative, while Slade (1982) in her much-referenced study concludes that the price of many raw materials during the period 1870 to 1978 initially went down only to go up again, and that overall prices follow a U-shaped curve. Lee et al. (2006) determine from a study of finite resource prices from 1870 to 1990 that prices for finite resources are “stationary around deterministic trends with structural breaks”. Moreover, a number of meta-analyses examining the development of commodity prices and their drivers are based on individual studies of the Hotelling model. By comparing four different tests, Chermak and Patrick (2002) determine that two of these tests confirm the validity of Hotelling’s theory, while the other two come to the opposite conclusion. In an extensive meta-analysis of empirical studies based on Hotelling, Slade and Thille (2009) conclude that it is not possible to confirm the general validity of the basic Hotelling model. Krautkraemer (1998) starts his qualitative review article with an overview of the basic model of Hotelling and gradually expands on the concept by introducing the drivers ‘exploration’, ‘capital investment and capacity constraints’, ‘ore quality’ and ‘market imperfections’. He goes on to explain – largely non-formally – the effects of these drivers on price development of a finite resource; however, clear statements about the effects of the individual drivers are not made. Such qualitative reviews serve as a basis for further investigation of commodity price developments. Nevertheless, existing qualitative reviews mostly stem from studies testing the basic Hotelling model, or extend them only in terms of single drivers (Chermak and Patrick 2002; Slade and Thille 2009). Probably due to this limitation, these studies usually come to the conclusion that the validity of the (basic) model cannot be confirmed. Although Krautkraemer (1998) presents well derived starting points for an extension of the basic Hotelling model, his proposals are of limited use, since their implications are derived in mainly qualitative manner — despite the fact that the article was published quite some time ago. Overall, it can be seen from this short overview of relevant literature that it is not possible to draw a generally valid conclusion on price trends for finite resources from existing literature alone. In order to find a more valid and reliable answer to the question “What drives resource prices?” we therefore need to take a more comprehensive, theoretical approach. Therefore as part of this study we will analyze results of established and current studies, while taking into consideration current developments in the raw materials markets, in order to identify points for which it is possible to find valid answers and those points for which answers cannot be found, or only to a limited extent. Motivated by weak results provided by existing qualitative reviews of Hotelling’s basic model and its already existing extensions, we expand Hotelling’s model with a simultaneous approach, including additional drivers such as backstop technology and recycling. In addition, drivers integrating changes to the demand side are incorporated into the model. Last but not least, we introduce an approach to distinguish between short- and the long-term effects of different drivers on the evolution of commodity prices. To identify relevant literature, the following databases were used: “ABI/Inform Complete” (ProQuest), “Business Source Premier” (EBSCO), “Econlit (EBSCO)” and “Google Scholar”. On one hand, we used the keywords (determinants of) resource prices, resource price development, commodity/resource price drivers, finite resources, and Hotelling’s model/rule, both individually and in combination. On the other hand, we also used other articles which were automatically suggested by the databases after an appropriate article had been identified (“recommended articles”). Based on the references of these articles, we could manually identify other papers related to our research. Depending on specific content, articles were either used in the introduction where the scientific state of the art is compiled, or were added to the middle part of the paper, where the theory-based hypotheses are tested. As far as possible, we used articles which directly refer to Hotelling’s model, in order to test the theory-based hypotheses. Due to the variety of articles directly or indirectly relating to raw material price drivers and the development of commodity prices, it was necessary to perform a reasonable selection to obtain an appropriate number of relevant articles. The structure of this paper is as follows: Firstly, the principles of the Hotelling model are presented, followed by approaches designed to expand the model into a more comprehensive overall model. Deductions are made from the Hotelling model, which are then further expanded by cet. par. consideration of the determinants extraction costs, technical progress, degradation, market power and risk. How these drivers can be simultaneously incorporated into the model is demonstrated, and the necessity of incorporating growing demand into the Hotelling model is discussed, along with the attendant difficulties and the need for additional research.",4

In the period of 1950–1973, steel served as a fundamental element of postwar reconstruction. Civil and industrial infrastructure development and industrial production growth in Europe, the USA, and Japan resulted in 6 % annual steel production climb (Basson 2013). World crude steel production (Basson 2013) The second growth phase took place in 2002–2008, when steel production surged 7 % annually driven by intensive urbanization, industrialization, and construction boom in China. Global steel industry faced temporary shortage of steel production capacities and raw material supply. Steel capacity utilization level hovered far above 80 %. Iron ore imports from Australia and Brazil to China surged manifold and finally constituted more than 70 % of the country’s iron ore consumption. Iron ore trade increased by 112 %, coking coal by 57 %, and ferrous scrap by 75 % (Deforche et al. 2007). This huge rise of demand caused a commensurate leap in steel and raw material prices ranging from five to nine times. The global financial crisis hit the steel industry dramatically in 2009, when steel consumption was down 7 % year-over-year. Despite a vivid recovery in volumes, the steel industry economic performance had declined significantly since “The Great Recession,” with the steel industry ranked among the least profitable industries in most economies. Roughly 65 % of large steel players were operating with negative cash flows versus 30–40 % before the crisis (Mareels 2013). Apart from the demand volatility, one can point out a few basic intrinsic forces periodically taking the steel industry in distressed situation: chronic overcapacity, growing pressure from the substitutes, increased volatility in raw material prices, and high fragmentation of the industry. The high level of excess capacity is considered to be the major cause of the steel industry’s weak financial performance (Wörtler et al. 2010). Since the recent “Great Recession,” overcapacity has grown up to 25 %, as a consequence of slowing demand and high investment in new capacities. Actually, overcapacity is a rather stable phenomenon. It is very difficult to reduce installed capacities because of high exit costs, inflexible nature of the production process at the integrated steel plants, and political and social sensitivity (Woertler et al. 2002). The problem is exacerbated by permanent productivity improvements at installed capacities via debottlenecking, product mix optimization, and new plans of capacity expansion. Demand growth lags behind the ramp up of capacities not only because of sluggish GDP development in the mature markets and China’s deceleration. Other reasons are a structural change of GDP growth in favor of less steel-intensive sectors and growing pressure from the steel substitutes. The effect of the latter is especially obvious in the car industry. According to the current trend, the introduction of high strength steel, aluminum, and composite materials is likely to reduce steel consumption from current 1000 to 830 kg/car in the next 10 years (Zeumer 2013). The next factor, explaining the poor performance of the steel industry, is the high level of raw material prices (Author and Vorobyev 2011). As it was mentioned before, driven by China’s demand surge, prices on iron ore, coking coal, ferrous scrap, and other commodities in the global marketplace jumped up five- to ninefolds over the last decade. As a consequence, steel companies managed to lift steel prices. However, a good chunk of the earned margin moved to producers of raw materials, resulting in stable or even shrunk earnings of steel producers. The margin transition to mining companies could be explained by the barging power of raw material producers that are rather more consolidated than their steel counterparts. The top five steel companies produce less than 20 % of the global market volume. In contrast, the top three iron ore producers account for more than 60 % of the global seaborne market (Basson 2013). To withstand these hostile factors, the steel industry traditionally resorts to a few strategic options like “upstream integration”, “consolidation”, “added value products,” and some others. Their viability is proved using the analysis of actual data (De Carvalho 2013). However, this rear-view approach could hardly help in the comprehensive strategy formulation process, because this process should be based on the long-run understanding of the future. Widely used approaches such as extrapolation, consensus, or more sophisticated forecasting techniques are not appropriate to the strategic tasks as steel and mining industries are extremely unpredictable. Software is the only industry with a higher rate of earning forecast errors. At the same time, the high capital intensity, multi-billion capital expenditures (CAPEXes), and long lead time for construction of new steel projects make the cost of strategic decision failure extremely high (Wörtler et al. 2010). Poor predictability does not mean that people should not get prepared for the future. One of the useful instruments of the future contemplation is scenario planning which is widely used for future thinking area in oil and gas (Sircar et al. 2013; Leis and Gottfredson 2013), banks (Dietz et al. 2012; Sadorsky 2011), transportation (De Brabandere and Iny 2010), and many other industries. The aim of the scenarios is to change the mental models of decision-makers, to consider new possibilities, and to create a common language and mental models (Van der Heijden 2004; Fahey and Randall 1997). Scenarios allow mental experimentation with multiple futures that are inherently complex and uncertain and do not force decision-makers in organizations to select a preferred future such as in the case with other strategic approaches. Thus, scenarios help to develop purpose-seeking systems by providing and constructing multiple plausible visions for the future. These visions are used to challenge the status quo and current thinking about the strategic agenda of the organization and other potential options. In that way, scenarios enable managers to make better informed decisions as a result of developing a better understanding of the choices they may face and the potential consequences of those choices. So, one of the practical application cases of scenarios for a company consists of “wind tunneling” of strategic options and key decisions (Chermack 2011). Scenarios were also developed for mining and metal industry in the framework of the World Economic Forum (Van der Elst et al. 2010). A year-long research brought together over 200 leaders from the private sector, government, academia, and international and non-governmental organizations in a strategic dialogue structured by scenario-planning methodology to consider the following central question: “How will the environment for the global mining and metals sector look in 2030?” Unfortunately, these scenarios are too general to help in the analysis of the future sustainable strategies for the steel industry. That is why the main objective of this paper is to introduce four original scenarios for the global steel industry performance over the next decade and check the robustness of the traditional strategic options in each scenario.",
28,1,Mineral Economics,05 May 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-015-0067-y,Relationship between the gold price and the Australian dollar - US dollar exchange rate,June 2015,Md. Aminul Haque,Erkan Topal,Eric Lilford,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The breakdown of the Bretton Woods system on 15 August, 1971, and the commensurate adoption of freely floating exchange rates, has motivated the growing curiosity to examine the relationship between exchange rate movements and economic parameters. Commodity price is one of the vital economic parameters that directly impacts on currency exchange rate movements in addition to a country’s overall economy. Most notably, countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Chile and South Africa are dependent on commodity exports for significant levels of foreign income. The world prices of commodities appear to have a robust and systematic relationship with a number of currencies (Chen and Rogoff 2003). The substantial long - run relationship between commodity prices and the relevant real exchange rate was investigated by Apergis and Papoulakos 2013; Cashin et al. 2004; as well as Chen and Rogoff 2003. Chen and Rogoff (2003) studied these commodity currencies through Newey-west heteroscedasticity, linear regression, and Chow and Hansen tests, and perceived that there is a close association between the price of specific primary commodities such as gold, oil and agricultural products and specific currencies which are known as commodity currencies. The Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar are the most frequently traded commodity currencies, and these countries are inextricably linked to global capital markets and to active participants in international trade. Zhou (1995) studied the response of real exchange rates due to different economic shocks and found that the variation of oil prices plays a key role in real exchange rate movements. His study focused on the stochastic trend movements of the real exchange rates, particularly the yen-dollar rate and the markka-dollar rate. In the study, the variance decompositions showed that changes in the trend of the global real oil price has the most crucial and robust effect on the trend movements of the two real exchange rates. Chen and Chen (2007) studied oil prices and real exchange rates. They found that real oil prices may have been the dominant source for the movement of real exchange rates, and there exists a cointegrating relationship between real oil prices and real exchange rates. Sari et al (2010) studied the dynamics of oil and precious metals prices, and the US dollar/euro exchange rate. They did not apparently find long - run equilibrium relationships between those spot price returns and changes in the exchange rate. In the short - run, however, there is evidence that spot precious metals prices and the exchange rate may be closely linked when shocks occur. Lizardo and Mollick (2010) studied the oil price fluctuations and the US dollar exchange rates by adding oil prices to the monetary model of exchange rates. They found that an increase in real oil prices lead to a remarkable depreciation of the US dollar against the net oil exporter currencies such as Canada, Mexico and Russia. Czudaj and Beckman (2013) investigated the relationship between oil prices and effective dollar exchange rates through a multivariate Markov-switching vector error correction model. The findings show that causality runs from nominal exchange rates to nominal oil prices and not vice versa. Haque et al. (2014) studied a numerical value for a mining project through real option valuation (ROV) methods under commodity price instability, considering a hypothetical gold mine as a case study. In this study, the authors also estimated gold price volatility from the historical data, and revealed that price volatility has a significant impact on mining project values. The combined impact of large volume and high value exports, notably coal, gold and iron ore, strengthened the Australian dollar against a basket of important global currencies, including the US dollar. Specifically, the Australian dollar recorded its strongest level, being its highest value (highest exchange rate), against the US dollar of 110.56 cents on July 28, 2011 (Ali and Rahman 2012), attaining this level due mainly to the export volumes of Australian minerals supported by the deemed insatiable demand of its largest commodities’ trading partner, China. The value of a commodity currency typically increases or decreases depending on the value of the country’s primary commodity exports. According to the Australian Government’s department of foreign affairs and trade in 2013-2014 (AGDFAT 2014), Australia earned approximately AU$151.18 billion through exporting minerals, and the main contributors were iron ore, gold and coal. Commodity prices affect the strength and weakness of the AUD including the AUD/USD exchange rate as a direct consequence of Australia’s dependency on mining and, to a lesser extent, farming exports. As a consequence, when there is a mining boom, Australia’s economy improves and, conversely, when a downturn in the resources sector occurs, Australia’s economy is negatively impacted. Therefore, the typical return on investment (ROI) in the mining and minerals industry is heavily biased towards commodity prices and commensurate exchange rate volatilities. Hence, it is imperative to analyse whether evidence exists to prove that an empirical relationship between commodity prices and exchange rate movements holds and, if so, to find the strength of their association i.e. the coefficient of correlation. The rapid depreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar has also provided some relief to miners that have experienced high operating costs and low international commodity prices. During 1996-2014, the lowest or weakest AUD/USD exchange rate was 0.4857, recorded on April 2, 2001, and the highest or strongest exchange rate was 1.0939, recorded on May 2, 2011. On December 24, 2014, the Australian dollar depreciated to a low of 81.12 US cents, and it has fallen almost 14.23 per cent from its July 02, 2014 peak of 94.58 US cents. However, the head of research at Patersons Securities, Rob Brierley, stated as commodities are sold in US dollar prices, the weak Australian dollar sometimes is a boon and gives relief to miners (Babs 2013). This is because, the Australian mining industry relies on its Australian labour force and commensurately an Australian cost base. Commodities are priced in US dollars and incomes from sales are converted to Australian dollars at the weaker exchange rate, therefore, effectively receiving a higher income in Australian dollars when converting to the local currency. This may be good for exporters, but it may not be so good for Australia’s overall economy and the importers of mining equipment, as equipment prices are often paid in US dollars. Reciprocally, as costs approach levels closer to revenue levels due to real domestic cost increases, an exchange rate appreciation may place the miner into a loss-making position. Over the last few years, all commodity prices have declined - coal, iron ore, copper, lead, silver, phosphate, zinc - but none of them more dramatically than gold, which lost US$200/oz in April 2013 alone (Babs 2013). At that time gold traded at around US$1,300/oz, down from US$1,700/oz three months ago. In Australian dollar terms, this translates to around AU$1,400/oz. Gold is presently trading at around only US$1,175.75/oz and this has created negative sentiment around the industry. Therefore, it is crucial for the mining and relevant industry participants to understand the correlation between economic variables, such as a commodity prices and exchange rates, so that they can establish better assessment for calculating the project revenue as well as capital and operating costs. As a consequence, the mining companies, especially the gold producers, need to know the relationship between gold prices and the AUD/USD exchange rate, and thereafter be able to determine the numerical value (correlation coefficients) for evaluating mining projects before making and acting on an investment decision or decisions around other investment commitments. This is because to estimate the mining project values considering more than one uncertainty through a continuous time stochastic model, the correlation parameter is required. Furthermore, for minimizing risk and maximizing profits due to several uncertainties, mining companies need to incorporate a relevant hedging strategy. Hence the results of this study may help mine managers make a suitable decision of hedging around the uncertainties associated with gold prices and the AUD/USD exchange rate. Regrettably, limited literature is available surrounding the gold price and the AUD/USD exchange rate and their strength of association or correlation. Han et al. (2012) proposed an interval method for exploring the relationship between the exchange rate of the Australian dollar against the US dollar and the gold price considering historical data focusing on the period between 2002 and 2008. They made a comparison between the interval and point methods and revealed that the difference between the ordinary least square (OLS) and indirect least square (ILS) estimates becomes larger when moving from weekly to quarterly data, since the lowest frequency point data excluded more information. Apergis and Papoulakos (2013) investigated the relationship in terms of means and conditional volatilities considering data from 2000-2011. They found evidence in favour of a cointegration relationship between gold prices and the AUD /USD dollar exchange rate. However, there are some available relevant recent literatures on gold and other currencies. For example, Reboredo and Rivera-Castro (2014a, b) investigated gold’s hedging and value-preserving properties when the US dollar depreciates. They investigated gold’s ability to reduce downside risk and to hedge currency risk for different kinds of portfolios. Ndlovu et al. (2014) investigated the link between the nominal exchange rate of the South African Rand and commodity prices. Their findings confirm that there is a direct relationship between commodity price changes and exchange rate changes in South Africa. However, the strength of the relationship is significantly weaker than in other commodity exporting countries. Reboredo and Rivera-Castro (2014a, b), studied the hedging and down side risk benefits using gold for currency risk management at different investment horizon. In this study, they found a positive dependence between gold and US dollar devaluation against a wide set of currencies. Therefore, arising from the limited literature available outlining the relationship between gold prices and AUD/USD exchange rates, the main objective of this study is to investigate the long term relationship and the correlation between these two indicators based on historical weekly (weekly average) data over a longer period from 1996 to 2014. Logically, it would be better to consider a prolonged period with data for finding the relationship and their strength of association. This is logical because over a shorter period, the lower frequency of data may exclude some of the information variability and hence provide diminished accuracy. Therefore, in our study, longer period data has been considered (almost 17 years) and, as a consequence, improved results were obtained in determining the relationship between these two variables. Augmented Dicky-Fuller (ADF) and modified Dicky-Fuller analysis methods using generalised least squares (DF-GLS) for the unit root test have been performed and all of the tests confirmed that the two variables are non-stationary in levels (here, in levels means data which are not differenced but are still original), and stationary after first differencing being I(1) stationary. The Johansen cointegration test has also been performed and it revealed the long term relationship at a 5 % significance. Furthermore, in this study, it has been revealed that there is bi-directional causality between the gold price and the AUD/USD exchange rate through the vector auto regression (VAR) model. In addition, the continuously compounded percentage return series has been determined for gold prices and AUD/USD exchange rates, and it was found that there exists a bi-directional causality between the continuously compounded percentage return of gold prices and the returns of AUD/USD exchange rates. Furthermore, the stability of the long term integrating relationship between the gold price and the AUD/USD exchange rate has been shown through VAR and vector error correction (VECM) tests. This study will clearly provide an insight into the strong relationship between the AUD/USD exchange rate and the gold price. There is no other industrial economic endeavour that has such a profound influence on the Australian economy (Han et al. 2012; Huleatt and Jaques 2005; Mudd 2007). The volatility of the gold price is an important factor for the Australian gold industry and, therefore, the overall Australian economy. When the price of gold in international markets rises, it encourages the production of additional gold in Australia which evidently provides stronger support than expected to the Australian economy and, consequently, leads to the appreciation of the AUD against the USD. Furthermore, if the demand for gold increases, demand for AUD will increase to buy the gold which will cause an appreciation of the AUD against the USD. Other economic and noneconomic parameters such as other commodities, inflation, countries’ exports, demand and supply may have influences on the AUD/USD exchange rate, but it is beyond the scope of the present study to contemplate these parameters. In addition, the concept and results associated with Dutch Disease, a term that originated in the Netherlands during the 1960s when high income levels were noted as being generated from the country's natural gas discoveries, led to a notable decline in the competitiveness of the country’s other, non-booming, non-gas sector. What eventuated was that the country's skills generally diverted to the booming energy and gas sector, but in the longer term, at a cost. The cost was the arising reduced focus on other sectors, which culminated in a significant skills-improvement (including specialisation) in the gas and energy sectors, but simultaneously with a notable decline in the acquired skills in the non-gas and non-energy sectors. In spite of the revenue windfall associated with the new gas discoveries, over time the Netherlands experienced a drastic decline in economic growth. This seems counter-intuitive but is explained by the removal from industry of skills not aligned to gas and energy. This paradox has been recognized as the situation in which a booming sector adversely affects the performance of other sectors of an economy. Over the past two decades, voluminous literature covering the Dutch Disease has examined the commodity booms experienced by some countries. Globally, the petroleum boom from 1973 to 1979 produced the most generally significant consequences. In Australia, the iron ore boom took significant skills away from other sectors and other States wherein these skills were applied and placed in the iron-rich region of Pilbara in Western Australia. However, with the recent decline in iron ore prices, these skills are again available to other sectors, but the Dutch Disease concept had already occurred with the pull or migration away from other sectors the skills taken up by in the iron ore sector. Takin this outline to Australia's currency and its relative strength against other currencies, Chinese demand for iron ore and metallurgical coal meant that, while the world suffered at the hands of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), Australia’s economy and hence currency strength was somewhat protected due to these demands for the country’s commodities. However, as China's demands for raw products reduced amid a slowing economic growth trajectory, the iron ore and coal prices have declined and, commensurately, Australia's commodity-dependent currency, referred to as a commodity currency, has been exposed and the country’s currency has weakened against its trading partners due to the lower demand for Australia’s natural resources from China.",10

Pedro,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Africa is known to host about 30 % of world reserves of extractive resources and produces over 60 different types of metals, ores and minerals (Dittrich et al. 2012). In some instances, mineral deposits and production are concentrated in a few countries, but more usually, they are spread throughout the continent. More than half the countries in Africa regard mining as an important economic activity and are producing minerals for an international market outside the continent. The paradox of Africa’s natural resource wealth, on the one hand, and the pervasive poverty of its people, on the other, remains a deep and often-noted feature of its economic landscape (AU/UNECA 2011: 9). In most African countries, the sector is often an enclave. The commodity price boom of the 2000s and the increasing demand for natural resources from emerging countries such as China have intensified the debate on the appropriate models for resource-driven development. It triggered calls for a new developmental approach in which mineral resources would play a catalytic role in promoting economic transformation and development, based on increased linkages with the local economy. In this context, the African Union Heads of State and Government adopted the Africa Mining Vision (AMV), in February 2009, as the continental framework to promote resource-driven broad-based development and structural transformation. The International Study Group (ISG)Footnote 1 published a report in 2011 called Minerals and Africa’s Development, saying that the enclave nature of mining ought not to be “an inevitable part of Africa’s destiny, but rather as a particular phase of history…which can be overcome” (UNECA 2011: 3). It adds that there is a need for strong and capable institutions to promote sustainable development in the extractive industry (UNECA 2011: 129–139). Indeed, There is need to strengthen institutional capacities (at government and other levels) for efficient long-term planning for sustainable development, prudent management and smart spending, saving and investment of mineral wealth. (Pedro 2004:18) The AMV (AfDB, AUC, UNECA 2009) advocates for ‘transparent, equitable and optimal exploitation of mineral resources to underpin broad-based sustainable growth and socio-economic development’ that would create ‘a sustainable and well-governed mining sector that effectively garners and deploys rents and that is safe, healthy, gender and ethnically inclusive, environmentally friendly, socially responsible and appreciated by surrounding communities’. At the core of the vision is a notion that Africa’s mineral endowments give the continent a comparative advantage to improve domestic productive capacities and build dynamic competitive advantages towards structural economic transformations and ‘knowledge-driven’ economies. Accordingly, the judicious exploitation of Africa’s mineral resources can generate substantial resources and rents to be invested in other forms of lasting capital that outlive the currency of mining. The development impact of the extractive sector in the local economy can be maximised through economic and social linkages. These opportunities can be realised if the mineral industry is unbundled to identify entry points for (i) downstream linkages into mineral beneficiation, value addition and manufacturing; (ii) increasing local upstream linkages into mining inputs in the form of capital goods, consumables and services; (iii) catalysing resource-based infrastructure to open up opportunities in other sectors of the economy; (iv) spearheading sidestream linkages into skills, research and technology development; (v) facilitating lateral migration of mining technologies to other industries; (vi) promoting the development of sustainable livelihoods in mining communities and (vii) creating small- and medium-sized enterprises and a more balanced and diversified economy with greater multiplier effects and potential to create employment. As an aspirational and transformational statement of goals and principles, the AMV represents a development blueprint that transcends the confines of the extractive sector. It entails a multi-/cross-sectorial approach to mineral development policy, especially the link with industrial and trade policy, infrastructure development, empowerment of local enterprises and skill formation. The AMV calls for structural shifts that require new institutional instruments to support its implementation, especially at country level. Accordingly, we state that the domestication of the AMV at national level needs to be anchored on country mining visions (CMVs). Not surprisingly, we are frequently asked what is it that the existing set of mineral policies and strategies are not already achieving that justify the CMVs. This is an important and understandable question. I offer to discuss this from two perspectives, namely the coordination and alignment conundrum and the difficult balancing act of earning a license to operate. In many jurisdictions, we have seen massive investments being made in extractive industries in the form of geological mapping and mineral exploration, mine and plant development and construction, which were not accompanied by supporting investments in infrastructure and skill development. This lack of integrated thinking and planning can lead to serious bottlenecks in the normal functioning of mining industries. Case studies from Mozambique, Guinea and South Africa below will help to illustrate that resource-driven development of a transformational nature requires complex inter-departmental coordination and multiple sectorial interventions that cannot be supported only through the existing mining-focused set of policies, laws, regulations and organisational settings. Mozambique is home to one of the largest reserves of coal in the world. It is said that, in full capacity, the Moatize, Benga, Zambeze, Changara, Revuboe, Ncondezi and other coal deposits in Tete province, Northwest Mozambique, could potentially produce more than 100 million tons a year of cocking (metallurgical) and thermal coal (USGS 2012). However, currently, any ambition to produce such an amount of coal cannot be realised because of transport capacity constraints in the existing stock of port and rail infrastructure. At best, the Sena railways in Central Mozambique that links the Moatize mines with the Beira port can handle 6 million tonnes of coal a year, far less than Tete’s potential coal production capacity. To redress the problem, the Brazilian mining company Vale (recently joined by Mitsui from Japan) is investing about US$6.4 billion dollars in its Moatize mine-plant-railway-port coal operations, of which US$ 2 billion will be dedicated to expand the mine and plant production capacity to 22 million tonnes/year, and US$4.4 billion dollars will be spent in the Nacala Logistics Corridor to upgrade a 900-km railway (US$ 3.4 billion) from Moatize to the port of Nacala and to improve the Nacala port (US$1.0 billion). The projected coal transport capacity of the railway will be 18 million tonnes of coal yearly.Footnote 2
 By 2020, Vale expects to employ 13,000 people, including contractors of which 89 % will be from Mozambique. The company is making a conscious effort to strengthen local enterprises and supply chain, but it is faced with serious capacity constraints and inability of local suppliers to meet the company’s quality standards and specifications. In 2012, Vale spent US$ 1.4 billion in the country of which 75 % with local businesses which supplied recruiting, cleaning, gardening and maintenance services. Expanding the share and quality of services provided by local suppliers will require entrepreneurship development programmes, the nature of which would involve collaboration with Ministries responsible for labour and vocational training, to name a few. When the projected 6000 MW/year (total) Benga, Changara and Ncondezi thermal coal-fired power plants would be put on stream, added to the current 2000 MW/year produced in the emblematic Cahora Bassa Dam, the Tete province could become a major energy producer and exporter hub. Government plans include the development of an iron and steel and manufacturing cluster. Speaking at the Reuters Africa Investment Summit 2015, the Minister of Mines of Guinea, Mohamed DiareFootnote 3 indicated that the “country’s economic growth will be built around mining hubs”, the first of which would most likely be the US$20 billion dollar Rio Tinto, Chinalco and International Finance Corporation investment in the Simandou iron ore. The Simandou ore deposit is world class. It has estimated reserves of more than 1.8 billion tonnes of high-grade (65.5 % Fe) iron ore (grading 65.5 % Fe) which can produce 100 million tonnes per annum for more than 40 years.Footnote 4 A significant part of the US$ 20 billion will be invested in a 650-km multi-purpose, multi-use and multi-user railway to the Focariah terminal and to build a new deep-water port at Moribaya. Indeed, many practioners have said that the Simandou project is a more logistic and planning exercise than a mining one. The railway to Focariah and Moribaya will form the core (The Southern Growth Corridor) of the trans-Guinean, a 1150-km integrated logistics corridor including rail and deep-sea port which will cross the entire country from southeast to northwest with a branch line from east to west. Indeed, the heavy-haul route is not only meant to transport mineral resources to the coast. Instead, the anchor infrastructure with the associated 1000 km of new roads, deployment of fiber-optic and wireless systems will become a development corridor and provide the business fundamentals and economic rationale to catalyse integrated spatial growth and development in such other sectors as agriculture, forestry, aquaculture, industry and services. It is estimated that when fully operational, the Simandou project can potentially double Guinea’s current GDP and directly and indirectly create 45000 jobs. This is transformational! The AMV calls for resource-based industrialisation anchored on mineral linkages, local content and cluster development programmes. This has been captured in many of the new generation mineral policy statements and development strategies of African member states. However as Morris et al. (2012) have clearly stated, visions and policy statements alone will not produce any significant structural change in Africa’s extractive industry. They need to be backed by appropriate laws and regulations, business plans (with clear milestones, timelines and monitoring and evaluation systems) and, importantly, concerted and well-targeted action by a multitude of institutions and stakeholders. Where this was done successfully such as in Norway’s oil industry or in South Africa’s Richards Bay aluminium, titanium and heavy industry cluster, governments and the private sector had to come together in a hive of coordinated interventions and well-planned and sequenced investments. At Richards Bay, the government, especially through the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), played a crucial role in transforming a small fishing village into one of South Africa’s most important industrial hubs (UNECA 2004b: 77). Based on its policy to establish industrial development nodes outside the Transvaal, South Africa’s industrial and financial heartland (now Gauteng), the government created the necessary regulatory environment for business to flourish, including fiscal incentives, and established an adequate infrastructure base to attract investors to Richards Bay. The development of the Richards Bay Harbour and Coal Rail Line in the 1960s made the local coal industry more competitive. This and other ancillary investments in the form of infrastructure, logistics, power supply and skills allowed the development of other large-scale, capital intensive and resource-based industries such as Billiton Bayside and Hillside Aluminum Smelters, Indian Ocean Fertilizers, Mondi Kraft, Richards Bay Coal Terminal (one of the largest coal terminals in the world with an installed export capacity of 91 million/year) and Bell Equipment. In turn, the large-scale investments have stimulated the emergence of a cluster of small and medium-scale providers of goods and services to the main industries. The multiplier effects and the direct and indirect impacts of the initial investments have thus been significantly magnified (UNECA 2004b:77–90). The examples discussed above show that for mineral linkages and clusters, resource-based industrialisation and spatial development initiatives to happen, as envisaged in the AMV, there is a need to align mineral policy with industrial and trade policies, plan and execute infrastructure development programmes timely and adequately, schedule skill development in consonance with identified needs, encourage innovation and establish effective inter-ministerial coordination, public-private partnerships and platforms for continued multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaboration. We argue that in larger mineral jurisdictions, this can be better achieved when an entire country is fully aligned and committed to a common vision and purpose, the CMV. In discussing good governance, (Dietsche 2014: 15)Footnote 5 notes that ‘economic development is pre-conditioned by political and social institutions’. This is particularly true in the extractive sector. Invariably, the discovery of mineral resources generates excitement, apprehension and expectations of bounty in many stakeholders, including local communities. It can also rekindle old grievances which can lead to open conflict. These tensions cannot be regulated through an exclusive conversation between governments and investors nor through the customary contracts, policies and laws aimed at optimising the sharing of fiscal and economic benefits. Now, securing a lasting license to operate is getting more and more difficult and involves many trade-offs. It is becoming an imperative to bring on board and to the negotiation table and decision chain other voices and constituencies, including local communities, civil society organisations (CSOs) organised labour and the media. The World Economic Forum Responsible Mineral Development InitiativeFootnote 6 notes that divergence in expectations has been the key driver in conflict and tension between stakeholders in the extractive industry. Furthermore, they observe that in many mineral economies, often not all the right stakeholders are involved in the decision chain; stakeholders assume they know each other objectives but in reality do not have a good and common understanding of what creates value for them or each other, and value is assumed to be a ‘zero sum’ game of losers and winners. They posit that in such circumstances, it is critical to create a shared understanding of the benefits and costs of mining in its financial, social, environmental and other dimensions through collaborative and transparent processes for stakeholder engagement. To facilitate these conversations, the World Economic Forum (WEF) developed the Mineral Value Management (MVM) framework, in which seven-value dimensions have been identified. These are the revenue streams (through tax, royalties, levies and fees), employment and skill acquisition, ensuring the respect for the environment and bio-diversity, securing social cohesion and cultural gains, facilitating the entry of local entrepreneurs in the mining supply chain, promoting local beneficiation and downstream industry and, last, optimising mining infrastructure for development. These value dimensions match the AMV key tenets, which are based on a broader definition of value, beyond financial and economic returns. This takes the triple bottom line conversation and assumptions about the drivers for success to another level. As indicated by Dietsche (2014:141–147),Footnote 7 the mere mention that good governance and strong institutions are a prerequisite to the delivery of positive mineral-driven development outcomes masks the complex nature of institutional change, the problematical character of the political economy of the extractive sector and the difficult challenges that policy makers and other stakeholders are faced with in managing the sector, throughout its decision chain. This extends from the mineral exploration and discovery stage to mine development and construction, operations, marketing, revenue collection, distribution and investment, into mine closure and decommissioning. Of particular complexity is how to balance national and local interests, as the Nigerian government would certainly testify from its experiences in operationalising the 13 % derivation principle, a formulae designed to ensure a fair distribution of oil revenue between oil producing and non-producing regions in Nigeria (UNECA 2004a:23). Equally difficult, is how to rein in the rentier behaviour of power elites that compete to secure the mineral rents arising out of a major mineral discovery, plunder resources and squander mineral wealth. (Power 2012:5)Footnote 8 states that this is particularly true ‘when mineral development occurs in a context of underdeveloped social, political and economic institutions’. He adds that in such circumstances ‘the level of social conflict increases and nearly irreparable damage is inflicted on the environment’. Deciding how and where to invest the accrued mineral revenue is not any easier. Caring for the needs of current and future generations can be an impossible task. In line with the times, (Pedro 2004:10) argued that the development of mining should be ‘people-centred and not only profit motivated’. Translating this statement into a credible and actionable proposition is a challenging task. In the ISG report, we say, There is need to redress the weight of existing power relations, especially for marginalised and vulnerable groups, to address deep-seated authoritarian elements of local cultures and some public institutions and reduce the resource constraints (human and material) of public institutions and those affected by or actively pursuing public participation. (UNECA 2011:3) (Pedro 2004:10) notes that the extractive sector needs new platforms for improved public participation in decision making and benefits sharing which facilitate preferential employment of local labour, support local procurement and provision of goods and services, enable multiple use and access to resource-based infrastructure, allocate mineral revenue to local communities and consider community equity participation in mining a viable option. Indeed, one way or another, to generate benefits for all and a compact for transformational change, every gesture matters and is important. Thus, the voices of artisanal and small-scale miners (galamsey) in Ghana who encroach on the operations of large-scale operators must be heard during mine project design and accommodated during the operations stage. Moreover, when local suppliers and business associations cry for access to the supply value chain of mining operations, it is important to harbour their claims in local content policies, in which mining companies should incorporate in their responsible business practices. In addition, it should not come as a surprise nor be considered a trivial incident when governments such as in Indonesia ban the export of unprocessed minerals or contracts are renegotiated in DRC or Guinea. Furthermore, when the Cajamarcan local community in Northern Peru protests over fears that the Yanacocha (a joint venture between Newmont Mining Corporation, Compania Buenaventura and the International Finance Corporation) US$ 4.8 billion Conga gold mining project would destroy local lakes, pollute water sources and disrupt their social fabric and way of live, it is paramount to listen to their grievances and dialogue in search for a lasting solution. Even more urgent is the need to ensure that, under no circumstance, the tragic events of August 2012 in the Lonmin platinum mine in Marikana, North West Province, in South Africa, in which 44 people, including 36 striking miners, were killed—a profound scar and failure to dialogue in a polarised environment—is repeated in any other mining jurisdiction on earth. As indicated earlier, managing these and other dynamics is very challenging. Failure to do so can lead to the erosion of a license to operate, intractable conflicts, reputational damage, business failure and paralysis that benefit nobody. Getting it right requires open dialogue, constructive multi-stakeholder engagement and honest brokering of realistic solutions. This is a joint responsibility of a multitude of stakeholders in host and home countries. Therefore, we need to celebrate when, through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), governments and companies are asked to disclose payments made or received for mineral resources; the OECD adopts the Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, as a means to mitigate the trade in illicit minerals and conflict minerals, and, in the same vein, US lawmakers enact the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Section 1502 on conflict minerals and Section 1504 which requires oil, gas and mining companies to publicly disclose payments made to governments in each of the jurisdictions they operate) and the European Union follows suit with its new Accounting and Transparency Directives. Equally relevant is the report of the high-level Task Force on Illicit Financial Flows, chaired by South Africa’s former President Thabo Mbeki, which underscores that annually Africa loses US$ 50 billion through illicit financial flows (including from the extractive sector) and calls for global action on secrecy jurisdictions, tax heavens, aggressive tax avoidance, commercial tax evasion, trade misinvoicing, abusive transfer pricing, disclosure of beneficial ownership and other forms of criminal, corrupt, market/regulatory and tax abuses, fraudulent practices and abuse of authority, just to name a few (UNECA 2015). It is also an important sign of change when big business signs statements of support to the new ‘John Ruggie’ UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights Reporting Framework endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in June 2011. We also have to take note when KLP, Norway’s largest pension fund manager, indicates that it will divest from companies that derive a large proportion of their revenue from coal, with the view to contributing to a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy. We should also pause and reflect when other large institutional investors de-invest in mining because of reputational risks or are concerned with the ‘carbon bubble’ and ask major oil, gas and coal companies to incorporate the risks of climate change in their business models and practices.Footnote 9
 These contributions to global ethics and transparency norm and standards setting in the form of hard and soft law, rules and regulations and reporting obligations constitute critical steps towards better governance and accountability in the extractive industry. We believe that they are part of the institutional make-up and fabric that can make the AMV ambitious agenda a reality.",

Tercero Espinoza,Marcel Soulier,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The study of metal flows in the anthroposphere helps us to better understand the impact of civilization on the environment as well as to identify areas where improvement is most needed in terms of reducing society’s collective footprint on the environment. In particular for the case of copper, a dynamic stock and flow model is available at the global level (Glöser et al. 2013). However, strong regional differences in production, use and disposal of copper make it necessary to move from a global to a regionalized view of copper flows in order to better understand the global copper system. This move to a regionalized global copper flow model ultimately requires the creation of several regional copper flow models interacting by means of foreign trade. It is important to note that the sheer number of relevant traded commodities between all countries makes the development of regionalized models more challenging in concept and in implementation than a global model. Beyond their utility in generating regional models of the copper cycle, the examination of copper contained in international trade flows can provide valuable insights into the relative positions of the regions in focus in globalized value chains. Certainly, the location of copper mining is tied to the presence of viable ore deposits rather than to the degree of economic and industrial development of the producing countries. Furthermore, foreign trade statistics alone cannot reflect the processing and use of copper in the respective regions. Nevertheless, foreign trade does tend to reflect the relative regional advantages and specialization along the respective value chains. Because of the importance of copper—based mainly on its electrical and thermal conductivity—both in infrastructure and in industrial and consumer goods, the amount of copper contained in foreign trade and the trends in these amounts can enrich analyses made by using other indicators. Data on foreign trade is available from a variety of sources (e.g., UN, EUROSTAT, national customs offices) and is already used to display flows of copper in concentrates, intermediate products of copper smelting and refining as well as refined copper (cf. ICSG 2013; ICSG 2014; ICSG 2015). In addition, a database of international trade in semi-finished goods between selected countries can be ordered from the International Wrought Copper Council (IWCC 2016). However, to more fully account for copper embedded in international trade, and in particular to establish the positioning of the regions in global value chains, it becomes necessary to expand the scope of commodities included in the analysis to finished products. Also, this addition is essential for understanding where secondary copper sources are to be expected, as these depend on the location of use and disposal of finished products rather than on the location of their production. Herein, an overview is presented of copper contained in foreign trade flows between six “regions”: Europe (EU28), North America, Latin America, China, Japan and the “Rest of the World” (RoW). The choice of the regions, while in principle arbitrary, was based on assumptions about the role of each region in global copper value chains and their relative homogeneity (regulatory, cultural, and economic). The time span of the analysis is 1992–2014.",11
29,2,Mineral Economics,04 October 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-016-0088-1,"Conditional linkages between iron ore exports, foreign aid and terrorism",December 2016,Simplice A. Asongu,Jacinta C. Nwachukwu,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"The world is witnessing one of the greatest challenges to peace and shared prosperity. According to the June 2015 Global Peace Index (GPI) report, the number on internally displaced persons recorded between 2008 and 2014 has been the highest since the Second World War. According to Anderson (2015), 13.4 % of Global GDP was lost in 2014 to fighting global terrorism and violence-related concerns. The substantial percentage of GDP represents the combined GDP of Canada, Brazil, Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany. Consistent with Asongu and Kodila-Tedika (2015a), the report argues that terrorist activities are likely to substantially increase in the coming years because terrorist-related killings have soared by more than 61 % in 2014 from 2008. Compared to developed countries, developing nations are more severely affected by the scourge. Moreover, the April 2015 World Bank report has revealed that many developing countries have not yet attained the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) extreme poverty target.Footnote 1
 Against the above background, an evolving stream of recent literature is being increasingly devoted to assessing mechanisms by which terrorism and conflicts can been attenuated. As far as we have reviewed, the documented channels have included the roles of transparency (Bell et al. 2014); rule of law (Choi 2010); learning (Brockhoff et al. 2014), especially in terms of bilingualism (Costa et al. 2008) and lifelong experiences (Asongu and Nwachukwu 2016); press freedom or positive use of media (Hoffman et al. 2013); best governance tools in the fight against conflicts (Asongu and Kodila-Tedika 2016); understanding behavioural intentions motivating terrorism (Gardner 2007); use of military tactics and strategies (Feridun and Shahbaz 2010) and horizons for common policies in the prediction of future regional conflicts (Asongu and Nwachukwu 2015a) and battle against terrorism (Asongu and Nwachukwu 2015b). There is another stream of literature that has been oriented towards nexuses between political instability, terrorism, violence, crimes and macroeconomic variables. Some orientations in this interesting literature have entailed, inter alia: (i) the effect of terrorism on foreign direct investment (FDI) (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2008) and the role of development assistance in mitigating the potentially negative incidence of terror on FDI (Bandyopadhyay et al. 2014), contingent on domestic corruption-control levels (Efobi et al. 2015) or FDI thresholds (Asongu et al. 2015); (ii) linkages between terrorism and economic prosperity, with unidirectional (Piazza 2006; Gaibulloev and Sandler 2009; Öcal and Yildirim 2010; Meierrieks and Gries 2013; Choi 2015) and bidirectional causalities (Gries et al. 2011; Shahbaz et al. 2013; Shahzad et al. 2015); (iii) the relationship between terrorism and innovation (Koh 2007) and (iv) the interplay of terrorism with natural resources (Humphreys 2005). This present study is closest to the fourth (iv) and first (i) streams. In essence, this line of inquiry aims to examine the role of development assistance in mitigating the potentially negative impact of terrorism on iron ore exports. On the one hand, the positioning of the inquiry fits the first steam because it uses foreign aid as a policy variable that can dampen the effect of terrorism on economic activity. On the other hand, the positioning also fits the fourth stream because it is focused on natural resources. Consistent with the underlying trade-terrorism literature (Asongu and Kodila-Tedika 2015a), studies linking terrorism to trade can be classified into three principal themes, notably, the incidence of terrorism on trade; effect of illegal trade on terrorism and pitfalls in the modelling of the relationship. Four main studies are noteworthy in the first strand on the impact of terrorism on trade. They are (1) security measures administered in the USA after the 11th of September 2001 terrorist attacks; essential to mitigate the unappealing effects of terrorism on world trade (Richardson 2004), (2) Nitsch and Schumacher (2004) have examined the impact of terrorism and welfare on trade by employing an augmented gravity model on 200 nations for the period of 1960–1993. Using a plethora of violence, bilateral trade and terrorism variables, the authors conclude that trade openness is negatively affected by terrorism. Moreover, doubling incidents of terrorism reduces the underlying trade by about 4 % and (3) the connection between ‘nearness to the source of terror’ and negative effects on trade has been assessed by De Sousa et al. (2009a) who have concluded that there is a (i) need to carefully work-out a theory that elicits relationships between trade, transnational terror and policies of security and (ii) the importance of engaging more robust investigations on terrorism spillovers to differing definitions of neighbouring incidents and relationships. (4) De Sousa et al. (2009b) have gone further to examine the effect of international terrorism diffusion on trade and security. The motivation for the empirical underpinning is the assumption that nearness to the source of terror is negatively related to corresponding spillover effects. The core motivation underlying the line of inquiry is that measures of security which influence trade affect neighbouring countries and the source-country simultaneously. Conversely, countries that are located far-off from the source of terror could have positive rewards from trade by reaping ‘trade benefits’ corresponding to the ‘loss of trade’ by the country hosting the terror and neighbouring nations experiencing negative trade externalities from the underlying terror. Three principal results are established, notably, (i) there is a direct negative effect of transnational terrorism on trade; (ii) with terror remoteness, trade increases and (iii) a negative effect of terror indirectly affects neighbouring countries from the source-country of terror. Concerning the second stream on the impact of illegal trade on terrorism, two main studies are noticeable in the sparse literature. These studies have been primarily focused on illicit trade. (1) Piazza (2011) has assessed the nexus between ‘drug trade’ and terrorism to establish that cocaine production, illicit drugs and opiate considerably fuel terrorism activities (domestic and transnational). On the other hand, the eradication of illicit crops and banning of drugs have opposite effects. (2) Piazza (2012) extends the underlying study by investigating the relationship between ‘opium trade’ and terrorism in 34 Afghan provinces for the period of 1996–2008, employing binomial regressions. The author concludes that in provinces where opium is substantially cultivated, high rates of terrorist attacks are apparent. Therefore, the direction of causality is established to be flowing from the production of opium to terrorism. In the third strand, modelling issues have been discussed after a survey of the literature by Mirza and Verdier (2008). Four principal pitfalls are articulated from a plethora of studies on the nexus between trade and terrorism, namely the need to (i) control for omitted variables which could most probably be linked to trade and terrorism; (ii) recognise the inter-temporal persistence of terror; (iii) distinguish between the effect of incidental country-specific incidences of terrorism from the impact of occurrences that are oriented towards the source-country and (iv) account for endogeneity. Noticeably, the above literature leaves room for extension in at least four main dimensions, notably the need to (i) control for more terrorism indicators; (ii) explore linkages between foreign policy indicators in the terrorism-trade nexus; (iii) consider specific trade openness dimensions like resource exports and (iv) adopt robust empirical strategies that account for initial levels of the dependent variable. 
First, consistent with a caution advanced by Choi (2015) on the need to explore more variables when investigating the relationship between macroeconomic indicators and terrorism, we consider a plethora of terrorism variables in order to improve room for more policy implications, namely unclear, domestic, transnational and total terrorism. The adoption of these terrorism indicators is consistent with recent literature on the relationship between terrorism and macroeconomic variables (Efobi et al. 2015; Asongu et al. 2015; Asongu and Kodila-Tedika 2015a). This adoption is also in line with the engaged trade-terrorism literature because some studies have focused only on a few variables, particularly (i) transnational terrorism (De Sousa et al. 2009a, b) on the one hand and (ii) on the other hand, transnational and domestic terrorism (Piazza 2011). 
Second, in a bid to improve space of policy directions, we are in accordance with the strand of literature which has used development assistance as a policy indicator in reducing the potentially negative impacts of terrorism on FDI (Bandyopadhyay et al. 2014; Efobi et al. 2015; Asongu et al. 2015). Hence, we steer clear of the engaged terrorism-trade literature by employing a foreign aid policy indicator in the terrorism-‘iron ore exports’ linkage. The motivation for this deviation from the underlying literature is that foreign aid can reduce the potentially negative consequences of terrorism on trade. Moreover, motivated by the Choi (2015) recommendation (on the imperative for more policy variables), two main foreign aid variables are employed to avail room for more policy implications, notably bilateral and multilateral aid. Based on the established evidence that terrorism reduces trade openness (Richardson 2004; De Sousa et al. 2009a, b), the intuition for involving development assistance is essentially to investigate whether foreign aid can reduce a hypothetically negative iron ore exports-terrorism nexus. 
Third, it is relevant to emphasise on trade-specific macroeconomic elements. Therefore, as opposed to the stream of studies discussed above, we narrow down the perspective on iron ore exports from the broad trade openness investigated by Asongu and Kodila-Tedika (2015a, b). We lay emphasis on natural resources because the recent growth resurgence in most developing countries has been established to be resource-driven (Amavilah 2015). Therefore, we employ an export-specific trade category: (i) following Piazza (2011, 2012) and (ii) opposed to Nitsch and Schumacher (2004), Richardson (2004) and De Sousa et al. (2009a, b). 
Fourth, motivated by the caution of Mirza and Verdier (2008) on the need for more robust empirical underpinnings, we adopt an estimated technique that is robust to outliers. Moreover, the adopted Quantile regression technique also enables us to distinguish between initial levels of iron ore exports. In essence, blanket policies may not be effective unless they are contingent on initial levels of iron ore exports and tailored distinctly across high- and low-iron ore exports countries. In light of the above, the present line of inquiry attempts to fill the gap left in the literature by assessing the role of foreign aid in reducing the hypothetically negative impact of terrorism on iron ore exports using quantile regressions. Foreign aid which is used as a policy variable is expected to dampen the potentially negative relationship that terrorism has on iron ore exports. It is logical to expect foreign aid to weaken the negative effect of terrorism on development externalities in recipient countries (including trade in terms of iron ore exports) because foreign aid is theoretically designed to increase economic output by bridging the saving-investment gap in poor countries (Easterly 1999). Iron ore exports are part of economic output. We do not consider specific relationships between types of terrorism and iron ore exports. We broadly assume that terrorism (regardless of type) negatively affects an economic activity like iron ore exports.Footnote 2
 The empirical evidence is based on 78 developing countries with data for the period of 1984–2008. The motivation for focusing on developing countries and the underlying periodicity is at least threefold. First and foremost, as documented by Gaibulloev and Sandler (2009), the negative macroeconomic consequences of terrorism are more visible in developing countries, compared to advanced economies. This is essentially because according to Gaibulloev and Sandler (2009), the former set of countries lack the technological, financial and logical mechanisms needed to absorb corresponding negative externalities linked to terrorism. Second, foreign aid is channelled from developed to developing countries. Therefore, the analytical scope should be the latter set of countries. Third, a motivation of the present inquiry is also to compare corresponding findings with the stream of FDI literature that has used the same periodicity and sample, namely Bandyopadhyay et al. (2014), Efobi et al. (2015) and Asongu et al. (2015). The rest of the study is structured as follows. The “Data and methodology” section presents the data and methodology. The empirical results, discussion and implications are covered in the “Empirical results” section. The “Concluding implications and further research” section concludes with future research directions.",14

This concept has acquired a high social and political status and is nowadays a fundamental condition to expand or open a new mine. The social license concept requires all stakeholders to be aware of their roles and to be effectively engaged in the delineation and implementation of the process to obtain and maintain the social license during the entire life cycle of a mine. In general, at operational level, several important aspects endanger the process to get the license especially in developing countries such as the following: The lack of information, governance and transparency at different government levels The roles given to federal/national, state/region, and municipal/local levels of government and theirs interfaces in terms of failure of the government to deliver. This fault is due to lack of appropriate legal framework or of the will to enforce the law The lack of a transparency and accepted methodology to evaluate the economic and social impacts of a project and The traditional stigma that constrains the image of the mining industry as well as fixed location of every mine In many situations, these aspects come together contributing to hide and compromise the perception of a specific community about the real opportunity costs beneath the options (for example to open or not to open a mine) under consideration. The evaluation of the economic impact of a project on all levels is a fundamental but often superficially made, if not completely forgotten, component of the decision process concerning the acceptance or the rejection of a project. A possible proxy for the opportunity cost is the total net benefits that will be lost by the society during the entire mine life cycle if the project is rejected. On the other hand, the assessment of its distribution impact profile is equally important. One of the most important issues in developing a mine is obtaining what is called the social license to operate. Many papers have been written about what it means as well as which are the best practices to obtain and maintain this license through the mine life. But in spite of these initiatives, what it exactly means has not been defined.Footnote 1
 As a matter of fact, despite comprehensive efforts to formalize and provide substance to the concept, a social license is at best only a process where nothing is really granted to begin with. In legal terms is quite an abstraction. At an operational level, it is mandatory. It is a dual proposition oscillating from a value somewhat fluid, quite intangible and legally fragile to the other extreme of a never ending process to guarantee and maintain the acceptance by the local community of a company’s activities. The process is susceptible to continuous changes with renewed of standards, adoptions of new practices as well as new demands from the community. The status acquired by the social license concept—it is almost a postulate—is a global reality. The mining industry, despite all efforts and the progress observed in adopting the best practices and standards, lies ultimately under an ever increasing kind of local community’s relation domain. The local community seems to have the last word. In many cases, the industry is obliged to take on traditional public responsibilities when government at all levels fail to do so. That is a very unbalanced and challenging situation usually resulting in higher investments and also affecting the risk perception of a project. Someone who does not know the concept social license to operate could reasonably ask the following: What does social license means? Is it renewed periodically or granted on a permanent basis? Is it to be renegotiated for every new government term in the local community or central government? Is it susceptible to change over time reflecting changes in local, state and federal—political, social, and economic—regulations and interests? Considering the questions above, is the local interest more important than the state and/or the national ones? Or perhaps it does not matter? Under what circumstances will national (or state) interests surpass local interests? How are criteria to be set for limiting local interest compared to state and national levels of interest? At the end of the day, the last word should remain with national government level since it has the supreme mandate to arbitrage the ultimate state (country) interest, or should it not? In spite of the slogan “think globally and act locally,” the mining industry does not have the option to choose the location. This reality composed of the natural migration of exploration investments to mining jurisdictions like Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia has been decisive for the expansion path of the mining industry. Over the years, the observed outcome is an increasing number of important mining projects whose development are prohibited, suspended (pending legal issues) and even completely canceled, usually after a lot of time and money have been spent. Latin America is a good example. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the region has become the most important destination for the global flow of exploration investments. However, during this period several projects mounting to billions of dollars of investments have been blocked. In the region, there has been an increasing opposition to mining projects especially in Peru and in Argentina. During this period, some pioneering projects characterizing the nature of these problems are as follows: Tambo Grande (Peru, Au-Ag-Cu-Zn-Pb), Esquel (Argentina, Au), and Rio Blanco (Peru, Cu). Other, emblematic examples are the projects Las Bambas (Peru, Cu) (resistance of the community) and Pascua-Lama (Argentina, Au-Ag-Cu) (pending legislation). As a matter of fact, the fixed location, the intensity of capital, the lag times for developing a mine and the level of risk involved limit the bargaining power capacity of the industry when facing unrealistic demands from local communities. This situation exacerbates risk perceptions, ultimately compromising the flow of investments and the reaping of benefits. In Latin America, the reasons for this situation vary and can, to a large extent, be traced to the following: The historic mining legacy of accumulated economic, social, and environmental liabilities, especially in the Andean region The perceived risk and impacts associated with specific projects The competition for use of the land with traditional cultures and tourism and Remarkable accidents followed by fragile initiatives suggesting failure to adopt best practices. In this context, the mega disaster of Samarco’s iron ore mine tailings dam in late 2015 will further have a strong influence on the environmental license process revision underway in Brazil and elsewhere, not to mention the increase in doubts and hesitance to mining operations especially those close to communities and located in environmentally sensitive areas. In Brazil specifically, large tracks of primary metalogenetic exploration provinces located in indigenous and border areas in total covering about 1.8 million km2 are out of reach for the Brazilian mining industry (and the international mining industry). The Constitution of 1988 allows the mining in indigenous areas, but the established Congress must define the guidelines, conditions, and procedures for the mining activity in these areas by the enactment of ordinary (infra-constitutional) legislation. These large tracks of primary mineable land suggest the order-of-magnitude of economic opportunity costs being generated beneath these legislative pending questions in terms of investments, income, and employment postponed or foregone. An important component of the solution for the challenge to reach a sustainable compromise solution, between a mining project with its investors and backers and the needs of the local community, lies in the public domain defining its role. Governments, especially at the federal and state (provincial) levels, must take full responsibilities and fulfill their legally defined roles. Emphasis should be given to macro-regional land use planning implementation. This is a critical government function, having a fundamental impact on mineral policy. The noticeable lack of planning and/or the absence of political will to enforce the existing regulation combined with the fixed location of a mining project often start disputes with local communities. In this process, the three levels of government have a crucial role. In practice, on several occasions, central and state governments are quite absent as stakeholders because of the lack of political will to take on their role, as set in the legislation, of mediator and arbitrator. Depending on the economic and social importance of the project, the role is of supporter with a policy of supplying infrastructure. On the other hand, eventually, when a project is facing continued resistance by a local community in spite of a project has followed all legal procedures, two situations are of most concern: When the project is considered a priority to state and/or federal government levels. This the case of the dichotomy question: is the local interest more important than the state and/or the national ones? Eventually ,to preclude the break of contracts by enforcing an effective compliance of mining agreements already concluded and committed. One example is stable taxation contracts like those offered by Chile and Argentina since many years. It is opportune to register that in emerging countries on many occasions, the situation reflects the influence of three fundamental dimensions: political wings with a strong bias to militant activism against mining, a fragile level of enforcement of the written law as well as areas of the legal framework permeated subjective and discretionary decision. In this situation, the outcome is random and the final decision could be pending for many years without any legal reasons. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report, even when following international best practices, is often superficial in one of its most important components: assessment of the economic and social impact. Although these reports are very technical, complex, and sophisticated, usually they apply a relatively poor or superficial economic methodology and criteria in particular considering their important role for supporting the decision-making process when large amounts of money and non-financial values are in conflict such as economic, financial, and social evaluation of options; tangibles and intangibles expected costs and benefits; irreversible environmental and social impacts; etc. Quantitative methodologies such as Contingent Valuation and Cost Benefit analysis among others should be used whenever possible and justified. The opportunity costs must be appropriately clarified. Since resources are scarce, the best option should be selected considering the economic and social dimensions at stake and constraints. An economic and social impact assessment report must be robust enough to confront technically specific biased political and economic interests. On the other hand, it must be accessible and comprehensive enough for all the stakeholders especially representatives of local communities to fully understand. Now, it is time to focus on a balanced view with more emphasis on the quantitative economic and social aspects as a means to confront the rhetoric as well as insidious badly informed campaigns. In this sense, one important area to be explored is ex-post evaluation of mining projects from an economic and social point of view. The global dissemination and acceptance of the social license to operate concept is one of the most important recent advances in human rights and environment protection dimensions of mining. The benefits of globalization in the reinforcement of international legislation offer more substance and effectiveness in the application of and respect for this concept. This note addresses some issues that are creating constraints and an unbalanced situation in terms of the community relation issues and mining industry. The purpose is to stimulate discussion about the long range impact for the mining industry’s future expansion path as well as the challenges to obtain and maintain social license during the entire life cycle of a mine. At the interface between the mining industry and community relation issues, three of the most important vectors behind this dysfunction are the following: Non-existent or fragile legal framework, since social license is primarily a concept but also an objective to be reached Failure of governments at all levels to act effectively as a decisive stakeholder in the process considering all its various duties. The demand on industry to take on traditional public activities to compensate for the lack of public services is one example. When looking at the process pipeline from exploration to mining, in the beginning exploration rights are granted by the central government. At the other end, after much time and money spent, is the locus of the crucial social license issue quite often the local community has the last word The lack of depth and substance of EIA in general when analyzed from the economic and social impact perspective. The enforcement of best practices recommending the fully evaluation of these dimensions surely can decisively contribute to find a compromise solution In the last decades, the most dynamic segments of the Brazilian mining industry in particular presented an impressive performance increasing their level of commitment in relation to environmental and social issues. Surely, the mining industry has a major share of responsibilities and the capability to adopt these best practices. It is never enough to rely on that; at the end of the day the society will pay for the impact of decisions taken. One way or another, local, regional, and/or national levels will have their share, depending on the nature, the size, the level of vertical integration and value added, and the potential economic and social impact of the project. Here society is understood embracing the three levels of political governance representativeness and interest: federal, national, and local. In terms of social license to operate, the impact of imposed costs to operate and fundamentally the (lack of) impact generated by irreversible decisions and prohibited projects must be considered in search of the best compromise solution. In these cases, the opportunity cost is represented by the foregone net benefits that could be generated by the prohibited project. For example, looking back in a kind of reverse sensitivity analysis, imagine the opportunity cost that could have been generated if the iron ore Carajás project had been blocked based on a decision of a local community.",1

30,1,Mineral Economics,12 December 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-016-0098-z,Stakeholder management theory meets CSR practice in Swedish mining,April 2017,Helena Ranängen,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be seen as the corporate contribution to sustainable development (ISO 2010). CSR should not only be philanthropy and compensation for irresponsible practice but also integrated into daily business (Hörisch et al. 2014). Scholars suggest that CSR needs to be implemented into every level of an organization to have a meaningful impact (Castka et al. 2004; Zadek 2004; Asif et al. 2011b; Shahin and Zairi 2007). A recent review of CSR practice in the extractive industry has shown that it is the code of conduct, the sustainability reports and community involvement that foremost represent sustainability management (Ranängen and Zobel 2014). Therefore, there is a need for further research on the actual implementation of CSR and the integration of those activities into core business processes (Asif et al. 2011b). Established management systems are useful for CSR practice, and frameworks derive from various standards (Ciliberti et al. 2008; Esquer-Peralta et al. 2008; Holton et al. 2010; Rocha et al. 2007; Sebhatu and Enquist 2007; Sullivan 2004; Castka et al. 2004). Management systems refer to the management of an organization in a comprehensive, systematic, planned and documented manner. It includes the organizational structure, planning and resources for developing, implementing and maintaining policy for CSR aspects like the environment, occupational health and safety, energy, etc. The PDCA methodology which stands for “Plan, Do, Check, Act” (Deming 1986) is often applied to achieve continual improvements. The benefits of integrating all aspects of CSR into one sustainability management system (SMS) are often claimed (Rocha et al. 2007; Asif et al. 2011b). The SMS is then a tool helping companies in their sustainability performance (Esquer-Peralta et al. 2008). However, critical researchers believe that SMS would benefit from a more externally focused stakeholder-driven and value-based approach (Kemp et al. 2006) and instead of “doing things right” should focus on “doing the right things” since companies are confronted with a range of stakeholders, each of them having specific values and interests (Zwetsloot 2003). Stakeholder theory can be considered a CSR theory (Melé 2008) that can be usefully applied in CSR practice (Hörisch et al. 2014) and scholars should continue to explore how traditional theories, like stakeholder theory, can be used to advance CSR practice (Starik et al. 2000). Efforts in integrating stakeholder management into SMS have been made; Singh et al. (2007) talk about stakeholder mapping and stakeholder consultation, Asif et al. (2011a) advocate an identification of key stakeholders, Rocha et al. (2007) see the stakeholders as the “battery” that powers the rest of the SMS, and Asif et al. (2011b) recommend “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches to CSR that identifies stakeholders and stakeholder needs. Nevertheless, these frameworks are almost always conceptual and very seldom describe how stakeholder management should be performed. More empirical research is needed to establish how these frameworks unfold in practice (Asif et al. 2011b) and more specifically the stakeholder assessment process and its translation into CSR objectives and policies (Castka et al. 2004). Hence, this paper describes how a company reacts to and appropriates established stakeholder theory i.e. to test its applicability. This is an important empirical addition to the otherwise often conceptual contributions to stakeholder management framed within the concept of management system thinking. The focus is on the planning phase in the PDCA methodology i.e. the identification of stakeholders and the estimation of “who and what really counts”. Following this introduction, the theoretical framework is presented. Then comes the methodology followed by the organizational context. In the results section, the empirical findings are presented. Finally, in the last section, these findings are discussed and conclusions are drawn.",14

Wellmer,Roland W. Scholz,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"If one has discovered a deposit with clearly defined boundaries of 10 million t and wants to mine it at a rate of 1 million t per year, a nonprofessional would think that a deposit is like a fuel tank in a car that allows one to drive at maximum speed to the last drop. This means that one can exploit the deposit at a constant rate of 1 million t for 10 years, meaning the production profile over 10 years would be a rectangular distribution. However, a deposit is not a fuel tank in a car. In reality, the production profile is always a “mountain curve,” a somewhat U-shaped curve as that, for example, shown in Fig. 1 for the lignite production of the Cottbus Nord open pit in the Lausitz area of Germany. We can distinguish a start-up phase, often associated with start-up difficulties; a plateau phase; and a decline phase. Even for a company with century-long experience to mine a commodity, like lignite here, this is true for a new mine. It is much more so in the case of a totally new mine, often with new technology that frequently encounters start-up problems and, consequently, a longer start-up phase. At the end of the mine life, each deposit section with a stope in an underground mine or an excavating machine in an open pit has its own “deposit section life.” In addition, to mine leftover pillars is less efficient than mining big stopes. Therefore, also at the end of a mine there is a gradual decline. Such U-shaped production curves can also be observed for mining districts, i.e., if you add up several of the production curves of single mines, as shown in Fig. 2 for the fluorspar province of Upper Palatia in Germany with many smaller mines. Under certain constraints—which we will discuss in this paper—this also holds true for countries or even for the whole world for a commodity. Lignite production in the open pit Cottbus North (Schroeckh 2016) Fluorspar production in Upper Palatia, Germany (data from K. Weis, Wellmer and Berner 1997) The ideal curve is shown in Fig. 3: the phase of building up production, a plateau phase, and then the decline phase. Rarely realized, the ideal curve is a symmetric curve. For oil fields, the peak is called depletion mid-point (dmp); 50% of the ultimate recoverable resources (URR) (or estimated ultimate recovery, EUR) are exploited by then. The pertinent curve for oil is also called the Hubbert curve. The geophysicist Marion King Hubbert (1956a, b) employed it as a tool to predict the peak of US oil production (lower 48 states) in 1971 with an error of only 1 year (Fig. 4a, b). Because of its seeming exactness, it became famous. After the oil crises in 1973 and 1979, the term peak oil was coined and found entrance into daily newspapers. Newspaper articles denoted Hubbert as a prophet who saw the coming oil crises in 1948 (Omang 1977). The idea of peak oil was then transferred to other commodities, resulting in “Peak Everything” (Heinberg 2010). The ideal “Hubbert curve.” The dotted lines on the right-hand side also show the incorrect concept of considering reserves and/or resources like fuel in a car’s tank 
a Hubbert’s 1956 peak oil graph (Hubbert 1956b). b Oil production in the USA (source BGR 2016) The Hubbert curve and peak became a key argument in the fierce political debates between environmentalists and resource skeptics. A historical study by Priest (2014) nicely elaborates that Hubbert, a geophysicist for Shell Oil Co. and later for the US Geological Survey, and Vincent McKelvey, the director of the US Geological Survey, were rooted in two opposing camps with different perspectives, narratives, and mechanisms believed to govern the dynamics of exhaustible resources. According to Omang, “Hubbert’s emphasis on geological depletion as a mechanism for creating scarcity clashed irreconcilably with McKelvey’s focus on price and technology as the keys to manufacturing plenty” (Omang 1977). In simple terms, a natural science view was countering economic realities which also depend on the human will (e.g., to pay) and on creativity (as a means of technology development). But while they are related, physical and economic stocks are different. Some minerals are substitutable and dependent on application for certain technologies that may disappear, and others are not, and short-term price shocks and crises follow different time scales and rationales than long-term depletion. In addition, many other factors affect the dynamics of resources on a global scale (Priest 2014). The objective of this paper is to provide a conceptual and empirical historic analysis of applications, misunderstandings, and fallacies surrounding the Hubbert curve and peak minerals. As applications of the Hubbert curve include knowledge about URR as a prerequisite or aspire to predict URR, we discuss this term first.",38

Strengthening of industrial sectors lies at the core of the development agenda as the overall economic growth depends on the sectoral growth rate which is influenced by the linkages between the sectors. Inter-sectoral linkages therefore play a crucial role in the industrialization and socioeconomic development of a country. This poses particular challenges for resource intensive economies since it is widely believed that the extraction of commodities is corrosive of industrial development (Morris et al., 2012). The Dutch disease and the resultant de-industrialization, the effect of volatile commodity prices on fiscal stability, the increased vulnerability to political conflict and violence, and the enclave nature of the extractive projects were drivers that linked commodity dependency to adverse growth and development environments. Extractive mineral industries have played a crucial role in the development of Botswana. The main mineral export is diamonds with little contribution also from copper, nickel and gold. Botswana’s record of mineral-led development is remarkable not just for its rapid growth, but for apparently avoiding most other aspects of the resource curse (Iimi, 2006). Over the years studies have been carried out to explain the impact of mining sector in the economy of Botswana. However, there are few studies in the context of linkage of mining sector with other sectors in the economy. Mbayi (2011) examined the nature and extent of forward linkages and the role played by linkage drives in deepening and widening the linkages. Mbayi (2011) found that Botswana is succeeding in developing the industry with significant local linkages. In their study Morris et al. (2012) argue that the linkage development of commodities sector in Botswana is thin and limited to labor. They put forward that the proportion of inputs sourced locally or outputs processed locally and their domestic value added are very minimal, adding that there is potential for increasing the linkages. Fessehaie et al. (2016) analyzed the design, implementation, and effectiveness of mineral linkage development strategies in Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Their analysis found that resource-based industrialization is possible through the development of necessary skills, increasing domestic technological capabilities appropriate polies and institutions, of which Botswana have taken coherent design and effective implementation to foster mineral linkages. The present study empirically examines the linkages among the mining and non-mining sectors in the economy of Botswana from 1976 to 2014. The study employs Granger causality test and vector autoregressive approach consisting of impulse response function and variance decomposition. The remainder of the study is structured as follows: “Economic background and mining sector in Botswana” section presents economic background. “The natural resource curse-industrialization nexus” section presents the resource curse-industrialization nexus. “Methodology and model specification” section presents methodology and model specification. “Results and discussion” section presents results and discussion. Conclusion and policy implication is presented in “Conclusion and policy implications” section.",5
30,2,Mineral Economics,30 January 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-017-0102-2,Investigating the effect of price process selection on the value of a metal mining asset portfolio,July 2017,Mikael Collan,Jyrki Savolainen,Pasi Luukka,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Profitability analysis of large industrial investment with long economic lives is difficult, and there are many issues that affect the accuracy and the credibility of these analyses. In this paper, the goal is to highlight the importance of the choice of stochastic processes, such as the price processes used in modeling the profitability of large industrial investments. Here, the focus is on the effect the choice of processes used to mimic future metal price changes has on analysis results for the analysis of a multiple mining asset portfolio. We are interested in portfolios, because when a portfolio of assets is studied simultaneously, one commonly expects to see what is called the portfolio effect to take place. What we specifically want to investigate is how much difference using different stochastic processes causes the perceived portfolio profitability and risk to exhibit. Mining investments are large and practically, irreversible investments that operate under multiple uncertainties and their profitability are inherently dependent on the price development of global metal markets. This fact underlines the importance of the selection of price processes used, when evaluating metal mining investments. An empirical review of the factors affecting metal price process selection in metal mining companies is presented in Espí and De La Torre (2013). A “complete” mining project typically consists of six distinct phases that consist of exploration, evaluation, pre-development, development, production, and closure phases, but only a fraction of all early stage projects actually reaches the production (exploitation) phase (see, e.g., Klossek and Klossek 2014; Krzak 2013). The profitability of mining investments is traditionally evaluated by using discounted cash flow (DCF)-based analysis methods such as the net present value (NPV), see Bhappu and Guzman (1995), Moyen et al. (1996), and Smith (2002). Research also exists for mineral resource valuation, see Eves (2013), and for company level analysis of mining, see Klossek and Klossek (2014). An important concern with the traditional DCF-based methods is their apparent inability to take into account the managerial flexibility of projects, and thus, they may underestimate project value (Brennan and Schwartz 1985a, 1985b; Davis 1996). Mining projects may include different types of operational real options, such as the flexibility to temporarily shut down and to restart operations. In this vein, to consider the value of flexibility connected to mining investments, real option analysis has been applied in the mining context, for example, Brennan and Schwartz (1985a, 1985b) suggest that a mine should be valued as an option to receive the cash flows from the mining project by using the risk neutral prices of commodity futures. The value of real options should ideally be considered already in the mining project analysis phase, before the decision to invest. In any case, real option analysis should be considered complementary to the more traditional methods, because as it has been previously observed, from a managerial point of view, it may be unlikely that one would irreversibly invest millions of dollars in a project that does not meet conditions of a plain NPV calculation, see Humphreys (1996) and Smith (2002). Moreover, Bjerksund and Ekern (1990) suggest that the impact of operational managerial flexibility in running a mining operation may be negligible, when and if compared to importance of investment timing on the value. This means that Bjerkesund and Ekern implicitly point out the importance of the estimated price of the mined substance to the profitability of the mine and point to the importance of being able to correctly choose the price process used. Studies furthermore suggest that value of mining projects can be optimized by applying methods of operations research in mine design and project planning (Newman et al. 2010). A recent review article by Savolainen (2016) discusses the choice of appropriate valuation methods and the role of managerial flexibility in the context of the metal mining industry. Historical price data of metal markets has been studied in, e.g., Labys et al. (1999) who found that historically, the metal prices do not seem to follow a random walk process, but instead, they are non-linear, non-stationary, and heteroscedastic. Many commodity prices (including metals) experience cycles (Humphreys 2010; Labys et al. 1999; Roberts 2009) and co-movement (Pindyck and Rotemberg 1990; Rossen 2015). A full metal price cycle consists of a peak price, followed typically by a long recession, which ends in a trough followed by a new (relatively short) expansion of prices and a new peak (Roberts 2009). The tendency of prices to move towards the same direction is suggested to be especially strong within groups of metals such as, e.g., non-ferrous metals and precious metals (Rossen 2015). Evidence of the existence of market trends, however, seems to be mixed and empirical results seem to be dependent on timeframe studied (Geman 2005; Roberts 2009). There are also empirical issues, such as structural change and overlapping data, that undermine the reliability of metal price data research (Watkins and McAleer 2004). Market prices of metals have been found to have a correlation with macroeconomic factors (Chen 2010; Labys et al. 1999). Volatility of metal prices can to some extent be explained by the time lag between the start of constructing new capacity and the start of production, in connection with rising prices and on closures of existing facilities, when prices fall (Dixit 2004). Qualitative historical macroeconomic explanations of metal price variations have also been proposed, see, e.g., Chen (2010), Humphreys (2010), and McClain et al. (1996). Metal price uncertainty is often modeled by using stochastic processes such as the geometric Brownian motion (gBm), e.g., see Brennan and Schwartz (1985b). A “feature” of the gBm is that the distribution of expected prices from over any time interval is log normally distributed (Dixit and Pindyck 1994). When gBm is used for metal price modeling, it has been found to lead to errors in valuation, and more recently, commodity price modeling efforts have been made by using mean-reverting (MR) price models, e.g., see De Lamare Bastian-Pinto et al. (2013), McDonald and Siegel (1985), Slade (2001), Smith and McCardle (1999), and Zhang et al. (2014). The formulation of a stochastic mean-reverting price process is presented, e.g., in De Magalhaes Ozorio et al. (2013); Guimaraes Dias and Carlos Rocha (1999); Smith and McCardle (1999). The mean-reverting (price) process used for the purposes of the numerical illustrations presented in this research can be expressed by: where d(X

t
) is the change in metal price, S(t) is the mean reversion speed, L(t) is the mean reversion level, and V(t)dW

t
 is the Brownian motion increment. It should be noted that further developed mean-reverting processes exist (see, e.g., Schwartz 1998). There is also research that has studied the joint use of stochastic processes and managerial information about metal price cycles that could also be used (Savolainen et al. 2017); these methods are however left outside the scope of this research. For an extensive overview on commodity price modeling, we suggest the reader visit (Geman 2005). Some recent contributions in commodity price modeling include using a combination of a mean-reverting process with the gBm and/or with a Poisson process (De Magalhaes Ozorio et al. 2013; Guimaraes Dias and Carlos Rocha 1999) and the use of two-state variable models (Gibson and Schwartz 1990), three-state variable models (Cortazar and Casassus 1998; Cortazar and Schwartz 2003), and a three-factor model, where the convenience yield depends on spot prices and interest rates and where the risk premium is time-varying (Casassus and Collin-Dufresne 2005). In sum, it is a commonly accepted notion in the metal industry that market prices of metals tend to be mean reverting. Nevertheless, we find that there is a lack of empirical studies regarding the levels to which metal prices seem to revert to. To date, the vast majority of investment analyses of mining projects reported in academic literature have been done on “stand-alone” basis and by studying the development of a single mining asset value, typically based on the value process of a single metal. In this paper, we focus on investigating the valuation of a portfolio of mines, where metal prices are interconnected with each other or they correlate with a given index. And we compare situations where, under such circumstances, the metal price processes of assets in a mining asset portfolio are modeled by using different stochastic processes—we investigate how much the selection of processes affects the value of the portfolio. Using the correlation of cash flows with a traded, or non-traded, index in asset valuation has been previously proposed in, e.g., Barton and Lawryshyn (2011) and Jaimungal and Lawryshyn (2015). In the metal mining context, Abdel Sabour and Poulin (2006) study a single multi-metal mine with a simulation method and assume an unequal correlation of factors between metals and a stock index. There seem to be very few contributions that include a study of historical implications of metal price data analysis into numerical valuation of projects; this can be described as a “gap” in current research. In our previous work (Collan et al. 2015), we have looked at this issue shortly and investigated how multiple mines with parametric uncertainties can be modeled simultaneously by using the Monte Carlo simulation. There, the focus was on the early screening phase of investments. Ignoring relationships between variables can lead to unrealistic combinations of variables, when the Monte Carlo simulation is used (Eves 2013). For this reason, for the purposes of this research, we have simplified reality and reduced the number of uncertainties into one category: the metal prices and the tested effect of the choice of using different processes to model the market movements of metal prices on a hypothetical metal mine portfolio value. The idea of this research is illustrated in Fig. 1. Illustration of the method used; n is the number of metals and m represents the number of simulation rounds The simultaneous analysis of multiple metal mining assets is interesting for many mining companies, as it is quite typical that large international mining companies have multiple active assets. The results should confirm the existence of the well-known portfolio effect and shed more light on the effect that the choice of the metal price process modeling has on the simultaneous valuation of multiple assets. The paper continues as follows: in the next section, we shortly introduce the simple valuation model used; this is followed by a description of the simulation cases, including a detailed description of the parameter values used and a presentation of the case analysis results. The paper is closed with a discussion and conclusions.",2

Countries in this region, such as Australia, have enjoyed economic prosperity as a result of the mining boom that began in 2005 (Ye 2008; Kent 2015). A transformation of the economy in the Asia-Pacific region has achieved a remarkable economic growth over the last 50 years. The uniqueness of this region has made it one of the fastest growing economies in the world in terms of mining investment (Llewellyn Consulting 2014). Otto (1992) states that the attractiveness of mining investment in the Asia-Pacific region is reliant on its competitiveness compared to other regions with the same geological conditions. Mining investments differ from investment activities in other sectors. Generally, mining projects involve a significant long-term life process that usually includes uncertainties such as the extent of the mineral reserve, mining techniques, and complex technologies that can lead to volatility of commodity markets and financing difficulties (Deloitte 2014). Mining companies are challenged by most of the major economic factors, both endogenous and exogenous, when undertaking projects. These factors include geology, engineering, financing, political risks, fiscal issues, and market risks that can significantly impact the mining investment decisions. In recent years, impacts on local societies have further become more important in such decisions (see for example in Lesser et al. 2017 and Suopajärvi et al. 2017). Mining investment decisions are determined by key factors, including the accountability, credibility, efficiency, and effectiveness of public policies. The transparency and openness of government policies are two of the key factors that attract mining investment in the Asia-Pacific region. Investment decisions in large-scale mining projects are irreversible (Décamps et al. 2006). Mining investors are extremely sensitive to price and political uncertainties that can impact investment revenues significantly. Managerial flexibility is as much about making decisions at the right time as about making the right decisions; therefore, timing is regarded as one of the critical issues in mining investment. Having flexibility in mining projects enables mining managers to decide whether to delay a project, expand, or abandon it. Dealing with managerial flexibility has not been a feature in the traditional cash flow method. Applying a strategic decision analysis approach with flexibility, this study aims to provide a real options framework using the binomial decision tree model to analyse investment decisions in the mining industry. Furthermore, the authors intend the study documented in this paper to provide new insights into investment strategies that have not been explored and tested in this region. In an actual investment climate, there are many uncertainties, such as a change in economic conditions, the volatility in commodity prices, and policy uncertainty. Uncertainty, therefore, leads to delay in the optimal timing of an irreversible investment activity. The motivation of this study is to address the research questions by presenting empirical analysis using examples from Asia-Pacific mining projects. There are two research questions that need to be addressed: the first research question is whether, when mining companies make the decision to invest in projects in the region, it is beneficial to use the strategy of timing flexibility in conjunction with the real options valuation (ROV) instead of the static net present value (NPV) rule. The second research question is how different tax rates affect the decisions to invest and when to invest if the optimal timing investment rule is applied. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: “Background studies of the Asia-Pacific region” section contains some background studies in the Asia-Pacific region. “Literature pertaining to the frameworks of mining investment and tax policy” section presents a literature review on natural resource valuation models and real options analysis in the resource sector. “The model” section comprises the methodology. “Data collection” section documents data collection. “The empirical analysis” section contains the results from the decision tree analysis, and “Conclusion” section concludes the paper.",3

Ayuk,Bruno Oberle,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Mineral wealth, if managed prudently, presents enormous opportunities for advancing sustainable development, particularly in low-income countries. The extractive sector has been identified as an important contributor to the achievement of all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by UN Member States in 2015.Footnote 1 Mining can impact most directly the Global Goals relating to poverty eradication, decent work and economic growth, clean water and sanitation, life on land, sustainable and affordable energy, climate action, industry and infrastructure, as well as peace and justice (UNSDSN 2015). Recent data published by the International Council of Mining and Minerals (ICMM) clearly shows the potential role of mining in national economies (ICMM 2016). For the poorest countries in the world, the sector can be a driver for economic growth and improved welfare of its people. The 2016 mining contribution index, which ranks 183 countries in the world according to the mining sector’s contribution to the domestic economy, shows that six of the top ten countries are in Africa.Footnote 2 In addition to generating vast sums of government revenues, extractive projects can also generate benefits by creating employment, fostering demand for domestic goods and services, transferring technologies and know-how, and building infrastructure. Notwithstanding, mineral-rich nations are confronted with serious challenges in attempting to translate natural resource wealth into long-term inclusive and sustainable development. The phenomenon of resource-rich countries being unable to transform their mineral resource endowments into enhanced growth and well-being for their citizens has received considerable attention in the literature, referred to as the ‘resource curse’ or ‘the paradox of plenty’.Footnote 3
 It has long been recognised that governance is key for mitigating the adverse impacts of mining and for enhancing its positive economic, social and environmental outcomes. Nevertheless, most existing policy frameworks and instruments for governing the mining sector tend to present piecemeal efforts and, importantly, often fail to be implemented at the national level. This means that new governance approaches and instruments have not succeeded in bringing about a transition away from the ‘extractivist’ and anthropocentric model widely prevalent in the developing world, whereby the extractive sector is an enclave with few linkages to the local economy (Acosta 2013).Footnote 4 To achieve this, there would be a need to adopt sustainable development approaches based on new metrics where success is measured on the strength of economic outcomes, sound environmental management, the respect of social values and aspirations and the observance of the highest governance and transparency standards. This more holistic approach is at the core of the Africa Mining Vision (AMV) adopted in February 2009, which argues that mineral resources can catapult Africa to broad-based development and structural transformation (African Union 2009). Insofar as these issues are currently taken into account in the governance of resource extraction, it is largely through the so-called Social Licence to OperateFootnote 5 (SLO). However, in response to the new imperatives set by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the inadequacies of the current paradigm, this paper calls for the SLO to be developed into a new multi-level, holistic and integrated governance framework, applicable to governments, companies and the range of stakeholders involved in the mining sector, which is here referred to as the ‘Sustainable Development Licence to Operate’ (SDLO),Footnote 6 and which is designed to function as a normative reference point for the multiple actors concerned with the extractive sector, and support their efforts to work together in a manner compatible with the SDGs. This paper firstly briefly describes the SLO and some of the criticisms that have been made of it (Section 2), followed by the changes in the international context and emerging challenges that have rendered the SLO somewhat outdated (Section 3). After examining the nature of the current governance architecture in the extractive sector, the paper then sets out the key principles and policies that underlie the proposed SDLO (Section 4), together with some of the implications for the reform of resource governance to which they give rise, followed by some concluding remarks (Section 5).",18

These debates over availability occur not only for highly scarce minerals such as the rare metals of lithium, gallium, and indium that have received much attention recently but also for the base metals, such as copper, that have been widely used throughout history, the production and mining of which have been intense and long standing. The debates also include two opposite paradigms of long-run mineral availability, namely, the fixed stock paradigm versus the opportunity cost paradigm (Tilton and Lagos 2007). Recently, Humphreys (2013) argues that some observations suggest both constraint on mineral availability in the opportunity cost paradigm and ultimate constraint on resource and environment in the fixed stock paradigm. Therefore perspectives on resource exhaustion in the long run are unclear and uncertain. The problems associated with global, long-run sustainable resource supply and demand forecasts must be tackled in a way that comprehensively considers the constraints described above. This paper analyzes the problems associated with the sustainable supply of mineral resources by developing a long-run mineral resource balance model that quantifies demand and supply including scrap supply. We examine the life cycle of mineral resources, starting from ore mining, followed by metal production, in-use and out-of-use of final products, disposal, and recycling at the global level. Of the base metals that have been consumed by massive amount in mankind history, our long-run model for supply and demand up to 2150 considers iron ore, bauxite (aluminum), copper, zinc, and lead, in addition to (non-metal) cement. Due to importance of non-ferrous sustainable supply and space constraints, we present only the results for copper, zinc, and lead in this article. Caveating that our model neither shows forecast nor prediction but just scenarios based on economic programming by applying linear programming in economically idealized world, the linear programming consists of three sets of equations: an objective function, balance equations, and constraint equations. The objective function is generally expressed by the sum of the products of (cost) coefficients (c

j
) with decision variables (x

j
) determined via optimization: \( C=\sum_j{c}_j\times {x}_j \). While linear programming requires perfect foresight—weakness to determine various parameters such as resource endowment with its cost, technologies, and demand—the strength is to clarify shadow prices of resources, key to estimate inclusive wealth (Arrow et al. 2012; Smulders 2012), which is measured over the time horizon (Dupuy et al. 2017) by applying an integrated assessment model including this mineral resource balance model.",16

Weak economic conditions, global excess capacity, and weak profitability are some of the pressures facing the steel industry. Many steel firms have adopted a number of strategies to cope with these adverse factors, such as moving toward supplying growing markets and adding value to their steel products. Under the circumstances, steel trade has played an increasing economic role among major steelmaking economies over the past few years.Footnote 1 Steel trade has important implications for conditions in the world steel market. The current situation of steel trade reflects, for example, the level of technology, productivity, types of steel products, quality of steel products, and convergence of emerging market and developing economies.Footnote 2 As a result, developments in steel trade and related trade policies are receiving increasing attention by governments and industry alike. The economic literature has focused on the convergence of developing economies, suggesting that they should experience faster growth than advanced economies (e.g. Baumol 1986; Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991; Barro 2012; Rodrik 2013). In the steel industry, less developed steelmaking economies have converged to more developed steelmaking economies by taking advantage of economic backwardness over the past several decades (Fig. 1a, b).Footnote 3 For example, China has rapidly converged to more developed steelmaking economies and has surpassed them to become the largest steel producer in the world. In 2015, China’s crude steel output reached 803.8 million metric tonnes (mmt), representing 49.6% of global steel production.Footnote 4

Source: Author’s calculation based on data from Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl (WV Stahl) (2016) and the World Steel Association (2016b) The global steel industry has experienced rapid growth in production since the start of the twenty-first century, although excess capacity has become one of the main challenges facing the industry today (OECD 2015a). Global nominal crude steel capacity reached 2384 mmt in 2015, which is more than three times as high as the 697-mmt capacity observed in 1970, according to WV Stahl (2016) (Fig. 2a). The growth in steelmaking capacity has occurred mainly in emerging market and developing economies.Footnote 5 Steelmaking capacity data from the OECD (2016a) seem to support this trend—non-OECD economies will continue to lead the capacity expansion in the global steel industry, with their share of world capacity expected to increase from 42% in 2000 to 72.4% by 2017 (Fig. 2b). This trend suggests that advanced economies have been losing market share in the global steel industry over the past decade. However, the question arises: have emerging market and developing economies converged to advanced economies from the viewpoint of value creation?

Source: WV Stahl (2016) and author’s calculation based on data from the OECD (2016a) Turning to steel trade, global steel exports, including intra-trade exports, have been increasing over the last few years.Footnote 6 There has been a decoupling between steel exports in volume and value terms amid weak domestic demand conditions, with steel exports in value terms declining while steel exports in volume terms have continued to climb (Fig. 3a). Global steel exports in volume terms reached a record high of 456.7 mmt. On the other hand, global steel exports in value terms declined significantly from USD 391.2 billion in 2014 to USD 342.7 billion in 2015, reaching the second lowest level for several years after the financial crisis in 2009.

Source: Author’s calculation based on data from the ISSB (2016) Figure 3b shows the shares of steel exports of the world’s 15 steelmaking economies in global steel exports in volume and value terms in 2015. There is a huge gap between volume and value terms.Footnote 7 China exported 111.6 mmt of steel, accounting for 24.4% of global steel exports in volume terms, while its share declined significantly to 18.1% in value terms, suggesting that Chinese exports were concentrated in low value-added items. On the contrary, the shares of steel exports in several advanced economies in value terms were greater than the shares of exports in volume terms, suggesting that these economies have played important roles in supplying higher value-added products. In recent years, amid recent weak financial performance of steelmakers and continued capacity expansion, there has been a debate that focuses on ‘value creation’ in the steel industry.Footnote 8 For instance, the World Steel Association (2015a, p. 9) has pointed out that ‘industry will need to focus on value-added instead of tons’. Moreover, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Steel Committee argues that ‘a focus on creating value instead of volume could help the industry capture opportunities arising from many long-term structural changes’ (OECD 2015c, para. 5). This suggests that it is important to consider how different the structure in value terms is from that in volume terms. However, publicly available data on the value of steel products are difficult to come by, and trade data are more readily available and more coherent than production data, enabling comparison between economies. Thus, trade data could be a useful tool to show the difference between them as a first step toward considering the issue of value creation in the steel industry. With respect to global steel exports by product, hot-rolled sheets/strips, used widely as a basic material for transformation in downstream products, are the largest export item in volume terms, followed by bars, ingots and semi-finished products, and galvanised sheets.Footnote 9 Although the share of ingots and semi-finished products was 11.2% in volume terms, it has declined to 6.1% in value terms. On the other hand, the share of pipes and tubes was 8.5% in volume terms, but has risen to 19.2% (the largest export item in value terms), indicating that the product category is the highest value-added product in the industry. Moreover, the share of cold-rolled sheets/strips increased from 8.8% in volume terms to 11.4% in value terms. The purpose of this study is to examine the export structure of the 15 largest steelmaking economies in 2015 based on production structure and the level of economic development.Footnote 10 The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section provides a brief literature review on theories related to the development of the steel industry and steel trade as well as the analytical perspective used in this study. The section thereafter discusses the structures of exports for the 15 steelmaking economies analysed in this study by dividing them into three groups; in addition, this section presents the empirical results of trade specialisation using the revealed symmetric comparative advantage (RSCA) index. The final section draws conclusions from the arguments in this study and addresses their implications.",5

In the 1950s and 1960s, the claim for political independence of former colonies and other developing countries led to the raise of taxes and the change of ownership of many mineral resource assets. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the economic and institutional change created by the reallocation of the rents to the mineral-exporting countries became the topic of various mineral economics research. Together with Raymond Mikesell, Marian Radetzki was among the first economistsFootnote 1 to point out the destabilizing effect of the new players surging in non-fuel mineral markets. Conversely to oil markets where the nationalization of the pits had led to an oligopoly of states, the structure of non-fuel mineral markets was much more diverse, combining private and state-owned companies, mixing a large array of mining and smelting technologies, addressing a wide range of processing sectors. Various issues were then at discussion. One was the economic efficiency of the new state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into which politics commonly interfered with the industrial logic (Radetzki 1985, 1989). Another was the real impact on development of the handling of the rents by the hosting states (Tilton ed. 1992). A third one was the change brought in mining investment and mineral supply by the reallocation of the rents to national development (Bomsel et al. 1990). The paradox of these times was that while no one could argue against the political emancipation of independent countries, the economic effects of the change of ownership in mineral reserves remained questionable. In particular, it was commonly thought that the multinational companies were capturing the mineral rents to the main benefit of the industrialized world, and that the return of these rents to the hosting states would boost their development. But, this did not happen. Not only did the less-developed mineral-exporting economies not improve but also their state-owned mines (in Peru, Bolivia, Mauritania, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo—DRC) experienced major operating difficulties. As John Tilton rightly termed it in 1992, “The recent poor performance of low-income mineral exporting countries is both surprising and distressing…. Growth in the less developed mineral-exporting countries remains an enigma, suggesting that the relation between mineral wealth and economic development is far more complex and at time, far less favorable than common sense would suggest”..Footnote 2
 Researchers like enigmas. And this one was quite exciting. I had written my PhD thesis on the economic imbalances that made the circulation of the mineral rents destructive for the non-mining sector. These, known as the Dutch disease (Corden and Neary 1982), consisted in the shaping of a dual economy based on high salaries paid in the mining sector, cheap imports of consumption goods including food products, and the creation of a wide public sector to compensate the fall apart of the domestic production one. Such policies were carrying political tensions. Radetzki, who had pioneered the depiction of the externalities associated with large-scale exotic mining, had noticed the economic and political disputes arising within a country for the control of the rents (Radetzki 1982). The secession of the Bougainville Island in Papua New Guinea (started in 1988) was a clear example of the frustrations resulting from the centralization of the rents at the national state level. The debate was whether such a situation was ineluctable or it could be monitored through adapted policy recommendations. For Radetzki (Tilton ed. 1992), it was clear that “a developing country with no prior exposure to mineral activity has to incur a heavy setting-up cost to develop institutions and human capital needed to reap significant national benefits from the exploitation of its mineral wealth. This setting-up cost seems unavoidable.” But he immediately added: “Because it has to be incurred at some point, it does not constitute a justification for a deferral (of a relevant mining investment).”Footnote 3
 The underlying idea was the existence of a learning curve in managing natural resources. The mining rents would then help the hosting country in financing its institutional setting-up cost. Chile or Indonesia, for instance, had proven getting wiser and wiser in managing their mineral resources. In other words, should the mine be exploited, the invisible hand of progress would gently drive the hosting country along the institutional learning curve. Yet, 25 years later, many mineral-exporting countries, including now Russia and Kazakhstan, as well as Algeria, Libya, DRC, or Venezuela, still suffer from institutional weaknesses. The institutional learning curve looks pretty erratic. The enigma endures. However, in the meantime, the political economy theory has made spectacular progresses shedding a new light on institutional processes. The concept of “social order” which did not exist before 2009 helps now to better specify the institutional game at work in many mineral-exporting countries.",2

The western half of New Guinea now comprises the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua.Footnote 2 The international border runs north-south through some of the most inhospitable terrain in the world, with rainfall often exceeding 10 m per year. There are significant porphyry copper-gold deposits in the mountains on both sides of the border, in areas near the collision zone of the Indo-Australasian tectonic plate with the Pacific plate. These mineral deposits, at Ok Tedi, at nearby Frieda River, and at Ertsberg on the Indonesian side of the island, are among the youngest in the world, with the volcanic and hydrothermal intrusions that generated the mineralization dating back only 1.2 million years. In geological time, that is the blink of an eye. When our hominid ancestors were already spreading out across Africa, these mountains and mines were still being formed. Exploration began at the Ok Tedi site in 1969, under a license granted by the Australian colonial authorities to the US company Kennecott Copper, Inc. (itself since acquired by Standard Oil of Ohio in 1981, by British Petroleum in 1987 and, finally, by mining giant RTZ in 1989). As it happens, RTZ, through its Australian subsidiary CRA, was also the developer of the Panguna mine in Bougainville.Footnote 3 By 1972, Kennecott had established sufficient ore reserves to justify mine development and began formulating proposals to present to the colonial authorities, who at that point still made all important decisions on behalf of their colony. But the political winds changed direction in 1972. Instead of the compliant, cap-in-hand local House of Assembly (Parliament) that the Australians had expected to be elected in that year’s voting, the electorate returned a much younger, more nationalist, and more aggressive government, headed by Chief Minister Michael Somare and with Paul Lapun, from the very district in Bougainville already seeing the effects of the Panguna mine, as Minister for Mines and Energy. Together with the election of a Labor government in Australia the following year, the new political order in PNG pushed up the timetable for internal self-government, which was achieved in 1973, and for complete independence, which came about in 1975. As early as the first sitting of the newly elected House of Assembly in July, 1972, questions began to be raised about the colonial agreement that had allowed the Panguna mine to go forward and about the policies to be adopted in respect of other potential mining projects.Footnote 4
 The first priority for the new government was the renegotiation of the agreement for the Panguna mine, which had begun production in 1972, earned over AUS$150 million in 1973 and, under the terms of the colonial-era agreement, would have paid no taxes at all for at least 6 years. Toward that end, the three principal expatriates involved with the issue—myself in the Chief Minister’s office and the Ministry for Mines and Energy, Canadian David Beatty in the Central Planning Office, and Australian Ross Garnaut (briefly in Finance but based in PNG at the Australian National University’s PNG Research Unit)—arranged for a wide array of consultants to give the new government some perspective on the issues and options available. Among those who traveled to Papua New Guinea in 1973–74 to offer advice were as follows: Michael Faber and colleagues from the University of East Anglia’s Overseas Development Group; Roland Brown, Gordon Goundrey, and Sumer Lallah from the Commonwealth Secretariat; Marian Radetzki from CIPEC; Economist Antony Clunies-Ross of the University of Papua New Guinea; Professor Louis Wells of the Harvard Business School; Charles Lipton, a consultant to the United Nations Division of Natural Resources; Professor Ray Mikesell of the University of Oregon; and Hugo Perez-Maldonado and colleagues from the Peruvian Ministry of Mines.Footnote 5
 Probably no developing-country government in history has received as wide a range of information and advice on natural resource issues as did Papua New Guinea in that period. Our consultants ranged from avowedly socialist to firmly free-market capitalist, with many variations in between. Their advice ranged from complete nationalization of the mining sector to a hands-off approach that would have left mining operations entirely in the hands of multinational companies. Armed with this information and institutional support, we proceeded apace. By mid-1974, we had successfully renegotiated the Bougainville Copper Agreement, ending the tax holiday and imposing perhaps the most sophisticated tax structure in the world.Footnote 6 In that same year, recognizing the volatility of revenue, income, and taxes from mining projects, the government established a Mineral Resources Stabilization Fund, designed to smooth out tax and dividend flows from the mining sector to the national budget. With the Bougainville renegotiation in place, and with our understanding of the issues involved increased a hundred-fold, largely thanks to our bevy of consultants, we then turned to the next big thing, creating a framework for development of the Ok Tedi deposit.",5

Davis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Do economies willing and able to exploit significant natural resource endowments suffer shrinking traditional sector output? If so, does this in turn have negative long-run consequences for growth and welfare? Often conflated with the broader miseries associated with the resource curse, the Dutch disease (DD) specifically refers to the shrinking of traditional export industries as a result of a “boom” in the extractive sector (Davis 1995). In the traditional model, a disease occurs because the shrinking sectors exhibit positive externalities, while the booming sector does not. Lost production in a sector with positive externalities permanently lowers the long-run path for income, resulting in lost present-value welfare when the short-run gains from the boom are insufficient to overcome the long-run losses. A consensus in economic and policymaking communities is that the DD is evident in resource economies. For example, the DD, combined with lost positive externalities in manufacturing, has been taken up as one of the main culprits leading to the slower growth associated with the resource curse.Footnote 1 Recent worries about the de-industrialization associated with resource booms have arisen in resource-rich developing countries like Mongolia (Jacob 2013), where traditional manufacturing and agriculture are shrinking, and in developed countries like Canada, where politicians blame lost manufacturing jobs on a booming and unregulated oil industry (Gollom 2012; Howlett and Walton 2012). Marian Radetzki, a long-time student of the development challenges in mineral economies, astutely differentiates between the DD and the resource curse. In his books on global commodity markets, Radetzki focusses on the problems of extractive monoeconomies, whose booms “end with a bang” (Radetzki 1990, 2008; Radetzki and Wårell 2016). Painful adjustments attributable to the loss of fiscal and export revenue ensue. According to Radetzki, the DD, via its shrinking tradeable sector, accentuates the concentration of economic activity around resource extraction, making matters worse. This, of course, is a different take on the effects of resource booms. Rather than focus on the impacts of lost externalities on long-run growth, Radetzki focusses on the export and fiscal revenue instability associated with more concentrated domestic production. This is a valid concern, but is not what the traditional DD models emphasize. There have been many reviews of the resource curse literature, but to our knowledge none of the DD literature. This paper conducts such a review. As part of our review, we will comment on whether or not traditional export sectors do shrink during a boom, addressing in part Radetzki’s worries about increasing economic concentration in resource-rich economies. While the DD has come to be treated as a fait accompli in booming resource economies, our review reveals that the evidence is not so clear. The traditional theoretical models plausibly and intuitively anticipate negative macroeconomic consequences of resource booms in selected circumstances. At the same time, underemphasized extensions of the models’ core assumptions emphasize that adverse economic outcomes are by no means inevitable. A number of recent papers challenge even the most basic sectoral predictions of the seminal models. There is also scant empirical evidence of shrinking non-extractive sectors in booming mineral economies, let alone that these shrinking sectors have positive externalities, the second but crucial ingredient for the DD to manifest as a disease. In our view, all of this calls into question the stylized wisdom of an inextricable link between extractive activities and the DD. More importantly, it calls into question policy aimed at directing economic activity in booming resource economies to avoid the predicted macroeconomic adjustments. In this sense, the DD is what Manski (2011) calls a conventional certitude that is likely to misinform policy. Radetzki was always skeptical of government actions to control the DD effects of a resource boom; “The temptations and potential benefits of a resource boom are simply too valuable to be missed” (2016, p. 269). He will be relieved to learn that there is no compelling evidence that such efforts are necessary in the first place. This is not to say that a resource curse does not exist, or that monoeconomies do not have special development challenges. It does say that the DD is not necessarily complicit in creating monoeconomies by shrinking the traditional sectors during a resource boom. Our paper commences with a review of the seminal models of resource economies and how a booming resource sector may lead to DD. We then synthesize via a “layered” analysis (Manski 2011) the model extensions that demonstrate the anticipated sectoral shrinkages are not axiomatic.Footnote 2 The paper concludes by examining empirical work regarding the presence or absence of DD in booming resource economies.",9
31,1,Mineral Economics,17 August 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-017-0113-z,Intensity of use reexamined,May 2018,Phillip Crowson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The intensity of use hypothesisFootnote 1 states that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the amount of a material used per unit of output, or its intensity of use, and the level of economic development, as reflected in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The existence of such a relationship was first suggested by Wilfred Malenbaum in the context of steel demand.Footnote 2 “At the early stages of economic growth when per capita income levels are low, material requirements are also low, for such economies are based largely on unmechanized agriculture. As industrialization occurs, manufacturing, construction, and other material-intensive activities expand. As development continues, however, the need for houses, factories, roads, automobiles, and machinery gradually is satisfied, and consumer demand increasingly shifts toward services. The service sector, it is argued, is less material-intensive than the manufacturing and construction sectors, so this shift in consumer demand leads first to a slowing and eventually to a reversal in the upward rise in intensity of metal use as per capita income advances.”Footnote 3
 The hypothesis is widely used both as an explanation of trends in materials consumption over time and as a predictive tool. It has been tested on a range of metals over different time periods with a variety of statistical techniques. Nearly all these published studies look at trends in the intensity of first use of individual metals in a variety of developed countries from the 1970s onwards.Footnote 4 It would be invidious to single out any one study, but this paper argues that the underlying foundations of data on which most are based are inherently weak. This paper is not concerned with elaborating the underlying theory, nor in developing appropriate statistical tests. No matter how statistically significant relationships may appear, their economic significance may be poor. They cover too short a time span, ignore important structural changes in trading relationships of recent decades and first use may be a poor guide to true usage within an economy for a variety of reasons. The paper starts off by setting the scene in showing long-term trends in the intensity of first use of aluminium, copper and crude steel for selected countries over a much longer time period than other studies have used. It then makes cross-sectional comparisons across countries for finished steel and cement before going on to examine the various weaknesses in the generally used data for metals usage, with reference to aluminium, copper and steel. It then looks at some of the factors that may complicate any simple relationship between usage of materials per unit of GDP and per capita incomes, as reflected in GDP per head. The broad conclusion is that, with the present limitations of data, the explanatory power of the intensity of use hypothesis is limited and that it cannot be a reliable tool for forecasting. The paper concludes with some suggestions for further research to improve the basic data and to elaborate the simple hypothesis.",13

Tilton,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"For many years, I have been struck by the fact that the general public, and even many economists and public policy analysts, believe that the large producers of mineral commodities—firms like Freeport McMoRan and Codelco in copper, Alcoa and Rio Tinto (Alcan) in bauxite, Norilsk Nickel and Glencore in nickel, and Vale and BHP in iron ore—possess market power and use it to earn excess or monopoly profits. Yet, in many conversations with in-house economists and other senior officials of mining companies, I have never encountered an awareness or recognition on their part that they possess market power. To the contrary, they invariably believe that their markets are quite competitive requiring vigilance to keep costs down so that given the prevailing market price, they can remain profitable. Of course, this could simply reflect a reluctance to share with an outsider the existence and extent of their market power given the public relations and legal implications. Still, while the profitability of the mining sector fluctuates greatly over the business cycle, over the longer run, there is little evidence, at least among the major producing firms, that they are exceptionally profitable. This is particularly the case once the relatively high risk associated with developing and exploiting mineral wealth is taken into account. Nor have efforts on the part of producing firms and countries to raise prices and extract extra revenues through cartels and other means been particularly successful with the debatable exception of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and perhaps the De Beers diamond cartel. This article attempts to explain these conflicting perspectives. It argues that there are two necessary conditions for a firm to possess market power. First, it must possess a sufficient share of the market to raise the market price above its competitive equilibrium by restricting its output. Second, it must have the incentive to do so. While the first of these conditions is widely recognized, the second is much less so, which may explain the differences in perspectives.",6
31,1,Mineral Economics,14 February 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-018-0141-3,Misinvoicing in mineral trade: what do we really know?,May 2018,Olle Östensson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Misinvoicing, where the value of goods is declared as lower or higher than the normal or market value, may be a very important problem in world trade: It is often argued that it is one of the major means whereby illicit capital flows aiming to avoid taxes and trade duties occur. It is important to note that the estimates of trade misinvoicing reported in studies do not represent actual losses to the economies concerned. The losses, in the form of forgone tariffs or taxes, are smaller than the gross value of the flows, although in some cases they could be large relative to the size of the economy concerned. In countries with strict capital controls, illicit flows can be associated with evading capital controls. As argued by Forstater (2016), “This can be motivated by concern about financial instability or predatory government or by a desire to access international investment and consumption. This should not be conflated with theft of public money or loss of investment funds. However, it might be argued that it reduces the stake of elites in ensuring property rights and development at home.” Other effects, such as the impact of capital flows on the exchange rate, should of course also be taken into account and may be of considerable importance at certain points in time. Estimates of illicit capital flows have traditionally used a residual method, where the net of capital flows into and out of a country is compared to the change in the value of total assets. Apart from statistical and other errors, a mismatch between the two may indicate that capital flows have not been declared. A number of studies have attempted to estimate the extent of the problem, often finding that it is of impressive size, justifying assertive measures to control and reduce it. In recent years, attempts have been made to estimate the magnitude of misinvoicing of trade as an additional vehicle for illicit capital flows. Some studies have found that such practices result in massive illicit capital flows.Footnote 1 Moreover, some studies have attempted to demonstrate that trade in natural resources is a particularly important element of the overall phenomenon. In the following, a few of the studies on trade misinvoicing, including two that present significant results for international trade in minerals, are reviewed in order to assess whether their results are sufficiently reliable to be used as a basis for public policy, at the national or intergovernmental level.",3

Gilbert,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"I will not offend anyone in describing Marian Radetzki as the foremost European mineral economist of his generation. Marian is also an eclectic general economist. His cv lists 27 books and 81 articles in academic journals. Four of his books are on metals, five on energy, four on commodities in general, five on environmental economics, and the remaining nine on more general issues in economics. His most recent book (Radetzki and Wårell 2017) was published when he had already passed his eightieth birthday. As a specialist, Marian is an expert in the fields in which he has worked. As a generalist, he brings a wider perspective to his specialized work. The specific issue I examine in this paper is the role of index investment in the determination of commodity futures prices. A more general issue underlies this question: Are commodity prices driven by market fundamentals or by sentiment? Academic discussions almost invariably suppose fundamentals to be dominant but this may, in part, be because investor sentiment cannot be directly observed. Keynes (1936, chapter 12) famously regarded “the state of long term expectation” as important in business investment decisions and argued that this “does not solely depend … on the most probable forecast we can make … [but] also … on the confidence with which we make this forecast”. No informed commentator would ever suppose that supply, and demand fundamentals are irrelevant in the determination of commodity futures prices, but it is unwise to suppose that sentimental and psychological factors never intrude. I explore these issues in relation to the recent commodity price boom that started in 2004 and picked up strength until the start of the financial crisis in the second half of 2008. Despite generally weak prices in 2009, there was a recovery in 2010. The final dramatic collapse of oil and metals prices took place at the start of 2015. Marian provided the earliest discussion of this boom, still then under way, in an academic journal (Radetzki 2006). Carter et al. (2011) discuss the genesis of commodity booms. Powell (2015) provides a brief survey of this literature. Erten and Ocampo (2013) seek to identify super cycles using an extended sample based on the Grilli and Yang (1988) data. One of the features of the recent commodity boom, and perhaps of commodity booms more generally, is the increased comovement of prices. This might be explained by market fundamentals if there were an increase in the cross-commodity correlation of production or consumption shocks. Alternatively, increased comovement might arise if investors come to think in terms of the “commodity asset class” rather considering the prospects for each commodity individually. Scherer and He (2008, p. 243) provide a useful characterization of an asset class as a “group of assets that investors regard as homogeneous enough (high internal correlation) as well as unique enough (low external correlation) to consider separate strategic allocations worthwhile.” This is equivalent to stating that the class is associated with a risk premium that cannot be usefully explained by the risk premiums on other asset classes. They remark that, as part of the process commodity market financialization, investors came to view commodities as an asset class comparable to equities and bonds (ibid, page 261).Footnote 1 I look at the evidence on comovement in the “Comovement” section of this paper. The Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2006) paper was particularly influential in persuading at least some investors to regard commodity futures as a well-defined and attractive asset class which could rival bonds as an instrument for diversifying an equity-based portfolio. Commodity future markets have always attracted a large volume of non-commercial or speculative funds but historically, speculators typically took positions, either long or short, for relatively brief periods of time in specific future contracts. By contrast, investors in the supposed commodity asset class hold positions which are almost invariably long in a basket of front or nearby commodity future contracts which they roll as the contacts approach expiry. Many of these commodity baskets replicate or approximate holdings in one of the two major indices, the S&P GSCI and the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index, or their sub-indices.Footnote 2 Investors who set out to track these indices (henceforth index investors) typically do so through fixed-for-floating swaps with the floating return defined in terms of one of the two major indices, consistent with the belief that commodities comprise a distinct asset class. Publicly available data on index investment positions only became available from 2006 in the form of the CFTC’s Supplementary Commitments of Traders (SCOT) data on index positions in US agricultural futures markets. I discuss these data in the “Index position data” section. By the time these data became available, index investment positions were already large. Gilbert and Pfuderer (2014b, page 129) report that in June 2006, index positions amounted to 27% of the long corn position, 39% of the long wheat position and 28% of the long soybean position on the CBOT (now CME) markets. Masters and White (2008) asserted “Index Speculators … are now the single most dominant force in the commodities futures markets. And most importantly, their buying and trading has nothing to do with the supply and demand fundamentals of any single commodity. They pour money into commodities futures to diversify their portfolios, hedge against inflation or bet against the dollar”. In his Senate sub-committee testimony, Masters stated that passive investors were driving up crude oil and other futures prices. This claim has become referred to as the Masters Hypothesis. He went on to state that index investors “eat” rather than provide liquidity (Masters 2008). Since that time, a large literature has grown up examining this claim. The literature relies almost exclusively on the Granger causality test methodology which I discuss in the “Granger-causality tests of index investment impacts” section. The academic consensus is that Masters was wrong—despite the size of index positions, they do not impact prices. Radetzki and Wårell (2017, page 155) concur with this view. This makes sense in terms of the market fundamentals view of commodity price formation. Index investors are passive (they do not actively move in or out of their investments) and, since they are investing in a broad portfolio of commodity futures, their decisions do not convey information on the prospects for any particular commodity.Footnote 3 I review this literature in the “Granger-causality tests of index investment impacts” section. The econometric analysis in the academic literature relies on the CFTC’s SCOT data, and it is these data that I use in this paper. They only cover index positions in US agricultural futures. Because of the absence of satisfactory data on index positions in non-agricultural markets, relatively few studies have attempted to examine the impact of index investment in these markets. Exceptions are Gilbert (2010b), Singleton (2014), and Hamilton and Wu (2015). Agricultural commodities form a relatively small component of the major indices tracked by most index investors. Energy commodities are more important and metals also take a substantial share of the invested funds. In the “Granger causality test results” section, I argue that although the academic consensus on the impact of index investment on agricultural prices is largely correct, there is strong evidence that index positions are associated with changes in the prices of energy and non-ferrous metals prices. This indicates that the academic consensus is in need of revision at least once we extend outside the agricultural context. In view of the absence of reliable data on index investment in non-agricultural markets, the results I discuss in the “Granger causality test results” section are based on an aggregate of agricultural index positions that I view as proxying total index investment. The construction of this aggregate is discussed in the “Granger causality tests of index investment impacts” section. Gilbert (2010a, b) and Singleton (2014) used similar procedures. It is difficult to reconcile the association of changes in this proxy and changes in energy and metals prices with information theory. An investor with specific information relevant to crude oil prices would do better to take positions in the WTI and Brent crude markets than to dilute leverage by taking index positions. This opens the door to explanations based on market sentiment. In asset pricing theory, changes in sentiment can either be rationalized as fads or as changes in investors’ subjective risk premia. Fads are a type of herding behavior and may give rise to price bubbles. They are necessarily ephemeral. I do not dispute the Etienne et al. (2014) finding that commodity futures markets exhibit short term froth. In “The size and persistence of index investment impacts” section, I show that the price impacts associated with change in index investment are permanent in the sense that there is no tendency for them to be reversed over time. Changes in investor risk premia therefore appear a more promising avenue. Singleton (2014) notes that in practice there is disagreement among investors on asset values even given common information. He discusses an alternative “differences of opinion” approach in which investors use their own fundamental or other models for asset valuation. In this approach, asset prices are a wealth-weighted average of investor valuations. Changes in risk premia unrelated to information arrival can lead to changes in these weighted average valuations and hence also of asset prices even in the absence of the new information. Consistently with this approach, a change in risk premia which makes commodity investments more attractive may manifest itself both in a higher level of index investment and in a change in the wealth-weighted value of commodity futures contracts. The “Synthesis” section offers a synthesis of these results, and the “Conclusions” section concludes. The test results suggest is that a change in market sentiment resulted in a group of investors taking a more positive view of the commodity sector, perhaps seen as defining a commodity asset class, with consequential effects on both the level of index investment and commodity prices, particularly energy and metals prices. I suggest that this change in sentiment may have been driven by perceptions of likely growth in Chinese import demand and that index investment was one of the channels through which these changes in sentiment impacted the level and comovement of commodity prices. The role of index investment in the recent commodity boom may appear narrow, but it raises much more general issues of how commodity markets function. Most of the academic literature is econometric and, for reasons of data availability, has focused on agricultural markets. Less has been written on the energy and metal markets on which Marian is expert. In writing this paper, I attempt to redress this balance and also to bring the more general perspective which is the hallmark of Marian’s work.",1

In addition, as Newbery (1984) has pointed out, the mineral industries typically consist of a few large firms (or strategic firms), and a large number of small and non-influential firms (at least regarding price formation), which are often described in economics as the competitive fringe. Montero and Guzmán (2010) have examined cooperationFootnote 1 among large producers in the context of a competitive fringe, where each firm chooses its production level and where prices clear in the market (e.g., in a metal exchange). They show that in a dynamic context, the best strategy for a cartel, in order to increase member profits, is to cutback production in recessions and expand output (beyond the expansion that would have taken place if there had not been cooperation) during booms. While the former strategy (restricting production during recession) is well understood, the latter is not. As Montero and Guzmán (2010) explain, there are two strategic effects that cartel members should consider. These are referred to as the static and dynamic effects. The static effect pushes cartel production downward, independent of the business cycle, in order to increase prices and raise profits. In fact, this is the standard strategy that traditional cartel theory considers. On the other hand, the dynamic effect appears because large firms can use history-dependent strategies to credibly build commitment over the fringe in order to increase the market share of the cartel. Since the dynamic effect increases production, prices fall.Footnote 2
 The strategy finally followed by the cartel will depend on the importance of the dynamic effect, which is associated with the responsiveness (real or potential) that the fringe firms have in the market. So, where the fringe has a small market share and its possible expansion is restricted by other considerations than price (e.g., geological constraints), the dynamic effect is weak, and therefore, no output expansion will take place. This seems to be the case for certain minerals, like the platinum-group metals, because the fringe (if we assume cooperation only among the four large firms in the market) has a market share of less than 15%, and undeveloped deposits controlled by the fringe do not present a real threat (Klass et al. 1980; Ericsson and Tegen 2016).Footnote 3
 The intuition behind the output-expansion result is that, in periods of booms, profits of the cartel members may increase if they are able to coordinate (explicitly or tacitly) in order to increase their production so as to limit the competitive fringe’s expansion and entry. Although this additional production makes the price fall even lower than what would be observed under non-cooperative circumstances, the increase in output and consequent limit in the expansion of the competitive fringe (and therefore of higher production cost firms) largely compensates cartel members for the fall in prices. Then, quantity competition and the size of the fringe (actual and potential) are fundamental to justify the output-expansion strategy of a cartel in booms, because in the presence of a small or inflexible fringe, the strategy of any cartel should be to diminish its output, as traditional theory anticipates.Footnote 4
 Given the Montero and Guzmán results, cooperation among the largest firms may produce considerable price stabilization with little effect on the secular level of prices. Based on Montero and Guzmán’s results, a trigger price
Footnote 5 mechanism can be established. The idea behind the trigger price mechanism is to fix a price (which is determined endogenously by the maximization of cartel profits) where—with respect to non-cooperative production—the strategy followed by collaborative firms is to decrease output when price is lower than the trigger price and to increase output when the price is above it. Cooperative production at the trigger price level is equal to the production under a non-cooperative regime.Footnote 6
 In this way, cooperation using trigger prices could be more successful than the previous price stabilizing mechanisms as the former rests on the individual rational behavior of each firm within the cooperative group. Moreover, the trigger price mechanism here discussed does not present a serious problem of conflict of interests, provided that large firms have similar targets (a reasonable assumption in many mineral markets). Nevertheless, the determination of the trigger price is a possible point of conflict. Although it does make sense that larger producers usually have similar perceptions of the appropriate trigger price, it is relatively easy to imagine situations where this is not the case.Footnote 7
 Interestingly, there is evidence of cartels that have used a trigger price mechanism in order to regulate cooperation among members (well-known examples include oil and zinc). However, typically, the trigger price has been used as a cooperative tool only in downturns. In this way, when the price goes below the trigger price (i.e., downturns), members of the agreement cutback their production cooperatively in order to brake the fall in prices. On the other hand, when price goes above the trigger price (i.e., upturns), firms return to their non-cooperative behavior. No direct evidence has been found in order to show that some cartels have used trigger prices to change their behavior to output-expanding, beyond the expansions that would occur in a non-cooperative scenario.Footnote 8
 Nevertheless, as Montero and Guzmán (2010) posit, there is some evidence to assume that this output expansion behavior has occurred at least one time in the copper market. Specifically, they referred to the International Copper Cartel (ICC henceforth), which existed for 4 years just before World War II. The main avowed objective of the cartel was to adjust production of its members to meet consumption requirements. To implement this, the ICC established a pivotal or trigger price. In this way, for prices lower than the last price, production cutbacks (through quotas) took place. On the other hand, all quotas were released when prices were higher than the trigger price established by members. Herfindahl (1959) claimed that the ICC only cooperated during recessions, and not at booms. In this case, the cartel would have led to higher prices (with respect to the non-cooperative scenario) during recessions, but not to lower prices during booms. Montero and Guzmán (2010), however, challenge this conclusion. They argue that an important strategic incentive to cooperate (increasing output) in booms existed and that, even without a quota scheme, the ICC increased its output beyond what competition would have produced. In fact, the main reason of the imposition of a trigger price for the ICC in upturns, they contend, was precisely to discourage additions to capacity outside the cartel during prosperous times (TNEC Hearings 1941). In this paper, a formal test for Montero and Guzmán’s hypothesis on ICC cooperative behavior during booms is developed. To test this hypothesis, the price elasticity of supply for a cartel with a competitive fringe is derived for both non-cooperative and cooperative behavior. For non-cooperative behavior, it is shown that the price elasticity of supply is unambiguously a decreasing function of either price or quantity. With cooperation, however, it can be decreasing or increasing. The latter occurs precisely because the fringe introduces a change in the cartel behavior, as Montero and Guzmán have pointed out. An econometric model is developed in this paper to measure the ICC’s price elasticity of supply. It is shown that the ICC’s price elasticity of supply is lower throughout recessions than during booms. These findings provide strong empirical support for the Montero and Guzmán (2010) thesis that the ICC members cooperated at booms as well as recessions. Hence, the ICC appears to have acted as a price stabilizer, increasing the copper price in recessions and decreasing it in booms with respect to the competitive case. Although this result opens the possibility that this cartel may have enhanced social welfare (i.e., the sum of consumer and producer surplus), whether or not this was the case remains for further research. Behavior of the International Copper Cartel is of interest today, given the great resemblances in the modus operandi between this cartel and OPEC, a similarity first noted by Atchade and Thoms (2006). A better understanding of ICC would allow us not only to establish the causes of the failure of OPEC’s price band, but also to provide a framework to study the conditions of its success. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In “Cartel’s price elasticity of supply in the presence of a competitive fringe” Section, the price elasticities of supply for the cartel members in the presence of a competitive fringe, for both the cooperative and non-cooperative scenario, are derived. “The International Copper Cartel, 1935–1939” Section describes the main characteristics of the International Copper Cartel. It also develops models based on these facts. “Data” Section explains the data. “Results” Section reviews the results and assesses the likelihood of both hypotheses (cooperative and non-cooperative behavior during booms). Concluding remarks follows.",2

First, it occurred in the newly born centrally planned economy (CPE), created with the Russian Revolution in 1917, whose influence did not take long reaching the shores of Latin America. In the 1920s, communist parties were created in most Latin American countries and the idea of State ownership of the means of production installed itself in the social debate (Hobsbawm 1987). During the early twentieth century in Europe, however, causes different from ideological motivations lead many countries to nationalize different industries, according to Bel (2010), and it would seem that economic disruptions created by the Great Depression may have been the most important one. For instance, the Weimar Republic partially or totally took over several mining companies in the early 1930s and these companies were later privatized by the Nazi regime during the late 1930s (Bel 2010). The new constitution created at the birth of the Republic of Indonesia in 1945 established that natural wealth belonged to the State. Three State mining companies for tin, coal, and other minerals were created from nationalized Dutch firms (Wiriosudarmo 1988). The fate of each of these companies was diverse in the second half of the twentieth century. For instance, tin was crucial for providing dollars to the economy until the 1970s when oil begun to be produced and dominated the national economy. The 1985 tin crisis, when the market collapsed due to high prices established by the International Tin Council, threw this industry into disarray globally (Strauss 1986, Trouble in third kingdom, Mining Journal Books Ltd., London, UK). Because of its social and economic role since colonial times, tin remained important in the country but its economic clout was lost. In 1946, the UK passed the Coal Industry Nationalization Act and France created the State Company Charbonnages. These companies were privatized many decades later. Nationalization occurred in Poland and in other Central European States occupied by the USSR in its final push against the German army, at the end of the Second World War. Then came the revolution in China in 1949. Tin and silver mines in Bolivia, on which this country’s economy depended, were nationalized in 1952 (Contreras 1993) by President Paz Estenssoro, after intense pressure of left labor leaders (Nash 1972). The Mining Corporation of Bolivia (Comibol) was created to manage these mines. However, the hopes for the contribution of these mines to the development of the country were “completely shattered” in the following 15 years, due to political instability in the country (Nash 1972). The Cuban Revolution in 1959 helped spread ideas of state ownership in Latin America. Chile, Peru, and Zambia were keys to the global political movement to nationalize copper mineral resources in the second half of the twentieth century (Radetzky and Warrel 2017). Mexico had begun its way to national rather than state ownership, passing a law in 1961 which gave incentives to companies that had 51% shares by Mexican citizens (Navin 1978). In Peru, Chile, and Zambia, nationalization has its differences but it all happened from 1965 to 1975. The main cause for the rush to nationalize mining companies in developing countries in the second half of the twentieth century was the belief that national development would be accelerated with State enterprises controlling the production and commercialization of minerals and metals (Radetzky and Warrel 2017). But, this was not the only reason. There were at least three complementary causes. First, the notion that mineral wealth was a national patrimony. Second, the size of the mining industry in many developing countries was too important economically and could not be left to be managed by foreign companies. And third, the long-term operation of most mines meant that capital was unmovable and captive, and therefore it was prey to the intervention of states (Radetzky and Warrel 2017). At the beginning of the 1960s, only 2.5% of global copper mine production was owned by the State in CPEs, whereas 15 years later, this value had increased to more than 40% (Prain 1975). This participation reached a maximum of 58.7% in 1984, including 23.5% share of CPE. However, by 2000, the total share had diminished to 27.7%, and in 2009, it reached 25% (Radetzky and Warrel 2017). After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, copper production in CPE dropped to 6.8% (Radetzky and Warrel 2017). During the 1950s, many Latin Americans thought that their country depended too much on the exports of raw materials (Moran 1974). It was the time of the utopia of industrialization as the way to raise salaries, stabilize the economy, and advance towards a more equalitarian society. The theory of dependence introduced in 1950 by Raul Prebisch, Director of the Economic Commission for Latin America, Eclac, and independently by Hans Singer, a German economist working for the United Nations, proposed that the terms of trade reflected the ratio of the prices for its exports to the prices of its imports (Eclac 1950; Prebisch 1963; Tilton and Guzmán 2016). Their main hypothesis was that the prices of mineral commodities exported by developed countries had been declining vis-a-vis the price of manufactured goods imported by them. Consequently, prices for exporting minerals were in detriment of national economies because it established a negative exchange trade trend for the countries. Manufacturing would not suffer from this malaise and therefore was promoted and subsidized in the Latin American countries. It was the time of high import tariffs that protected national industries (Contreras and Zuloaga 2014; Peru Top 2013; Muñoz 1972). Therefore, not only was necessary for underdeveloped countries to take control of mining industries and capture the full extent of its rents, but also this should be accompanied by industrialization. These two actions would have a durable impact on the dependence of the countries. Much later, it was shown that the price of mineral commodities had not been decaying in the long run, measured in periods of 50 to 100 years. In specific periods, for instance between 1970 and 2003, mineral commodity price fell, but between 1945 and 1970, it had been the opposite. Overall, in the long run, it makes sense that the price would remain constant unless there were structural factors which would alter this balance (Hadass and Williamson 2002; Cuddington et al. 2007; Frankel 2010; Van der Ploeg 2011). The objective of this article, nevertheless, is not to discuss the theory of dependence or the theory of weakening trade factors, but to discuss key differences in Peru and Chile’s mining nationalization and privatization processes since the 1960s. The paper focuses its discussion on the nationalization push of the 1960s and 1970s in these countries, its successes and failures, and on the extinction of the state mining sector in Peru, excluding oil, as well as the coexistence of a state sector and a private sector in Chile. As will be analyzed, the roots of success or failure of nationalization processes in Chile and Peru had little relation with its causes. A hypothesis of this paper is that success or failure in the mining nationalization process determined the attitudes of Peruvians and Chileans towards the role of the State in mining, and therefore mining policies in each country would account for this difference at present. This historic perspective may help illuminate future paths for mining development in each country and, also, cooperation between the two countries. The opportunities to cooperate rather than compete or even confront each other are unlimited. The “Mining in Peru and Chile” section of this paper discusses general aspects of mining in Peru and in Chile. The “Nationalization and privatization in Peru” section is about the nationalization and privatization in Peru. The “Nationalization and coexistence with private enterprises in Chile” section is about nationalization and coexistence with private enterprises in Chile, and the “Discussion and concluding remarks” section contains a discussion and concluding remarks.",6

For Australia, however, the normal pattern has been disrupted periodically by major fluctuations in its international terms of trade (Fig. 1) and by spurts of discoveries of large reserves of minerals and energy raw materials (Blainey 2003). Thus, its long-run sectoral trends have been shocked numerous times. The sectoral structure of the Australian economy also had been affected by a long-standing policy of protection from import competition, particularly for manufactures (Anderson and Garnaut 1987; Lloyd and MacLaren 2015; Lloyd 2017). One result of high levels of protection until the 1980s was to reduce the share of GDP traded internationally and the range of products traded, which in turn amplified fluctuations in Australia’s terms of trade. Trade liberalizations and the move to a floating exchange rate system in the mid-1980s have allowed much smoother adjustments to shifting terms of trade within and between sectors of the economy over the past three decades. International terms of trade, Australia, 1871 to 2015 (1967 = 100). Source: Gillitzer and Kearns (2005), updated for 2005–15 from ABS Cat No 5206.0, Table 34 More specifically, a boom in one sector of the economy typically raises national income, but not everybody is certain to gain.Footnote 1 This is true regardless of whether the boom and associated currency strengthening is demand driven, by terms of trade improvement, or supply driven by, for example, a new discovery of minerals. Either way, the real exchange rate appreciation resulting from a boom in one sector makes it more difficult for sectors producing other tradable goods and services to compete in domestic and foreign markets, while producers of non-tradables enjoy a growth in demand for their products. In the absence of strong redistributional policies, there are likely to be both gainers and losers when one sector of the economy booms. Conversely, a slump in international prices of a major export sector’s outputs or the exhaustion of a natural resource lowers national income and hence the demand for non-tradables but may cause a real exchange rate depreciation sufficient to benefit producers of some other tradables. This paper sheds light on the extent to which Australia’s agricultural, mining, manufacturing, and service sectors have altered their contributions to GDP, employment, and exports in the course of Australia’s economic growth over the past two centuries, with a particular focus on periods of mining booms and slumps.Footnote 2 It begins by reviewing the branch of international trade theory that deals with sectoral comparative advantage changes in growing economies that are resource-rich and subject to occasional mining booms. It then examines the extent to which data on Australia’s sectoral trends and fluctuations are consistent with the theory of comparative advantage for countries with trade-restrictive policies. The data reveal a number of unusual patterns in the sectoral composition of Australia’s economy. Understanding these patterns requires some Australian policy and institutional background, in addition to the variables suggested by standard trade theory such as trade costs, relative factor endowments, and international terms of trade. The paper concludes by drawing out implications for future policies.",2

This is an increase in real value by more than 500% compared to 1980. The production, consumption, and trade patterns of iron ore have also changed over the last decades. Since 1980, the focus of trade has shifted from Europe and North America markets towards Asian and South American markets. But even within these markets, there have been major changes. For instance, China has replaced Japan as the major importer of iron ore in Asia while Brazil has replaced Canada as a major exporter. In addition, most European countries have experienced reduced shares of the trade value. These insights give raise to several interesting and important research questions. What have been the main drivers behind the changes in trade patterns? How will the future trade pattern change? Which countries will be the relative winners of these changes? What is the trade potential in iron ore? The objective of this paper is to apply a trade gravity model on the global iron ore trade in order to project and assess future trade patterns and trade potentials for iron ore. The trade gravity model is commonly used to evaluate and predict trade patterns. The model has been applied in numerous specifications and contexts and it has been argued that the gravity model is the leading empirical model in economics regarding international trade flow (Anderson 2011). The basic trade gravity equation states that the trade flow between countries depends primarily on the size of the economy of the two countries, the distance between them. It has been applied to macroeconomic issues dealing with aggregate trade flows and, e.g., the effects of currency unions (e.g., Frankel and Rose 2002; Glick and Rose 2002; Berger and Nitsch 2008). It has also been applied to disaggregated trade flows, such as agricultural commodities trade (e.g., Zahaniser et al. 2002; Peterson et al. 2013) and forest products trade (e.g., Buongiorno 2015, 2016; Olofsson et al. 2017). In addition, the gravity model has been discussed in the context of cultural factors affecting trade (e.g., Hofstede 1994; Kogut and Singh 1998) and political factors (e.g., Srivastava and Green 1986). However, despite the importance of trade for the iron ore industry and the explanatory power of the gravity model, only a few studies have been found that quantitatively analyze the effects of globally changing economic conditions using gravity equations. Robertson and Robitaille (2014) investigate the importance of geography for trade in iron ore by estimating a gravity model. They show that iron ore has high trade elasticity with respect to distance. Moreover, Babri et al. (2017) separate the trade flow of iron ore into a long-term contract bound part and into a spot market (choice theory) part, using a gravity model.",8

The main motivation of the study is to investigate which factors that can explain the iron ore price movement during a time period that is characterized by dramatic changes in the price series. Wårell (2014) performed a similar study, based on monthly data between January 2003 and September 2012. The motivation for the study was the breakdown of the producer pricing system in the end of 2008. Before that the iron ore prices were mainly characterized by an annual negotiation system, i.e., a benchmark price were negotiated annually between large producers and consumers in the two dominating regions. However, during the latest commodity boom, this pricing system broke down, and today, the pricing regime for iron ore is based on spot market prices. One of the main explanations for the breakdown of the benchmark system was the growing importance of the Chinese market, which is also evident considering that the benchmark system resulted in a FOB price, while the spot market indices are mostly based on CFR China prices.Footnote 1 The iron ore pricing system today is based on several indices, which are developed by benchmarking companies following certain systematic procedures.Footnote 2 The main reason for the difficulty to define one price for iron ore is due to its heterogeneous nature; i.e., the quality between different iron ores varies considerably and premiums for high-grade ores are still based on negotiations. In recent years, the difference in prices between different grades of ores has increased, indicating the need to clearly state which quality the price refers to Löf and Ericsson (2017). The main conclusion from the quantitative analysis in Wårell (2014) was that the change in pricing regime did not have a significant impact on the iron ore price in the econometric model. Iron ore prices, GDP growth in China and the freight rates were found to be cointegrated, and the short-run results indicated that GDP growth in China had the strongest impact on the iron ore price series between 2003 and 2012. However, as this study was performed when the most recent commodity boom was still, ongoing questions regarding the validity of these results could be made. Could it be that the results obtained in Wårell (2014) are significantly affected by the fact that they were estimated during an ongoing commodity boom? This paper will perform a similar analysis to Wårell (2014) in order to see whether the conclusions of the effect on iron ore prices still holds. The quantitative analysis of iron ore prices will thus be performed in order to investigate the most important factors influencing prices during the entire commodity boom. The most recent commodity boom, which seriously affected prices for many important primary commodities, was more persistent than commodity booms in the past. The prolonged duration of this commodity boom attracted a lot of attention and discussion regarding whether it represented a so called super cycle (Heap 2005; Cuddington and Jerrett 2008). According to this literature, a super cycle is defined as a prolonged price cycle for a broad range of primary commodities, with an upward trend for roughly 10 to 35 years, making a complete cycle last for about 20 to 70 years. It is further argued that the super cycle is demand driven, and that it will last for as long as the strong demand growth continues. The proponents of the super cycle thesis see the industrialization and urbanization of China as the main cause for the current super cycle. Other views of the prolonged duration of the most recent commodity boom are rather that an extended investment cycle has been the main driver (Radetzki et al. 2008; Radetzki 2013; Radetzki and Wårell 2017). This view argues, in line with standard microeconomic theory, that the high-commodity prices prevail until sufficient capacity to meet the accelerated growth in demand is installed. When using a simplified example of different investment cycles Radetzki et al. (2008) illustrate that a resource boom can last for 12 to 15 years, due to investment lags and persisting capacity constraints. We can conclude today, in mid-2017, that the boom is over and that the high prices lasted until about 2014, when sizable new iron ore capacity was finally brought to the market. The reduced demand growth caused by a slowdown in China’s economic expansion in recent years of course also helped to punctuate the boom. The paper proceeds as follows: the next section will present the development of the latest commodity boom, with a special focus on iron ore prices. The following section will focus on answering the question regarding if the change in pricing regime has had a significant effect on the iron ore prices when using an extended time period to incorporate the entire boom, both using tests for structural breaks and a reduced regression model. Furthermore, the analysis of iron ore prices is also extended to include breaks for the end of the commodity boom, as well as including more explanatory variables to the regression analysis. In the last section, some concluding remarks are made.",19

Aguilera,Roberto Aguilera,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Our paper proceeds as follows: this introductory section elaborates briefly on the historical energy mix and on forecasting organizations’ general expectations for the future. In the next sections, we describe the Global Energy Market model (GEM), with the ultimate objective to develop a reasonable scenario of the future energy mix. Then we address the environmental implications of our findings. The final section discusses the large uncertainties inherent to the energy market, noting that changes in policy and technology could alter outcomes significantly. Energy sources compete against one other for market share, with the winners coming out ahead due to favorable economic, technical, environmental, and geopolitical characteristics. Our work on the energy mix begins by analyzing the historical period back to 1850. At that time, following the industrial revolution, approximately 80% of the global energy needs were satisfied by wood, agricultural residues, and animal dung, with the remainder met by coal. The decades that followed saw a significant increase in coal consumption, given its energy density of over three times that of wood. The coal share reached a peak around 1912, with a contribution accounting for 70% of the total, while the market share of wood and the other solids had decreased to 22%. The oil industry was born in the late nineteenth century, and by 1920, oil had captured approximately 10% of total global energy demand. The oil share peaked in the 1970s at 50%, having never reached the heights of wood or coal. In the same decade, natural gas use was on the rise, reaching a market share of 19% in 1980. Meanwhile, coal’s share had stabilized at 26% after decades of continuous decline. The balance, some 5%, was composed mostly of hydroelectricity and nuclear energy. In 2016, the contributions of coal and natural gas were around 28 and 24%, respectively, with oil at approximately 33%, and the balance of 14% consisting of hydroelectricity, nuclear, wind, and other minor sources (BP, annual, n.d.). Energy mix projections are typically carried out annually by various public bodies and energy corporations, utilizing a variety of technical definitions, time horizons, and regional aggregations. The GEM model adds to the existing literature but employs a unique methodology (see next section). In addition, the baseline scenario generated by the GEM remains unaltered since its creation in 2007, which provides the rationale to test the scenario with data from the last 10 years. This is in contrast to the work of other organizations, who revise energy mix forecasts annually based on the latest changes in investments, policies, and other variables. It should be highlighted that while the GEM has been used previously to forecast overall energy usage, it is of equal importance to study the combination of energy sources used over the long run, given that the evolving mix remains highly uncertain and has significant implications for the future level of carbon emissions. Most analysts’ projections of the future energy mix foresee a fossil fuel convergence where oil, gas, and coal each account for similar shares in 2040 (e.g., International Energy Agency 2016; Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 2016, among several others). Thus, in these projections both coal and oil are losing ground, while gas is on the rise. In the short run, increased gas use will mostly be found in electricity generation, as there is great potential for gas to take market share from coal in that sector. In the long run, some possibilities are likely to exist in the transportation sector (where natural gas will compete with oil) and in the industrial, residential and petrochemical sectors. The rapid growth of natural gas is not surprising, since it enjoys many benefits relative to the other fossil fuels: its wide geographical distribution, its affordability and its environmental benefits—for instance, fewer emissions than coal and oil when burned. In addition, there is an abundance of natural gas resource endowments. Apart from the vast conventional gas resources of the world, there is huge potential for unconventional sources including tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane.",2

The coal was the basis for the industrial revolution in the eighteenth century. At the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, crude oil has contributed to the development of the automotive industry. Natural gas has proved to be a versatile raw material, not only in power industry, but also in the chemical industry, only after the Second World War. Nuclear power was introduced in the second half of the twentieth century. The last decade of the last century has started the process of dissemination of renewable energy. It is believed that this is the next stage in the global energy development. In the light of global climate change and the limitation of non-renewable fossil fuel resources, sustainable development has to play an increasingly important role in securing energy needs, in which the necessities of the present generation must take into account the wellbeing of future generations. The energy and climate policy gradually implemented in the European Union is focused on the issue of emission reduction from, among others, the energy sector, while the energy transformation is often implemented (e.g. in Denmark, Germany, and France) by eliminating fossil fuels in favor of the power industry based on renewable energy sources. An additional argument for the development of renewable energy, besides limiting the impact of the traditional energy sector on the environment, is that renewable sources have a local character, help to diversify energy supplies, and strengthen the energy independence of the country (IEA 2016). The concept of transformation is naturally associated with innovation and new technologies. An important element in making a change is not only the availability of technology but also the development of such an energy policy that will enable the relatively inexpensive (for the society to benefit from it) and least environmentally damaging uninterrupted energy supply (energy security). In a broader sense, energy transformation is associated with the promotion of low-carbon energy sources based on low-carbon and efficient (energy-efficient) energy production technologies. Another element of energy transformation is the development of energy-saving ideas, that is the improvement of energy efficiency in various sectors of industry and services (e.g., insulation and thermal efficiency improvement, energy-saving lighting, cogeneration—combined heat and power generation, and energy recovery in industrial processes) (Mlynarski et al. 2017). Therefore, not only the energy supply in the right quantity and quality, but also the volume of demand that can be influenced are both of great importance. The article presents the present state of the electricity sector and the hard coal mining sector in Poland. In the context of trends in the EU climate policy, the Polish energy economy, based on the generation of electricity from solid fuels, requires a deep transformation. An outline of the planned activities differs from the pathways adopted in other EU countries. This is due to the specific conditions of Poland.",33

31,1,Mineral Economics,03 January 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-017-0134-7,The Saudi 2014 gambit: a counterfactual analysis,May 2018,James M. Griffin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"On November 27, 2014, Ali Al-Naimi, the Saudi minister of petroleum, shocked the world oil market by announcing that Saudi Arabia would not cut production to prevent falling oil prices. Indeed, the Saudis embarked on an effort to regain lost market share ramping up production by 0.9 million barrels per day (MMB/D) over the subsequent six months. By February 2015, oil prices had plummeted to $30/barrel, prompting many to ask why the abrupt price decline and how long before prices would return to their previous levels. Speculation abounded as to the cause of the Saudi action. Some pointed to political reasons—the Saudis were getting even with Iran and Russia.Footnote 1 Another political explanation for the Saudi action was to curry favor with China, its primary oil customer.Footnote 2 Still, others viewed their action as a reassertion of their power within the OPEC cartel.Footnote 3 Another theory, echoed by Evans-Prichard, was that the Saudi action was a declaration of war against shale oil production.Footnote 4
 At the time, Aguilera and Radetzki’s manuscript, The Price of Oil, was delivered to Cambridge Press in early 2015; both the motive for and the permanence of the price decline were unclear. If you had been fortunate enough to have a draft of the Aguilera and Radetzki book, you would have known the answers. Rarely, does a volume have such prescience to identify in advance a “game changer.” Aguilera and Radetzki correctly put their finger on the cause—the shale revolution—and the effect—enormous unlocked reserves which they believe will impose a long-run price ceiling of $60/barrel or less. Using their knowledge of varying qualities of mineral deposits, Aguilera and Radetzki understood the importance of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and horizontal drilling technology to exploit previously uneconomic but large deposits of tight oil often located in shale formations.Footnote 5
 In view of the unprecedented increase in US oil production, the Saudi gambit was a clearly designed move to staunch the flow of high-cost shale oil. The major drawback to combining fracking with horizontal drilling is its cost. High oil prices in the $80 to $100/barrel range over the period 2009 to 2014 provided the perfect incubator for the development of the shale revolution. The Eagle Ford Shale formation provided the perfect laboratory experiment, spanning a 300+-mile stretch from College Station in central Texas to Laredo on the Mexican border. Drilling and fracturing costs were high. A 7000-ft vertical well with a 5000-ft lateral could easily cost $5.5 million in 2014. It was high cost because the discovered reserves might only be 400 thousand barrels of equivalent oil.Footnote 6 But to recover these reserves, high operating costs are also necessary to dispose of produced and flowback water. As shown subsequently, the period of high oil prices from 2009 to 2014 resulted in steeply rising production profiles from the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas and the Bakken Shale in North Dakota. After trading in the $100/barrel price range from 2011 to August 2014, oil prices had fallen below $80/barrel on the eve of the OPEC meeting on November 27, 2014. The Saudis rejected proposals by some OPEC members to cut production and thereby re-established the previous price levels. Indeed, not only did OPEC ultimately agree not to cut production, but the Saudis adopted a strategy of protecting its market share actually leading to increased production in the ensuing months. Since the Saudis decisive action, a number of critics have come to question the wisdom of that decision. Most prominently, Ambrose Evans-Prichard, writing in the Financial Times, questioned the wisdom of the Saudi gambit. In July 2016, Evans-Prichard (2016) titles his article “Texas Shale Oil has fought Saudi Arabia to a standstill.” He concludes that Twenty months after Saudi Arabia took the fateful decision to flood world markets with oil, it has still failed to break the back of the US shale industry.…North America’s hydraulic frackers are cutting costs so fast that most can now produce at prices far below levels needed to fund the Saudi welfare state and its military machine, or to cover OPEC budget deficits. Following this line of logic, one must ask the question, “Wouldn’t the Saudis have been better off producing less oil at a price of $100 per barrel than more oil at $50 per barrel?” If as Evans-Prichard contends, costs have been cut so much that Texas producers can now produce the same oil at $50/barrel (the price in mid-2017) than at $100/barrel (the price in mid-2017); the shale revolution has been immunized from the oil price shock. If Evans-Prichard is correct, the Saudi gambit has failed miserably. This brings us to the two key questions of this paper. First, was the Saudi gambit a failure or was it a painful, but necessary decision to staunch the long-term flow of shale oil? Second, what role if any will OPEC play in a post shale revolution world oil market? To provide answers to the first question, it is not sufficient to argue that since the Saudis are worse off today than they were in 2014, their gambit was a failure. Rather, we must construct a counterfactual analysis asking how conditions facing the Saudis today would differ if oil prices had remained in the $100/barrel range.Footnote 7 This will require viewing the Saudis as the residual supplier to the market and asking how demand and supply responses by key parties would have affected Saudi output. The second question, the role of OPEC in a post shale revolution, is the focus of the “OPEC’s role in the shale revolution” section of the paper. Intuitively, one can think of the simple limit pricing model outlined by Pashigian (1968). Prior to the advent of fracking and horizontal drilling, the limit price might be the cost of renewables but after these shale innovations, the limit price has been dramatically cut. Pashigian explores the choices facing the dominant firm in his theoretical model. Is it better for the dominant firm to completely deter entry by pricing at the limit price? Or alternatively, should it choose a higher price path allowing the gradual incursion of the new technology? Whatever the price strategy chosen, the price space within which OPEC operates between its low production costs versus the limit price imposed by the shale revolution has been sharply diminished. Since the potential gains from collusion have been severely diminished, does this imply the demise of OPEC? Alternatively, is it possible that OPEC members acutely realize the scarcity of oil revenues, making them more amenable to collusion?",

Two other basins were also developed: Lower Silesia abandoned after 1990s due to high costs of production and Lublin Basin which only started to operate in the 1980s. During the command and control period, limited access to convertible currencies, lack of crude oil reserves and domestic natural gas supplies covering only half of annual consumption but abundant domestic coal reserves led to the economy based on coal. It was the only fuel relatively easily available for all sectors of the economy and for households. The strong position of the coal mining industry under the “socialist” rule came also from coal export, which was the dominating source of convertible currencies. Due to this role, the sector enjoyed several privileges including such as favourite pension conditions or special shops for miners. Trade unions of coal miners were and still are a strong force in the coal sector, and practically no crucial decision could be undertaken without their consent. Politicians still consider these unions as a real political force able to influence voters’ opinions. Coal still plays a significant role in primary energy supplies (Fig. 1), but its share of energy supply diminishes as crude oil for transport purposes increases, as would be expected, due to the number of cars and growing transport demand. Poland’s GDP has increased two and half times since 1990 which at quite stable primary energy consumption gives a proportional decrease of energy intensity. Primary energy consumption and GDP in Poland. Source of data: GUS (1991-2016) and World Bank (GDP, in constant 2011 US$) The role of coal in the economy is decreasing due to improvements in power generation efficiencies and fuels switch in industry which contributed to the lower consumption (Fig. 2). Opening to international markets, no import quotas, used earlier to limit import from Russia, caused that Poland once big coal exporter became net importer. In recent years, import from Russia reached 9 ml ton (2011) out of total 14 ml ton (Olkuski 2013). In the same 2011 year, Polish export was only 5 ml ton. Majority of imported coal is used by small consumers (Stala-Szlugaj 2016), as domestic production is dominated by fine grades suitable for large consumers, while coarse coal is in shortage. Coal balance million ton (Source: GUS (1991-2015), Olkuski 2013) The Polish coal market up to years 2000 was considered to be separated from the world one. The development of the country’s international trade and management skills of coal companies broke this separation and domestic coal prices started to depend on international ones. It could be observed that domestic coking coal prices directly depend on the international ones, while for steam coal there is one year lag (Fig. 3). Coking coal international trade, both import and export, seems to have strong link to domestic market. Coal prices in Poland and NW Europe (source of data: The Supreme Audit Office)",7

32,1,Mineral Economics,23 July 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-018-0158-7,Raw materials management in iron and steelmaking firms,April 2019,Henrik Florén,Johan Frishammar,Magnus Ericsson,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper aims to add to the understanding of factors impacting how raw materials should be managed in iron and steelmaking firms, and explore capabilities underpinning proficient Raw Materials Management (RMM). Process firms manipulate material properties to develop and produce upgraded raw materials for subsequent use in upstream product and application areas (Barnett and Clark 1996). Thus, process firms manufacture non-assembled products through processes in which raw materials are transformed in continuous flows or batches (Lager et al. 2013). Firms in the iron and steelmaking industries are key examples of such raw material intensive firms, in which the firms’ capability to manage their raw materials constitute a critical dimension of their competitiveness. The basic units of “raw materials management” can be said to be all the activities—acquiring, purchasing, refining, developing raw materials—that go into delivering a sufficient amount of raw materials at an acceptable quality and price to ensure that the strategic and operational objectives of the firm are achieved, while also working proactively within the organization to assure that available raw materials provide the best possible benefits within the limitations given by the production process. Effective raw materials management means performing all these activities better—i.e., faster, with higher quality, better price, and with fewer inputs and less hurdles—than competitors. All this needs to be done taking into consideration both the competitive environment of the firm as well as internal strengths and weaknesses of the firm, i.e., the cost of using any raw material is linked to the processes used within the company and cannot be understood unless a broad view is applied. Many firms, however, still deploy a rather basic approach to RMM: an approach that is reactive and short-term (Slowinski et al. 2013). It should be noted that not all iron and steelmaking firms are in need of a broad approach to RMM. Certain details of when a holistic approach to RMM is necessary in relation to raw materials supply can however be deduced from the way raw materials are traded. If the raw material in question is a publicly traded raw material on a recognized exchange with a multitude of suppliers, like for example refined copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME), there may be less of a need for a complex use of RMM approach. That said, many firms use a portfolio of different metals and materials, and for other raw materials where the quantities are smaller, the suppliers fewer, and when individual companies might have a direct market impact, a more elaborate RMM can make a difference. Other metals could carry costs as the user of the metal gets associated with problematic environmental and social practices by the miner. Cobalt is one example of a metal where non-economic costs are potentially high, as production is often linked to problematic geographical areas like the Congo. Most metals traded on an exchange are generic in the sense that, e.g., the refined copper sold is more or less exactly the same product no matter who produced it. This reduces the need for a more holistic RMM. However, iron ore is a raw material with quality properties depending on the choice of supplier, which limits the number of potential suppliers for companies like Höganäs and other steel companies with complex and high-quality downstream products. Thus, the need for specific iron ores does give rise to a need for a well thought through RMM. Practically, this strategy could include long-term contracts and strong mutual ties to the suppliers, joint and research. Hence, in some cases, iron and steelmaking firms have a lot to gain from developing a broader approach to RMM. Firms that deploy a basic, reactive, and short-term approach to RMM fail to look beyond the functional elements of RMM, such as the purchase or procurement of raw materials or technical issues related to process development and material properties. Although these dimensions are clearly of utmost importance, we argue that the prevailing short-term, reactive, and functional/operational approach to raw materials that many iron and steel firms adopt is sub-optimal as it increases risks in several layers, such as price risks, supply risk, and production risks. There are multiple reasons for this claim. First, the way a firm manages raw materials greatly affects both short-term profits and long-term business opportunities. For example, from a short-term perspective, when the supply of raw materials is smooth, production volumes can be sustained. When that supply is interrupted, however, the impact on firms is immediate and severe. Second, from a long-term perspective, the prices of raw materials affect long-range average costs, marginal costs, and profitability (Aylen and Albertson 2006), and the quality of raw materials affects both prices and the value proposition to customers. Therefore, raw materials management is a complex task that goes far beyond procurement or pure technical issues in manufacturing process development (Florén et al. 2013). The need for change is further stressed by the transition from a relatively stable price discovery mechanism for iron ore, the so-called benchmark model, which has been abandoned and replaced with a more market-based mechanism, giving rise to more short-term volatility (UNCTAD 2012). Most iron ore remains traded under long-term contracts with defined volumes, qualities, and prices. Iron ore prices used to be agreed upon in annual negotiations but are nowadays usually set on a shorter term basis, mostly quarterly and monthly but increasingly even shorter periods are used, weekly, and daily. Previous research has contributed significantly to understanding how firms should deal with the challenges related to raw materials. More specifically, research has contributed knowledge on handling raw materials to mitigate supply risks (Achet and Helbig 2013; Rosenau-Tornow et al. 2009), on forecasting supply trends for specific types of raw materials (Massari and Ruberti 2013; Humphreys 2013), on policy making at the national level (Tiess 2010; Noras 2016), and about how firms can deal with shortages of important materials (Slowinski et al. 2013). The understanding of raw materials management from a holistic perspective is, however, largely lacking, and extant research does not provide qualified advice to firms on this matter. This study aims to provide such knowledge by drawing on insights from Höganäs AB (hereafter Höganäs), a world leader in ferrous powder metallurgy, and their efforts to identify aspects and principles of raw material management. More specifically, the purpose of this paper is to provide a holistic view on how iron and steelmaking firms can manage raw materials. Our elaboration of a more holistic view on RMM builds on two elements. First, we depict five external uncertainties and three internal conditions that impact firm-level raw materials management. Second, we present six critical capabilities that underpin proficient firm-level raw materials management in iron and steelmaking firms.",6

Even considering higher recycling rates, still the majority of resources will have to come from primary resources, being mined, concentrated, smelted, and refined. With respect to the ongoing discussion on criticality of minerals and metals (EU Commission 2014; Coulomb et al. 2015; Graedel et al. 2015), which is so far based on the consideration of economic vulnerability and supply risks, there is a need to further consider the environmental dimension of mineral exploitation and concentration. The environmental impact of mining depends on a large number of factors, including inter alia, the grade of ore in a deposit, the depth of a deposit, the nature of the overburden, the mineralogical, physical and chemical properties of the ores, and the location of the mine (Manhart et al. 2018; Dehoust et al. 2017; Priester 2015).

This concept has been picked up by the field of Life Cycle Assessment, which seeks to quantify and aggregate environmental impacts potentially arising from the complete set of processes occurring over the whole life-cycle of a product or service. Sonderegger et al. (2017) describe ‘Type 3’or ‘future efforts’ methods of life-cycle impact assessment as a means of incorporating impacts on scarcity of mineral resources into life cycle assessments (LCA). The relevant paragraphs are not easy to follow but, stripped to its essentials, the argument appears to be this: Mining imposes a burden on the earth, a burden the authors define as future efforts. This burden is increasing with time, and even if it is not, it might be reasonable to assume that it is for the purpose of comparing potential impacts of resource use ‘on a common scale’ in LCA. For example, the concept of future efforts due to declining primary resource quality is explored by Vieira et al. (2016) and Vieira et al. (2017) in their work. Vieira et al. (2016) relate current resource consumption to potential consequences for future extraction of resources—quantified in terms of a ‘surplus cost potential’. Vieira et al. (2017) quantify the same potential consequences in terms of a ‘surplus ore potential’. They suggest that a specific burden associated with the production of each primary material should be taken into account and that this can be done by studying the costs or ore requirements of production of the material and by projecting forward likely costs or ore requirements into the future. As the authors put it, their goal is ‘to assess the increase in scarcity of resources extracted’ for use in the product system under study. For the purpose of the analysis, they employ mine cost data for 2000–2013 and reserves data published by the US Geological Survey. In so doing, they make a number of critical assumptions: That mines with lower operating costs are exploited first, That in the long run, the effort to extract resources will increase due to declining quality of deposits, That ore grades tend to decrease with the increase of metal extraction and that ore grades mined in the future will therefore be lower, and/or That increased primary metal extraction results in an increase in mining and milling costs and energy consumption for subsequent (future) extraction. We will argue that this approach is incorrect, and with this Comment, we wish to make it clear that—contrary to what is suggested in much of the Life Cycle Assessment literature (Vieira et al. 2012; Goedkoop et al. 2013; Swart and Dewulf 2013; Sonderegger et al. 2017)—the future efforts concept is not an established rule of natural resource extraction. For mineral resources, it is quite impossible to proceed with extraction in the ordered way that this approach suggests because there is no comprehensive view of the entire natural resource. Secondly, there is no evidence available to support the idea that extracting a mineral resource today causes a decrease in availability of that mineral tomorrow. On the contrary, the weight of evidence suggests that where declines in ore grades have been observed they are overwhelmingly due to technology development in response to high demand and have been accompanied by increased mining efficiency and increased availability of the resource to successive generations. Grade is a rather arbitrary measure since the grade of mined ore ultimately has to do with the relationship of costs and revenues. It is not only the technology employed, which matters, but also how smartly this technology is applied. The Swedish copper mine Aitik, where mine life has been continuously extended over a long period through the discovery of new reserves, provides an interesting and persuasive clarifying case study. See Fig. 1. Thirdly, the future efforts approach entirely overlooks the potential availability of mineral materials from secondary (scrap) sources, sources which are expected to become increasingly important to mineral supply in the future.

(2016) and Vieira et al. (2017) as cases in point. Our data only deal with metallic ores, but there is nothing to suggest that the conclusions are not valid also for non-metallic ores.",11

Nevertheless, miningFootnote 1 is again under attack. In many countries,Footnote 2 projects have been delayed or stopped because of environmental authorities’ resistance to mining developments in large parcels of the territory, and the unwillingness of local communities and civil society organizations to grant access by legal mining permit holders to areas covered by their licenses. Starting in 2012, the end of the commodities boom left a generalized feeling on the population of resource-rich countries that mining revenues were not being distributed fairly [i.e., mining companies were not paying enough taxes] and that the industry failed to contribute to the economic development of the country and the communities affected by their projects. Dissatisfaction with mining prevailed despite continuous efforts by central governments to attract foreign investment to generate tax revenues that pay for expensive social policies. This article reviews the origins of the nexus between mining and sustainable development, including its most elaborated effort, the Mining, Minerals and Sustainable Development (MMSD). It analyzes mining’s globalization under the so-called Washington Consensus and the role played by international financial institutions like the World Bank in promoting good practices for the management of the sector. It concludes with a discussion of the new set of challenges that is affecting the global mining industry. The paper is supported by a concise literature review covering the main relevant theories and body of knowledge on the topic. Case studies on Colombia and Guatemala were included to support the main argument in the paper about the lack of consistency of current legislative frameworks for the sector.

Some of these changes were essentially cyclical and reversed as commodity prices fell, and companies were forced to adjust their behaviour to deal with the problems of lower cash flows and high levels of corporate debt. However, other changes which took place during these years are likely to prove longer lasting and contribute to shaping the industry over the next 20 to 30 years. In considering trends in the regulation of the mining industry, it is useful to review these changes since they will play a part in providing the context within which such regulations are established in the future. Amongst the identified changes are these: The location of the market will continue to move towards emerging economies and specifically towards Asia; Markets will focus on the short term, and prices remain volatile; Companies from emerging economics will play an increasing role in the global industry; Costs will come under greater pressure from depletion and from tightening environmental standards; Investment will remain subject to the forces of nationalism and protectionism.",15

One of the governance issues has been the bilaterally negotiated mining contracts that less-developed countries have signed with mining companies. A study commissioned by the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) found that countries ‘regularly end up with poorly negotiated deals that confer limited benefits to the country and the communities affected by the mining investment and may even sit completely outside of the legal framework of the country’ (BGR/BMZ 2015, p. 5). High-profile cases, such as the contracts Mittal Steel Holdings signed with the Government of Liberia, have underpinned the argument that countries need support to negotiate better deals.Footnote 1 The assumption is that better deals will increase the fiscal take and more revenue will contribute to countries achieving sustainable development outcomes. Several initiatives have taken up this argument to support contract negotiations. At the same time, efforts have also focused on supporting host countries with the development of generally applicable mining legislation and other related legislation, for example on environmental protection, fiscal management and economic and social development.

This paper focuses on the balance between the use of mining contracts and the development of stronger mining legislation that stipulates how a country should manage the mining sector as a whole. This topic merits attention, first, because mining contracts have more often been relied upon by less-developed countries. In contrast, developed and more mature mining countries predominately rely on specific mining legislation and their overall legal and regulatory systems to grant exploration and production licences and to tax mining companies. Second, despite them sometimes being touted as a tool for achieving sustainable development, experiences with mining contracts have been mixed. It is therefore worthwhile to pose the question whether the use of contracts and contract negotiations has come at the expense of overlooking the importance of strengthening sector and related legislation. As part of the 2017 Mining Seminar, held at the University of Dundee’s Centre for Energy, Petroleum and Mineral Law and Policy (CEPMLP), a roundtable discussion was organised to gather views on how to balance bilaterally negotiated mining contracts with the development of generally applicable mining legislation, and to consider the mixed experiences from the perspectives of international development organisations, mining companies and host countries. This paper summarises the ambiguous observations on mining contracts that were shared and discussed during and after the CEPMLP Seminar. “The rationale for mining contracts between host governments and mining companies” section reviews the rationale for the use of mining contracts. “The impacts of mining contracts” section discusses their impacts on the stability of investment conditions, the risk of corruption, the administrative burden on governments and on the development of generally applicable mining legislation and regulations. The “Discussion” section explores some underlying issues at stake. The last section concludes and looks forward. Of primary interest for the discussion held in Dundee—and therefore also for this paper—were the contracts negotiated between the governments of host countries and international industrial mining companies.Footnote 2 By exclusion, this means that the paper does not focus on the many other types of contracts that mining companies negotiate with private sector entities and whose expertise they draw on to plan, develop and operate mining projects. These entities include the various contractors and suppliers that work with and for mining companies. The paper also does not discuss in detail the types of contracts that mining companies sometimes sign with third parties affected or impacted by mining activities. These contracts include agreements that companies may negotiate with local communities and/or municipalities, such as compensation and benefit-sharing agreements, community development agreements or local development agreements.Footnote 3 However, the paper mentions some aspects that relay to these types of agreements.",4
32,2,Mineral Economics,05 September 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-018-0161-z,Trade restrictions on minerals and metals,July 2019,Jane Korinek,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Goods are produced using raw materials that have either grown from the soil or been extracted from the sub-soil. All raw materials used to produce the goods we use are made from agricultural products or have been mined. Metals and minerals are used in large quantities in traditional industries such as motor vehicles, airplanes and machinery. Moreover, newer and cutting-edge technologies have created additional demand for many minerals and metals, some used in small quantities not visible to end-consumers. Metals and minerals are used to produce mobile phones, computers and other electronics, environmental goods such as wind turbines, hybrid cars and LED lightbulbs, and strategic defence systems. Many metals and minerals have specific properties—withstanding the heat of a jet engine, for example—that make them difficult to substitute. But no one country is self-sufficient in every raw material. Some metals and minerals are found in only a few countries. One of the specificities of the mining sector is that economic activity is largely determined by geology rather than comparative advantage or a well-regulated investment climate. The strong concentration of production means that restrictions on trade in such materials are particularly disruptive to global supply chains. Import and export taxes imposed on products that are far upstream in global supply chains increase trade costs strongly since they are applied on products that will most likely be traded many times before they are ready for final consumption. Any increase in the cost of products early in the supply chain is magnified every time the raw material is traded or transformed (WTO 2010). An export or import tax on copper ore will increase the total implied rate of protection of the processed copper concentrate and copper cathode which in turn will increase the cost of copper sheets and wires, which will be translated into higher prices for computer chips, telecoms equipment, heating and cooling systems and even guitar strings. Export restrictions have contributed to instances of shortage of supply and strong swings in prices, not least of all during the episode of high food and agriculture prices in 2007–08 and 2010–11. In 2008, the cereal price index reached a peak 2.8 times higher than that of 2000 (FAO 2018). Many studies empirically assessed the market effects of the export restrictions introduced in 2007–08 and 2010–11, and all concluded that these effects were substantial (Anderson 2012; Anderson et al. 2013; Bouët and Debucquet 2010; Headey 2011; Laborde et al. 2013; Martin and Anderson 2012; Rutten et al. 2013; Tanaka and Hosoe 2011; Thompson and Tallard 2010). Additionally, when one country implemented a price insulating policy, it stimulated other countries to follow suit. When many countries apply the same measure, the combined impact of all measures pushes international prices to even higher levels (Deuss 2017). Export restrictions on raw materials not only impact the cost of products but also introduce uncertainty of access to supply for producers of semi-processed and final-consumption goods (Fung and Korinek 2014). These restrictions have created trade frictions and open trade disputes including, in some instances, cases that have been brought to WTO dispute settlement. Regarding industrial raw materials, they are DS 394, 395 and 398: China—measures related to the exportation of various raw materials; DS 431, 432 and 433: China—measures related to the exportation of rare earths, tungsten and molybdenum; DS 508: China—export duties on certain raw materials; and DS 509: China—duties and other measures concerning the exportation of certain raw materials. The existing international trade regulatory framework is very different for import tariffs compared with export taxes. Import tariffs have fallen during successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations since the Kennedy Round in 1963. WTO members have bound their import tariffs, whereby they pledge not to raise them above a maximum, and have lowered tariff bindings during subsequent multi-lateral and plurilateral negotiations. In addition, each WTO member has concluded preferential trade agreements with, on average, 14 other countries (Hofmann et al. 2017) and all such agreements include provisions for preferential market access and lower import tariffs. Export taxes, on the other hand, are not subject to any WTO disciplines. WTO members are free to restrict exports through taxes at any level, although some more recently acceding members have agreed to lower or remove export taxes in the context of their WTO accession agreements. Export quotas and export bans are also allowed in some circumstances, and the language outlining the instances where quotas can be used are quite vague, e.g. to “preserve natural resources”. (For a summary of WTO disciplines on export restrictions and those agreed in preferential trade agreements, see Korinek and Bartos 2012). Therefore, trade policies regarding imports are more transparent than those regarding exports in the WTO context. Every WTO member submits a codified import tariff schedule of all products on which they require an import tariff to be paid by other WTO members. Tariff schedules are available online, including through an interactive data tool,Footnote 1 which presents full information including applied tariff rates, bound rates, binding coverage and any other import restricting mechanism that is applied. On the export side, however, WTO members are not obliged to submit schedules of export restricting measures, so there was no easily accessible way to obtain such information. For this reason, the OECD put into place an inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials which now includes a comprehensive list of export restrictions by all major exporting countries for 65 industrial raw materials from 2009 to 2014.Footnote 2 The OECD also collects, jointly with FAO, export restricting measures that have been placed on main staple food commodities (wheat, maize, rice and soybeans).Footnote 3 Some users of export restrictions justify their existence because of tariff escalation in major markets for raw materials. As the argument goes, semi-processed goods face higher import tariffs in major markets compared with those for raw materials, so minerals exporters face a disincentive to process minerals domestically and export a higher value-added product. By implementing export restrictions on unprocessed raw materials, such producers maintain, they will counter-balance skewed protectionism in their consumers’ markets.Footnote 4 This paper takes stock of the situation regarding the use of export restrictions on minerals and metals using the OECD’s comprehensive original dataset. It then describes the prevalence and magnitude of import tariffs and determines the validity to the claim that export restrictions by producers mirror import restrictions in consumer markets. This paper provides a backdrop to the recent trade restrictions on minerals and metals. This issue has had much resonance lately since the United States imposed import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium from some major producing countries. The use of export restrictions on minerals and metals is increasingly common. The inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials records such restrictions on 65 strategic, essential raw materials in all major exporting countries.Footnote 5 Over the six-year period for which information has been collected, from 2009 to 2014, the stock of export restricting measures—outright export bans, export quotas, export taxes, non-automatic export licencing requirements and other export restricting measures—has risen significantly (Fig. 1). Number of active export restricting measures. Source: OECD inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials Moreover, once export restricting measures are in place, they are rarely lifted. The inventory records distinct entries for introduction, elimination, decrease, increase, extension, reintroduction, revision and persistence of restrictions. Over the six-year period, export restrictive policies increased by 7.2% (153 occurrences) per year on average. Turnover is very limited as restrictions tend to remain in place once they are instituted—illustrated by the prevalence of measures “left unchanged” in Fig. 2. Export restrictions–direction of change. Source: OECD inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials Not only are export restricting measures increasing in number, they are also becoming more restrictive. The new measures introduced over the period 2009–2014 are overwhelmingly of the more restrictive type: export prohibitions account for more than half of the stock of new measures, followed by fiscal taxes. Export taxes are the most widely used type of restriction accounting for 38% of measures on minerals and metals. The second most common measure is non-automatic licencing requirements (36%), followed by export prohibitions (6%), export quotas (3%) and other export restricting measures (18%, see Fig. 3). “Other export restricting measures” includes such policies as domestic market obligations, minimum export prices, fiscal taxes, VAT tax rebate reductions and withdrawals, restrictions on customs clearance for exports, qualified exporters lists and captive mining. Obviously, these measures are very different in terms of their implementation and their impact on exporters, consumers and world markets. Type of export restricting measure. Source: OECD inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials Export prohibitions and export quotas, making up 9% of all export restrictions, can have very far-reaching consequences. In 2014, for example, Indonesia instituted an export prohibition on all unprocessed ores with the objective of requiring mining firms to invest in processing facilities in order to export higher value-added products. According to the Indonesian Mineral Entrepreneurs Association, 30,000 jobs were lost in the mining sector in the country due to the ban.Footnote 6 One ex-ante estimate of the net loss in welfare for Indonesia was USD 6.3 billion per year (USAID 2013). Some export restricting measures have prompted dispute settlement action in the WTO. China maintained export quotas on 12 of the 55 products for which data has been collected and export taxes on 21 of those materials (source: OECD inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials). Dispute settlement cases that have been brought before the WTO have been almost exclusively on these products. When instituting an export restriction, governments sometimes provide a statement concerning the purpose of the measure in the legal text or regulation. This information is included in the inventory when it is available. Such information can provide insights into policy objectives and economic activities that the government aims to protect and foster or, conversely, control or reduce. In should be kept in mind, however, that these are stated policy objectives. Additionally, some policies are initiated for a number of different purposes whereas only one purpose is expressed. In only about half of the cases of export restricting measures do governments indicate the aim of the policy. Although policy purposes differ somewhat by year, common stated policy objectives for export restrictions are safeguarding domestic supply, controlling export activity, health or environmental protection and promoting further processing or increasing value added (Fig. 4a). a Stated policy purpose for all export restricting measures. b Stated policy purpose for export taxes. Source: OECD inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials The policy purpose often changes with the type of measure being implemented. In the case of export taxes, for example, the most common reason given, if any, is to generate revenue (Fig. 4b). In some countries, a non-negligible portion of government revenue comes from import and export taxes. In others, export taxes provide a substantial portion of government revenue, for example, 13% in Argentina in 2008 (OECD forthcoming) and 14% in Belarus in 2012 (Fliess et al. 2014, p. 43). Argentina has been a frequent user of export taxes since 2002 when the country defaulted on its sovereign debt. Since 2002, export taxes were applied on all tariff lines and were particularly high for agro-food products; in 2008 the export tax rate of soybeans reached 44%. However, in 2016, Argentina removed almost all export taxes, including on mineral products, and plans to reduce export taxes on the remaining products derived from soybeans to 18% in 2020 (OECD forthcoming). Other common aims of export taxes are to preserve non-renewable natural resources, safeguard domestic supply of raw materials and promote further processing or value addition of such resources. Export taxes on minerals and metals are generally high, and some are prohibitively high. In many cases, the level of the export tax is so high that it is undoubtedly reducing competitiveness and is most probably impacting the amount of trade taking place. The average export tax in place on raw materials was 9.44% and that on semi-processed goods was 5.34%.Footnote 7 Export taxes were placed on 8% of global exports of minerals and metals and 5% of semi-processed goods resulting from them (Fig. 5). Export taxes can be as high as 50% on raw materials and up to 40% on the semi-processed products that result from them. Such prohibitively high tax rates will negatively affect exports of countries that impose them. The impact of such taxes is therefore strongly underestimated as regards the share of total trade affected by export taxes: little trade is taking place when such high export tariff peaks are enforced. Minerals and metals—average and maximum export taxes by level of processing: (1) Share of total world exports in raw materials (including waste and scrap) affected by export taxes and (2) Share of total world exports in semi-processed goods affected by export taxes.

Source: OECD inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials Export taxes differ substantially by product and sub-sector. Ferrous metals, metal ores and minerals, and metallic waste and scrap are all subject to high average export taxes and high maximum rates (Fig. 6). Tariff peaks are highest on metallic waste and scrap, metal ores and minerals, and chemicals and compounds, followed by ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Export taxes are much lower on precious metals and stones and industrial minerals. However, it will be seen in the next section that even average export taxes on industrial minerals, for example, of 7.3% (for raw materials) and 5% (for semi-processed minerals) are far higher than average import tariffs in the sector.

Coverage is outlined in the methodological note of the inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials, http://www.oecd.org/tad/benefitlib/inventory-export-restrictions-ind.pdf. Source: OECD inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials Trade restrictions on metallic waste and scrap pose a particular challenge to the aim of decoupling industrial production from resource use, which has been deemed necessary to achieve compliance with the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals.Footnote 8 Metallic waste and scrap is generated either as a by-product of the production process of mining, refining and producing industrial products or from recycled goods that provide recovered metals and non-metallic materials that re-enter the production cycle as inputs. This process is also referred to as the “circular economy”. Export restrictions on metallic waste and scrap mean that materials are not always recovered and re-used to the largest extent possible, in particular if countries restricting the trade in such materials do not have the recovery and recycling capacity or the demand for such materials. The circular economy is already well underway: approximately 40% of copper and 40% of steel are produced from recycled materials. For other common materials such as aluminium, lead and zinc, over 30% of production presently uses recovered inputs.Footnote 9 However, export taxes remain high on all of these materials: average export taxes on waste and scrap emanating from all base metals are above 10%, and above 15% for waste and scrap from copper, iron and steel, nickel and aluminium as well as cobalt and titanium (Fig. 7). Export taxes on waste and scrap are much higher in some countries: up to 50% for copper and aluminium, 40% for iron and steel, and 30% for lead, nickel, zinc, cobalt and titanium (Fig. 8). In countries with insufficient or inexistent recycling capacity, such export taxes suggest that recovery of metallic and non-metallic materials may not take place. In that case, further extraction of non-renewable natural resources is necessary to respond to continued global demand for steel, copper, aluminium and other metals.

Coverage is outlined in the methodological note of the inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials, http://www.oecd.org/tad/benefitlib/inventory-export-restrictions-ind.pdf. Source: OECD inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials On many primary products, and some semi-processed industrial products, export taxes are high. Export taxes on raw materials are over 10% on average for copper, graphite, iron and steel, lead, nickel, phosphates, tin, titanium, tungsten, zinc, vanadium, antimony, chromium, niobium and zirconium. Many semi-processed products also have substantial export taxes. Those 10% and over include: aluminium, coke, iron and steel, manganese, pig iron, potash, rare earth elements, silicon, antimony and chromium (Fig. 8). Export taxes on some primary and secondary materials are up to 40% for some countries. A list of maximum export taxes is available in annex Table 1. Trade policies as regards imports are very different to the ones described above for export taxes. Eight successive rounds of multi-lateral trade negotiations have taken place since 1947, reducing many tariff lines and encouraging countries to bind their tariffs (by pledging not to raise them above an agreed maximum) at successively lower levels. Most-favoured nation (MFN) tariff levels are applied to all WTO member countries. Successive rounds of trade negotiations have been undertaken by a greater number of countries as they became members of the GATT, and, subsequently, the WTO. Although developing countries could claim special and differential treatment in order to bind fewer tariffs and at higher levels, many undertook substantial market opening. Additionally, many countries have signed preferential trading agreements (PTA) in order to grant and obtain greater market access. On average, each WTO member country has concluded 14 PTAs (Hofmann et al. 2017). The engaged international climate surrounding negotiated reductions in import tariffs over the last 70 years has resulted in substantially lower import tariff levels for minerals and metals in major importing countries. Examining major markets for minerals and metals—OECD countries, China, and the United States and European Union separately—shows import tariffs that are substantially lower on average compared with the export taxes imputed by producing countries shown in the previous section. Applied tariffs on raw materials in the United States are 1.2% on average, 0.6% in the European Union, 0.7% for the OECD overall,Footnote 10 and 3.1% in China. Import tariffs on semi-processed products are slightly higher, showing some tariff escalation. Tariff escalation occurs when import tariffs on goods that undergo more processing are higher thereby creating a disincentive for raw materials producers to process their products in-country as they will face higher tariffs on exports of goods that have undergone more processing in their main markets. In particular, semi-processed products face import tariffs of 3.3% into the United States, 4.6% in the European Union, 1.5% in the OECD overall, and 5.2% in China (Fig. 9).Footnote 11 These averages imply that there is some tariff escalation in major importing markets for minerals and metals overall. Average import tariffs and tariff peaks by level of processing. Note: most-favoured nation tariff (MFN) is the tariff applied to imports from WTO members. Bound tariff (BND) is the maximum level at which an MFN tariff may be levied according to WTO multilateral trade rules. The data presented here refer to tariffs on 83 different HS codes classified as raw materials and 385 as semi-processed products. Source: OECD inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials These tariffs are low overall but apply to a substantial share of trade in raw materials and semi-processed products: China and OECD countries together impose import tariffs on 16% of world imports of raw materials and 32% of imports of semi-processed products. Although at much lower levels than export taxes, import tariffs are applied on a larger share of global trade. China represents a special case as it applies both import tariffs and export taxes on 47 raw materials and semi-processed products. Imports into China are, however, taxed much less: generally between 1 and 5%, whereas export taxes can be as high as 40%. China, the EU and the United States all apply import tariffs on a greater share of semi-processed products than raw materials. In the EU, only 1% of tariff lines for raw materials are subject to import tariffs, compared to 45% for semi-processed goods. In the US, figures are 14% for raw materials and 46% for semi-processed products. China imposes import tariffs more widely: 61% of tariff lines for raw materials and almost all semi-processed goods (96%). In the case of the United States, European Union and China, applied tariffs are close to bound rates indicating that on average, they cannot raise their tariffs significantly and still continue to comply with WTO commitments. However, as recent action by the United States to impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminium imports demonstrates, unilateral imposition of significant import restrictions nonetheless remains an option for constraining access to import markets. Some other OECD countries however have “water in their tariffs”, i.e. they could potentially raise their tariffs by a substantial margin without reneging on previous commitments. In the OECD area overall, applied rates are between one-sixth and one-third of what they could legitimately be and still comply with WTO rules. Some tariff peaks on raw materials and semi-processed minerals and metals are higher—up to 10% in China and the European Union on both raw materials and semi-processed goods; 15% on semi-processed products in the United States and 22% in the OECD area. These import tariffs are substantial and undoubtedly create a strong disincentive to import. They remain, however, few compared with maximum rates on export taxes. Annex Tables 1 and 2 include all tariff lines over 20% that are applied on export taxes and import tariffs respectively. Annex Table 1 includes 84 entries by country and product that reflect export taxes over 20%; on the import side, there is only one. Import tariffs on raw materials into major markets are low, in particular compared with level of export taxes by producers—and many are in the range commonly considered “nuisance tariffs”.Footnote 12 The only potential exception is the import tariff by China on coking coal of 4.5% which affects 16% of world trade and, depending on the definition used for “nuisance tariffs”, those on aluminium and copper of 3% which affect close to 30 and 20% of world trade, respectively (Fig. 10). Shares of world imports directly affected by import tariffs on raw materials by US, EU and China. Note: tariffs refer to average applied tariffs per product of non-zero values. The 40 raw materials are made up of 83 HS tariff lines. Source: OECD inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials Semi-processed products are characterised by slightly stronger import restrictions. The United States imposes tariffs of at least 5% on five semi-processed products: titanium (9%), manganese, beryllium, vanadium and tungsten (all 5%). The European Union imposes tariffs between 5 and 7% on nine products and China on seven (Fig. 11). In addition, some of the tariffs in China in the vicinity of 5% are applied to a large share of world trade: 37% of copper, and 44% of borates for example. Between a fourth and a fifth of world imports of tungsten are taxed by the three regions at a trade-weighted average of 5.6%. Shares of world imports directly affected by import tariffs on semi-processed products by US, EU and China. Note: Tariffs refer to average applied tariffs per product of non-zero values. The 37 semi-processed products are made up of 385 HS tariff lines. Source: OECD inventory of export restrictions on industrial raw materials Some users of export restrictions assert that export taxes applied on raw materials by producing countries offset import tariff escalation that exists in their major markets. Some raw materials producers have suggested that import tariff escalation in their major markets contributes to confining them to exporting lower value added mineral ores as opposed to higher value added processed products. The above analysis does not confirm this hypothesis. Export taxes are on average significantly higher than corresponding import tariffs. Export taxes are on average 9% and affect 8% of exported raw materials. Corresponding import tariffs are 0.8% for OECD countries and 3% in China and affect 8% of imported raw materials in each case. Semi-processed mineral products face export taxes of 7% and affect 5% of world trade. Corresponding import tariffs are 1.5% in OECD and 5% in China and affect 24 and 9% of world trade respectively. Furthermore, for most products, export restrictions on raw materials are coupled with restrictions on semi-processed goods. In some cases, export tax escalation occurs, i.e. export taxes are higher on more processed products. Such policies are not contributing to offsetting import tariff escalation. Moreover, as regards tariff peaks, export taxes are also higher than import tariffs. Since average rates can mask important protection in key products, analysis was undertaken of maximum values of export taxes and import tariffs. Here again, they were higher on exports—around 50% on raw materials and 40% on semi-processed products—compared with maximum values on imports which were around 10% for raw materials and 10 and 22% for semi-processed products in China and the OECD, respectively. A list of products subjected to particularly high import tariffs and export taxes, defined here as taxes of 20% and above, is included in Annex Tables 1 and 2. Furthermore, for the three major markets—EU, US and China, applied tariffs are very close to bound rates. These economies cannot raise their import tariffs significantly without reneging on their WTO obligations. There is more “water in the tariffs” in the other OECD countries, many of which could raise their import tariffs from their low average levels to 6 and 8% for raw materials and semi-processed products respectively. Products that have been bound at particularly high levels include aluminium in Israel (60%), iron and steel in Mexico (50%) and articles of tin in Iceland (35%). On the other hand, export taxes are not subject to any WTO disciplines and can be raised without consultation or prior submission. For most products, export taxes are substantially higher than any import tariff escalation. For a few products, however—gold, manganese, platinum metals and to a lesser extent silver and tantalum—export taxes are proportionate to the difference in import tariffs between the raw materials and semi-processed products in major markets (Fig. 12). This is partly because the export taxes on these products are fairly low, around 5%. For most other products, export taxes are substantially higher than average import tariffs.

Gourley,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There can be an inclination amongst some governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to view the resource sector with some cynicism. The cities of Port Colborne (Ontario, Canada—heavy metal contamination), Aberfan (Wales, UK—tragic waste slide), Libby (Montana, USA—asbestos Superfund location) and the plagued town of Moura (Queensland, Australia—coal explosions) stand as testimony to the fact that the seeds of such cynicism have been sown in the West where the beating heart of capitalism now finances so many foreign adventures.Footnote 1 Junior mining companies sometimes engage with local communities (or not), leave without a trace (or perhaps with tracks, trails and trenches) and offer only a brief hope for betterment (or long-standing court battles over environmental or community issues) causing strong emotive reactions.Footnote 2 None of the major miners have managed to avoid controversy in their own corporate histories either; of course, none ever could. The rapid evolution and shift in science, technology and cultural views in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have assured that all operators retire looking rather derelict and, with the passage of time, even negligent. Against such a backdrop, the art of crafting reform to mineral regulation throughout the world has become a balancing act for the international resource lawyer. As the World Bank notes: Ample evidence exists that countries that adopt modern mining legislation and offer an enabling environment can attract private sector investment in mining exploration and production … contribut[ing] to increased tax revenues, export earnings, employment opportunities, infrastructure development especially in rural areas, and transfer of technology to the host countries. However, while the extraction of mineral resources provides developing countries with considerable opportunities for economic development, there is the risk that mining operations can turn into socio-economic enclaves or cause environmental damage. … Countries, communities, and companies face tough questions about opportunities and risks as they develop steps to ensure responsible approaches toward mineral resource development.Footnote 3 Most argue that “sustainable development”Footnote 4 is, at least partly, the answer to recent and historic sins of the industry and, without reservation, the industry has now embraced this concept.Footnote 5 Unfortunately, the concept of sustainable development, by itself, offers little drafting guidance to the resource lawyer tasked with modernising a mining code. There can be no argument that fair and transparent environmental permitting processes are a necessary part of the effort nor that local communities need to be engaged and, where appropriate, embraced by a prospective developer. Nevertheless, blindly delivering advanced projects into the hands of an environmental ministry or a community agency who is empowered to promote the “best interests” of a nation, sometimes without appeal, timelines or any meaningful guidelines, occurs too often in modern times.Footnote 6 Ultimately, the mining company requires certainty when investing in exploration, development or expansion projects in a foreign country to offset the substantial uncertainty inherent in the exploration and mining processes themselves:Footnote 7 certainty as to the retention of title and certainty as to fiscal terms and certainty as to administrative fairness. Certainty is not obtained by the stability of the applicable regulations themselves; certainty as to ambiguity—the Donald Rumsfeld’s so-called known unknowns—is no help at all to the executive. Rather, one needs clear rules which are consistently applied that assure the developer that it may explore, develop and produce any discovery without interference of government or any other person and can measure with some accuracy the expected investment and the anticipated reward.Footnote 8 This paper examines several mining codes in the Middle EastFootnote 9 and offers a critical assessment of their relative opportunity and risk to the developer. It examines each risk in comparative detail, including in comparison to a set of principles found in an exemplary mining code adopted by Madagascar in 2005. The principles of a model mining codeFootnote 10 (MMC) have been determined after examining more than 50 mining codes from around the world and benefit from the work of MineHutte and the Fraser Institute,Footnote 11 which offer ratings for mining regulatory regimes based on different criteria.",1

It would have been easy to believe that this discussion had been laid to rest with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the discredit of central planning and with the disappointing results of industrial policy as pursued in the 1970s and 1980s, not just in developing but also in developed countries. For anybody who doubted, recent history could have been expected to provide sufficient empirical evidence for even the most skeptical. For the past 30 years, world trade has grown faster than ever, resulting in a dramatic reduction in poverty, in large part due to specialization and the fragmentation of supply chains, as demonstrated by the fact that world trade has grown much faster than world GDP, contradicting the arguments of those who believe in the benefits of policies aimed to promote vertical integration within one country. However, more recent thinking about industrial policy advocates a more nuanced approach, focusing on the role of transaction costs and in particular on the institutions that reduce transaction costs. As expressed by Dietsche (2017, p. 5): The general case for industrial policy is built on the argument that there are situations in which markets rely on the public sector to achieve broadly desirable economic and social outcomes. These situations are, but are not limited to, those cases where clear ‘market failures’ can be identified. Therefore, industrial policy sits at the heart of the relationship between markets and states, and it also shapes economies and the social outcomes they produce. It could be argued that government efforts to reduce transaction costs could result in improved conditions for downstream processing. Such efforts could be seen as elements of industrial policy, which, after all, comes in a large variety of flavours (see Smart 2017). Several governments seem to think that vertical integration will yield better results in terms of resource-based development than earlier approaches: Achieving the transformative potential of Africa’s resources requires a new way of thinking about minerals, which aligns with the continent’s own priorities of industrialisation and diversification through value-addition, processing, beneficiation and the creation of strong mineral-led linkages with other sectors of our economies (Fatima Haram Acyl, African Union Trade and Industry Commissioner, Indaba 2017). Policies in a growing number of countries confirm the interest in downstream processing. Some countries have used positive fiscal incentives. Indonesia, for instance, relies on tax holidays, reductions in corporate income tax and duty exempt imports to incentivize primary mineral producers to invest in processing facilities (Bellefleur 2014). Rwanda applies a 15% Preferential Corporate Income tax for projects exporting processed minerals up to 50% of turnover of minerals produced in Rwanda (Rwanda Development Board n.d.). Generally, businesses in Rwanda pay tax at the rate of 30%. Other countries, including India (iron ore) and Zambia (copper), have introduced export taxes on unprocessed commodities. Finally, some countries have resorted to outright bans on the export of unprocessed commodities, including Indonesia on bauxite, copper, nickel and tin from 2014 to the end of 2016 and Tanzania on copper and gold since March 2017 (Östensson and Löf 2017). All of these developments justify a closer look at policies aiming to support or promote downstream processing of minerals, particularly through restrictions on exports, and to try to assess the possibilities of success of these policies. These possibilities may depend partly on the degree to which the policies form part of a coherent industrial policy framework or whether they represent attempts by populist politicians to mobilize the electorate or reward particular constituencies under the heading of “resource nationalism.” The term resource nationalism does not have an agreed definition. Its meaning may range from a broad and uncontroversial “desire of the people of resource-rich countries to derive more economic benefit from their natural resources and the resolution of their governments to concomitantly exercise greater control over the country’s natural resource sectors” (Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy 2012), to a narrower “anti-competitive behaviour designed to restrict the international supply of a natural resource” (HM Government Horizon Scanning Programme 2014). At this point, it is worthwhile recalling that actions to promote downstream processing through restrictions on exports may be incompatible with countries’ commitments under WTO rules.Footnote 1 Most export taxes or bans are not challenged in the WTO because no other country than the one imposing the measures suffers any significant damage. However, in many cases, taxes can also be challenged under bilateral trade deals or investment treaties, for instance, the EU Economic Partnership Agreements. Thus, Article 15 of the Interim Agreement establishing a framework for an Economic Partnership Agreement between the Eastern and Southern Africa States, on the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, on the other part, reads “Except as otherwise provided in Annex III and for the duration of this Agreement, the Parties shall not institute any new duties or taxes on or in connection with the exportation of goods to the other Party in excess of those imposed on like products destined for internal sale” (European Union 2012). The surrounding rhetoric sometimes sounds like resource nationalism aimed at domestic audiences and the objectives and underlying analysis are not always clear and explicit. However, one can imagine several mainstream arguments for making further processing an industrial policy objective: Prices of more processed products may be more stable and further processing would therefore provide some insurance against revenue variations; Processing raw materials may give rise to important learning effects and improve skills; The processed products may be strategic or, at least, less expensive, inputs for domestic manufacturing, construction, or agriculture. The present article aims to provide a critical overview of the arguments used in the debate about policies to promote downstream processing of minerals, particularly coercive policies such as export taxes or bans. The “Market failure, policy failure or comparative advantage?” section in the following reviews some of the reasons why downstream processing of minerals does not always take place in the country where they are mined. The “Costs and benefits of downstream processing policies” section discusses costs and benefits of coercive policies, drawing partly on the example of Indonesia’s ban on exports of unprocessed minerals from 2014 to 2016. The “Conclusions” section, finally, attempts to draw some very general conclusions.",3

In the present paper, the time series is updated to 2016 and a discussion is added of the development of some socio-economic indicators. Based on available detailed data for the minerals and metals sector in as many countries as possible, an analysis is carried out of the current situation for 2016 compared with 2014, and how the contribution by mining to economic development has changed since 1996. The study covers all non-fuel minerals and coal for short in the text called metals and minerals. Oil and gas are excluded. Economic data have been gathered for production, prices, mineral rents, exploration expenditure and government revenues, and added to this the following socio-economic indicators: Human Development Index, various governance indicators and the Governance and Inequality (the GINI coefficient). The focus is on the following questions: How much do the mining industries statistically contribute to national economies? Has the level of contribution changed as a result of the sharp drop in the prices of most extracted commodities since about 2011—after the end of the so-called ‘super cycle’? How has that level of statistical contribution changed over the past 20 years from 1996 to 2016? How have socio-economic indicators developed in the same period in African mineral resource rich countries? The paper covers all countries but low- and middle-income developing economies are given additional attention to follow up on our earlier study.Footnote 3 Our intention is to collect and analyse statistical data on a global level over a long period of time and to give an empirical contribution to the discussion about the role of mineral resources in economic and social development of countries. The purpose of the paper is not to provide a full analysis of all the factors behind the observed changes in economic and social contribution by mining. We hope our data and analysis can give inspiration and direction for additional research to perform such analyses. The paper starts with a methodological discussion and proceeds with the first question raised above: a review of the Mining Contribution Index (MCI-Wr) in 2016 compared with 2014. The four components of the MCI-Wr are the following: value of mine production, mineral exports, exploration and mineral rents. They are presented and analysed together with other factors affecting mining’s contribution. A discussion of the second and third question follows: changes in contribution over time both since 2014 and over the entire period under study. The socio-economic issues are dealt with in the subsequent section. Finally, our conclusions are presented.",87
32,2,Mineral Economics,26 June 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-018-0157-8,Using risk assessments to address corruption in mining,July 2019,Lisa Caripis,Andrea Shaw,Alexia Skok,Female,Female,Female,Female,"To ensure a globally consistent approach to the research, all country assessments followed a standardised method developed for Transparency International in collaboration with experts from multilateral institutions, major international non-governmental organisations and industry bodies—the MACRA Tool. An updated version of the Tool has been published along with the global report on the country-level findings. The MACRA Tool applies a standard risk assessment process, based on ISO 31000, to assess corruption risks in mining approvals. The Tool has a number of specific strengths that support collecting reliable and useful data: The Tool guides assessors through a series of steps to (1) define the scope of the assessment (2) map the selected approval process(es) and what happens in practice, (3) analyse the context in which mining approvals take place, (4) identify vulnerabilities in the approvals process, practice and context, (5) identify the corruption risks resulting from the vulnerabilities from a set of common risks listed in the MACRA Tool, (6) systematically analyse each selected risk in terms of its likelihood and potential impact, and (7) determine priority risks for action. This process has provided a flexible but consistent structure for undertaking the assessment. The Tool does not require assessors to respond to a standardised survey about different aspects of the approvals process, but instead allows them to determine the scope of their assessment, based on analysis of the local context and consultation with key stakeholders with an interest in the mining sector. This ensures that the results of the risk assessment are more likely to be acted on by key stakeholders because the subject of the risk assessment has been determined to meet local needs and priorities. Virtually all Transparency International national chapters assessed the processes for awarding both exploration and production licences. Most also considered the risks associated with community consultation requirements and environmental impact assessment and approvals. Some risk assessments looked at the processes for opening land to mining, and others at negotiation of joint venture and mineral development agreements. The Tool has a strong focus on stakeholder engagement. As well as supporting information collection from knowledgeable actors, the MACRA Tool incorporates validation by a range of stakeholders at key steps in the process in workshops or individual meetings. Across the 18 countries in this study, Transparency International chapters collected information from over 750 stakeholders from throughout the mining sector—government, industry, civil society, affected communities and academia. A further 250 individuals participated in validation and review of the risk assessments. This level of engagement allowed the risk assessment results to be reviewed and tested by knowledgeable actors, strengthening the reliability of the data. It has also helped establish groups of stakeholders prepared to take action on the risk assessment findings. The Tool requires assessors to use evidence to justify the decisions they make along the way. To support them to do so, it provides advice on suitable data collection methods to ensure valid and reliable data, including a range of primary and secondary sources, such as key informant interviews, legislative analysis and process mapping. It includes an extensive reference list of resources. The methods employed by Transparency International assessors varied based on their context, but all used a range of methods and invited representatives from industry, government, civil society and community groups to participate in interviews, focus groups and workshops. Many assessors also conducted field visits to mining regions. This multi-method approach increased the validity of the risk assessment findings. While the MACRA Tool does not specify any particular profile of assessor, for the purpose of Transparency International’s study, assessors were hired by national offices based primarily on their social science and legal research qualifications and their knowledge of the sector. For the integrity of the study, care was taken to screen out assessors with vested interests in the assessment results. Review throughout the research process by the global research coordinator (lead author of this viewpoint) as well as review and validation of assessment results through multi-stakeholder meetings were important mechanisms for securing meaningful and robust risk assessments.",4

This has significantly changed the structure of the industry. Some non-OECD countries have rapidly growing steel industries, supported by abundant steelmaking raw materials, very low costs of energy and labour, and growing domestic demand. Non-OECD countries now appear to be participating more in the globalisation process (Kowalski et al. 2015), and steel has been impacting world markets for goods and services. Since the start of the twenty-first century, non-OECD countries have accounted for an increasing share of global steel demand, with steel import volumes growing significantly to satisfy infrastructure and industrial development needs. To increase the self-sufficiency rates of non-OECD countries and to press forward with industrialisation, extensive ironmaking/steelmaking investments have been carried out in these countries (OECD 2015a). As a result of several investments, non-OECD countries have experienced significant growth in production. China is the principal engine for growth, thereby affecting the global steel market, as well as the global steelmaking raw materials market (Ericsson 2011). Non-OECD countries surpassed the OECD’s crude steel output in 2004, with their share of world crude steel output increasing from 41.6% in 2000 to 70.2% in 2016, indicating that non-OECD countries have played a significant role in the global steel market (Fig. 1a, b and Appendix Table 7).Footnote 2 As a result of China’s rapid capacity expansion and its accession to the World Trade Organisation in 2001, the country has become the largest producer and consumer of steel, as well as the world’s biggest steel exporter.Footnote 3 Aside from China, the gap of crude steel output between OECD and non-OECD countries (excluding China) has been shrinking over the last decade. a, b Development of crude steel output (1975–2016). Non-OECD 1, non-OECD countries, including China; Non-OECD 2, non-OECD countries, excluding China. Source: Author’s calculations based on data from the World Steel Association (various issues) In addition to changes in the composition of the global steel market, there has been a gradual change in the structure of production technologies in the global steel industry (Fig. 2a, b). Crude steel is produced via two primary production routes, that is, the integrated steelmaking route, based on the blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace (BF/BOF) and the electric arc furnace (EAF) route. Since the past several decades, efforts to modernise steel production facilities have continued in several countries, and steel mills have been replacing out-dated facilities (e.g. open-hearth furnaces [OHF]) with BF/BOF and EAF furnaces. In the OECD, the BF/BOF route has been the major steelmaking technology, accounting for 57.7% of its production in 2016. However, the share of the EAF route in OECD countries has grown over the past few years in line with growing ferrous scrap reservoirs. Turning to non-OECD countries, the BF/BOF technology has played a dominant role, with its share climbing to 80.5% in 2016. The increase in BF/BOF production in non-OECD countries has occurred mainly in China. Conversely, the importance of the EAF technology in non-OECD countries (excluding China) continues to grow. a, b Crude steel output by processes (1975–2016). Non-OECD 1, non-OECD countries, including China; Non-OECD 2, non-OECD countries, excluding China. Source: Author’s calculations based on data from the World Steel Association (various issues) Non-OECD countries have developed from peripheral players to major centres of global steel production and trade, and they should continue to play a crucial role in the global steel market as a result of steady capacity additions.Footnote 4 Thus, the developments in non-OECD steelmaking countries have been receiving increasing attention from governments and the industry. The question posed in this study is as follows. With the increasing importance of the EAF route in some non-OECD countries, does the BF/BOF route still play an important role for non-OECD countries to catch-up with OECD countries? Given the scale and importance of the global steel industry, understanding the structure of non-OECD countries is crucial for both the industry and policymakers. The aim of this study is to better understand the structure of non-OECD countries and to explore the relationship between production processes and steel trade structure. The remaining paper proceeds as follows: the ‘Literature review’ section, the ‘Stylised facts and analytical framework’ section, the ‘Data and methodology’ section, the ‘Analysis and results’ section, and lastly the ‘Conclusion’ section which draws conclusions and discusses directions for further research.",1

Kukla,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Mineral resources are a key factor of successful economies and societal progress. To minimize supply risks for import dependent countries such as Germany, unhindered access to strategical important metals must be ensured. Today, large quantities of manganese (Mn; 100%), cobalt (Co; 90%), and copper (Cu; 50%) are imported by Germany from non-European countries (Kausch et al. 2016). Besides their application as alloying elements in steelmaking, Ni, Co, and Mn become increasingly important due to their application in high and green technologies (Hein et al. 2013; Marscheider-Weidemann et al. 2016). In the event of the market penetration of electric cars with lithium-ion technology, the metal demand for the German automotive industry is estimated at 110,000 metric tons of Co, 188,000 t of Ni, 194,000 t of Mn, and 110,000 t of Li in the year 2035 (Marscheider-Weidemann et al. 2016). Seafloor manganese nodules (SMnN),Footnote 1 about potato-sized, polymetallic rock concretions covering vast areas of the Earth’s ocean floor (Mero 1962; Hein and Koschinsky 2014; Petersen et al. 2016), might be a source of future supply (Table 1). The occurrences with the highest economic potential according to their abundances and metal grades occur in areas beyond national jurisdiction—for example, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) of the Central Pacific, the South Pacific, the Indian Ocean, and the Peru Basin (Fig. 1; Hein and Koschinsky 2014). The global resource potential is estimated to be about 500 billion dry metric tons of SMnN (Archer 1981). However, global abundance is far from certain as many areas have never been sampled adequately (Hannington and Petersen 2016), while regulations for the exploitation of SMnN in international waters are under development (ISA 2017). Moreover, SMnN have not yet proven to be economically minable with current technology and economic conditions (Ecorys 2014). Global occurrences of SMnN (courtesy of GEOMAR; edited). Cash values refer to the mean value (2015-US$ per m2) of the years 1970 to 2015; estimated according to the methodology and data published by Volkmann et al. (2018). The lower cash value refers to three-metal recovery (Ni, Co, Cu), the upper cash value to four-metal recovery (+Mn). Nodule abundance (kg/m2; dry weight) and metal grades (wt%) according to data published by Hein and Koschinsky (2014) and SPC (2013). Rounded figures Focused here, the CCZ represents the largest occurrence with the highest economic potential (Hein and Koschinsky 2014). The so-called Manganese Nodule Belt of the Pacific Ocean stretches from the west coast of Mexico to Hawaii and encompasses an area of ~ 5.2 million km2, including an area of ~ 4.2 million km2 of commercial interest (ISA 2010). The average nodule abundance is about 15 kg/m2 (wet weight); however, it varies from 0 to ~ 30 kg/m2 within only a few hundreds of meters (SPC 2013). Metal grades are relatively constant over wide areas of the CCZ (ISA 2010). The conservatively estimated quantity of SMnN amounts to ~ 21 billion dry metric tons (ISA 2010). Compared to global land-based reserves, the estimated metal tonnages are indeed remarkable (Table 1). However, only a small fraction of the reported SMnN resource might be mined under current assumptions and estimates on the resource utilization are yet highly speculative (Volkmann and Lehnen 2017; Volkmann et al. 2018). Focus of this research is the investigation of economic conditions needed to invest into a commercial SMnN project. The European research project Blue Mining (2014–2018) serves as a specific case study. Past and future cost and price trends are considered. Although the investigation of the economic viability of SMnN mining has been intensively studied since the 1970s, the transfer of evaluation tools from land-based mining has not yet been completed. This contribution offers methods to evaluate the profitability of a mining project on SMnN. Besides the net present value (NPV) or the internal rate of return (IRR), an additional approach is presented to assess the “early feasibility” of a SMnN mining project. Using this approach, a spatial planning tool is developed (Volkmann et al. 2018). Moreover, a further approach is discussed, which allows one to include route planning in the economic evaluation at a more advanced technological readiness. Thus, this paper contributes to the setting of requirements and the validation of assumptions for future mine planning.",6

Njike,Mustafa Kumral,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the last decade, mineral resources companies have focused on investing in the development of mines and rushing to take advantage of the high commodity price Beginning production early while permanent field development is being planned and full facilities are being built is the so-called early production (Rahmanpour and Osanloo 2015). This early production helped them to benefit from early cash flow, uninflated construction costs, and high-profit margins (Rahmanpour and Osanloo 2016). Also, as Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis proposed (2008), in the good times, the companies undertake high risk through new projects. Too many new projects associated with profit greed trigger the next crises. The current top mining companies have multiple products groups with different Chief Executive Officers all competing for the same global capital expenditures (CAPEX) funds. For example, a top mining corporation has a number of different groups with annual CAPEX of multi-billion dollars. The billions dollars annual CAPEX are distributed between their different product groups. A large amount of this investment is allocated to their sustaining capital which highlights the fact that it is mainly for the existing mines or assets. These new projects can be construction or purchase of a new mine/facility, capacity expansion of existing mine, or replacement equipment to adopt new technologies. Over the last 5 years, commodity prices index dropped by 41% (Canada 2016). For a specific mineral commodity such as iron ore, the market price dropped by 68% from 2011 to 2016 (IndexMundi 2016). Mineral resources companies are no longer achieving high-profit margins because of the combination of their high operating costs and low commodity prices (Raffaini 2016). Thus, the reluctance to quickly move from development to early production Also, mining investments are irreversible and incur the significant amount of risks associated with the fluctuations in the global mineral markets (Collan et al. 2017; Sauvageau and Kumral 2017, 2018). Collan et al. (2017) illustrate the effect of market price on the metal mining asset portfolio valuation in terms of net present value and real option valuation of the assets. Considering the internal competition of projects approval between different business units/product groups within the same corporate mining company, this paper highlights the fact that on top of the market price impact on the assets valuation, the criteria of operational performance of business unit/product group–project’s initiator in the initial investment decision are necessary and also impact the decision to invest or not. The study related to approval for internal sustaining capital projects has not yet been done with additional criteria of a project initiator’s performance in the previous corporate mining projects portfolio valuation. The current commodity prices are low because the supply is overshooting the demand (Ives 2016). At the same time, the high-cost producers are running out of cash and, in turn, suspending their operations while the low-cost producers are overcoming this challenging market. The cyclical behavior of the commodity prices is a well-known phenomenon, and the investment strategies of the companies are based on their perception of the evolution of the cycle (Humphreys 2018). The continuous drop in commodity prices increases the competition among low-cost producers. Furthermore, the complexity of international economics and globalization lead to additional challenges to the investment strategy of mining companies (Wirth et al. 2013). For mining companies’ decision-makers, the challenge is how to improve the effectiveness of their current asset/resources/projects and better manage the risk to allocate the capital investments into the most valuable initiatives (Bowman and Ambrosini 2000). This challenge can be formulated as a decision-making problem, which is translated into an intertemporal optimization problem (Chang et al. 2000), namely, a quadratic portfolio management model; this model refers to a constrained nonlinear program with a quadratic objective function where all constraints are linear. The decisions variables for the defined problem are the fractions of fund invested in each project. The decision made in any period affects future possibilities. Therefore, there is a need to take into account this effect when a decision is made. The quadratic optimization model developed in this paper will provide the optimization model with operational performance and international risk (Herring and School 1986). A product group is defined as a combination of multiple business units associated with mining and processing operations. To obtain an approval for a new project, the product group’s previous performance will be a criterion. For example, an excellent safety record, whether production quality and quantity targets are captured, the budget is properly managed, and resources are effectively utilized will be considered in the approval process. Considering these key economic drivers, a sequence of effective decisions needs to be made to maximize utility expressed in the objective function. This approach will allow the decisions’ makers to effectively have the right fraction of available CAPEX to invest in each product group in order to minimize the risk subject to a specified minimum expected rate of return defined by the corporate group as the economic threshold profitability limit of the corporate group (Xue et al. 2014). Corporate groups are very often divided into multiple product groups with respect to commodities such as gold, diamond, aluminum, iron ore, and copper. Many mining organizations use the Net Present Value (NPV) as the critical criterion to evaluate the project from exploration to production stages. However, for capital allocation at the corporate level, beyond NPV criterion, there are the risk associated to the operational performance of the product group and the location of the business unit initiating the project (project’s initiator). Xu et al. (2014) developed an improved portfolio model for project selection where applicable technique beyond NPV is presented for capital budgeting. Nevertheless, the current operational performance of the project initiator has not been considered. In the mining industry, the additional capital expense has always been considered as a critical element of operational performance (Xue et al. 2014). Given that before buying a new asset, it is critical to optimize the asset in possession, the consideration of current operational performance in the approval of a new project proposed by the product group is required. In this paper we consider a single corporate office managing a portfolio of programs/projects from different product groups defined as a set of companies producing a group of products in a specific geographic location. All project submitted to the corporate office for approval will be considered to already meet the NPV criterion within the product group. The additional corporate criteria will be the operational performance and the international risk associated with the project’s initiator. The chart below illustrates the different stage of project approval. The approval process is illustrated in Fig. 1. Approval stages from product group to corporate level Bhappu and Guzman (1995) illustrated the fact that the Discounted Cash Flow techniques do not allow the consideration of premium values on projects valuation. There is a typical assumption of constant mining and processing operations throughput/effectiveness in the evaluation of mining projects. However, these throughput/effectiveness are correlated to the operational performance of the business unit requesting a project approval. The originality of this paper rests on proposing an optimization model for project portfolio management in the mining industry with operational performance as one of the key criteria of project’s approval.",2
32,3,Mineral Economics,20 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-019-00178-3,Monetary impacts and overshooting of energy prices: the case of the U.S. coal prices,November 2019,Dragan Miljkovic,Jungho Baek,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The impact of monetary policy on the real commodity prices has actively been examined for several decades now. Early research typically dealt with the impact of monetary policy on commodity prices through changes in exchange rates (e.g., Schuh 1974, 1976; Chambers and Just 1981, 1982). Another commonality of that research was its focus on agricultural commodities. Neither focus was surprising considering the relative importance of international markets in commodity trading and in particular in trading of agricultural commodities. Soon thereafter, however, it was recognized that the impact of monetary policy on commodity prices is plausible even in a closed economy (Frankel 1984, 1986, 2006). Frankel developed models, based on fundamental macroeconomic theory, which illustrated how monetary policies could lead to either an increase or a decrease of commodity prices. For example, growth in money supply increases the expected rate of inflation, which, in turn, leads investors to shift out of money and into commodities and drives up the current commodity prices. As money supply declines, on the other hand, the nominal interest rate tends to be higher than the expected inflation rate (in other words, a rise in the real interest rate), which results in investors to shift out of commodities and into bonds, thereby depressing commodity prices. Frankel’s models have been tested empirically, so far, for agricultural commodities (e.g., Saghaian et al. 2002; Frankel 2006) and oil (Baek and Miljkovic 2018) in an open economy context only. Thus, they accounted for both exchange rate and interest rate (money supply) mechanisms. These papers built on Frankel’s theory and Dornbusch’s overshooting model (Dornbusch 1976). Other fossil fuels including coal, oil, and natural gas are also subject to these monetary policy impacts but, curiously enough, have not been subject to this analysis. This paper is particularly interested in the case of coal in the USA because it has long been self-sufficient in coal consumption, and overall a small net-exporters. It lends itself as a perfect case study for the impact of monetary policy on commodity prices in closed economy context, hence a real test for the original Frankel’s model. Not more than 2% of domestic coal consumption has been imported, while about 7–8% of domestic production has been exported in recent years (http://www.eia.gov/coal/). Moreover, possibility of substitution in consumption of different fossil fuels in production of electric power or industrial sector in the USA in the short run is limited due to several reasons, but most notably due to long ago–built and long ago–developed plants and facilities, and well established resulting infrastructure (Miljkovic et al. 2016). Short-term shifts between different fossil fuels or other alternative energy sources are thus unlikely reiterating that monetary policy changes could have an impact on coal prices that indeed could be internalized and considered in a closed economy setting. Monetary policy in the USA has been diverse in recent decades. It changed from what was termed the Great Moderation (Taylor 2013) during the 1980s and 1990s into what characterized the whole 2003–2005 period and often called the “too-low-for-too-long” period (Taylor 2013). At the 2016 symposium organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City held in Jackson Hole, WY, Dr. Janet Yellen, former Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, presented the speech titled, “The Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Toolkit: Past, Present, and Future.” Her focus was on the policy tools that are needed to ensure that we have a resilient monetary policy framework. In particular, she focused on whether Fed’s existing tools are adequate to respond to future economic downturns. Dr. Yellen argued (Yellen 2016, available at: http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160826a.htm), “…one lesson from the crisis is that our pre-crisis toolkit was inadequate to address the range of economic circumstances that we faced. Looking ahead, we will likely need to retain many of the monetary policy tools that were developed to promote recovery from the crisis. In addition, policymakers inside and outside the Fed may wish at some point to consider additional options to secure a strong and resilient economy.” Hence, it is clear that we do not know at the moment what direction the Fed will take in terms of its policy. Thus, it is even more important to recognize potential effects different monetary policy scenarios could have on coal prices in this largely closed economy setting. Variations in monetary policy, such as those mentioned above, give us an opportunity to analyze its impacts on coal prices. Thus, the objective of this paper is to analyze the impacts of monetary policy on determination of coal prices in a closed economy setting. Specifically, the intent is to see if the monetary policy has an effect on coal prices because, although they are flexible, other goods prices serving as the reference prices for the economy, i.e., manufacturing prices, are sticky. The remaining sections include methodology, data, empirical results, discussion, and conclusions with policy implications.",

Bratvold,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Ever since the emergence of capital asset pricing models, corporate finance has provided us with a formal method of translating risk into money. More specifically, we adjust the discount rate used for evaluation of future cash flows to account for time value of money and risk. The adjustment for risk, also called the risk premium, draws on financial theories of Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) after Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965), or more sophisticated alternatives of Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) proposed by Ross (1976), or even Multifactor Models. Regardless of what method is used, all risk premiums reflect the notion that higher risk should accompany higher rewards. More specifically, greater (systematic) risk implies greater risk premiums. In an alternative risk-neutral approach to valuation (discussed in Smith and Nau 1995), we apply risk adjustments to the expected cash flows rather than the discount rates. Risky cash flows will be more heavily modified compared with more certain cash flows, but the discount rate will only reflect the time value of money. These two approaches will essentially yield the same results if they are consistent in treatment of risk. In other words, the risk premium in the discount rate (following CAPM) should have the same effect as risk-adjusting the expected future cash flows. Arnold and Shockley Jr (2002) pointed out that both approaches arise from a unified framework and, in theory, are the same. Yet, the risk-neutral approach accommodates uncertainties in individual projects while the CAPM approach is a general measure representing all risks in all projects a company undertakes or has undertaken, a broad-brush approach that is correct on “average” but potentially mars individual valuations (Smith and McCardle 1999). In addition, most oil and gas companies also use diverse sources of capital, including debt, to finance their operations; so besides the risk premium, the discount rate should reflect the cost of borrowed money. This Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) accounts for the aggregate financing and investing the company has made. The problem is, exploration and development opportunities frequently fall outside the range of “average” risk or have risk profiles that change when management later decides to change the course of the projects. Even if a project has average risk, separately modeling market uncertainties (such as variation in prices) in decision trees or scenario analyses introduces a systematic error to valuations. To overcome these biases, the solution is a valuation model tailored to each individual project. Laughton et al. (2008) suggested a consistent decision tree model combining project-specifics with market-based valuation. Smith (2005) further led the discussion in a comment to the binomial tree approach of Brandão et al. (2005); for a consistent valuation, we rely on risk-neutral approach and directly model the uncertainties of a problem. For example, in a decision tree model of an exploration well, we should model market uncertainties using risk-neutral time series and private uncertainties using expert probability assessments. Brilliant as this is, the industry did not immediately adopt the framework. Most industries persist in using CAPM perhaps because it is straightforward in calculations and easier to implement in the decision-making process, yet, rendering their practice an inconsistent mixture with excessively high discount rates. For example, In a recent survey by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE 2018) on discount rates used in petroleum exploration and development, most respondents reported rates close to 10%. Other studies revealed similarly elevated rates, including the discussion paper released by the International Valuation Standard Council (IVSC 2012). Several academic analyses, for example Guedes and Santos (2016), have also used discount rates of 10%-15% for valuation of upstream petroleum assets. In this paper, we point out the biases and provide a remedy. We discuss that if we use the appropriate beta for discounting outcomes of a decision tree or a binomial tree; as e.g., in Brandão et al. (2005) and Brandão and Dyer (2005), we restore much of the consistency. Despite the mounting evidence against plausibility of CAPMFootnote 1 and its use in valuations (from early works of Banz 1981, Basu 1983 to recent oil and gas study of Willigers et al. 2017), we admit that most firms (73% of CFOs in Graham and Harvey’s 2001, survey) use CAPM to estimate their cost of equity. Our intention in this paper is to provide practical valuation guidelines inspired by the popularity of CAPM. We suggest a discounting method from Bernardo et al. (2007 and 2012) and Da et al. (2012) where the authors suggest adjusting project beta for the real option potentials of the firm. We combine these learnings with decision analysis principles and devise a more coherent valuation method. This paper contributes to the practice of project analysis from two aspects: it suggests using a normalized measure of project riskiness across the upstream petroleum industry. We use returns from major firms in the USA to calculate this measure of risk. In addition, through an example, we suggest using multiple discount rates in decision tree models that evaluate project flexibility, separating outcomes of normal risk from those that are more certain. These insights are readily applicable to the exploration of non-fuel minerals and, in a general context, to the process of pharmaceutical drug discovery and R&D project selection. The next section discusses the deficiencies in explanatory powers of CAPM and implications in practice. Even with such a weakness, we use recent findings in the “Project valuation requires estimating project risk” section to calculate the standard measure of project risk. Later in the “Multiple project outcomes: petroleum exploration valuation” section, we apply this measure to valuation of an exploration opportunity and suggest a second refinement to valuation models. The “Conclusions” section provides more discussion of the suggested method and concludes.",7

Initiatives have been established at the national and international levels to guarantee the origin of raw materials from conflict-free areas (e.g., iTSCi) or to certify compliance with more extensive development policy goals (e.g., CTC or RCM).

The start of that relationship—which grew steadily in terms of both common academic interests and close personal feelings—dates from nearly 40 years ago with the launching, in the early-1980s, of a decade-long joint research initiative between Penn State University and RFF. Referred to as the Mineral Economics and Policy program, the effort was directed, on the RFF side, by Hans Landsberg, at Penn State; it came to be singularly identified with the name and rapidly emerging reputation of John Tilton. During the program’s tenure, and apart from numerous periodical and working-paper releases, it produced seven full-length books. Besides RFF and Penn State, supporting roles came from the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria and Colorado School of Mines (CSM), which John joined in 1985. It would not be an exaggeration to claim that the teamwork of John and Hans—frequently supported, of course, by researchers at each institution—served to solidify Hans’ standing as a widely respected resource economist and, in the case of John, signaled a career progressively reflective of fundamental contributions to mineral economics, whether from the vantage point of conceptual, empirical, or policy analysis. And it was an intellectual partnership that endured beyond John’s move to the CSM and—even with Hans’ death (in 2000)—left its mark to the present day. The synergistic linkage between John and RFF progressed in multiple ways. John’s frequent presence on the RFF premises—as a University Fellow, visiting scholar, workshop participant, lecturer—was sufficient to promise a remarkably durable relationship. But it was the astounding publication record that came to be an integral part of that itinerant activity which demands at least selective mention.",

33,1,Mineral Economics,03 December 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-018-00167-y,Fifty years of copper mining: the US labor productivity,July 2020,Hamit Aydin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The US copper mining industry has experienced dramatic changes in copper mining production and labor productivity in the last 50 years. As we might recall, the US copper mining industry suffered a major decline during the 1970s and early 1980s and recovery started in the following years. This recovery in copper mining is reflected as a sharp jump in industry labor productivity (Fig. 1). Starting from 1980, industry labor productivity more than tripled in 1989, going from 18.8 to 60.8 ton per 1000-man-hour. Productivity growth then slowed down. Annual increases in industry labor productivity were on average 14% in those years (1980 to 1989) and later in the following years labor productivity showed a continuous growth (on average 7.1%) reaching to 94.4 ton per 1000-man-hour in 2003. The overall increase in labor productivity was much larger for the 1980–2003 period. It had quintupled. US copper mining labor productivity. (Selected surviving mines comes from the production data that is available to the public: Morenci, Bingham Canyon, Ray, Bagdad, Sierrita, Tyrone, Chino, Mission, Silver Bell, Miami, Pinto Valley, Safford, and Robinson). Sources: Copper production; USGS (1965–2015), and annual reports of the companies. Employment for individual mines and industry, MSHA (1975–1995, Copper Employment Record Report, Washington, DC. (unpublished printed copy)) and MSHA (1983–2015) and annual reports of the companies. Industry employment (1965–1986), ADMMR (1970); and Beard (1989) The most striking development apparent in Fig. 1, however, far from its peak in 2003, is the decrease in labor productivity that continued till 2012 and reached to 42 tons per 1000-man-hour (a 45% decline in 10 years). In 2015, labor productivity was comparable to the levels of the late 1980s. Figure 1 depicts labor productivity in three series: industry as a whole and split into two (selected and remaining mines). As seen from Fig. 1, the selected surviving mines are always performing well compared to the remaining mines, i.e., labor productivity in selected mines is threefold larger than that in remaining mines. This result coincides with the conclusion of Aydin and Tilton (2000), where it was argued that “…Most of the jump in productivity during the 1980s…came about because of improvements in productivity at individual mines. Much less important were new low-cost mines and other developments that caused the location of mining to shift from low- to high-productivity operations….” When labor productivity jumped in the 1980s, some (Andrews 1989) suggested that these increases might simply reflect high grading, postponing maintenance and capital replacement, reductions in stripping ratios, and other such measures that at best provide temporary cost reductions and an increase in labor productivity. Later, the study by Aydin (1998) attributed the recovery of labor productivity in the 1980s to shifting location of output, i.e., the closure of low productive mines, an increased use of capital per worker and the realization of increasing returns to scale, and technical changes through the use of new technologies—particularly the increased use of SxEw (solvent extraction electro winning), not because of change in head grades. This is because the SxEw method has allowed the exploitation of low-grade sulfide and oxide ores, which previously were treated as wastes, at a lower cost compared with the traditional process. Tilton and Landsberg (1999) examined possible explanations for the recovery of the global competitiveness of US copper mining, such as (1) an increase in the production cost of foreign producers, (2) a surge in copper prices, (3) a raise in byproduct revenues, (4) a decline in real wages for domestic copper workers, and (5) an increase in US labor productivity. They concluded that all these factors contribute to US competitiveness, but the surge of labor productivity between 1980 and 1986 was particularly important. They examined three factors as the possible causes of labor productivity increase—increases in capital and other inputs available per worker, changes in the quality of the copper ore being mined, and new technology and other innovative activities. They concluded that most of the increases in labor productivity (1975–1995 period) came about because labor had more capital and intermediate goods with which to work, and because of innovative activity and new technology (SxEw, in-pit crusher and increased automation-computer control). Aydin and Tilton (2000) provide additional evidence that the recovery of the US copper mining industry had little to do with changes in the quality of the country’s mineral endowment. They concluded that a surge in industry labor productivity mostly came from an increase of labor productivity in individual mines rather than closing and shifting location of mining towards better quality deposits. Tilton (2001) studied the US copper mining cross-sectional data from the 1975–1990 period and found that the growth in labor productivity during a recession is crucial for the survival of individual mines. The author also argued that labor productivity growth is key in improving comparative advantages of the US copper mining industry. Finally, Tilton (2014) explored causes of the recent collapse in mining productivity in the copper, aluminum, iron ore, and coal industries and questions the earlier findings, i.e., labor productivity increases in mining were mostly associated with the increased use of innovation and technological change. Two schools of thoughts have emerged regarding the decline in labor productivity. The first contends that new technology will no longer be able to offset the adverse effects of depletion resulting in higher prices in the future. The second, however, contends that the recent drop in productivity is the result of high prices and effort to expand output rapidly. That is, falling productivity is mostly cyclical, it will likely rise if prices fall. The author concludes that mining productivity over the past decade has largely fallen as a result of the cyclical nature of productivity. That is because, when the price of a natural resource increases, there are two mechanisms that can act to reduce productivity. As the price rises, it becomes profitable to extract previously unprofitable marginal deposits. The second effect of higher price is behavioral, i.e., profitability undermines productivity as an objective for firms in generally (Bradley and Sharpe 2009). This article extends this issue and tries to address the following questions: What is the significance of the determinants of labor productivity in US copper mining? What is the effect of price change on productivity? And how does it relate to the quality of the mineral being produced? The second section, which follows this introduction, reviews US copper mining in the following parts: copper production, copper yield, production capacity of copper mines, producer price of copper, and copper mining employment. The third section describes the estimation methodology, the data, and the variables used in this work. The section after that presents the statistical results and their analysis. The final section summarizes the findings and looks at their implications.",2
33,1,Mineral Economics,12 February 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-019-00173-8,The cobalt market revisited,July 2020,Gary A. Campbell,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The use of electric vehicles is increasingly being argued as an important and necessary step in making society greener. China, for example, due to its environmental and energy situations has developed governmental policies that are aimed at significantly increasing the production and use of electric vehicles. The goal is five million vehicles by 2020 (International Council of Clean Transportation 2018). Germany has announced a push to have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2020 (German Trade and Invest 2015), and other European governments are planning similar moves. It is likely that even more countries are or will be following this lead. The changeover from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles will have significant ramifications for material usage by society. One potential change of concern is the availability of two key materials used in electric vehicle batteries, lithium, and cobalt. Lithium availability has been, of course, a material of concern and study, but cobalt is also needed in the batteries and has a long history of supply disruption so its availability is a concern as well. An additional factor is that lithium-ion battery use is not limited to electric vehicles. Personal electronic devices and power storage needed with renewable energy sources (wind and solar) are also growing areas of consumption of lithium-ion batteries. Concern has increased about the ability of the producers of cobalt to meet the need of a potentially rapid increase in the production of electric vehicles and other battery uses. This concern about the future availability of cobalt is a fairly recent fear. A critical materials strategy study done for the US government in 2010 found that the short-run and medium-run risk for cobalt was “not critical” (USDOE 2010,2011). Past studies by the European Union have found cobalt to be a critical mineral but with most of the concern being on economic importance (price) and less on supply risk (EU 2017). These conclusions were based on the important but modest amount of cobalt needed in personal electronic devices and super alloys. However, forecasts of future demand for cobalt have increased dramatically as the mass production of electric vehicles has become a more likely possibility since cobalt is a necessary element in the lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles (Al Barazi et al. 2017; Zeng and Li 2015). A recent supply risk study for the materials used in electric vehicle batteries found a high supply risk for cobalt (Helbig et al. 2018). China’s Ministry of Land and Resources (2016) included cobalt on its list of critical minerals due to its use in lithium-ion batteries as has the United States government. Several factors drive this growing concern about the risk of limited cobalt supply availability. Cobalt is mostly produced as a by-product of nickel and copper mining, and cobalt production is largely driven by the market for those two metals and not cobalt’s market. Cobalt has a sizeable amount of production (over 50% in 2018) occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo which is politically unstable and has ethical source concerns about its production (due to civil war, other violence, and child labor)(Schmidt et al. 2016). China is a rapidly growing consumer of cobalt to meet its battery needs for electric vehicles and other uses which is pushing overall demand higher and constraining supplies for others just as their demand is rising as well. Taken together, these factors have led some analysts to predict a possible cobalt crisis to appear in the next few years (Olivetti et al. 2017). A similar concern about the availability of cobalt occurred 40 years ago with the “cobalt crisis” of 1978 (Alonso et al. 2007). The situations of these two eras are not identical, but they have many similarities. Mining production was equally dominated by the DR Congo (Zaire in 1978) in both eras. In 1978, the cobalt production of the DR Congo was totally controlled by the government company Gecamines who set a producer’s price through its marketing arm, SOZACOM (Campbell 1983). In 2018, the mining has been privatized and a market price is used. Cobalt consumption, in 1978, was more evenly distributed among the end uses with super alloys and permanent magnets being the most critical ones. Electric vehicle batteries were not a significant factor in 1978. Economists argue that a market should adjust to market problems and correct them over time. It has been 40 years since the 1978 crisis in the cobalt market with its significant supply cutoff and the resulting huge price spike. Cobalt supply problems occurred again in the 1990s due to reoccurring political problems in the DR Congo. These past events suggest an intriguing question that can be raised. How has the cobalt market responded and adjusted to these past supply crises? This paper attempts to answer this question. It looks at what has happened in the cobalt market since the cobalt crisis of the 1970s and its aftermaths and tries to determine if the market has indeed made longer term adjustments in response to the risks of cobalt supply availability and its price spikes or not. This information will give some useful insights into how we expect the cobalt market to respond as the demand for lithium-ion batteries continues to grow and what the ramifications might be. This paper consists of an economic discussion section on how the cobalt market might respond to a large price spike due to a supply restriction, a section on what actual changes and adjustments have occurred in the cobalt market since the crisis of the 1970s, and a section discussing what has happened in the cobalt market over the last 40 years and where it may be going in the future.",38

33,1,Mineral Economics,22 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-020-00227-2,Potential copper production through 2035 in Chile,July 2020,Gustavo Lagos,David Peters,José Joaquín Jara,Male,Male,Male,Male,"While there are numerous theoretical models regarding future copper refined demand (Paley Commission 1952; Meadows et al. 1972; Fisher et al. 1972; Tan 1987; Vial 1988; Ayres et al. 2002; Valencia 2005; Elshkaki et al. 2016; Schipper et al. 2018) and of secondary refined production (Fisher et al. 1972; Slade 1980; Tan 1987; Vial 1988; Valencia 2005; Gomez et al. 2007; Fu et al. 2017), very few primary supply theoretical models were found in the literature (Fisher et al. 1972; Tan 1987; Vial 1988). The production function (Cobb and Douglas 1928) was applied in these models to estimate primary production, but the results proved too general in order to guide public institutions and companies as to what greenfield and brownfield projects would be developed first in the future. Future refined production forecast methods, therefore, were developed based on detailed reserve, cost, production capacity, and commissioning date knowledge of individual projects available globally, whose existence had been reported by mining and exploration companies (Wood Mackenzie 2018; Cochilco 2019a). The most traditional forecast method is adopting the expansion plans made public by mining companies. This method is used by the Chilean Copper Commission (Cochilco) in some of its reports (Cochilco 2019a). A second method is employed by most expert commodity companies and agencies, including Cochilco (Cochilco 2019b) in some cases; it consists in modifying both the time for commissioning, and the throughput announced publically by the mining companies. They also include potential projects which have been reported, even if the companies have not yet defined the starting date. This method is justified because mining companies usually overestimate throughput rates and are optimistic about commissioning dates. During the last decade, there was a systematic bias towards over-predicting global mining production (UBS Global Research 2017; Wood Mackenzie 2017c). A third method consists in predicting the date of commissioning and the throughput using the price incentive method (Wood Mackenzie 2017a), which forces the more competitive projects to be commissioned first. It implies that demand and secondary supply are known previously and requires detailed cost data of the greenfield projects. The method, nevertheless, does not consider the time required for commissioning and only considers a modest part of the available brownfield projects. The motivation of this article was to explore the potential production of the Chilean copper mining industry through 2035, considering that the country is the world’s largest producer and holds the biggest ore reserves and resources globally. It is of importance for the copper industry to understand such potential and also find its limitations. Therefore, the aim of this article is to analyze the production potential and some of the main challenges of Chilean copper mining through 2035, assuming that metal price, the regulatory environment, and other competitive aspects of the country should not limit project development and production growth. Therefore, the article provides an unobstructed view on what is technically possible, but does not provide all the real challenges that the industry will face in the future, since it ignores three main challenges in the future which would be economic, regulatory, and environmental. This scenario is referred to as the “Full Scenario.” As a result, this paper estimates the maximum total copper production of Chile that could be achieved from 2019 to 2035, given the assumptions indicated. The article addresses the production of copper in concentrates and cathodes. The earlier is employed for processing mainly primary sulfides ores and includes a concentration process based on froth flotation, which must be followed by smelting and electro refining in order to obtain refined metal. The latter starts from oxide ores or even secondary sulfides, resulting in copper cathodes via leaching, solvent extraction, and electrowinning processes (Leach/SX/EW). In 2018, Chile produced 5.8 million tons of contained copper, of which 47.8% were exported as concentrates, 25.2% were smelted in Chile, and 27% were cathodes produced via Leach/SX/EW. This paper also addresses the availability of ore resources and reserves in the country. In particular, if they will represent a constraint if Chile increases its copper production through 2035 according to the full scenario. The variables included in this work to evaluate challenges of the industry in this scenario are the following: ore grades, energy and water consumptions, GHG emissions, and generation and disposal of tailings. All these elements have been considered key in studying the copper mining environmental footprint by Lagos et al. (2018), Ali et al. (2017), Aivazidou et al.

Its low atomic mass, low coefficient of thermal expansion and high electrochemical reactivity have made it a particularly attractive material for use in rechargeable batteries for consumer electronic devices, electric vehicles and grid storage systems. In a little more than two decades, lithium consumption has increased dramatically, its real price has jumped (see Fig. 1) and its supply has risen strongly. Estimated annual lithium carbonate prices per kg in the United States - real (2010) and nominal US dollars - 1990–2018. Source: United States Geological Survey (various years, a) In 2005, the US Geological Survey estimated the average annual real price of battery-grade lithium carbonate at around US$2 per kilogramme (at 2010 prices). By 2017, it had risen to US$13 per kilogramme (also at 2010 prices). Increasing supply in response to large profit margins finally led to falling real and nominal prices in 2018. After standing at about 40,000 t of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE)Footnote 1 per annum in 1995, annual world lithium consumption had risen to 277,000 t by 2018 (see Shabalala 2018).Footnote 2 The average rate of growth in lithium consumption between 1995 and 2017 was about 8% per annum. With further strongly increasing use in the battery sector, it is arguable that there will be average growth rates around 10% per annum or even higher during the next two decades. It seems certain, therefore, that annual consumption will exceed 300,000 t LCE by 2020. It should be more than 500,000 t per annum by 2025 and if this dramatic growth continues, lithium consumption (LCE) will exceed 1.5 million tonnes per annum by 2037. Chile has been a major producer of lithium and some of its associated first- (and later-) stage compounds such as lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide and lithium chloride since the commissioning of the brine operations of Sociedad Chilena de Litio Ltda. (SCL) in the Salar de Atacama in the Antofagasta administrative region in 1984. This importance increased with the opening of further brine operations by SQM, also in the Salar de Atacama, in 1995.Footnote 3 The two current Chilean lithium extraction operations stand out because of their large size, high lithium grades, proximity to good roads and ports, competitive processing costs, important co-products and by-products and low levels of impurities.Footnote 4 Subject to regulatory approval, each facility also has the capacity for expansion. These operations lie in a broad geographical region, known by industry commentators as “the lithium triangle”, that includes northern Argentina, northern Chile and southern Bolivia (see Fig. 2). The location of operating and key proposed projects in the “lithium triangle”—2018. Source: USGS, Company reports Most of Chile’s current reserves are in the Salar de Atacama, but there are also about 60 other lithium salt brines in Chile. Two high-grade deposits attracting recent attention are in the Salar de Pedernales and the Salar de Maricunga, each located several hundred kilometres south, in Chile’s Atacama administrative region. While there are lithium brines in Nevada in the US and in China, outside of South America companies have usually mined lithium compounds from hard rock deposits. The most competitive of these have recently been the spodumene obtained from the Greenbushes mine in Western Australia. This facility accounted for between just over 23% of world first-stage production in 1995. It had risen to more than 40% by 2017. Using the price estimates from Fig. 1 and production estimates from the USGS, it is possible to estimate approximately the value of first-stage lithium output over the 1994 to 2017 period for Chile. These points are plotted in Fig. 3. Value of first-stage lithium output (in US$ 2010)—Chile and the world The value of Chile’s lithium output stood at US$72 million in 1994. It fell to US$52 million by 2000 and then rose to US$107 million in 2006. At this point, Chile benefitted from the positive effect of the Chinese “super cycle” and also from the surge in demand for lithium batteries, which drove up lithium prices dramatically. The value of Chile’s lithium carbonate production rose to US$200 million by 2007, to US$500 million by 2012 and to more than US$800 million by 2017. It exceeded US$1 billion in 2018. There was a parallel surge in the value of world first-stage lithium output—reaching US$484 million in 2007, US$998 million by 2013 and US$2865 million in 2017. Jamasmie (2018) has observed recently that lithium is now Chile’s fourth largest export by value—following copper, molybdenum and iron ore. Though it commenced from a low base, consistently high annual growth has increased it to much greater economic importance in the Chilean economy. In passing, it is useful to compare this with the emergence of lithium in the Australian and particularly the Western Australian economy. As Table 1 shows, in 1995, Australian production stood at 9000 t of LCE (23.4% of world production) per annum. This increased more than 11 times to 99,500 t LCE by 2017. By comparison, Chilean lithium output from brines, which was also 9000 t (LCE) in 1995, had increased strongly to more than 70,000 t (LCE) per annum in 2012. It then stabilised briefly before rising to 75,000 t per annum by 2017 and 85,000 t per annum in 2018. Table 1 also shows that the slowing in the growth of Chilean lithium production after 2012 was offset by the expansion of Argentinian output. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the two main Argentinian operations produced more than 30,000 t of LCE in each year. Total annual Argentinian production had previously not exceeded 20,000 t LCE. Our expectation is that, since Chile has played the leading role in the lithium industry since 1995 and because it controls almost half of the world’s lithium reserves (see United States Geological Survey various years, b), the nation should continue as the world’s leading first-stage lithium producer in the foreseeable future. Yet on closer study, there now seems to be some questions about whether this is the case. Table 2 shows that, in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018, Australia had become the top-ranked producer of lithium. The gap widened dramatically in 2018 (see United States Geological Survey 2016b). The Chilean economic development agency (CORFO) that seeks “to improve the competitiveness and the productive diversification of the country by encouraging investment, innovation and entrepreneurship” has been responsible for allocating lithium extraction quotas since 1960. Quite recently, however, SCL (now owned by Albemarle) and SQM have struggled to negotiate new expanded long-term extraction contracts for their operations with CORFO. In Chile, lithium also has the rather unusual status of being a non-concessionable mineral because of its potential uses as a key material in the process of nuclear fusion.Footnote 5 Chile is the only country in the world where the government has made this categorisation. It means that the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission must also approve any new lithium extraction operation. This has also complicated the metal’s exploitation. There has typically been a major cost advantage in processing lithium-rich brines over hard rock (spodumene deposits), particularly in producing lithium carbonate. Writing recently, the Bloomberg journalists Lombrana and Gilbert (2017) noted that costs to extract lithium from brine ranged between US$2000 and US$3800 per tonne in countries such as Chile and Argentina. This compared with costs of US$4000 to US$6000 per tonne in Australia where there was hard rock mining of lithium at places such as Greenbushes and Ravensthorpe. It has recently, therefore, been a very profitable time to be a lithium producer. Contract market prices for lithium and its key compounds were particularly high in 2016 and 2017 (i.e. as much as US$15,000 per tonne), and spot prices were even higher. Lithium production was highly profitable. Given the nature of the lithium market, the competitive framework faced by lithium producers and the mineral policy environment which operates in Chile, the remainder of the paper assesses possible developments over the next decade. In a similar fashion to the situation in the copper industry, there is a strong desire by Chilean decision makers to extract lithium in a responsible way and, by adding value, utilise lithium reserves to contribute further to the nation’s economic development. Because Chile possesses about a half of identified world lithium reserves, lithium consumption has risen so much since the mid-1990s and the real price of lithium also increased dramatically; it is natural for local commentators to see great potential for expansion of the lithium sector, particularly in Chile’s Antofagasta region. This is influenced, however, by the competitive structure of firms mining lithium and the mineral policy framework in which they operate. In considering its recent past and looking at its future, the “Competition and market power in the lithium industry” section focuses on the industry’s competitive framework and how it has been changing. The brief “The Chilean government, mineral policy and lithium” section then considers mineral policy in general and Chile’s mineral policy more particularly. This provides a foundation in the “The National Lithium Commission, its findings and their implementation” section for a discussion of the recommendations of the National Lithium Commission, which reported to President Bachelet in 2015. The “Looking to the future” section then seeks to assess key developments that are likely to emerge from this process.",14

Aguilera,Roberto Aguilera,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Our paper proceeds as follows: This introductory section elaborates on the expectations for natural gas in the future. In Section 2 we briefly describe the Global Energy Market model (GEM). Section 3 examines historical decarbonization and provides projections of future decarbonization to the year 2040. Section 4 extends the vista with a projection of the energy mix and the corresponding carbon output to the year 2150. Section 5 discusses our results in the context of policy and technological efforts to stabilize climate. In the past half century, pollution and the environment has emerged as one of the dominant concerns in the public discourse about threats to humanity (Tilton and Guzmán 2016). As the world economy continues to expand over the long run, it has been argued that natural gas could play a significant role in satisfying energy demand and provide a bridge for largescale renewable energy use (Aguilera and Aguilera 2012; Hefner III 2009, among others). In contrast, some research casts doubt on the importance of gas as a transition fuel, given that it is a fossil fuel (e.g., Howarth 2014). In the short run, increased gas use will mostly be found in electricity generation, as there is potential for gas to take market share from coal in that sector, particularly in emerging Asia. In the long run, some possibilities are likely to exist in the transportation sector—where natural gas can compete with oil. The rapid growth of gas consumption in past decades is based on its many benefits relative to other fossil fuels: its wide geographical distribution, its affordability, and its environmental benefits (given the lower carbon intensity of gas compared with coal and oil). In addition, there is an abundance of gas resource endowments around the world. Apart from the vast conventional gas resources, there is potential for unconventional sources including tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane. In 2017, the contributions of coal and natural gas to the energy market stood at 28% and 23%, respectively, with oil at approximately 34%, and the balance of 15% consisting of hydroelectricity, nuclear, wind, and other minor sources (BP, annual). The GEM model adds to the existing literature on the energy mix but employs a unique methodology (see next section), in that, we start by observing the curvature on a graph given by the historical market share of each energy resource over time. We then develop the GEM which allows the data to determine the specified shapes of the curves. Next, the model is extended out of sample in order to make projections for the future. The close match of the historical data, generated by the GEM, provides some confidence that the estimates of the future are reasonable. Moreover, the baseline energy mix scenario remains unaltered since its creation in 2007, and the projection has proven accurate when compared with data from the last 10 years (Aguilera and Aguilera 2018). This contrasts with the work of other organizations, who revise energy mix projections annually based on the latest changes in investments, policies, and other variables. Figure 1 displays past energy mix data from 1850 to 2017. In addition, it shows an excellent historical match provided by the GEM (Aguilera and Aguilera 2018)—the GEM curves are developed with Eq. 2 and its variations, as presented in the next section. The figure also provides a projection to the year 2040, where gases—mostly in the form of methane, but also some solar, wind and hydrogenFootnote 1—have a clear lead in the energy market by that time. The validation of the GEM with data from the last 10 years, and the good fit with the preceding history, suggests the projections could be used with a reasonable level of assurance to inform the enactment of public policy. GEM curves generated in 2007 versus real data for wood, coal, nuclear, hydro, oil, and gases. Recent data (covering 2005–2017) from BP (annual) is represented by fat black markers.

John combines an inquiring mind, a rigorous grasp of economic theory and the powers of a great communicator. He is also somebody I am pleased to call my friend these past thirty-five years, since we first met at a UN meeting on deep sea mining in New York in 1983. In subsequent years, through various jobs, I have had the pleasure of undertaking several projects with John and sharing a number of adventures in places across the globe, including Sweden, France, Austria, Chile and Japan. I have learned an immense amount from him and, no less, have been a lucky beneficiary of his and Liz’s generous hospitality. One of the issues that has intrigued John over the years, and to which he has returned in his writings and speeches, is the issue of productivity in mining. In research published by Resources for the Future (RFF), John, along with Hans Landsberg, provided the definitive analysis of how the US copper industry saved itself by radically boosting its productivity in the 1980s (Tilton and Landsberg 1999). In later work, he addressed concerns that productivity in the mining industry might be in secular decline, demonstrating that productivity in mining is inherently cyclical, with high prices tending to suppress productivity as companies focus on volume, and with low prices tending to boost it as companies seek to reduce costs (Tilton 2014). He remained optimistic that, when the effects of the most recent boom had worked through, productivity growth in the industry would resume. The purpose of this paper, as a tribute to John Tilton, is to take a very long-term look at productivity and to see what, cutting through the natural cyclical variations in productivity, the data tell us about past trends in mining productivity and where it might now be headed. Productivity is, of course, key to all economic sectors as it central to a country’s general economic well-being. John’s chapter in the RFF study begins with the well-known quote by Paul Krugman that ‘Productivity isn’t everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country’s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker’. The notion of productivity, however, has particular significance in mining since mining operates in an industry with depleting assets. Productivity growth has first to overcome the effects of this before it can make any real headway. Although much discussion on depletion focuses on the issue of grade decline in the remaining available resources, depletion goes a bit wider than this. It can also take the form of higher stripping ratios (the need to remove more overburden), harder rock, more complex mineralogy and more impurities in the ore (necessitating more processing). Furthermore, it implies the need to safely dispose of—and pay for—increasing amounts of solid and liquid wastes. In the absence of a capacity for the positive contributors to productivity to outweigh the negative effects of depletion, then costs of mineral production must rise and so, eventually, must prices. Moreover, the nature of the commodity business hitherto, with its homogenised products, is such that producers can do little by way of branding or product differentiation to help boost the value of their output. It all comes down in the end to costs and, to a significant degree, this means productivity. There have, in recent years, been some worrying developments in industry productivity. Since around the year 2000, productivity in mining across the globe appears to have declined, and declined significantly. Figure 1 shows indexes of labour productivity and multifactor productivity for mining in Australia and the USA since 1990. Labour productivity (LP) is a simple measure of output per worker in mining. Multifactor productivity (MFP) is a more comprehensive indicator of productivity, which seeks to measure the efficiency with which capital, labour and intermediate products are converted into outputs. It is sometimes also referred to as total factor productivity. Productivity in the Australian and US mining industries. Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics, Estimates of Industry Multifactor Productivity, https://www.abs.gov.au; Bureau of Labor Statistics, data for ‘Mining, except Oil and Gas (NAICS 212)’, https://www.bls.gov Whichever measure is used—and, as Fig. 1 shows, it is often the case that these measures broadly move together—the trend in recent years is clear. There are, it is true, some signs of a turnaround since 2012, consistent with John’s view that productivity has a strong cyclical component and that much of the fall in productivity shown in the figure reflects the China-induced boom in prices that occurred from around 2004. However, it is also true that most readings on productivity are still a long way below their levels of 2000. Consistent with this observation, real terms operating costs for a number of major metals are still substantially higher than their pre-boom levels (Humphreys 2018). And then there is the rather awkward fact that the decline in productivity, in Australia at least, appears to have started before the boom got under way. Since the passing of the boom in 2012, mining companies have made growth in productivity a central plank of their efforts to boost their margins and recover the confidence of investors (BHP 2014). And yet accounting and consulting firm Deloitte was 2 years later still talking about ‘sliding productivity and spiralling costs’ in the mining industry (Deloitte 2014). The consulting group McKinsey’s proprietary MineLens Productivity Index (MPI), which showed a more than 35% drop in global mining productivity between 2004 and 2012, has since begun to recover, but the recovery is weak and the index remains over 30% below the levels attained before the boom (Lala et al. 2016; Flesher et al. 2018). In Chile, an analysis of the country’s copper industry showed at decline in MFP of between 68 and 85% between 2000 and 2009, although it has since recovered some ground (Solminihac et al. 2018). A more substantial recovery in mine productivity may come in time but, for the moment at least, there still seems to be a pretty major problem. Is depletion finally getting the upper hand?",31

The European imperial powers dividing Africa at the end of the nineteenth century spurred a scramble for African resources with horrifying consequences for Africans and their societies (Diogo and van Laak 2016). Although Africa has a mining and metallurgy tradition going far back, it was only with the diamond and gold rushes in southern Africa that Africa’s minerals resources came into focus (Yachir 1988). During the twentieth century, European and North American interests dominated African mining, with a short interlude of increased national control following independence and nationalisations in the middle of the century. In the early twenty-first century, a new scramble for Africa seemed to start (Southall and Melber 2009). The quick growth of Chinese mineral demand and the vast untapped resources of Africa attracted Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) into exploration and mining when domestic resources were no longer sufficient. Sinosteel’s acquisition of the Dilokong chromite mine in 1997 marked the start of Chinese investment into African mining. This was not, however, the first contact between African and Chinese miners. In 1904, in the aftermath of the Boer wars, the shortage of labourers on the South African gold mines was acute. In the next two years, a total of 64,000 indentured Chinese workers were imported to South Africa. In 1906, they represented 34% of the total number of unskilled workers on the mines. The Chinese workers were treated as an international commodity and stayed on a three-year contract with conditions in principle similar to the African migrant labour. In 1907, the risk of having a large group of Chinese workers as immigrants when their contract ended made the Chinese question a key issue in the elections in Transvaal. The Boer generals Smuts and Botha won the elections, and all the Chinese workers were repatriated to China after their contracts ended. By 1910, all of them had been shipped home (Allen 1992). It took almost 100 years for the next Chinese mine workers to arrive in South Africa. Serious worries about the new Chinese companies’ behaviour on the African and global mining scene, and the effects of their entry, have been voiced. From sensational and exaggerated statements like “the Chinese appear determined to pull all available levers, .... China’s resource undertaking is global and among the most aggressive in history,” (Moyo 2012 p. 3)Footnote 1 to academic research carefully studying various aspects of Chinese mining activities (for example: Cooke et al. 2015; Deng 2013; Kaplinsky and Morris 2009; Morgan 2019; Sautman and Hairong 2019). The cartoon in Fig. 1 illustrates the new situation—as it appears superficially and is generally presented in media: China is taking control over mineral resources in Africa, where the dominance of European and North American mining companies has been unchallenged for 150 years. It is, however, not possible to compare the slicing up of Africa by colonial powers and transnational mining companies in the twentieth century with Chinese presence today. The political situation with independent African states, new mining technology and public scrutiny and awareness of environmental and social issues caused by mining make it impossible for a Chinese mining company to act like Anglo American, Newmont or Union Minière did during much of the twentieth century. Cartoon of Chinese investors in African mining. Cartoon by Kevin KAL Kallaugher, The Economist, Kaltoons.com In order to gauge Chinese geopolitical influence in an area of such basic economic importance as security of mineral supply, it is crucial to get a correct understanding of the scale of Chinese mining overseas. Without an up-dated and fine-tuned view of Chinese control over mineral production globally, and in Africa specifically, any attempt to serious and realistic discussion becomes difficult. Our study shows firstly that Chinese control over mine production, in Africa and globally, is much smaller than generally anticipated,Footnote 2 and has evolved slowly, and evidently without any master plan, over the past 20 years. Secondly, that the concept of a ‘China Inc’, a coordinated Chinese government–led attempt to control flows of minerals to China is a simplification. The aim of this paper is three-fold: To measure Chinese control over global and African non-fuel mineral production. To monitor the development of this Chinese control over time. To analyse which companies are active and how they interact with Chinese state interests. The basis for the analysis is a mine by mine database built over more than 25 years monitoring all mines in the world: production, ownership and other details not only for Chinese companies but also for all companies (Raw Materials Data; Ericsson 2011). A detailed understanding of the size and extent of control by Chinese companies of mine production around the world forms the scientific basis for discussion of all other effects of these mining activities. The social, environmental and political consequences of Chinese investments and control over mine production are dealt with in many studies, on all Africa (Cheru and Obi 2010; Burgis 2015; Wegenast et al. 2017) or on specific aspects in certain countries where some studies are highly critical (Human Rights Watch 2011), while others compare Chinese practices with those of non-Chinese companies and come to the conclusion that there is not much difference (Jansson et al. 2009 p. 39; Sautman 2015; Sautman and Hairong 2012). These important topics are outside the scope of the present study. This paper starts with a review of Chinese overseas mining investments worldwide to give a background to the activities in Africa. A presentation of the most important Chinese companies engaged in overseas exploration projectsFootnote 3 and mining follows. We analyse in more detail the growth of Chinese control over African mining. We discuss what are likely future developments of Chinese control over global and African mine production. Finally, we make some observations about the effects of the entry of Chinese companies onto the global mining scene for international metal markets, African countries and Chinese domestic mining operations.

This note is based on the SITC, but there are common pitfalls in defining the scope of the minerals industry whichever basis is used. The next section delves into the data in some detail, as such burrowing is necessary to an understanding of the meaning and relevance of the aggregate measures. It is in no way a criticism of the World Bank or other providers of aggregate trade data, but rather an explanation of the data. The devil, as always, is in the detail. That may be well understood by specialist researchers into the minerals industry, but such rare individuals are not the target audience for this note. Perhaps the most widely quoted broad measure of minerals trade in general discussion is that of the World Bank, as published, for example, in its World Development Indicators. This covers total exports in divisions 27 (crude fertilisers, minerals not elsewhere specified), 28 (metalliferous ores and scrap) and 68 (non-ferrous metals) of Revision 4 of the SITC. The first column of the upper portion of Table 1 shows the figures for 2016,Footnote 1 as recorded in the United Nations’ Statistical Division’s Comtrade. The total of $525.2 billion excludes the exports of a number of mineral producing countries, such as Papua New Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo, for which Comtrade has no data. Some commentators (for example, Ericcson and Lӧf 2017) widen the definition of mineral trade to include pearls, precious stones and non-monetary gold (divisions 667 and 971 of SITC Rev.4). The totals for these are substantial, as shown in the lower portion of Table 1 and their inclusion greatly increases the value of mineral exports to $985 billion in 2016. An important caveat about using total exports as a measure is that they embrace re-exports as well as domestic exports. Re-exports are relatively insignificant for the narrower definition, accounting for little more than 2% of the published global total exports. They are far more important for precious stones and non-monetary gold, making up almost 20% of the total exports of these products. That means that re-exports account for just over 10% of the overall total shown in Table 1. In practice, re-exports are probably much greater than shown because many countries do not separately distinguish them. Looking beyond global figures, re-exports are important for some individual countries so that their inclusion can distort inter-country comparisons of export dependence. Domestic exports, as shown in the third column of Table 1, are a much cleaner measure, both for inter-country and for temporal comparisons.",

Davis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"One of the ways economists provide value to society is through the discovery of trends in noisy data. Such trends allow us to better understand economic phenomena and implement welfare-improving policies where necessary. For resource-based economies, such trends can prepare governments for what is to come and allow them to apply appropriate policy measures in a timely manner. John Tilton has long been fascinated by the resource curse, at first identified through case studies and later empirically confirmed by Sachs and Warner (1997), whereby countries rich in mineral and energy resources tend to grow more slowly in the short run than they would were they barren of resources (Davis and Tilton 2005, 2008; Tilton and Guzmán 2016). Davis (2013) confirmed that Sachs and Warner’s results were replicable and reasonably robust to sample and time period. Why this slower growth occurred was an open question at the time. John has suggested that corruption may be a contributing factor (Petermann et al. 2007). The deeper question is whether that slower growth would continue in the long run. This required an assessment of whether the slower short-run growth was a result of temporary disadvantages like rent-fueled corruption or long-term structural changes in the economy. Davis (2011) and James (2015) find that the slow growth was most likely a result of a temporarily booming but slow-growing resource sector, a “resource drag.”Footnote 1 Correspondingly, Alexeev and Conrad (2009) and Smith (2015) find no evidence that resource economies’ long-run growth has been negatively affected.Footnote 2 One remaining and equally serious concern is that these economies may nevertheless tend to suffer from higher-than-normal income inequality, leading to increased poverty levels for a given level of income. A higher poverty rate not only reflects increased misery but also affects long-run growth. In a 2008 paper, John acknowledged that such worsened income inequality may exist, and wrote then about his concern that a negative perception of the mining industry may alter the behavior of multilateral agencies and developing countries toward neglecting the mining sector (Davis and Tilton 2008). He saw this as “tragic.” There are arguably 40 to 50 economies in which mining or oil production is significant enough to affect their paths of development.Footnote 3 This is a quarter of the world’s economies. Establishing whether or not there is higher income inequality across this group of countries is an important step in guiding modern development policy. In honor of John’s many contributions to resources and development, and in celebration of his 80th birthday, I undertake such an investigation in this paper. As with the recourse curse, early concerns about income inequality in resource-rich economies arose from case studies and anecdotal observation. The popular press and the world’s blog space have been particularly active in this regard. Claims of general tendencies for resource-rich economies to have higher income inequality have also been made by academics (Engerman and Sokoloff 1997, 2002; Karl 2004; Sokoloff and Engerman 2000; Page 2006; Stiglitz 2006), non-governmental organizations (e.g., Ross 2001; Power 2002; Slack 2009; Society for International Development 2013), and multilateral development agencies (e.g., Nankani 1979). Income inequality can be a sign of a well-functioning economy transitioning along its optimal growth path (Leamer et al. 1999), though more recent thinking is that income inequality slows long-run growth (Easterly 2007; Ravallion 2012). Inequality could then undo the “distinct advantages” thought to be held by mining and oil countries like Libya, Zambia, Chile, and Peru only a few decades ago (Johnston and Kilby 1975, p. 11). These early suggestions spawned several empirical papers investigating the link between resource extraction and income inequality at the national level. In recognition of the low inequality in oil-based Canada and Norway, some suggested that negative outcomes only happen when political and institutional failures are present (Mehlum et al. 2006; Smith 2007; Morrison 2013). van der Ploeg (2011) summarizes the efforts as follows: “The best empirical evidence suggests that countries with a large share of primary exports in GDP have bad growth records and high inequality, especially if quality of institutions, rule of law, and corruption are bad” (p. 406). I read this to be an unconditional confirmation of a tendency toward higher income inequality in resource-rich nations, with a worsening situation in poorly-governed countries. Governments in resource-based countries have been fairly warned. Yet, I am not convinced on several fronts. First, the reported results are more nuanced than this. Second, as I will show in this paper, the papers that van der Ploeg cites, and many that have been produced since, suffer from a country sample that is small and missing many of the 40 to 50 resource economies in question due to lack of data on income inequality. This lack of data has been previously noted by Gelb and Associates (1988), Askari et al. (1997), and Ross (2007). This is problematic because the results from small-sample studies of development outcomes tend to be highly dependent on the chosen sample (Kaffine and Davis 2017). Kaffine and Davis (2017), for example, find that Mehlum et al.’s (2006) link between institutional quality and resource-based development outcomes is contingent on the inclusion of a single country in their sample, Malaysia. More importantly though, these studies omit the very case study countries like the Middle East that caused suspicions of high income inequality in the first place; the samples that are used are hardly representative (Ross 2007). A referee on a previous version of this paper, advocating for a case-by-case approach, observed that “Saudi Arabia and several other oil exporters in the Near East are clearly unequal societies whether or not their statistical offices compile Gini indices or not. As every journalist and newspaper reader knows, their inequality and lack of democracy can be traced in part to their oil abundance.” Whether or not one agrees with the suggested methodology, or with the assertion as to what can be known without supporting data, the importance of including these countries in the sample is clear. The earlier studies also omitted very poor countries such as Rwanda that have high income inequality and no natural resources. Finally, the common practice of normalizing mining and oil production using GDP risks biasing the results in favor of a negative outcome (Alexeev and Conrad 2009).Footnote 4 A better numeraire is population. I came to realize that if one studies income inequality in oil-rich countries without including the Middle East, one can say hardly anything about a broad relationship between oil and income inequality. A comprehensive analysis needs to include the extreme cases of both the resource-rich and resource-poor if the broad relationship between resources and inequality is to be tested. In response, in this paper, I use a simple but novel large-sample approach to investigate whether economies heavily involved in mining and oil production have higher income inequality as a result. The sample includes many of the resource-rich and resource-poor developing economies that have been left out of prior analyses, including all of the Middle Eastern economies save for Saudi Arabia. The cost of the larger sample is an analysis that omits many of the statistical controls found in other work. That is, my analysis looks for blunt and bold evidence of higher income inequality in resource-rich nations compared with resource-poor nations. It is not able to determine causes of that outcome or whether the outcome may be due to spurious correlates (e.g., some nations have more corruption, corruptions leads to less investment of mobile capital and more investment in immobile capital like mineral and energy resources, and such corruption also results in higher income inequality, leading to a false inference that resource extraction leads to higher inequality). I do control for regional differences in political and institutional quality in the hope that this will at least remove any first-order effects that a purely unconditional comparison of inequality would hide; Norway is not compared unconditionally with Angola. I first review the theoretical case for higher income inequality in mining and oil economies, something that has to my knowledge never been done, and then synthesize the existing empirical studies in a critical review, again something that has never been done. Finally, I examine income inequality in mining and oil economies using the most recent net income Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID) Gini index series by Solt (2016) that applies a missing-data algorithm to the WIID data set. The SWIID data set has unusually good coverage for mining and oil economies due to its imputations of missing data. The downside is that the data is imputed, and so each estimate has an associated standard error.",7
33,1,Mineral Economics,24 May 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-019-00190-7,Short-term price volatility and reversion rate in mineral commodity markets,July 2020,Diego García,Juan Ignacio Guzmán,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Prices of many mineral commodities fluctuate greatly over the short-term (Tilton and Guzmán 2016). As a matter of fact, it is not unusual for prices to double or fall by half within a year or two. Rapid, unexpected and, often, large movements in commodity prices are an important feature of their behavior (Cashing and McDermott 2002). As Brunetti and Gilbert (1995) indicate, this phenomenon—called price volatility—measures how much a price changes either about its long-term level or about a long-term trend. Price volatility measures the variation on prices typically over a day to day, week to week, month to month, or year to year frequency. Following the standard literature (see, for example, Brunetti and Gilbert 1995), it can be computed as the standard deviation of logarithm of prices on a sample over a period. Mathematically: where \( \overline{\ln (P)} \) is the price average natural logarithm over the T periods. Hence, price volatility is a statistical measure of the tendency of a commodity’s price that varies over time.Footnote 1 Price volatility is known to create vulnerabilities, as well as opportunities, not just for producing firms and countries, but also for consumers and investors (both speculative and non-speculative). As Jacks et al. (2011) indicate, shocks of commodity prices are a key source of macroeconomic instability in commodity-specialized countries, with recognizable implications for their long-term growth. On the other hand, consumers and firms also suffer from price volatility, since they cannot make accurate planning decisions. For investors, as established by Hull (2015), the level of price volatility is also relevant for option pricing purposes which are typically associated with opportunities rather than vulnerabilities. The presence of price volatility has led to numerous efforts to stabilize commodity markets, which, for the most part, have had null or limited success. In the context of mineral commodities, as Tilton and Guzmán (2016, ps. 105–109), among others, indicate, it is also believed that investors and speculators accentuate price volatility over the short-term and long-term trends. Pindyck (2004) examines the role of price volatility in short-term commodity market dynamics and its determinants, developing a structural model for inventories, spot, and futures prices. He estimates this model by using daily and weekly data for crude oil, heating oil, and gasoline. However, his model does not recognize the role of dynamic adjustments over supply and demand to reach market equilibrium. Additionally, at least to our knowledge, the existing literature has been limited regarding the number of commodities under study. In this way, Brunetti and Gilbert (1995) used a record of daily prices from the London Metal Exchange to construct a set of monthly price volatility measures over a 24-year period (1972–1995) for six LME metals—aluminum, copper, nickel, lead, tin, and zinc. Labys et al. (2000) studied the cyclical nature of 21 primary commodity price series (8 of them minerals, 12 agricultural products, and 1 energy-related commodity), employing monthly volatility measures to assess the amplitude of cycles. More recently, Prokopczuk et al. (2017) analyzed the variance risk premium in commodity markets over a monthly basis, using a sample composed of 21 commodities from a variety of sectors, including only 3 minerals. Crucial to the understanding of price volatility is the stochastic behavior of commodity prices, which allows to mathematically link price with volatility. The stochastic price equation plays a central role not only in models for valuing financial contingent claims but also in the procedures for evaluating investments to extract or produce the commodity (Schwartz 1997). A classic example in continuous time is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which is a well-supported stochastic equation for mineral commodity prices that takes into account price mean reversion (i.e., the assumption that price will tend to move to the average price or long-run price over time) as well as a linear volatility relationship. This process could be mathematically described by Øksendal (2003): In this stochastic equation, the parameter η > 0 is referred as reversion rate and it measures the degree of mean reversion to the long-term mean price, \( \overline{P} \). In this equation, the term dZt corresponds to a standard Brownian motion; i.e., dZt~N(0, dt), which, in technical literature, is known as the Wiener differential. In discrete time, price in eq. (2) is related to an autoregressive process of order 1, or AR(1). These processes satisfy the following general equation: where εt is an error term (typically normally distributed). Under (3), the reversion rate to the long-term price is given by Dixit and Pindyck (1994): Equation (4), and the fact that the regression coefficient β1 is market specific, suggests that every market can have its own reversion rate, which is expected since each market presents different conditions to reach the market equilibrium. There are many factors that can affect the nature of market fundamentals (supply and demand), which can vary greatly from one mineral commodity to another (Tilton and Guzmán 2016). Furthermore, as Boland (2017, p. 29) establishes too, while the price can change in the right direction, it may easily be that the equilibrium is never reached in practice. Therefore, time to reach the equilibrium is a critical concept here, one which, in our opinion, has not been sufficiently studied in the economic literature.Footnote 2 The reversion rate and its relationship with market equilibrium has been addressed before in economic literature. In fact, Boland (2017, p. 28) indicates that equilibrium model builders must deal with how fast and in what direction the price changes,Footnote 3 referring in this context to both speed and direction of adjustment. Although the reversion rate concept has not been explicitly named before in microeconomic literature (at least to our knowledge), it has been referred as the speed of adjustment toward an equilibrium state of a market, and it has been represented by a mathematical specification.Footnote 4 A key property of a mean-reverting process in both continuous and discrete time is the half-life time, i.e., the time required to achieve half the distance between the current price and that defined by the long-term. As Skorodumov (2008) shows, the half-life time for the AR(1) process given by equation (3) is t1/2 = ln(2)/η. It is clear from this that η tending to infinity implies an instantaneous convergence to equilibrium, while η tending to zero implies no convergence at all. Figure 1 represents graphically this. While the time to reach halfway of long-term price equilibrium takes ln(2)/η, the convergence to reach any degree of proximity (let us say α-close to an equilibrium state) takes a time tα~O (1/η)Footnote 5. Time to attain long-term price equilibrium The above suggests that the larger the reversion rate, the smaller the time to reach the equilibrium condition (note that since convergence is asymptotic in the case of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or an AR(1) process, the long term is never achieved, but only sufficiently approached). Then, given that η belongs to an individual characteristic of a single market, such time will vary over the set of commodities to study. The standard mineral economics theory, as Radetzki and Wårell (2017, ps. 88–89) and Tilton and Guzmán (2016, ps. 97–102) posit, establishes that short-term price volatility arises because demand varies greatly over the business cycle, while supply is fixed on the same time horizon due mainly to capacity restrictions. The main argument offered to justify supply stickiness is that lead times in mining are significant. As a matter of fact, the time elapsed from the first discovery to a decision to invest will normally exceed a decade for a large mineral deposit, and construction itself is likely to be extended over several years, requiring about two additional years for a large mine, from the start-up, to reach and sustain its design capacity (Brannon et al. 2011, p. 1437). In practice, however, supply could shift at some level in the short term in the pursuit of adjusting to the expected demand (Guzmán 2019). This dependence of the supply curve movement on a demand curve’s shift is caused by the supply-side market participants who alter their behavior in pursuit of maximum profits. Radetzki and Wårell (2017, ps. 92–96) recognize this instability in the short-term supply, suggesting different reasons, that range mine closures or change in mine plans to changing macroeconomic factors (input prices and foreign exchanges). The above can be clarified by taking as example the copper market. As Auger and Guzmán (2010) discussed, the investment in copper mines can take between 3 and 7 years for brownfield and greenfield projects. Hence, there seems to be no possibility to adjust capacity of production over the short term. However, when redfield projectsFootnote 6 are considered, capacity can be expanded in the short term (even in a period as short as several months). Thus, part of the short-term supply for copper is not perfectly rigid as suggested by traditional mineral economics. As above established, demand and supply adjustments depend specifically on the commodity market. So, for example, copper producers do not necessarily have the same adjustment capacity that diamonds, aluminum, or lithium have. Not all producers need the same time to increase their production, just as not all consumers need the same time to substitute or eventually buy more or less of a certain commodity. This article seeks to deepen into the traditional mineral economics explanation about short-term price volatility by specifically trying to incorporate the role played by the time required to achieve a long-term equilibrium state in the determination of price volatility. As we will propose in the conceptual section, our hypothesis states that in mineral commodity markets, there should be an inverse relationship between short-term price volatility and reversion rate. At least, to our knowledge, nobody has suggested this relationship before, which, in our opinion, is explained because the current microeconomic theory is built mainly on an instantaneous adjustment to the long-term equilibrium price. The paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the conceptual framework for the analysis. The third section shows the empirical analysis carried out and presents the main results. Concluding remarks follow.",4
33,1,Mineral Economics,15 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-020-00230-7,Attracting mining investments: the relationship between natural endowments and public policies,July 2020,José Joaquín Jara,Stefano Delucchi,Carlos Marquardt,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The years that Professor John Tilton spent in Chile left a profound mark in our country, especially in the Department of Mining Engineering at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (DIM-UC). In 1999, Professor Gustavo Lagos, at that time director of the Mining Center UC, invited John (who was recently starting the retirement process at Colorado School of Mines) to come to Chile and assist him in creating an academic program in mineral economics. Despite the relevance of the mining industry, no academic programs or research groups dealing with these issues were active in our country at that time. The program would be funded by the state and the local industry. And so it was. As a result, Professor Tilton was made a full professor at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (UC), he spent one semester per year in Chile for more than 15 years, and a Master of Science program in mineral economics was created. During that period, John regularly gave a course on mineral economics, guided and co-guided over two dozen master and doctoral students, and contributed editorially and with articles to the publication of 8 books in Spanish on a series on mineral economics (Foro en Economía de Minerales), and with papers in peer reviewed journals. Professor Tilton still participates, now from the USA, in co-guiding masters and Ph.D. students, and he is active publishing academic articles jointly with professors at UC and with his former students, now renowned experts in the mineral economics. This experiment was not only highly successful but also turned out to be quite invigorating, contributing with new ideas and research hypothesis for different topics in the field. An advisory committee to the program was created with the participation of other world renowned mineral economists, namely Professor Marian Radetzki, formerly at Lulea University in Sweden, Dr. David Humphreys from Rio Tinto in the UK, and Professor Roderick Eggert from the Colorado School of Mines in the USA. The Chilean members of this board were Professor Marcos Lima, a former Codelco CEO, and Professor Gustavo Lagos. This group would meet periodically, generating the most exciting discussions and issuing relevant research questions for the students. Following the best academic traditions, John would arrive to lunch and coffee time, always with a small piece of paper containing a list of topics to be discussed. And he made sure that everyone else understood the fine arguments that he was putting forward, which were not always shared by all the participants. Professor Tilton’s intellectual contribution to the mining industry in Chile is manifested. Though, anybody who had the pleasure to meet him knows that his most significant legacy remains in his humanity: extremely kind, especially with students and personnel; always open to listen others and to share his wisdom and knowledge; constantly worried about the person and their relatives; and with a genuine concern about the underprivileged of our societies. In this regard, his wife Liz have played a crucial role in organizing and supporting John’s long visits to Chile, but more in creating a warm and kind atmosphere to those of us who had the pleasure to share with them in Chile. A recurrent topic in our conversations with John during his years in Chile was the pathways that different mineral rich countries experienced in terms of their mining sectors. John always highlighted the case of Chile and how its good public policies beneficiated the country and the fact that (almost) nobody questioned these policies. Finally, these discussions led to the publication of a couple of scientific articles: the first one dealing with the problem to measure countries’ long-term mining competitiveness (Jara et al. 2008) and the second one trying to model, through cross-country regressions, the relationship between natural endowments and public policies in assessing the attraction of mining investments (Jara 2017). The aim of this paper, as a tribute to John Tilton and a way to maintain his legacy in such a difficult time for our country, is to give additional support to one of his several key contributions to the field of mineral economics: to strongly remark and communicate the essential role of public policies for having local mining sectors that could contribute to the sustainable development of countries, especially in developing economies. The ownership structures of the extractive industries followed divergent patterns in the last decades. In the oil and gas sector, state-owned companies took the control of a major share in global reserves and production in many countries. At the same time, most countries that are naturally rich in metals, uranium, and coal deposits, privatized their mining industries (Jara et al. 2008). This led to a prominent participation of private multinational enterprises in mining worldwide. As a result, jurisdictions avid to attract investments to find and exploit their mineral deposits contend for international capitals. This situation led to policymakers, analysts, and companies to think about the factors affecting the competitiveness of mining districts. Usually competitiveness is measured by the market share captured by a company, an economic sector or a country, which could be increased through providing cheaper or better products to the costumers. However, the mining industry produce mineral commodities that are (in general terms) homogeneous and standardized. Thus, the only way for companies or countries to raise their mining competitiveness is reducing their costs (Tilton 1992). Mining costs strongly depend on a series of variables related to the natural characteristics of the ore bodies and the methods used to exploit them. Some are geologic in nature as the size of the deposit, its depth of emplacement, and the distribution of its grades. Others are technical like the mining method to extract the ore or the metallurgical process to obtain the final product. All these factors deal with the main concerns of mining professionals and frequently can determine the economic viability of a mining operation without any other consideration. This partial view (historically, the company space of action; currently, the operation’s one) led to the traditional paradigm of competitiveness in mining: the capacity of a country or jurisdiction to attract investments and develop a local mining industry is a function exclusively of the quantity and quality of the deposits within its territory. Without them, there is almost nothing that companies or governments can do to improve their position. This conceptual model is based on the literature on international trade and particularly on the factor endowment theory (Heckscher 1949), which states that countries tend to produce and export the goods that can be cheap to produce in their territories. Thus, China and India should export goods that are labor intensive, Australia, those that are reliant on natural resources, and the UK, the products or services dependent on financial sources. Consequently, mineral commodities should be produced in and exported by countries on which deposits are richer and mining costs smaller. However, the evidence suggests that the natural endowment of a country cannot completely explain its capacity to attract mining investments (Tilton 1983; Jara 2017). In the 1960s and 1970s, several resource-rich countries implemented actions to increase taxes and nationalize companies and other policies in order to increase the government’s share of the mining rents. The result in most cases was stagnation, or even reduction, in their global share of mineral commodities production, despite their enormous, high-quality mineral resources (Tilton 1992). Therefore, during the 1980s and first half of the 1990s, an alternative paradigm was built to assess the variables that influence the attraction of mining investments. It stated that the previous conception of mining competitiveness is not incorrect but incomplete, because companies not only look for a good geologic potential but also for a favorable investment climate (Tilton 1992). Among the factors frequently included in a good investment climate were the following: availability of infrastructure; skilled local workforce and advanced human capital; sociopolitical stability; clear, long-term regulations and institutions; adequate tax regime; and specific regulatory framework to enhance mining activities (Johnson 1990; Fraser Institute, several years). There have been more than 30 years since the inception of this alternative paradigm, a concept that currently has a broad acceptance within the industry and most governments worldwide. However, only a couple of scientific works (Khindanova 2005, 2006, 2007, 2011Footnote 1; Jara 2017) have tried to validate it with empirical data. In her works, Khindanova (2005, 2006, 2007) explained the country allocation of nonferrous exploration budgetsFootnote 2 in 2002 (MEG 2003) through different variables representing the geological potential and the investment climate of the jurisdictions included in her datasets. Also, Jara (2017) tested both mining attractiveness paradigms against empirical information for the year 2014. These studies have relevant shortcomings, despite their substantial contribution, the most relevant of which is their restricted temporal representation (only 1-year datasets for the analysis of an industry characterized by its long-term perspective). The purpose of this work is to provide empirical evidence to analyze the attraction of mining investments by countries in a wider temporal timeframe, by extending the work of Jara (2017) to the period 1996 to 2014. Consequently, the article is structured as follows: previous studies are reviewed in the “Previous works’ review” section; The “Data description” section presents the data used in the study; the models, criteria selection and results are shown in the “Model specifications, criteria selection, and results” section; and finally, The “Discussion and recommendations” section discusses the main outcomes of the research and provides some recommendations for future works.",2
33,1,Mineral Economics,28 October 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-019-00208-0,Short-term supply and demand of graduate mining engineers in Australia,July 2020,Peter F. Knights,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Mining engineers play a vital role in Australia’s mineral industries. To quote a recent MEA curriculum review committee (Hebblewhite 2019): “Mining engineering is the practice of applying engineering principles to the evaluation, planning, operations, closure and reclamation of mines in a safe, profitable and socially acceptable way.” In short, without mining engineers, Australia will be unable to sustainably evaluate, plan, operate, or close and reclaim mines. The income derived from the mining industry would be drastically curtailed, and the liability associated with closed mines is magnified. The supply and demand for graduate mining engineers is therefor of great relevance to the industry. It is relatively straightforward to quantify the short-term supply of new mining engineering graduates. Seven tertiary institutes offer undergraduate BE and BE (hons) programs in mining engineering across Australia. Estimating supply, therefor, is a simple matter of collecting graduate statistics from each of these institutions. Estimating demand for graduate mining engineers, however, is more challenging. Previous unpublished studies of demand for graduate mining engineers simply assume a growth rate for mining engineers, and an attrition rate to account for attrition, retirements, and promotions outside the mining engineering technical roles. These growth projections have a very little scientific basis. The Minerals Council of Australia recognize that the job market for graduate mining engineers is likely to become extremely tight by 2022 with enrolments down to just 50 students per year (as reported by AFR, Feb. 2019). A search of seek.com, Australia’s most popular online employment website, for mining engineers revealed 1213 jobs on offer as of 25 Sept. 2019. The website predicts a projected job growth of negative 5.7% over the next 5 years from 2018 to 2023. This is taken from the Australian Government Labour Market Information Portal (see LMIP 2019) and is derived by combining forecasts from autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and exponential smoothing with damped trend (ESWDT) model, with some adjustments for future industry developments. The negative growth rate at the time where Australia is experiencing increased demand for skilled mining personnel highlights the inadequacy of this method. ARIMA estimates may fail to adequately reflect sudden upswings in employment due to cyclical commodity price movements. Demand is primarily a function of the development of new expansions and mining projects, as well as replacement of mining engineers due to attrition, promotion, and retirement. Figure 1 shows the trend in Australian mining capital expenditure (CAPEX) from 1988 to 2017, derived from a database of CAPEX by the mining industry as maintained by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS 2019). The ABS divides this according to two categories: (i) mining building and infrastructure, and (ii) mining plant, equipment, and machinery. The former represents CAPEX investment in new projects or expansions, while the latter includes sustaining CAPEX associated with fleet replacement. A peak in investment occurred over the 2012–2014 period, with CAPEX declining since this time. In 2017, mining building and infrastructure investment was a little over $31 billion. Given the slowing pace of the world economy (particularly China), it is quite possible to see building and infrastructure investment continuing to decline below $20 billion within the next 3 years. Australian mining capex investment 1988–2017 (source, ABS 2019) Figure 2 is reproduced from an ABS special feature on investment in the mining sector. Oil and gas investment makes up to almost 60% of all CAPEX investment over the period in question. Investment in metal and coal mining reached their peaks in June 2012. Oil and gas investment continued to increase until peaking 18 months later in December 2013. Australian mining capex investment by subdivision, 2005–2015 (ABS Cat. 5206.0, Sept. 2015)",8

33,1,Mineral Economics,08 May 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-019-00184-5,Metal markets and recycling policies: impacts and challenges,July 2020,Patrik Söderholm,Tomas Ekvall,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"During recent decades, an increasingly expanding global economy has led to concerns over the exploitation of the earth’s natural resources, about the environmental impacts as well as about impending resource shortages (e.g., Hashimoto et al. 2012). The promotion of circular material use, including not least recycling and reuse, are deemed necessary in order to reduce the generation of waste and the economy’s dependency on the extraction of primary (virgin) raw materials. Recycling of materials may save resources and energy, and delay the depletion of virgin natural resources. In the metals industry, secondary (i.e., recycled) materials compete with primary materials, which depend on the extraction of non-renewable resources. Scrap materials, or secondary metals in processed form, can sometimes be relatively cheap to produce compared to primary materials, at least in the cases where the scrap collection costs are not excessively high. Furthermore, the costs for exploration, mining, and primary refining have already been taken, and the energy requirements are lower. Moreover, as mining enterprises must resort to lower-grade, and more remote, mineral deposits, the costs of primary (virgin) material production may increase over time,Footnote 1 therefore further improving the competitiveness of secondary metal production (Tilton 2000). Due to the often high value of secondary metals, recycling of copper, aluminum, steel, etc. has been undertaken for almost as long as these metals have been used, and typically in the absence of any policy intervention. This has been the case for other secondary materials as well, including recycled newsprint and paperboard (e.g., Mansikkasalo et al. 2014). However, increased metal recycling may also face a number of barriers, such as failures to internalize the environmental external costs associated with primary metal production and use, and a lack of technological change facilitating the recyclability of various products (e.g., EEA 2017). The establishment of efficient secondary metal markets may also be hampered by incomplete information about the quality of various waste products (Nicolli et al. 2012; Milios 2018). For this reason, in many countries, far-reaching policy instruments have been undertaken—and/or are planned—to promote further recycling of various secondary materials, and other efforts aiming at closing the material loops. For instance, in 2015, the European Commission adopted its Circular Economy Package, which includes legislative proposals on waste and a detailed action plan with measures covering the entire material cycle: from production and use to waste management and the market for secondary materials (European Commission 2015). Recycling policies often rely on price signals and economic incentives, e.g., surcharges on the disposal of recyclable products, tradable recycling credit schemes, subsidies to recycling programs, and virgin material taxes (e.g., Finnveden et al. 2012). Clearly, the assessment of the effectiveness and the efficiency of such policies must take into account the functioning of the already existing economic markets for the materials, and thus shed light on the relevant demand and supply responses. The respective policy impacts are complex also because while policies often are implemented at the national level, the affected economic markets, for instance, scrap metals, tend to be international in scope. In this paper, we synthesize the existing literature with the purpose of discussing (1) the impacts of various recycling policies on metal markets in which aggregate demand can be met by both primary and secondary production, and (2) a number of challenges that policy-makers need to confront in choosing between various types of recycling policies and policy designs. In achieving the first purpose, we use a (graphical) static partial equilibrium model describing the long-run interactions between primary and secondary production in satisfying a given (exogenous) material demand. This simple model is used as pedagogical tool for investigating the market impacts of three different types of recycling policies: tradable recycling credits, a virgin materials tax, and a recycling subsidy. We devote particular attention to the price responses and the resulting competition between secondary and primary production. The second objective is achieved by drawing on the literature on addressing environmental externalities in waste management policy (Dinan 1993; Fullerton and Kinnaman 1995; Walls and Palmer 2001; Ino 2011). Efficient waste management policies, though, depend also on the presence of well-functioning economic markets for the recycled materials, i.e., markets characterized by low transaction costs, transparent information, etc. Still, a limited number of studies have analyzed various second-best cases, thus assuming that recycling markets are not operating due to the presence of high transaction costs, information failures, etc. (Calcott and Walls 2000, 2005; Fullerton and Wu 1998).Footnote 2 Throughout the paper, we consult the empirical literature on supply and demand conditions in secondary material markets, and with strong emphasis on scrap metals. Specifically, quite a few econometric studies provide estimates of the own-price elasticities of supply and demand. In the case of secondary metals, these have focused on copper, aluminum, steel, and typically on North American market conditions. The copper studies include, for instance, Bonzcar and Tilton (1975), Gómez et al. (2007), Slade (1980a, 1980b), and Stollery (1983), where the last two also investigate aluminum and steel recycling, respectively. Blomberg and Hellmer (2000) and Blomberg and Söderholm (2009) study the price responsiveness in the European secondary aluminum market, while the US steel scrap market has been analyzed by Barnett and Crandall (1986).Footnote 3 Moreover, since recycled metal has represented a significant share of total metal consumed, econometric models of metal markets, aimed at studying primary metal supply and demand, often include descriptions of the associated secondary markets. Examples of such work are the copper studies of Fisher et al. (1972), Wagenhals (1984), Suan Tan (1987), and an early analysis of the aluminum industry by Charles River Associates (1971). The analysis in the present paper draws on the results from these empirical studies of supply and demand behavior (e.g., own-price elasticities of supply and demand) in various metals markets. Still, it differs from the above studies—including previous literature reviews—in that it focuses in more detail on the impacts of three different types of policy instruments on the metal markets, explicitly taking into account the market interactions between virgin and secondary metal production (Sigman 1995; Palmer et al. 1997).Footnote 4 In addition, we compare the possible market impacts of a global recycling policy versus the case of unilateral policies. The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we outline the generic partial equilibrium model describing the interactions between primary and secondary production in satisfying a given overall material demand. This model is then used to investigate the various material market impacts of three recycling policies implemented at the global level in the international market: tradable recycling credits, virgin materials tax, and recycling subsidy. We also briefly comment on the case of a unilateral policy in only one country (or a subset of countries), not least discussing under what circumstances a national policy would affect the global material market as well as some important consequences if it does. In a final step, we identify a number of challenges that policy-makers will need to address in choosing between—as well as implementing—various policy instruments and mixes. These challenges include improving the functioning of secondary material markets, designing efficient recycling policy instrument mixes, and regulating through price or quantity. Some concluding remarks and implications are provided in a final section.",20

During that time, Azerbaijan was delivering more than half of global oil output. From the early stages of industrialization until the end of the Second World War, Baku produced, with short interruptions during the years of the New Economic Policy, the lion’s share of oil and kerosene within the former Soviet Union (FSU) (LeVine 2007). The Absheron Peninsula continued to play a central role in the energy complex of the FSU until the late 1950s (Sicotte 2018). This role was not limited to the supply of fuel. Between the 1960s and 1980s, Azerbaijan enhanced the offshore oil production over creation of the unique living and logistics infrastructure, known as the Oil Rocks, by building artificial islands on the Caspian Sea. Since the early 1960s, Baku emerged as an engineering base and innovation hub for the extractive industries in the expanding petroleum basins of the FSU as well as countries within its political and economic orbit. Hence, Baku contributed strongly to the exploration and exploitation of the petroleum riches of the West Siberian petroleum basin, Central Asia, and Northern Vietnam. Azerbaijani enterprises were the key suppliers of the machinery both for offshore and onshore oil and gas extraction in the whole area of the FSU, Eastern Europe, China, Vietnam, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and a number of African countries. In 1949, the first offshore oil wells were drilled 1100 m beneath the Caspian Sea. More than 75% of the needs of the petroleum industry of the FSU were delivered by 20 large petroleum machinery companies in Azerbaijan, which were in the list of the 500 largest industrial enterprises of the FSU and contributed substantially to the local employment. Petroleum sector has been the leading sector of the Azerbaijani industrialization since the early 1960s giving growth and development impulses to all the other sectors of the economy. Nevertheless, with the collapse of the Soviet Union like all other sectors of Azerbaijani economy, oil and gas sector also underwent the blow of the severe structural crisis (Sabiroglu and Bashirli 2012). Thus, “The Contract of Century” signed with the predominantly Western companies on September 20, 1994, was considered as an attempt to resuscitate Azerbaijani economy. Since then, more than 30 additional production sharing agreements (PSA) on the exploitation of both offshore and onshore oil reserves. The local industry and economists were sure that Azerbaijan would not experience the enclave mining experience due to its high skilled labor force, well-known research, and development institutions in the field of geology, geophysics, and petroleum machinery and the existence of the globally known universities in the field of petroleum engineering (Muradov et al. 2019). This is why from the very beginning of opening of Azerbaijan for the foreign direct investments (FDI) in the petroleum sector in the early 1990s, Azerbaijani government followed not the In-Country-Value (ICV) but rather the revenue-focused approach and confined its local content policies only to the field of education of the petroleum sector staff to implement the nationalization of employment plan for 5 years from the beginning of operations (Safaraliyeva 2018). In the face of the huge investment requirements and absence of the alternatives to the FDI, following a more intensive local content approach could lead to the substantial protraction of the exploration of the petroleum riches in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea. The risks of the domestic or local content policies have already been shown on the theoretical level in Grossman (1981). According to the production sharing agreements that serve as the major legal basis for the international cooperation in the field of hydrocarbons, the investments in education of the local staff members are reducing the taxable income of the oil and gas companies with international capital (Tordo et al. 2013). In addition, there is a 10% export and import tax duty advantage for companies operating predominantly in Azerbaijan. The comparison of these policies with other oil extracting and exporting countries indicates that Azerbaijan, in tendency, has not been following the In-Country-Value (ICV) but rather the revenue-focused approach in the management of oil and gas sector (Brand 2017). The confinement of the local content policies only to the fields of the local employment of the qualified staff members and some minor tax advantages has been yielding substantial benefits also for the multinational enterprises (Auty 2006; Kazzazi and Nouri 2012). The lack of capital after the severest structural crisis which came to its own with the fall of the economic ties with the other republics of the FSU leads also to the break-up of the market for the products of the chemical industry, petroleum machinery, and geophysical services in the entire area of the post-socialist block. Substantial petroleum reserves, nevertheless, attracted oil companies like BP, ExxonMobil, Shell, Amoco, Saudi Aramco, and Statoil, which constituted Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC), a consortium for the exploration of three major oil fields of Azerbaijan. This leads to the introduction of the advanced European and US-American petroleum technologies in the oil sector of Azerbaijan. Despite employment of the local engineers, the technology for the offshore oil and gas extraction has been entirely imported. Only the onshore oil drilling rigs are overwhelmingly produced by the local engineering companies subcontracted mainly by the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR). Sabiroglu and Bashirli (2012) investigated the contribution of the oil and gas sector to the output of the nonoil sector and the total factor productivity of Azerbaijan in the IO framework. Their assessment covered the early year of the international FDI boom in the petroleum sector, 2001, and 2006, the year of the commensuration of the big oil exports over Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline. The authors detected only negligible contribution of oil-led growth on the total factor productivity and the nonoil sector output. Sadik-Zada (2016) assessed the output linkages of the petroleum sector on the Azerbaijani economy in 2006 and 2009. The paper in hand complements the mentioned surveys by focusing on the three early boom years, 2006, 2008, and 2009, and dwells not only on the output but also on the employment linkages of the petroleum sector with the rest of the Azerbaijani economy. In addition, assessment of three time periods enables the insights with regard to the dynamics of the production and employment linkages over time. The dynamics of the linkage effects could also serve as an indicator for the success in harnessing the local potential by international oil companies. In 2012, Azerbaijan has reached its peak oil and the oil revenues will continue to decline until 2024. Nevertheless, in the coming decade, Azerbaijan is going to commence large-scaled gas exports to Europe. According to the estimations of the experts of the Oxford Center for Energy Studies, until 2047, Azerbaijan will be one of the major gas suppliers in south-eastern EU and Turkey. The finalization of the Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline (TANAP) and TransAdriatic Pipelines (TAP) connecting Shah-Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan to Europe closed the last infrastructure gap for the realization of this project (Pirani 2018; Rzayeva 2015). Hence, in the coming years, the question of the integration of the petroleum sector into the rest of Azerbaijani economy will not cease to dominate the economic policy debate in Azerbaijan.",39
34,1,Mineral Economics,18 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-019-00206-2,Use of artificial intelligence to assess mineral substance criticality in the French market: the example of cobalt,April 2021,Fenintsoa Andriamasinoro,Raphael Danino-Perraud,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"To secure a supply of mineral raw materials in France, its public and commercial stakeholders need to have a vision of the challenges we face and how the criticality of these raw materials changes in France (Critic_FR 2018). As France has little or no deposits, whether we are talking about lithium (Daw and Labbé 2012), cobalt (Audion et al. 2014), or other substances, any study of criticality by French entities goes beyond France and also includes a broader review, covering either the European Union or the whole world. These studies are conducted on at least two different scales and have to be spelled out separately to define each scale covered in the study. Substances have a specific criticality value because the scale for the level above is not representative enough of the study for us to be able to ignore the lower scale. To illustrate our comments, we compare the criticality study developed at the EU scale (EcCRM 2017) with the study conducted by the French geological survey just on France scale (Critic_FR 2018). We should start by saying that these two studies position each mineral substance on the same criticality axes SR (supply risk) and EI (economic importance of the metals), commonly used by many companies and institutions who work on both of these scales. Regarding the study carried out by the European Union (EcCRM 2017), the 2017 criticality assessment was carried out for 61 candidate materials (58 individual materials and 3 material groups: heavy rare earth elements, light rare earth elements, and platinum group metals, amounting to 78 materials in total); the EI provides insight into the importance of a material for the EU economy and the SR axis reflects the risk of a disruption in that material’s supply in the EU. As for the French study, conducted by the “Comité des métaux stratégiques” (COMES) established by the French Ministry in charge of mineral raw materials not used for energy, 31 substances were covered at the end of 2018 (Crit_BRGM 2015)—updated in 2019. The results are summarized in a criticality matrix for metals and illustrated in Fig. 1, adapted from (Critic_FR 2018). Criticality matrix of mineral substances or groups of substances in France, adapted from (Critic_FR 2018) To show the difference between the two spatial scales in the studies (France and the EU) in terms of substance criticality, we superimpose the two maps and compare the position of three substances taken as examples: lithium (Li), cobalt (Co), and tungsten (W). The result of the comparison is illustrated in the Fig. 2. Visual superimposition of the criticality map for metals in France (Fig. 1) with the EU criticality (EcCRM 2017), with examples of positions for Li, Co, and W along the SR and EI axes In looking at these three example substances (Li, Co, and W), Fig. 2 shows that they do not have the same position in the map for France and that for the entire EU: these three substances are more critical in France than in Europe as a whole. This shows two things: (a) monitoring of criticality of substances in France merits being strengthened specifically, and in detail, separately from the EU situation and (b) in the field of criticality estimation, a global model is not always representative for describing how a local scale functions, necessitating an explanation of a model specific to this scale. Certainly, the specific demonstration above (superimposition and comparison) is debatable in the sense where the axes, although semantically identical (SR and EI), are not graduated the same way. Nor are these axes universal. For example, Erdman and Graedel (2011), researchers at Yale University and the UN, felt that to define the criticality of a material came down to thinking jointly about “Supply risk” axes (also SR) but for the second axis, “System vulnerability to a potential supply disturbance.” However, we think that our conclusion on the difference between the two scales is valid for at least two reasons. The first is that visually, the spatial dispersion of the three substances (and these are not the only ones), for the two respective scales, is so different (see Fig. 2) that it is simply difficult to deduce the criticality of the metals in France only when using the entire EU scale. The second reason is that the quantitative graduation on the EU axes can also be subjectively translated into a qualitative graduation (from “low” to “high” or “very high”), eventually connecting with the French scale. Therefore, we can say, with the available degree of latitude, that our conclusion does not change. And it is not risky either to say that this difference may be reproduced in other countries, so we can generalize the conclusion: in studying criticality, the global scale representative of the local scale. In fact, a criticality analysis being initiated at a global level is understandable because mineral resources are unequally spread out over the Earth as a whole. However, this is not sufficient. Efforts to explore the criticality of metals should not only consider the global level, because organizational differences make a uniform analytical approach for all organizational (i.e., global, national and local) levels impractical (Graedel et al. 2012). In the same way, the distribution risks may be under-appreciated when discussing global resources (Kushnir and Sandén 2012). In particular, knowing the quantity available globally does not automatically imply that of the distribution per country. Likewise, if a likely global shortage period is known, nothing says that it will be the same for any two given consuming countries, since supply behavior on the production side varies from one producing country to another, depending on its individual and collective interests (Andriamasinoro and Ahne 2013). Finally, extending a criticality study from the global scale to a more complex scale (starting from a country scale) would make the supply chain more transparent (including the chain through the involved countries), and transparency is demanded by organizations like the London Metal Exchange or, for example, in the case of cobalt, the Better Cobalt project (INN 2018). Let us also remember that criticality consists above all in identifying the tensions present for supplying industrials in a given country for the manufacture of products that are essential for its security or for the implementation of its energy transition policy. More generally, we must keep in mind that criticality is not a fixed notion (Buijs et al. 2012). A metal can be critical for one industry and not for another. For example, the United States considers that lithium is critical, but the EU does not. Apart from the spatial dimension, a multi-scale concept also requires the integration of the time dimension. The time notion naturally includes annual changes in the market but can also include short-term market fluctuations, an indispensable inclusion in studying criticality (Panousi et al. 2015). Then, we would have to extend the study's time scale (e.g., from year to month), and this is why we have a multi-scale project for time. Issues related to a metal can also change over time. For example, the criticality of neodyme and gallium has fallen since 2011, though resurgences cannot be ruled out, whether for prices or access to the resource. More generally, we could use time on any scale, for a given metal, to anticipate the prospective schemes for how the supply risk for this metal would change. These changes could for example appear in the event of drastic changes to mining policies or commercial policies on the producing side via possible restrictions to exports (Korinek and Kim 2013), etc. Changes like that are not all that common so disruption would not happen immediately afterwards. But as a former French Minister of Finance said on managing metals (among others), public authorities must anticipate what may happen (LesEchos 2015). The anticipation tool would help them, among other tools, to determine the criticality level of this metal (e.g., a substance may be evaluated as critical because of a risk of supply shortage in the medium or long term). In summary, so that criticality studies by French public and commercial stakeholders are more complete, especially when they are a decision aid (e.g., for better positioning of a given substance in the French criticality matrix for mineral substances—Fig. 1), it seems to be necessary for these stakeholders to have a tool that can anticipate in model form a complex simulation that would consider multiple scales (global and more refined) in an integrated way. And the multiple scale applies to both spatial and temporal dimensions, respectively. The tool also ought to be systemic (links between prices, quantity, resources, etc.). Finally, it would be controlled by rules for strategies from the stakeholders at different scales. Indeed, as Ponte and Sturgeon (2014) recalls, to analyze material flow at different spatial and time scales along the value chain, we must also understand the strategies of the industrials behind these changes in flow. In the state of the art, models to evaluate criticality already exist. French public and commercial stakeholders have contributed. For example, we can cite the calculation model developed by the “Direction générale des Entreprises” (DGCIS 2012) analyzing how vulnerable French companies are to market fluctuations. Section “French mineral substance criticality: the need for a multi-scale assessment” of this article has already cited the criticality matrix (Fig. 1) made by the French Geological Survey for COMES (Critic_FR 2018). A criticality model based on two axes SR and EI exists, adopted by Beylot and Villeneuve (2015), in its project on copper, developed with French manufacturer Renault. Finally, on lithium criticality, we can mention the model developed by BRGM (Daw and Labbé 2012) and the one developed jointly by IFPEN and IRIS (Bonnet et al. 2019). Outside France, we can also cite examples of different projects described by Gruber et al. (2011) and Helbig et al. (2018) on risks to supply associated with lithium and materials in batteries. More globally, Speirs et al. (2013) have summarized a good number of other criticality studies from around the world. Although these models are, for the most part, operational today, they are limited by lacking one or other of the characteristics expected of a multi-scale tool described in the section “French mineral substance criticality: the need for a multi-scale assessment”. Without necessarily getting into the details of each model, the missing features can be (a) the time aspect—i.e., no consideration of market fluctuations; (b) a disaggregated calculation method; or (c) the systemic aspect. In sum, the field of mineral raw materials—including the French stakeholders (among others, COMES members)—recognizes that as the market is complex, accounting for this complexity is required for carrying out further pertinent analysis of a material’s criticality. By “complexity,” we are referring here to one definition in Fromm (2004), viewing complexity as a property: “a system is complex if it can be represented efficiently by different models at different scales.” However, at a dynamic modeling stage (and the state of the art showed that modeling is necessary when studying the criticality issue), this complexity is hardly taken into consideration. This weak consideration of country scale is probably due to at least two reasons. The first is because spatial scale extension and systemic aspects will involve at least one additional constraint: the information flow (price, quantity, etc.) to be modeled simultaneously increases substantially since it has to be iteratively considered for each substance in the value chain and for each country that sends this substance to the final country. Statistically, these countries are generally numerous (TradeMap 2018). The second reason is that if the model also requires a temporal scale change (e.g., from year to month), this further increases the information to be processed. Here, we are entering the “big data” context. This increasing complexity may then hold back stakeholders in mineral raw materials (industrials, experts, deciders, scientists, etc.) from following this path. This will remain the case unless an adequate resolution methodology is proposed to—and accepted by—these stakeholders. One potential solution that should at least partially tackle to complexity issue regarding criticality assessments for prospective purposes is the agent-based computational economics (ACE) paradigm (Tesfatsion 2006). ACE, a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), can represent the market as a complex economic system composed of interacting agents. These agents are relatively autonomous and only have partial perception of the environment (Wooldridge 2009). Furthermore, as stated by Railsback and Grimm (2019), agent-based (here, ACE) models are different from other models (like statistical models) because they are always concerned with at least two levels (here at least the world scale and the country scale for the criticality study) and how those interact. In addition to ACE, and to implement the complex rules of respective agents by considering the big data involved by the scale changes explained previously, one idea would be to introduce machine learning (ML) techniques, another subfield of AI, and to couple it with ACE. This ACE/ML coupling is based on the following imbrication suggested by Moyaux et al. (2006): the main topic of ML is the study of components of intelligence and the goal of research about agents is the integration of these elements. In our case, criticality issues supported by ACE involve a set of producer, transit, and consumer countries (agents) that exchange materials (interaction) and have their own decision-making rules (autonomy) regarding the import and export of a substance at each of its transformation levels, respectively. As such, the whole market is composed of heterogeneous agents. Each agent also has only a partial perception of the whole market (countries do not have a full view of the other countries’ rules) and agents are situated at different levels (e.g., France and the EU). Whereas we might also think of adopting other solving approaches like global optimization of the whole market (Gomez 2019), we would not adopt this since the mineral substances market is predominantly decentralized (while we acknowledge that information may exist centrally, e.g., metal prices in the London Metal Exchange). Resolving from a purely global approach may then result in accuracy loss, not ideal for a decision-aid tool. By taking cobalt as an illustration example, this paper presents the first thematic and methodological discussions of our results in the ongoing design of a complex ACE/ML model to assess French mineral raw materials criticality as a prospective purpose and at a multi-scale level. By multi-scale, we mean world (because the cobalt French market comes from the world), European (because France belongs to the Europe and partly influenced by it), and country (because France is a country). The goal of the paper is “thematic” in the sense that the goal of the ACE/ML model would be that it is used as a complementary knowledge source to aid French stakeholders (among others, COMES members) to better position cobalt in the French criticality matrix (recall Fig. 1). The goal is “methodologic” in the sense that as stakeholders are often non-initiated stakeholders, we will discuss (mainly from the literature) how the proposed methodology dealing with complexity is currently accepted by these mineral raw materials stakeholders and how it could be improved towards that acceptance. Regarding the thematic question, let us first note that cobalt supply in France comes in the form of either “ore and concentrates” (hereafter “ore”)—node 1 of the cobalt value chain—or “oxides” —node 2 of the cobalt value chain (BIO by Deloitte 2015), with a predominant supply of oxides (Fig. 3). “Oxides” are the final needs of French industrials. French import of “ores” predominantly transits via the UK (TradeMap 2018). In 2018, the UK market share was 60% followed by Germany (40%). The UK was also the transit leader of “oxides” exported to France in 2018 (54%), followed by Finland (24%). French importation (in metric tons) of cobalt from the world (2000–2017), respectively, in the form of either “ore and concentrates”—node 1 of the cobalt value chain—or “oxides”—node 2 of the cobalt value chain (TradeMap 2018) Our thematic question concerns anticipation of supply shortage risk for cobalt oxides in France. It is measured in this work by the quantity of cobalt oxides that France could have, either by importing it directly or by importing ores into France and then transforming them locally. More precisely, among others, questions posed by French stakeholders regarding how to anticipate supply shortage that we would also plan to aid to answer are: (Q1) What are the possible determinants of French cobalt oxide import? (Q2) How could prospective changes in the value of these determinants affect French cobalt oxide imports in the future, ending a possible supply shortage? (Q3) What features (export quantity? price? others?) of “ore” producer countries can be determinants that highly influence scores for French imports of “oxides”? (Q4) Will there be possible interplays between “ores” and “oxides” in France, namely will the import of one evolve to the detriment of/benefit of the others in the future? To answer these questions, we must monitor how cobalt flows in the different transit countries through which it passes (potentially transformed, in the meantime) from the initial producer countries to France, knowing that each country has its respective rules to adopt regarding how to manage each imported substance (e.g., how much of the ores to transform to oxides, how much of the ores and oxides to export), rules that may change over time. Transit countries (e.g., the UK, the Netherlands, Finland) exist because statistical data (Roskill 2017; TradeMap 2018) shows that except for a few months out of 16 years (2000–2016), there is no direct exchange of “ores” nor “oxides” between France and cobalt producers (DRC, Zambia, China, Madagascar, etc.). To answer these questions, we must also consider how much ores are imported by France even if its quantity is low compared to cobalt oxides (Fig. 3) for at least two reasons: first, it also determines the total quantity of oxide used by France and second, the fact that its quantity is low most of times does not mean this situation will not change in the future (see Question (Q4)). All this complexity convinces us that ACE/ML approach would be an appropriate solving approach regarding the questions. To design a complex modeling tool though, we must be careful. Indeed, as already highlighted earlier by (Boehm 1988), development of any software (then including a simulation tool) entails a cumulative cost in terms of coding, test and maintenance time (this is a fortiori true for software implementing a complex model). The development should then be carried out via a risk-driven approach (risk in terms of cost). That is why Boehm adopted the spiral (iterative and incremental) software development process. With that method, when a current version of the developed model “bugs,” it would be “easier” to find the last spiral cycle from which the model was stable, and to restart the model improvement from this version instead of from the beginning. Our planned ACE/ML modeling of the cobalt market crudely resumes that idea except that one cycle in our spiral process corresponds to (an adapted version from) the scientific modeling cycle proposed by (Railsback and Grimm 2019): a cycle is composed here of tasks of problem formulation, assumptions, implementation, analyses, interpretation, communication of the cycle results and, in parallel, revised formulation, etc. (Fig. 4). These cycle authors guide the process as follows: “the modeling cycle is an iterative process (…), it must be started with the most simple model possible, because we want to develop understanding gradually, while iterating through the cycle (…). It is wise to have a model implemented as soon as possible, even if it is ridiculously simple. But the simpler the model is, the easier it is to implement and analyze, and the sooner we are productive (….). “Iterating” does not mean that we always go through the full cycle; rather, we often go through smaller loops (…)”. The modeling cycle followed by this work, inspired from Railsback and Grimm (2019), coupled with a more global spiral model of software development inspired from (Boehm 1988) The work reported in this paper corresponds to the first modeling cycle (but is already complex by itself, as we will see) of this global spiral development of our cobalt market model, with a first question, first assumptions, first analysis conclusions, etc. that may be adjusted in next cycles (future work). In that first modeling cycle, the substance addressed in this first cycle is only cobalt “ore.” Regarding the “formulation” task in the cycle, our thematic questions concern sub-questions posed upstream of (Q1) and (Q2) respectively as follows: (Q1’): What are the current possible determinants of French cobalt ore import? (Q2’) How could prospective changes in these determinants affect French cobalt ore import in the future, resulting in a possible supply shortage? The rest of the first cycle tasks are detailed throughout the paper, knowing that the communication task is this paper itself. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section “Model description and implementation” is related to the model’s assumptions settings, structure, and implementation; section “Model analysis and interpretation” is related to how to analyze the model’s results regarding historical and prospective periods; section “Discussions” discusses the work (for both cobalt and more broadly mineral raw materials); and section “Conclusions” concludes the paper.

It becomes feasible when the project is economically profitable, technically appropriate, and environmentally socially responsive. In recent years, several studies have dealt with the sustainable development in mining. Less attention has been paid to social criterion of mining in comparison with other two criteria. A review of social criterion of mining has been reported recently. The social impacts of mining can be divided into six general categories (Mancini and Sala 2018): economy, income, and security; employment and education; land use and territorial aspects; demography; environment, health, and safety; human rights. Given the multifaceted effects of mining on the community, mine design would not be optimal without these effects. As long as the society is one of the three principles of sustainable development, this will lead to unsustainable mining. The question that arises is how the social impact of mining can be considered in mining design? The quantification and valuation of how sustainability can be indicated within mining activities is a challenging issue that has been dealt with a lesser extent so far. The social impacts of mining can be divided into two broad categories of positive or negative impacts. Higher positive social impacts lead to higher mining value and vice versa. In other words, if the value of each social impacts of mining can be calculated, then the social value of mining also can be obtained. Many services, including mining operation services and impacts, are not able to be traded on the market and are not affiliated with or related to any market. Therefore, people cannot express what they are willing to pay in those circumstances. In this context, people are asked to express directly what they are willing to pay in order to get a service based on a hypothetical scenario. This is base of stated preference approaches. In recent decades, several forms of the stated preference approach have been developed in various fields such as marketing, the environmental economy, transport, health economics, and other related issues. A common feature in stated preference approach is to question people directly about their possible choices in a hypothetical market. Finally, the willingness to pay (or to gain) is calculated for the average respondent (Hensher et al. 2005). Choice experiment (CE) is a subset of the multi-attribute valuation method and referred to the stated preferences approach. The CE technique has been employed in numerous studies to estimate the preferences of individuals in relation to mining impacts. Rolf et al. used the CE technique in mining for the first time in 2006. Since then, limited researchers have used this technique. After Rolf, researchers such as Windel, Ivanova, Boateng, and Que used CE technique (Ivanova et al. 2007; Ivanova and Rolfe 2011; Windle and Rolfe 2012; Windle and Rolfe 2013; Rolfe and Windle 2015; Boateng 2017; Boateng and Awuah-Offei 2017; Que 2015; Que et al. 2015; Que et al. 2016; Que et al. 2017; Que et al. 2018; Que et al. 2019). The CE technique has been used more closely with the preferences of people in different mining areas in Australia (Ivanova et al. 2007; Ivanova and Rolfe 2011) (Windle and Rolfe 2012; Windle and Rolfe 2013; Rolfe and Windle 2015; Gillespie and Kragt 2012; Reeson et al. 2012) and the USA (Boateng 2017; Boateng and Awuah-Offei 2017; Que 2015; Que et al. 2015; Que et al. 2016; Que et al. 2017; Que et al. 2018; Que et al. 2019). In the first works in this regard, social and economic impacts associated with changes in the coal mining industry in the Bowen Basin, Queensland, Australia, evaluated. The creation of entertainment and new jobs were among the indicators examined in this work (Ivanova et al. 2007). The non-market effects of underground mining have been evaluated using this method. The paper reports the results of a CE undertaken for a mine in the Southern Coalfield of New South Wales. Results from the study are used to aid the government decision by evaluating alternative proposals to continue underground coal mining operations. Social well-being and new jobs were among the social impacts of mining that were examined in this study (Gillespie and Kragt 2012). Another application of the CE technique in mining is to evaluate the acceptance of mining projects by the community (Boateng and Awuah-Offei 2017; Que 2015; Que et al. 2015). Classifying critical factors that influence community acceptance of mining projects (Que et al. 2015), describing the local community acceptance for enhanced community engagement (Que 2015), and agent-based modeling framework for modeling the effect of information diffusion on community acceptance of mining (Boateng and Awuah-Offei 2017) are among these studies. These researches looked at social indicators such as job opportunities, increased amenities, mine life, and income. Increasing the life of the mine will lead to an increase in the duration of employment, and an increase in income will improve people’s livelihoods. Corporate social responsibility and analysis and understanding of mining stakeholders are the other researchers conducted in the field of mining using the CE technique (Que et al. 2016; Que et al. 2019). By examining the work done on people’s preferences regarding the social impacts of mining, it can be concluded that indicators such as the number of created new jobs and the creation of welfare facilities were directly examined. Duration of employment and improvements in the livelihoods of the people in the region has been indirectly examined by mine life and income. There has also been no research on the earning of skills, creation of social anomalies, and the gender imbalance in the studied area. In other words, individuals’ preferences regarding the social impacts of mining have not been examined together. In the mentioned articles, in addition to the limited number of social impacts of mining investigated by the CE method, none of them have used the results of the research to estimate the value of the social impacts and consequently, mining based on them. In order to calculate the social value of mining, people affected by mining may be asked about their preferences and, according to the results, the importance and value of each impact and consequently, the social value of mining are obtained. In addition to the fact that the mining project will also be based on the evaluation of its social impacts, the design of the mine can be done in such a way as to achieve the highest social value. Given the social value of the mines, they can be compared in this respect and a better design is chosen. Having such information can be used as a tool to support managers’ decision-making. Therefore, it is necessary to aggregate the indicators and identify the preferences of the individuals. In this study, the social impacts of mining are examined with respect to two sections, i.e., job creation and other social impacts of mining. Job creation is measured by certain characteristics such as the number of new jobs, the duration of employment, the acquisition of skills for employment in other mines, and the duration of work under unsuitable conditions (sometimes underground mines). Other issues include positive social impacts, such as creating welfare facilities and improving the livelihoods of people being involved in the region, while negative impacts include social anomalies and gender imbalance. The latter could be due to the migration of men which generally outnumbers the migration of women to any area where a mine is located. Therefore, the present paper aims to evaluate the most important social impacts on mining by using the CE method.",5

Madheswaran,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The subject of firm ownership and productivity or extraction efficiency is always contentious. Who extracts minerals more efficiently is always a moot point. One line of theoretical arguments based on property rights (Alchian and Demsetz 1972; Alchian 1965), public choice (Buchanan 1978; Niskanen 1971; Olson 1965) and agency theory (Fama 1980; Jensen and Meckling 1976; Williamson 1964) provides several justifications for superiority of private firms in terms of productivity. The other line of arguments advocates for no significant difference between the productivity of state-owned enterprises (SOE)Footnote 1 and the private firms in regulated economic environments, at least under complete regulatory contracts (Laffont and Tirole 1993; Stigler 1971; Averch and Johnson 1962). A rich body of empirical literature also exists concerning the performance of public and private firms. Wolf (2009), examining the world’s 50 largest oil and gas companies for the years 1987 to 2006, find that private firms significantly outperform public firms in terms of output efficiency and profitability. He also suggests that political preference for public sector oil firms usually comes at an economic cost. Faria et al. (2005) studying the Brazilian private and public companies providing water and sewerage utilities show that the private companies are only marginally more efficient than the public ones. Dewenter and Mala-testa (Dewenter and Malatesta 2001) use the sample of Fortune 500 largest international companies for the years 1975, 1985 and 1995 and, controlling for firm size, location, industry and business cycle effects, find private firms more profitable and less labour intensive and show lower financial leverage than state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In a heavily cited paper, Boardman Anthony and Vining (1989) researching the 500 largest non-US industrial companies in 1983 find that private firms significantly outperform both state-owned and mixed-ownership firms. Contrary to these results, Martin and Parker (1995) and Caves and Christensen (1980) find no superior performance of private firms. Rather, they argue that public firms are equally productive as private firms and any form of inefficiency in the public firms is due to lack of healthy competition between the two types of ownership. The productivity difference emerging from ownership difference can be attributable to several factors. Sectoral difference appears to be one reason for the existence of such difference between public and private firms. Public firms seem to be more productive in sectors where there is limited competition or regulations are imposed on private firms such as electricity and water, whereas private firms are more efficient in the delivery of services where the government subcontracts to the private sector (Boardman Anthony and Vining 1989). Similarly, age can be another major determinant in deciding superiority of one type of firm over the other. Private firms exhibit more productivity growth in the long run than their public counterparts (Pollitt 1995). Overall, whilst a significant number of empirical studies find evidence in favour of private ownership (Megginson and Netter 2001), Ehrlich et al. (1994) point out that the comparison between public and private firms would be inappropriate as most of the comparative studies are undertaken either for natural monopolies or regulated duopolies and ultimately may lead to inconclusive results. Comparison in most of the cases is impaired by methodological difficulties. Choice of appropriate measurement variable and the interacting effects of ownership, competition and regulation are some of these methodological issues (Vickers and Yarrow 1988, p. 39). Besides, it is often difficult to find appropriate groups of firms to compare as in many sectors only a small number of firms are truly comparable. All these limitations ultimately force researchers to arrive at different conclusions leading to inconclusive results. Contrary to the large number of ownership studies, there is limited research so far specifically on the mining industry. Das (2012) studied productivity differences between 65 public and private mining companies from 1988–1989 to 2005–2006. Using the semiparametric econometric method, he found that private firms were more productive than public firms in three subsectors such as metallic, non-metallic and coal, while for the petroleum sector, public firms showed better productivity. Our paper can be seen to build on these issues, but goes deeper into the investigation with a significantly more comprehensive panel data set. Thus, this paper aims to empirically investigate the ownership effect in the context of the Indian mining industry. The mining industry in India is an interesting sector for studying the ownership and productivity link since the industry has been fully opened up to private sector participation since 2000. In the past, the mining industry, being the non-renewable resource industry, remained under the complete control of government and was under the aegis of state ownership. The absence of private investment and lack of competition resulted in the low level of production and productivity growth of this industry. However, with the advent of economic reforms in the year 1990 and resultant upsurge in the demand for mineral commodities, the Government of India realized the role of competition in enhancing the productivity of this sector. In view of this, the sector was opened up to private sector participation in the year 1994 and again the sector was fully opened up to the world economy since 2000. Considering the economic reforms and the consequent growth in private sector participation in the mining industry in India, it makes an interesting case to enquire about the ownership and productivity link issue. The present research is an updated version of the study undertaken by Das (2012) in Indian context over 1989–1990 to 2005–2006. The study differs from that of the previous study in respect of its time period, sample size and construction of variables. An earlier research paper used a small set of data from 1988–1989 to 2005–2006. The need for doing a similar kind of research can be justified on several grounds. Firstly, this paper uses data in a bigger way from 2000–2001 to 2016–2017 to establish a large number of points such as to check the compatibility of the old model with the new set of updated, latest and larger set of data; secondly, to find out how effectively the govt./private sectors used the findings of the earlier study to improve their policies; thirdly, to point out any new findings/outcomes (which might have been ignored in the earlier study) in the micro level with a larger set of data. The rationale behind updating the study is also to figure out the changes that have happened between the performance of public and private firms in this industry over time. Thus, this research aims to identify the variance in output/result as many changes (with respect to policy making and the number of firms) have already happened in India specific to the mining industry (both in public and private sectors). However, the findings of this study confirm with that of the previous study, bringing out important implications for policy makers.",3

Our study contributes to the literature on mineral resource-based development by bringing forward the importance of innovation-intensive support services as a distinguishing factor of resource-rich industrialized countries. Using cross-country data, we find that even though emerging economies play an important role in two large segments of extractive industries, they are under-represented in the third one. Specifically, during 2005–2015, non-OECD nations accounted for an average of 45% and 80% of global exports in non-energy mining and energy extraction, respectively. However, these countries’ share of global exports of support services represented only 20%. Although the market for support services represents the smallest part of the overall extractive industry, accounting for 8% of the latter’s value, employment in this subsector in the OECD countries represents on average 30% of the total number of people employed in the extractive industries. In fact, during 2005–2015, support services were the fastest growing subsector among the extractive industries in OECD countries with its employment increasing at an average of 6% compared to 1% per year in the other two subsectors. In other words, support services are important for spreading direct benefits of resource extraction to the wider economy through their employment effect. In addition, support services are an important source of innovation in the extractive industry. The most striking example of such innovation, primarily associated with the activity of oilfield service companies, is the US “shale revolution.” Its underpinning was the application of innovative technologies in exploration and energy extraction which produced disruptive effects not only on the international commodity markets but on international politics as well, including the climate change agenda. Furthermore, our study finds that support services are closely linked to the innovation outside the resource sector which may explain the advantage of the industrialized countries over the emerging economies in producing these key services. In this study, we use the definition of support services adopted by the International Standard Industrial Classification (UN 2008). According to this definition, “support services” do not include all types of services that support the extractive industries. To introduce this definition and the resulting data, one needs to briefly consider various services in extractive industries’ value chains. Firms in extractive industries procure numerous services such as transportation, banking, insurance, consulting, and communication. These are considered general producer services that provide important inputs to many production processes, including resource extraction. During the last 40 years, increasing use of such producer services allowed for greater specialization, economies of scale, and enhanced productivity of industrial firms by meeting the latter’s need in specialized knowledge (Amiti and Wei 2005; Beyers and Lindahl 1996; Francois 1990). Together with consumer services, producer services account for a significant share of national output: about 50% and 70% of aggregate value added is generated by service industries in the non-OECD and OECD countries, respectively. Service production and consumption, and, consequently, their measurement are distinct from other industries. While official statistics agencies regard the natural resource sector as the primary sector and manufacturing as the secondary sector, most services are classified as the tertiary sector. Some specialized services that are closely linked with the extractive industries, such as geophysical, geologic, and seismic surveying activities, are reported under the tertiary sector category of professional, scientific, and technical services (PSTS, alongside accounting, architectural design, and other services). Disaggregated data on PSTS that lend themselves to cross-country economic analysis of specialized technical services for the mining industry are not availableFootnote 1. However, there is a designated category of services reported within the primary sector: mining support services which are almost exclusively consumed within the extractive industries are reported as one of the subsectors of “mining and quarrying,” and international data on these services became available in late 2018. As a result, our study uses data on mining support services as defined by the most recent International Standard Industrial Classification as follows: This division includes specialized support services incidental to mining provided on a fee or contract basis. It includes exploration services through traditional prospecting methods such as taking core samples and making geological observations as well as drilling, test-drilling or redrilling for oil wells, metallic and non-metallic minerals. Other typical services cover building oil and gas well foundations, cementing oil and gas well casings, cleaning, bailing and swabbing oil and gas wells, draining and pumping mines, overburden removal services at mines, etc. (UN 2008, p. 84). Next, as we are interested in analyzing the link between support services and innovation, we need to discuss our approach to defining and measuring the latter. To this end, we rely on the definition of OECD/Eurostat ( 2018) of innovation as new or improved and significantly different product or process that a firm brings to the market or incorporates it its own production. The following activities may be considered as part of innovation: engineering, design, and other creative work activities; marketing and brand equity activities; intellectual property–related activities; employee training activities; software development and database activities; activities related to the acquisition or lease of tangible assets; innovation management activities (ibid.). Starting from the early 2000s, innovation surveys of firms were designed and undertaken in some countries to investigate such parameters of innovation as proportions of businesses that introduced or implemented new or significantly improved goods, services, or processes; associated expenditures; types of collaboration; and barriers to innovation. These surveys have been carried out occasionally, and their analysis provides a valuable complement to traditional innovation studies of research and development (R&D). R&D is a type of innovation: “Research and experimental development (R&D) comprises creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge and to devise new applications of available knowledge” (ibid p. 87). R&D spending was used in numerous studies as a proxy for innovation. For example, Bilbao-Osorio and Rodriguez-Pose (2004) and Mairesse and Mohnen (2004) find that R&D expenditures explain changes in innovation and productivity in Europe; using surveys of oil and gas firms, Mancini and Jose Paz (2018) show that R&D spending produces a positive impact on innovation activity in the extractive industry in Brazil. In what follows below, we will use R&D expenditures as a proxy for innovation to argue that the value of support services has close links to both output levels in mining and the oil and gas industries as well as innovation. While acknowledging that R&D spending may only partially capture the entire innovation activity, our study suggests that emerging economies with large extractive industries should enhance the overall innovation system in their countries. Our arguments are based on reviewing relevant literature, analyzing data, and econometric modeling.",6

As part of the Action Plan, the Commission launched the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) envisioned to be a stakeholder network involving all relevant interests including industrial actors along the value chain, EU countries and regions, trade unions, civil society, research and technology organisations, investors and NGOs who share the goal of supporting the extraction of critical raw materials (EC COM(2020)474). The day before ERMA’s launch, however, a letter was delivered to the Commission with the signatures of approximately 234 civil society organisations and academics expressing their deep concerns about the narrative of the Action Plan (Civil Society open letter, 2020). European policy and European society are at a critical juncture in charting the future course of exploration and exploitation activities, and the tension between those who believe mining is critical for the energy transition and those who champion post-consumerism and resource decoupling has come to the fore, with adoption of the Action Plan and launch of ERMA. Caught in the middle are the companies, who have largely been alone in trying to handle the opposition and discovering that social acceptance, equated with the social licence to operate concept for the purpose of this paper, is not only a result of their individual behaviour but also that of the entire industry. The Commission’s convening of a stakeholder network to promote critical raw materials shows not only that government is willing to enter the fray but could be interpreted as an acknowledgement they see the legitimacy of the entire mining industry potentially at stake. What is happening on-the-ground is buttressed in recent academic literature asserting that while connected, there is a company social licence which is separate and distinct from the industry’s social licence (Boutilier 2020). Research on the societal dimension of SLO, particularly around its preconditions, what drives it and how it affects community SLO, although the latter point still not well understood, acknowledges the importance of better understanding the societal influences on acceptance (Zhang et al. 2015; Litmanen et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2018; Jartti et al. 2020; Poelzer et al. 2020; Ruokonen 2020). The concepts of societal SLO and industry SLO may either be mirroring or a response to conditions on-the-ground. What is clear is that policy, reality and research are converging as the acceptance of European mining has entered the discourse in all three realms. Similar organizations and rationale invoked in the opposition against ERMA are also evident at the Member State level and at least three different approaches to address opposition have been attempted in Europe: two at the national level and one at the regional level. This paper compares the two national-level approaches, one in Finland and one in Spain, that not only address the opposition but also proactively seek to build societal SLO through the adoption of international good practices. Both Finland and Spain have adopted the same instrument for achieving acceptance, the Canadian Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) program, yet have implemented it in very different ways. In Finland, the approach is a government-led network that includes representatives of all stakeholder groups with an interest in mining. All stakeholders are considered equal and decisions are made by consensus. In Spain, implementation is via an industry-led national standard through the UNE, the Spanish Standards Association, a more traditional and hierarchical style of implementation. The aim of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of the implementation mechanism on a policy instrument, in this case, whether a stakeholder network or a national standard is better suited to the implementation of an outside nation’s industry standard. As both of these efforts are still new, this article endeavours to provide preliminary insights into the initial phase of adopting the TSM.",4

In relation to mineral resources and to the minerals and metals industry, it can be defined as the framework of laws, regulations, voluntary initiatives, standards, norms, practices and institutions that is applied by the stakeholders concerned by this industry and any of its specific projects. Governance requires an effective, verifiable implementation and the commitment to this framework of all stakeholders with an interest in a specific project or activity. Mineral resource governance can be a very abstract, if not vague, concept. It can also explicitly refer to, and should systematically do it, the UN Sustainable Development Goals internationally agreed in 2015 (United Nations 2016; UN International Resource Panel 2020b). It also should refer to the need to decouple economic growth from the negative impacts of growth on the life supporting global ecosystem, of which climate, healthy oceans and the global carbon and water cycles are essential components. Decoupling is also needed to reduce the current high pressure on the great diversity of local ecosystems (UN International Resource Panel 2011) on which local life depends on. The squandering of mineral rents by the political “elites” in some mineral-rich countries, corruption, short-term profit seeking, tax evasion, the lack of public transparent reporting of exploration projects and mining activities are still obstacles to the development of good governance. While governments of developed rich countries, including the EU, bear a significant responsibility for this state of affairs, individual choices and behaviours are equally important. Everyone needs to understand the multiple roles of minerals and metals in support of individual well-being and realise their strategic importance, while supporting all the efforts needed to develop greater resources circularity, through multiple possible actions such as the eco-efficient production of minerals and metals, and eco-design of product actions including the following:
 Ecologically and socially efficient production of minerals and metals The development of actions that support circular resources use such as:
 conceiving innovative resources efficient materials conceiving serviceable and recyclable goods thanks to eco-design the development of the re-use, refurbishment and remanufacturing of specific components and end-of-life recycling the fight against programmed obsolescence; industrial ecology where the waste of one industry is used as a resource for another one Governance is the fourth dimension of sustainable development, in addition to the economic, environmental and social dimensions more widely used to describe sustainable development (Barbier 1987; Purvis et al. 2019; Weinberger et al. 2015). This is why the public reporting by companies of their performance in these four dimensions of sustainability should become a must, and be available for each production site. This is far from the current practice. Governance is the force that drives the convergence of the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development (Fig. 1). It is not a natural force, but a complex cultural construct based on components such as facts-based knowledge, technological choices, accountability, full public reporting of sustainability performance at individual production sites, transparency and verifiability of data and information.
 Governance, the driving force is the fourth dimension of sustainable development, and its key components with regard to the minerals and metals industry Data, information and knowledge shared in an open, transparent way among all concerned stakeholders promotes trust, a key ingredient to make complex, risky projects possible. The minerals and metals industry consists of a complex realm of enterprises that extract raw mineral resources and process them to marketable products, such as sand, cement, aluminium, phosphoric acid, copper, indium or neodymium, needed by the myriad of industrial supply chains (Fig. 2) that are dependent on minerals or metals for the production of goods or services essential to human well-being. For instance, minerals and metals are the enablers of the information and communication technologies that allow many to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, thus avoiding an even worse economic and social disasters. A recent UN International Resource Panel (IRP) video documents this (IRP 2020a)
 Schematic representation of a mineral resource–dependent supply chain (derived from IRP 2020b). The EU economy is highly dependent on imports of minerals and metals from beyond its borders and vulnerable to rapid price escalations and possible supply tensions/disruptions. Its vulnerability appears somewhat reduced at the metallurgical and metal-refining stages A detailed description of this realm, of its multiple stakeholders and of its governance landscape, is provided in a recent report of the IRP (IRP 2020b). It identified about 90 different natural resources government instruments, recognising that some may have been missed by the analysis. None fully addresses the four dimensions of sustainable development, of which governance is one. This industry is extremely diversified, ranging from
 informal, frequently unregulated or very loosely regulated, sometimes illegal, small-scale entities (some being temporary groupings of fortune seekers without any legal status) with almost no capital and very limited knowledge, using very simple technologies such as digging with picks and shovels and some coarse gravimetric recovery of the marketable mineral product. Loosely regulated, if regulated at all, extraction activities are playing a major role, in many countries, in the production of construction materials (clays, anhydrite and gypsum, sand, lime, gravel, dimension and ornamental stone). The cumulated production of these entities is also an important source of gold, gemstone, tantalum and tin; to very large size multinational companies with a market value that exceeded 100 billion $ US in July 2020 for two of them, BHP and RioTinto (Mining.com 2020). Such companies are knowledge and technology intensive and use state-of-the-art technologies in exploration, mining engineering, ore processing and metallurgy, with complex machinery and processes applied for the recovery of the marketable products. Continuous optimisation of their operations made possible thanks to the intensive use of multiple sensors and of information, and communication technologies are essential in this segment of the industry. These companies and the very large deposits they exploit play a major role in the supply of the global economy with mineral raw materials requiring complex, capital and technology-intensive, industrial processes for their production. While large deposits can be mined by small operations, the huge growing minerals and metals requirements of the global economy make large-scale mining of large deposit essential. Many of these raw materials are needed in tonnages counted in millions of tonnes (e.g. copper, manganese, nickel, lead, phosphate or zinc), or even exceeding the billion tonnes mark (cement, iron ore, steam and coking coal). The per-ton value of these raw materials economically makes them widely traded goods that travel by sea over many thousands of kilometres, as it is the case with Brazilian iron ore or Chilean copper concentrates feeding Chinese smelters, while mineral raw materials needed by the construction sector (sand and gravel, ordinary clay, dimension stone) represent about, by far, the largest segment of the mineral production materials produced in the largest tonnages, the world sand and gravel production alone being estimated to be about 40 billion tons per year, GAIN (2014). In between, a realm of mid-sized companies plays an important role in the production of many minerals and metals. The article by Ericsson and Hodge in this issue provides a detailed presentation of the structure of the global mining industry. While the locations of the initial stages of mineral resource–dependent supply chains, up to and including ore processing (where needed), are geographically constrained by the geological factors that control the development of economically recoverable concentrations of minerals, the further stages, or nodes, of mineral dependent supply chain can be located in any location worldwide offering “attractive” conditions for the investments necessary to develop the activity and for running it at a profit. The copper industry case documented by Tercero Espinoza et al. (2016) illustrates the global and complex nature of mineral raw material–dependent supply chains. “Attractive” as used here can mean the availability of cheap and abundant energy, of skilled manpower, of good transport infrastructure and of a stable regulatory and fiscal framework. It can also mean lax environmental, social and/or fiscal regulations, openness to corruption and poor social standards. Profit is usually measured in terms of return on capital invested, after taking into account the multiple risks inherent to mineral and metal production activities (EY 2020). In this annual survey of risk perception by top executives from the global mining industry, “License to operate” ranks as the most important, for the second year in a row. This means that many industry leaders are worried about seeing their operations challenged by their broader stakeholder groups (Fig. 3) such as local populations environmentally and/or socially impacted by mining activities.
 Minerals and metals industry stakeholders—Source: Christmann (2017) and IRP (2020) Minerals and metals provide a huge range of services and products that are essential to human well-being. Without mineral fertilisers and agricultural machinery, agricultural production would be much reduced, modern water supply and wastewater would not exist, modern health services would be unavailable, nor would the Internet of computers exist. Their production provides major contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment 2016; ICMM 2016) but it also can be a source of important negative environmental and social impacts. The main impacts of concern are global (CO2 emissions that contribute to global warming) or, mostly, local (generation of large amounts of potentially harmful solid waste, failure risk of waste containment structures, impacts on air quality, ground and surface water, on flora and fauna):
 CO2 emissions: the production of minerals and metals generates about 16% of the global CO2 emissions (OECD 2019), the major contributors being cement and steel, due to the large tonnages produced, and aluminium, whose production is highly energy intensive. CO2 and other emissions are not only the consequence of technological choices made at individual sites; they also are a consequence of the energy mix used for the production of minerals and metals. In 2019, China, by far the most important current global producer of many minerals and metals (Fig. 4), used 85% of carbon-based fuels in its energy mix, 58% of the mix being from very polluting coal. In comparison the USA, used only 12% coal and Europe only 14% in their energy mix (bp 2020). Coal is not only a source of greenhouse gas emissions but also an important source of mercury emissions in the atmosphere (UN Environment 2019) and of massive amounts of environmentally problematic waste from coal burning (fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag). Some of this waste can be used as a feed for other industrial processes, for instance fly ash in cement production. China’s share, in %, of the 2018 world production, of selected mineral raw materials. China is the world’s largest producer of the selected raw materials. The share is shown either as a percentage of the production at mine level (raw material name followed by MI, blue bars) or of metal at smelter/refinery level (name followed by ME, bars with a diagonal pattern). Cement is shown in yellow as it is neither a mining product nor a metal. Data sources: Darton Commodities Limited (2020), International Copper Study Group (2020), Reichl and Schatz (2020), U.S. Geological Survey (2020) Generation of potentially harmful solid waste and related hazards: the production of some metals (copper, gold, platinum group metals, lead and zinc, phosphate, uranium) generates large amounts of waste, mostly as fine-grained sand like tailings resulting from the crushing and grinding of the ore necessary for the recovery of the valuable minerals from the ore mineral assemblage. These tailings can contain residual minerals, especially sulphides, that are potential sources of harmful elements releases to the environment (such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury, selenium or tellurium) further to a widespread bioleaching process known as Acid Mine Drainage (Verburg et al. 2009; Jacobs et al. 2014; Kesler and Simon 2015; Australian Government 2016; Lottermoser 2017). At an average of 0.56% Cu in the globally produced copper ore (Schodde 2019) and assuming a 100% recovery rate (the reality being probably about 80 to 90%), and a global mine copper production of 20.5 Mt Cu in 2018, about 3.6 billion tonnes of tailings will have been produced that year. This soft material is stored in large tailing ponds confined by dams. Tailing dams can be very large facilities, extending over several square kilometres. After many years of decline, the average global Cu content of mined ores may marginally increase (to 0.65–0.7% Cu in the globally mined ore if the production from new high-grade deposits in the Democratic Republic increases by 1 to 2 Mt Cu per year). This would not significantly modify the annual tailings tonnage estimate given here. Mining and ore processing waste-related impacts can last for many years, even centuries, after the actual termination of mineral and metal production activities. Their mitigation can be the source of important costs to unsuspecting taxpayers, long after the closure of the mining site. In extreme cases, the capital cost needed to manage them at one single derelict mine site can be nearly one billion US$. This is the cost of the planned confinement of 237,000 tons of deadly arsenic trioxide left behind in underground mined out chambers as a non-marketable by-product resulting from ore processing over the lifetime of the Giant Gold Mine, located near Yellowknife in Canada’s North-West Territories (Mckenzie Valley Review Board 2013). This province has a population of only about 45,000 persons. These are few shoulders to bear such a burden. In addition, annual operating costs will accrue for an unspecified number of years. Older tailing dams can contain economically important metal contents, sufficient to profitably reprocess them to recover valuable contents. Such reprocessed tailing materials can become suitable for construction purposes. Reprocessing of old tailings can be economically very attractive as in the past the processes used for ore beneficiation were less efficient than in modern state-of-the art processing plants, with significant parts of the ore minerals ending up in the tailings. Where no further economic use is possible for tailing materials, or contained residual metal values are too low to make them economically recoverable, they need to be disposed forever. In well-regulated countries and/or in the case of companies operating to high environmental standards, tailings and mine waters are managed to avoid environmental impacts and tailing dams’ stability is regularly monitored; nevertheless, tailing ponds can remain long-term threats to the environment as some day after the end of the operation monitoring operations and/or water treatment operations may become underfunded, or no more funded at all, leaving local communities to bear the consequences of industrial activities that may have happened several generations before. Tailing dams are also fragile structures that may fail with dramatic consequences, even during the active mining phase, as dramatically documented by the Córrego do Feijão iron ore mine tailing dam (Near Brumadinho, Brazil) catastrophic failure that killed at least 259 persons and caused important environmental damage on January 25, 2019 (Silva Rotta et al. 2020). The WISE-Uranium project maintains a database of major tailing dam accidents, listing 150 major tailing dam failures that happened since 1961 with their known consequences (Diehl 2020). Concerns about the lasting and potentially very costly impacts of mining activities are on the rise, even in jurisdictions historically favourable to mining. Authorities, wary of the potential negative impacts of mining activities, are imposing tougher regulations on mining activities. In Canada, for instance, the large-scale Schaft Creek open-pit copper mine project in British Columbia, with a measured and indicated resource of about 3.3 Mt Cu (Copper Fox Metals 2020), with molybdenum, gold and silver as by-products, started its mandatory environmental assessment process in 2006, producing over 50 studies, without having obtained the necessary Environmental Assessment certificate so far. In Alaska, the Pebble Mine project acquired by Northern Dynasty Minerals in 2001, is one the world largest undeveloped but fully documented copper resources, with an indicated and measured copper resource of nearly 26 Mt. The project has not yet received the required US Environmental Protection Agency permit and it may well never get out of high-level political concerns about its potential impacts on the water quality of Bristol Bay, considered the world’s most valuable salmon fishery (Randall 2020). There is abundant scientific literature on environmental issues related to the production of minerals and metals, for instance UN International Resource Panel (IRP 2013a); Kesler and Simon (2015); Jain et al. (2016); and Lottermoser (2017). Unless there is a broad social consensus to accept lifestyles independent from minerals and metal use, enjoying living conditions equivalent to about 10000 years ago, before the use of metals began to shape the evolution of civilisations, it needs to be accepted by society that there cannot be mineral and metal production without some environmental impact, as much as there are no other human activities without environmental impacts. But these impacts can be much reduced by using the current best available technologies and management practices in mineral and metal production (European Commission 2013a, 2013b, 2017; Garbarino et al. 2018). While companies active all along mineral- and metal-related supply chains have a responsibility in ensuring that the minerals and metals they produce or use are produced according to high sustainability standards, the role and the responsibility of governments, or, in the case of the European Union, of the European institutions, are of major importance too. They ought to ensure that:
 best available technologies and practices are documented and effectively implemented; environmental impacts are transparently documented and publicly reported; regulations are put in place, and effectively enforced, to ensure that minerals and metals produced on the national territory, or imported, as well as derived goods, are produced in line to best available environmental and social regulations or standards; and market mechanisms are put in place to support high environmental and social performance and deter poor practice. The production of minerals and metals generates direct and indirect employment in regions that may have only limited development alternatives. Modern large-scale mines, smelters and refineries offer a great diversity of skills in disciplines such as accounting, blasting, chemical analysis, community relations, electrical systems, environmental management, geology, hydraulics, advanced information technologies, mechanics, metallurgical and mining engineering, ore processing, robotics and automation, advanced information and communication technologies, and ventilation management. Most of the skills developed in mining or metallurgical industry are transferrable to other sectors of the economy once a mine or a smelter closes. The development of human skills needed for the production of minerals and metals has played a critical role in the development of the economic and social wealth of developed nations, and in many cases mining schools are still among the best engineering high schools and research institutions in countries where there is not much mining left. In this respect, mining and metallurgy are important development drivers, the resulting skills development being an important example of the long-lasting social benefits that can result from the transformation of natural capital into social capital. The industrial-scale production of minerals and metals involves many stakeholders (Fig. 3), some being directly involved with the productive activities such as:
 professionals working at the mines and the related plants (mineral processing plants and, in some cases, smelters and refineries), trade unions, local communities that are directly impacted by these activities, investors having invested into their development (shareholders, investment and/or development banks) and authorities at local, regional and national levels. Some other stakeholders are equally important, although they are not directly involved in the daily operations. These include academia and research, media, political parties, non-governmental organisations, insurance companies, technology providers, customers and end-users of minerals and metals. This creates extremely complex webs of differing and potentially conflicting perceptions and interests, fuelled by differing experiences and knowledge, and divergent interests. The differences in perceptions is nurtured by differing cultural differences, access to knowledge and asymmetries of information. Some stakeholders may also reject fact-based evidence and science as guides available to inform their own decisions or even develop rejection of science-based governance. A further complication is that different stakeholders have agendas defined by very different timeframes: economic stakeholders frequently have very short-time strategic objectives set by shareholders expectations of rapid returns. Activist funds and financial analysts being driven by profit seeking are making it difficult for companies to invest in long-term development activities, including in research and innovation. Politicians and regulatory frameworks they define are constrained by electoral agendas while innovations may take decades to complete the complex route from the initial innovation concept and its translation in derived innovative products and services becoming available on the market. Local populations also tend to expect rapid tangible returns from new mining activities. These conflicting time horizons is an important problem for mining projects which frequently take 20 years and more from the initial discovery to the eventual commissioning of a new mine. And then, the profitability of mining projects that in many cases have required hundreds million $US, and sometimes billions, of initial capital investment to start their production will much depend on hardly foreseeable changes in regulatory and/or taxation frameworks. Negative social impacts easily develop where modern industrial scale mining projects develop in regions with native populations having had limited, or none, previous exposure to 21st industrial culture. Cultural differences and knowledge/information asymmetries between mining companies and local communities can make stakeholder dialogue and cooperation very difficult and resource consuming. But the cost of failure is much higher. It can ruin a project or even translate into bloody conflict. Examples of such situations are the civil war that developed on Bougainville Island (Papua New Guinea) further to the development of the giant Panguna copper mine (May 1996; Hammond 2012; Zorn 2018), the failure of the large-scale Minas Conga gold project in Peru (Downs et al. 2020). Not only large-scale industrial projects are exposed to conflicts. The production of sand and gravel is essentially ensured worldwide by a myriad of small- to medium-scale enterprises, with relatively limited international trade, as compared to higher value minerals and metals, due to the relatively low per-ton value of most sand and gravel products. In quite a number of countries, this specific segment of the industry is very loosely regulated, if regulated at all (Brown and Peduzzi 2019). In some countries, including in Europe, this industry is exposed to corruption and even organised crime and land-use conflicts related to sand and gravel production abound. However, practical solutions are available to reduce the negative impacts of this industry segment (UN Environment 2018). The re-use of tailing sands could help to substitute some sand uses, but this is unlikely to develop significantly unless well-recognised international standards are developed certifying that candidate tailing materials meet minimum physical and chemical specifications required for specific end-uses. Moreover, the use of tailing sands is likely to be constrained by the existence of local markets, as their low per-ton value makes it uneconomic to transport such materials over longer distances. All are challenging top-down business-as-usual development models, calling for careful stakeholder integration from the early stages of the mine planning process, as soon as exploration results indicate that a discovery may have the potential to become a mine and the decision is taken by the project owners to engage a preliminary economic assessment or a scoping study of the identified prospect. Addressing in a fair and transparent manner the multiple interests of stakeholders is a complex and time-consuming, but necessary, process. Even the well-meant goodwill of companies keen to engage local communities into their project can lead to negative impacts. In regions with limited economic activities, mining projects do provide jobs and financial compensations to impacted communities, but these are temporary as employment, local communities support programmes and/or compensation schemes paid by mining companies are likely to come to a more or less rapid stop once the mine and/or the smelter/refinery end their activities. Income and/or benefits perceived by local communities can be temporary by nature, unless specific actions are conceived and effectively implemented such as the creation of a public trust fund where part of the funds perceived by the authorities is set aside for the benefit of future generations, a model that has been develop for oil and gas revenue in Norway, with a large part of this revenue being set aside in the Norwegian Oil Trust Fund, currently worth over 1 trillion US$ (Norges Bank Investment Management 2019). As mineral and metal production–related revenue comes to an end once the production activities, social disruption can be extremely severe when communities adopted unsustainable lifestyles that then collapsed. Zorn (2018) reflecting on his long experience in advising the authorities of Papua New Guinea authorities on the management of the country’s mining sector states: “Big mining projects in developing countries by their very nature generate lots of cash, environmental problems, and social disruption while contributing relatively little employment or other linkages to the national economy. Managing both the good (foreign exchange inflows, government revenue) and the bad is not easy”. Ericsson and Löf (2019) and the International Council of Mines and Metals (ICMM 2020) provide descriptions of the contribution of mining to national economies, including production, prices, mineral rents, exploration expenditure, government revenues and several governance-related indicators, including the World Bank’s World Governance Indicator (WGI) and the UN Human Development Index (HDI). The geographic coverage is global, with a particular focus on low-income and middle-income countries. This contribution, from a broad sustainability perspective, has also been assessed by the UN International Resource Panel (IRP 2020b). However, the use of mineral rents, an indicator published annually by the World Bank as a part of its World Development Indicators (World Bank 2021), does not document the contribution of mining to national economies. A mineral rent is the financial surplus that arises if the selling price of a mineral or mineral production is higher than the full cost of its production, including taxes, royalties and levies, amortisation and depreciation. This indicator provides no information about how this rent is shared among the various stakeholders. To measure the contribution of mineral and metal production to producing countries, it would be necessary to consider all the monetary flows that go into the economy of the producing country:
 Wages paid to national employees Procurement from national sources (including food, energy, and water) Taxes, levies, rights, and royalties paid to the national, regional or local authorities Voluntary subsidies and grants paid to local stakeholders (support to specific local activities related, for instance, to culture, education, farming, health or sports) Payments into national health and pension schemes Provision of infrastructure to local populations (housing, power supply, roads, water supply and sanitation, waste collection and processing …) Provision of public access to some infrastructure specifically built for the mining and/or metallurgical activities There is no database providing public access to this information, which could be partly compiled from annual reports of those companies providing a detailed country-level breakdown of their operating costs and reporting their social performance. Annual reports produced by mining companies mostly only provide data aggregated at corporate level. Private equity companies do not have to publish annual reports. A detailed assessment on the socio-economic impacts of mining, providing somewhat more detailed data, is available for global gold mining over the 1990–2013 period (Maxwell Stamp PLC and The World Gold Council 2015). It provides data and analysis for the 30 largest gold-producing countries. It states that the industry provides one million direct employments worldwide, plus three million additional indirect employments in companies providing services and goods to the gold mining industry. In some poorer countries, with relatively limited development alternatives (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Kyrgystan, Mali, Papua New Guinea, Suriname, Tanzania), gold mining generates more than 10% of the national gross value added, this representing more than the official development assistance received by some of these countries. However, these benefits are only temporary, as they will stop once ore reserves are mined out. Therefore, the transformation of this temporary bonanza into actions that can generate lasting benefits, for instance through investment into health and education, is of major importance. This requires a strong commitment to good governance by the political personnel and the administration of these countries.",13

We are now confined to our homes and we have seen the most important global industrial halt since 2WW. If an observer was to write about the future of any industry in February 2020, the conclusions could have been similar to what we said in 2019. Suddenly, the world halted, and globally, the oil and gas price drastically dropped as consumption stopped. There is obviously a direct correlation between GDP growth and mining. Thus, as the world prepares to a severe drop in GDP, we must conclude that mining will suffer also a general drop. But we are seeing a very curious effect of the national isolation caused by the closure of frontiers. As imports of many minerals through ports stopped, many industries are looking for a national supply; then for some commodities, there is an increase in national production, and, at the same time, some exporting countries will suffer a severe drop in exports to Europa. Since Europe was a main global mineral importer, we might be seeing, during some months, an increase of the European mineral production for internal use, a reduction of imports from outside Europe and thus an improvement in the balance of payments in this sector.",8

Sweden and Finland garnered such attention during the mining boom. Increasing demand for metals and mines drives mineral exploration with the aim of identifying commercially extractable deposits across the EU (European Commission 2016). As the region experienced a proliferation of mineral exploration and investment, various actors raised questions over the viability of mining and its effect on existing social practices and the environment. Academic research on the mining industry grew commensurately and one field that benefitted considerably from the surge in research is the social sciences. Over the past few years, issues central to the social side of the mining industry, such as CSR, social license, public consultations, and environmental regulation, received far greater examination. Nevertheless, as mining activity continues in these Nordic nations and proposals for new projects are assessed, understanding the mining policy processes from a social science perspective is ever more critical. From a policy process perspective, mining provides an interesting but not uncommon case of competing interests and values, a non-renewable resource that requires land use and causes irreversible change to the ecosystem but, often, generates significant revenues both for the state and for private actors. Reconciling these values and the multiple interests associated with land use remains a persistent challenge for countries endowed with natural resources, not the least as governments look to stay in power and politicians to get re-elected. On the one hand, governments in resource-rich countries must attract investment to ensure that national resource revenue continues while, on the other hand, creating parameters for mining that considers local interests and limits negative effects in the environment as well as on existing sociocultural practices. In political practice, this challenge of balancing or merging the three dimensions of sustainability (e.g., economic, ecological, social) becomes increasingly more complex as governments must work within existing institutions and continuously respond to a large, and growing, cast of actors (McMahon and Remy 2001). Playing a critical role in human development, mining facilitated the advent of modern tools, engineering, and industry—a result of both production and downstream activities. Thus, mining remains crucial to our current lifestyle. Furthermore, achieving global and regional goals of sustainability, specifically around carbon emission reduction, necessitates the extraction of new minerals. Meeting these goals still puts pressure on communities, particularly regarding the risk of environmental degradation and substantial societal and cultural change (Bridge 2004: p. 206). Increasingly, local communities demand more action from governments and corporations to protect their sociocultural and economic interests. As a result, governments attempt to enhance the policy process (or elements of it) with more inclusivity while mining companies emphasize corporate social responsibility (CSR) in their efforts to improve community relations (McMahon and Remy 2001). While much of the research on CSR is focused on developing countries, where the legislative and regulatory are typically lacking, the contributions here add to our understanding on how corporate practices can drive political institutional change (Frederiksen 2019) and contribute to trust building within the community (Cesar and Jhony 2020) or, alternatively, fail to deliver on its promise and perpetuate historical problems (Hilson et al. 2019). Finally, an important aspect of CSR and mining is with reference on impacts to Indigenous communities, particularly the potential economic benefits that come with company-community partnerships (Berman et al. 2020). The connection between CSR and partnerships is particularly pertinent to Sweden and Finland, which are both home to Sami in the north. Again, while the importance of these engagement and feedback mechanisms for securing local benefits is acute in developing states with weak institutions, these issues remain pertinent for jurisdictions, such as the Nordics, that are engaged in debates over the benefits and costs of mineral extraction. Often regarded as progressive countries in terms of environmental stewardship and human welfare, an opportunity to learn from international examples and ensure mining policy fulfills societal goals. First, laying out the key facets of policy analysis—institutions, actors, and processes—and their importance in respect to mining development, then categorizing the existing body of work as a starting point to determine future areas of research. Second, highlighting key issues in Sweden and Finland related to each of the institutions, actors and process, point out some of the practical implications, and the strategies used to either take advantage of opportunities or mitigate problems. This includes highlighting similar problems experienced at different locations across the globe. Third, assessing the findings of the review and highlighting areas of strength in the policy and pointing to keys areas that we believe would benefit from additional attention.",2
34,2,Mineral Economics,03 November 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-020-00242-3,Building a mineral-based value chain in Europe: the balance between social acceptance and secure supply,July 2021,António Mateus,Luís Martins,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Minerals and metals are the material foundations of economic development behind the progress of human society. Over time, successful paths of technological evolution in production chains have led to large-scale consumption and to the current high material (and energy) intensity of the economy. However, several recent signs consistently indicate the need for changes in the way mineral raw materials are used and their (primary and secondary) sources managed. These signs include widespread concerns about the material waste in modern societies and social inequities fostered by poorly regulated globalisation agendas, in addition to apprehensions related to environmental impacts triggered by fossil fuel combustion and heavy industrial activities. Accordingly, some expectations exist about reorganisation of the current raw material supply chains to better deal with these signs, which also represent the main grounds of societal reluctance regarding mining and mineral processing activities. All the roadmaps oriented to eco-efficient and low-C intensity economies stimulate the reliance on a large number of minerals and metals whose increasing demand cannot be fulfilled on the basis of reuse, recycling, and/or substitution practices (Johnson et al. 2007; Vidal et al. 2013, 2017; UNEP 2017; Fortier et al. 2018; Hund et al. 2020). This means that material inputs derived from primary resources will always be necessary to balance the demand/supply ratio, filling the gaps of material stocks and flows in the economy that are not provided by secondary sources, even when suitably managed. In fact, the expected growth rates for demography and gross per capita incomes will boost spreads in consumption of conventional raw materials (Krausmann et al. 2009; OECD 2019). These spreads will be coupled with increasing diversity and growing amounts of specific metals needed to support the current and foreseen expansion of digital, clean, and disruptive technologies, reinforcing the trends towards (high-tech) metal-intensive economies (Kleijn et al. 2011; Fizaine 2013; Giurco et al. 2014; Frenzel et al. 2015; UNEP 2016b; Kavlak et al. 2015; Deetman et al. 2018). However, as reported in several recent assessments (UNEP 2009, 2010b, 2013a; Reck and Graedel 2012; EU Commission 2020a), ≈ 60% of the raw materials used in high-growth and high-tech industries have low (< 5%) recycling rates and are of difficult or impossible substitution, according to current know-how and technical procedures, and economic criteria. Furthermore, the production and market availability of these raw materials are subjected to a series of constraints that increase the likelihood of supply shortages in the near future, justifying their inclusion in various lists of critical raw materials (CRM), such as those produced for the EU (Coulomb et al. 2015; Graedel et al. 2015b; Delloite Sustainability et al. 2017; EU Commission 2018a, 2020b). The ongoing revolution of digital technology (digitisation) plays a vital role in the dematerialisation of economy (Ulbrych 2015). Physical goods and services are being gradually replaced by digital versions, and impacts on product innovation, technical upgrading, operational efficiency, and downtime reductions (by means of predictive maintenance and smarter programming of maintenance cycles) were already achieved in many stages of industrial value chains. But these continuing technological developments represent also an important driver of the current and anticipated demanding growth for many CRM, despite the overall tendency to atomisation (i.e., shifting manufacturing models towards additive assembly of very small, custom-designed components). Pressures on the production and availability at affordable costs of these CRM and several other mineral commodities rise considerably when added to the quantities required to meet the growing market demands in technological solutions oriented to (i) electric power generation and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as electrical mobility, energy efficiency, renewable energy production and storage; (ii) smart communication grids and advanced interaction tools of widespread use; and (iii) disruptive technologies aiming at increasing levels of automation and efficiency, which may also drive the search for new (smart) materials, including robotics in industrial and residential contexts, autonomous driving, 3D-printing, and drones with specific functions. To a large extent, many of these transformations, with evident impact in the mining industry and mineral-based value chains, are policy-driven (Tilton et al. 2018). But policy makers must realise that the growing dependence on many mineral commodities should also force significant changes in the current mineral production/supply networks, claiming for an increase of domestic production quotas whenever possible. Without these changes, several difficulties recently experienced as a result of export restrictions, hegemony, and market control by some players will tend to worsen, reinforcing the raising of concerns on security, availability, and costs of minerals and their derivatives (OECD 2010, 2014; UNEP 2016a; Mitra 2019). This could put at risk successful paths towards the goals of many international agreements, namely those concerned with social and economic inequalities and global climate change. On the contrary, if the right political measures were taken, new opportunities will be provided to encourage mineral exploration and develop modern mining centres operating sustainably in countries where these activities were significantly reduced in the last decades, as in the EU. The existent policy instruments used to promote domestic production should be reviewed in some depth and improved. The task is problematic but essential to face the new challenges imposed by the need to regulate the joint management of products derived from primary and secondary resources and address the increasing number of social concerns. In what concerns the first aim, the intended measures should embrace collectively and coherently the activities related to the access and transformation of raw materials regardless of their origin. This will generate an intertwined body of regulatory solutions that improve the governance of material stocks/flows in the economy, boosting as well the collaborative inter-sectoral management of productive activities. In consequence, mineral-based value chains will be gradually restructured through reinforced regional networks geographically scattered. If suitably implemented, this reorganisation can also assist the quickened spread of good industrial practices and transparent trading processes, besides ensuring consumers that materials used in end-products meet environmental, ethical, and other responsible social standards (McLellan et al. 2009; Epstein and Yuthas 2011; OECD 2013; Ali et al. 2017; Wall et al. 2017; Hofmann et al. 2018; Segura-Salazar and Tavares 2018). The second aim of the envisaged improvements in policy instruments should be contextualised in narratives seeking for higher levels of procedural fairness, legitimacy, and trustworthiness in decision-making processes related to mineral raw materials (Bice et al. 2017; Boutilier 2020). These processes, from the granting of mineral exploration and exploitation rights to the permitting of industrial infrastructures implicated in mineral transformation, should be simple, consistent, transparent, and easily scrutinised. The proficiency of applicants should be subjected to highly demanding criteria and procedures often involved in rent-seeking and regulatory capture should be changed to correct distorted outcomes (Dumbrell et al. 2020). An open and systematically updated information database about ongoing or planned industrial activities should be created by competent authorities and duly disclosed to the public in general, stimulating further communication/discussion frameworks with a wide spectrum of stakeholders. This will minimise the polarisation of public opinion caused by biased interpretations or conjectures and allow to anticipate potential conflicts at local scales. The scope of evidence-informed decisions should be widened by including sources of knowledge other than technical, legal, or other kinds of expertise (Rifkin 1994; Head 2010; Dumbrell et al. 2020). The means by which minerals are accessed and how these practices are reconciled with other land uses or natural resources/eco-services should also be clarified and balanced. In this work, some fundamentals on global and regional mineral-based value chains are revisited, commenting their connections with the mining and product life cycles, as well as the need to reorient current procedures to better assist the raw materials demand and supply balances imposed by the main technological and societal drivers. These issues have been recurrently addressed in recent literature, although not delivering an integrative perspective, and to the best of our knowledge, not discussing the importance of have strong regional networks supporting the supply of mineral raw materials located in diverse regions/countries. So, the main goal is to propose a conceptual rearrangement of interconnections between the Mining and Product Life Cycles, leading to the build-up of restructured and more resilient mineral-based value chains that may assist the fundamental drivers of the intended technological and socio-economic development. In this context, the specific case of the EU is analysed, considering the impacts of a reinforced upstream industry (mining/quarrying and mineral processing) in a renewed European raw materials economic sector. Policies that encourage the growth of domestic production of minerals and their derivatives from primary resources in the EU will face strong social disapproval, as documented for many recent situations in different Member-States. Therefore, several additional comments on the relevance of “Corporate Social Responsibility” and “Social Licence to Operate” concepts for public opinion are provided along with suggestions of improved communication approaches to enhance the transparency and accountability of decisions that affect the management of natural capitals of communal use and of public importance, such as mineral resources.",10

For example, Poland accounts for 56% of the EU’s copper production, Sweden represents 90% of the net iron ore production, and Greece and Finland each account for approximately half of the nickel production. Sweden accounts for 43% and Ireland accounts for 32% of the EU’s lead and zinc production, respectively (STRADE 2018). This production mostly comes from individual companies. Poland’s copper production primarily comes from KGHM, and LKAB accounts for the majority of iron ore produced in Sweden. On the Iberian Peninsula, the presence of multination corporations, namely Lundin, First Quantum, Atalaya, and the Mubadala Group, is responsible for most of the current production of base metals. Within the framework of the EU Raw Materials Initiative, an explicit objective was established to ensure the supply of raw materials from national and international sources. The declining attraction of investment in exploration during the recent decades is cited as one of the main reasons why new production capacities have not been added to the EU’s member states. Fundamentally, the European Union has supported the mining sector through the Horizon 2020 Seventh Framework Program by financing projects focused on technical, social, political and governance matters associated with raw materials. STRADE (2018) notes that the number of active projects ranging from prospecting to obtaining exploitation permits is relatively limited and reaches below 200 for the EU member states. What is more concerning is that the number of projects in the advanced exploration stage is close to half of those included in production. In this work, only projects that are still without production that have a favourable technical report or PEA are considered. Additionally, those with exploration investments exceeding 10,000 m of drilling or its equivalent are included (see Tables 1, 2 and 3). In Iberia, the proportion of projects in production under these conditions is almost 1/1.
 In southwest Europe, most of the metallogenic provinces are bound to the European Variscan Belt, namely the Hesperian Massif in Iberia. Referring to the operational metallic mineral deposits in Iberia, two large metallogenic provinces could be considered. One of the characteristics of the South Portuguese Zone (SPZ) is the abundance and size of the massive sulphide deposits contained herein. The part of the SPZ where these ores exist is known as the Iberian Pyrite Belt (Barriga 1990). The IPB, which forms part of the Hercynian orogenic belt, consists of Late Devonian to Middle Carboniferous rocks that host considerable mineralized volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VMS) deposits: 1700 Mt of sulphides consisting of 14.6 mill.t of Cu, 13.0 mill.t of Pb, 34.9 mill.t of Zn, 46,100 t of Ag and 880 t of Au (Inverno et al. 2015). Several deposits with less economic importance are located in the Galicia-Tras-os-Montes Zone, the West Asturian-Leonese Zone and the Central Iberian Zone in Portugal and Spain. There are productive mineral occurrences containing metals that are used in technological applications (Sn, W, Ta and Li). These deposits are generally formed by magmatic-hydrothermal processes and are commonly related to magmatic rocks with granitic compositions. Other areas of metallogenic interest are located in the Asturian-Leonese Zone, which contains the only active gold mine in the Iberian Peninsula and the Ossa Morena Zone, which has considerable research possibilities for various metals. Often, the assignment of an “ore deposit” to a specific metallogenic province is decisive. In the IPB, the geochemistry and morphology of its deposits are the determinants of the mining system. In their fundamental models (disseminated, massive and “stockwork feeder zone”), they frequently appear imbricated, deformed (probably with material flow) and even inverted. However, together, they form lenses, which are often short and thick (Tornos 2008). Furthermore, the final configurations left by the tectonic phases to which they have been subjected tend to occupy both the flanks and hinges of the tight folds of the Variscan orogeny. This morphology favours economic exploitation at medium and, in the future, even deeper depths in sublevel systems with or without filling. Additionally, shortening (very tight folds and very frequent thrusting) substantially assists exploration. For this reason, successes in exploration are not rare after having spent considerable amounts of money in this endeavour. The differences between the geotechnical characteristics of a mineral and its “hanging wall” facilitate low dilution in the “stockwork” and massive ore. In addition, the specific gravity of all the sulphides that accompany the usable sulphides is a factor of extractive volumetric efficiency, which is of interest in underground mining. In addition, the secondary enrichments of the main metals linked to the last deformation stages favour the selection of their qualities. Nevertheless, technological minerals do not usually present morphological homogeneity, even in their setting, always very dispersed, which does not facilitate the formation of minable exploitation clusters. Furthermore, as already described, current projects lack important dimensions and present many individual variations. Thus, the tendency of tungsten to be exploited in a variety of scheelite minerals is due both to its relative abundance and previous lack of mining. This causes metallurgical problems and lacks social acceptance, as can be seen in areas with no recent mining tradition. A grouping of uses can be seen from Kesler and Simon ’s (2015) perspective in his book Mineral Resources, Economics, and the Environment. This book contains updated information on the geology and distribution of metals denominated “technological elements”. In this case, the main resources are described, as well as the technological and economic conditions of basic metals (for example, aluminium and copper) and a few selected metals (for example, lithium and rare earths). This book contains a description of the current available resources and the distribution of such deposits, in addition to the use of this group of metals in several rapidly growing fields. Regarding this, the next three groups are considered separately in Iberian metal production. The base metals (Cu-Zn-Pb). There is no rigorous definition for this metal group. Aluminium, copper, zinc, lead and nickel are generally considered base metals. However, in the case of mining on the Iberian Peninsula, only copper, zinc and lead are considered. This is due to their economic importance; nickel ceased a few years ago, and there are not aluminium deposits of great importance.  The W-Sn-Ta-Li group. De la Torre and Espí (2019a, b) referred to the W-Sn-Ta-Li group as being scarce. In the W-Sn-Ta-Li group, there is sometimes a natural association of geological and metallogenic types, at least for those under the most frequently occurring geological conditions. These metals are scarce with an iron (steel) affinity that produces alloys or surface improvement (tin in the manufacture of tinplate, tungsten, niobium) and belong to the group of metals with technological value (Wellmer and Becker-Platen 2002). Precious metals (Au, Ag). Precious metals are categorized as such due to their high price. They are metals that occur regularly in nature in the free state; that is they are not combined with other chemical elements. In Iberia, there is only one gold-producing project, although the chances of having appreciable production of this metal are reasonably high. Silver is an element that inevitably accompanies copper and zinc minerals. For this reason and especially in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, silver contributes unevenly to the economic feasibility production of these two metals. Assuming the grouping of projects according to the criteria described above, we provide a brief description.
 The base metals (Cu-Zn-Pb) (Table 1) The mining design of IPB projects is based on the varied morphological and geochemical characteristics of its ore deposits. In general, massive sulphide bodies occupy the core of the main deposits of the Neves Corvo (Cu, Zn), Ajustrel in Portugal (Zn, Cu), Aguas Teñidas (Cu, Zn), Sotiel Coronada (Zn, Cu) and Magdalena-MATSA (Cu, Zn), Cobre Las Cruces (Cu) (Table 1). All these deposits are exploited as “cobrizos” (more or less rich in copper). However, Los Frailes in Spain and Ajustrel and Lagoa Salgada in Portugal contain appreciable amounts of zinc and lead (Table 1). In addition, the “feeder” Riotinto-Atalaya Mining (copper), disseminated primary sulphides and stockworks are also exploited in the new CLC project, termed PMR (Polymetallurgical Refinery), which will replace the current one that is in the closing phase. This project has revealed a substantial amount of copper and zinc sulphides underneath the depleted secondary sulphide mass. These minerals are part of the “feeders” of the main body, and therefore, their degrees are notably lower. The Aguas Teñidas deposit also has a deformed stock attached to the main mass. The grades are also highly variable. Massive sulphides have exploitable copper grades above 2% Cu (“cobrizos”, rich in copper) from Neves Corvo, Aguas Teñidas and Magdalena. The Las Cruces copper deposit stands out, with average grades in the order of 6% Cu (secondary sulphides) and the primitive Neves Corvo (approximately 5% Cu). The massive sulphides that contain zinc and lead do not usually exceed 5% Zn (Neves Corvo, Ajustrel, Aguas Teñidas and Sotiel). All these deposits are currently mined in underground mining operations. However, current stockworks do not exceed 0.5% Cu in Riotinto-Atalaya Mining, while they are somewhat higher in Aguas Teñidas. The next Cobre Las Cruces (CLC) project will mine a primary mineral deposit (including feeders) with only 1.1% Cu, 2.6% Zn and 1.3% Pb. The Riotinto project is set to mine an “open pit” with a low stripping ratio, while the PMR project will operate an underground mine due to administrative obligations, while the recently paralysed CLC open pit has a very high stripping ratio (approximately 14/1, t/t). If we do not take into account the first period of the Neves Corvo production (a true European world class), the productions of the current Iberian projects are quite similar (Table 1). Thus, approximately 70,000 t Cu per year is produced by Cobre Las Cruces, Aguas Teñidas (with its three deposits) and, possibly, Touro-Atalaya Mining and Neves Corvo-Lundin become operational within a very short time. In zinc-lead production, the 130,000 t of zinc equivalent in lead is the current production capacity of MATSA (Aguas Teñidas-Magdalena-Sotiel), but this could be achieved (or close to it) in a short time in the CLC-PMR, Neves Corvo, Ajustrel, Los Frailes and, perhaps, Lagoa Salgada mines. Two pending projects have been left out of the description: the Touro mine in the metallogenic province of Galicia-Tras-os-Montes Zone and the Toral mine, in the West Asturian-Leonese Zone. The most developed of the two is the Touro mine, which would be operational if it had obtained an environmental permit from the regional administration.
 W-Sn-Ta-Li group (technological elements) (Table 2) Referring to the geological context of Iberian economic mineralization, there are two other closely related zones referred to as Central Iberian Zone (CIZ) and the Galicia-Trás-Os Montes Zone (GTMZ). They contain productive mineral manifestations containing technological metals (Sn, W, Ta, Li) (Table 2). They are primarily located in relation to pegmatitic fields and leucogranitic cupolas, in addition to stockworks and veins in hanging rocks. Tin: Tin is broadly distributed across Iberia, and there are abundant mineralized deposits: plutons, granites and domes, stockworks and placers. However, with tin prices in recent years, only the Oropesa mine has economic viability. Discovered at the end of the last century, Oropesa has been included in several different projects in recent times. The optimum version of the project in open-pit mining would produce no less than 2000 t/year Sn. Its tin grade is quite high, referring to open-pit mining. Currently, this project is awaiting environmental permit. Tungsten: Iberia has been a great producer of tungsten over the last century. At present, supported by reasonable metal prices, it seems that its production will be renewed again. The main projects are as follows: Panasqueira (Portugal) is one of the main tungsten mines in Europe and is located within the Central Iberian Zone of the Iberian Massif, which is a continental-scale tin-tungsten metallogenic belt in Western Europe. This vein type deposit is spatially and genetically associated with a two-mica, S-type, Late Paleozoic granitoid. Panasqueira is an old project that has been operational without interruption in recent years. Los Santos (Salamanca, Spain). Los Santos is a skarn deposit. These scheelite-bearing ore form bodies deposited through magmatic-hydrothermal fluids associated with granitoid intrusions into carbonate metasedimentary rocks. The Los Santos project has just been halted without reaching the stage of underground mining from its actual open pit mode. Valtreixal (Zamora, Spain). This is as a complex hydrothermal deposit with hydrothermal veins, but is a skarn affinity bound to a stratabound horizon within green schists overall. Tungsten mineralization, as scheelite, occurs mainly outside quartz veins and appears to be stratabound in origin; however, associated tungsten (cassiterite) mineralization is found in and around the quartz veins. The owner company, ALMONTY R. is also the owner of the Los Santos deposit, which it will probably replace. San Finx (La Coruña, Spain). The San Finx deposit is formed by hydrothermal quartz veins with cassiterite and wolframite hosted in shale and orthogneiss within a graben structure. Synkinematic two-mica granites outcrop in the vicinity. The main mineralization is found in several quartz veins between 0.5 and 4 m thick. The project has been halted due to environmental requirements. La Parrilla (Cáceres, Spain). La Parrilla is a hydrothermal vein-style deposit consisting of a scheelite- and cassiterite-bearing quartz vein system hosted within a Precambrian schist-graywacke sequence and located above a buried granitoid intrusion, which is interpreted to be the source of the mineralizing fluids. The project was started with considerable difficulties achieving the expected production. Barruecopardo (Salamanca, Spain): hydrothermal quartz-tungsten mineralization at Barruecopardo occurs within the igneous intrusive rocks. The system of steep parallel veins and veinlets of variable length and widths (up to 15 cm wide) is hosted by the Barruecopardo leucogranite. The project, recently started, has encountered quite a few problems in reaching design production. The dimensions of tungsten projects are relatively similar. Two groups can be established, projects with a “production guidance” of approximately 100 kmtu (1000 t WO3)/year: Panasqueira, Los Santos, Valtreixal, San Finx and Regua, and projects that will exceed 200 kmtu (2000 t WO3)/year: La Parrilla and Barruecopardo. Tantalum: Iberia produced a substantial amount of tantalite at the end of the last century, with deposits in production in Golpejas (Salamanca) and Penouta (Orense) and Covilha in Portugal. The development of the Penouta project (Spain) halted because of the tin crisis of 1985 and was meant the return to produce tantalum and niobium in Spain. The deposit is part of a greinsenized and albitized granite dome that contains a mineralized body in Sn-Ta-Nb up to a depth of more than 200 m. Mineralization produced cassiterite and minerals from the columbite group, which are finely scattered throughout the granite. The Penouta project started in 2018 and is going through a difficult start. The valued resources fail to reach 100 million tons. Both the tantalum content (77 g Ta/t) and tin content (443 g Sn/t) are essential. Lithium: As in other metals, the ability to reach European metal needs always falls short; in lithium, meeting these needs in the short term seems possible. In Iberia, several projects have reached the level outlined by the Economic Feasibility Study, and some are in the beginning of investments. All deposits fall under a recognized quality standard used to validate their resources and reserves. Examples can be seen in the Iberian Peninsula, including the Valdeflórez project in Spain and the Barroso project in Portugal. In addition, Las Navas in Spain and others in Portugal are on the way to achieving such goals. These projects refer to hard rock mineralized deposits, and both their grades and geological circumstances resemble many of the world’s operational projects. Barroso (Portugal). The Barroso project is the most advanced Portuguese project. The deposit consists of pegmatites with spodumene inclusions in shales. Its resources are valued at 14.4 mill.t with 0.92% Li2O. Argemela (Portugal). The hydrothermal-related granite deposits of the Argemela project are valued at 20.1 Mt (Inferred resources) with 0.86% Li2O. Valdeflórez (Spain). The Valdeflórez contains stockworks of Qz-Sn-Li veins and a massive ore deposit formed by wall rock metasomatism by lithium micas. Resources are valued at 14.1 mill.t with 1.1% Li2O. It is the most advanced Spanish project with solid engineering that aims to achieve the highest added value to obtain battery-quality lithium hydroxide. The lack of understanding on the part of local and regional administrations has impeded its continuity. The project has been renewed with a change in membership. Las Navas (Spain). Pegmatite dikes in the materials of the Grauváquico schist can be seen in the Las Navas mine. This project has sufficient resources to operate and produce more than 20,000 t of CLE production per year. It is awaiting environmental authorizations. Precious metals (Au, Ag) (Table 3) In Iberia, there is only one gold-producing project, although the possibilities of having significant productions of this metal are quite high. Silver is an element that inevitably accompanies copper and zinc minerals (Table 3). For this reason, especially in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB), silver contributes to the project’s economy. Orovalle: The gold mineralized deposit in the El Valle-Boinás-Carlés mine is part of a skarn in the Gold Belt of the Narcea River. It is associated with the Boinás stock, which partially fits into a carbonate series of Cambrian age. The complex is affected by hydrothermal episodes that remobilize some elements, brecciate and enrich the mineralized zone with gold. Orovalle is the continuation of Rio Narcea gold mines that began its activity at the beginning of this century. Altogether, the metal extraction in this area reaches one million ounces of gold. Now, it still has 9 million tons of resource reserves left with approximately 4.0 g Au/t. Actual production is approximately 50,000 ounces of gold per year. Orovalle has initiated extensive exploration activities to maintain its presence in other Asturian gold belts. Salave: The Salave gold-silver deposit includes a group of shallow, near-horizontal mineralized bodies associated with altered fracture zones in the Salave granodiorite. According to a technical report produced by the owner, the company stated that, based on the NI 43-101 standard, Salave’s measured and indicated resources reach 6.5 million tons with a grade of 4.5 g Au/t, this is, of 0.95 million ounces of gold. The Exploraciones Mineras del Cantábrico project has adapted to the environmental requirements set by the regional administration (underground mining, distances from the processing plant, sale of gold contained in a flotation concentrate and others) to obtain definitive permits. Corcoesto: The Corcoesto gold deposit is located in an approximately 2-km-wide shear band in the northwestern part of the shale domain of the Galicia-Tres-Os-Montes (SDGTM). The higher-grade mineralization is related to quartz veins that contain arsenopyrite. Edgewater Exploration has valued its resources (measured and indicated) to reach 5.8 million tons, grading 1.74 g Au/t, and 350,000 ounces of gold. Currently, the project has been haltered by the regional administration and is being appealed by the affected company.",2

The publication of the “Communication on the Raw Materials Initiative - Meeting our critical need for growth and jobs in Europe” (COM 699, 2008) and Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (COM 571 2011) which promotes a shift towards a resource efficient and low-carbon economy to help achieve more sustainable growth were a turning point for European minerals policy. A large variety of activities have been conducted to support research and innovation (Smol and Kulczycka 2019), to exchange best practices and to improve public awareness and policy (Tilton et al. 2018). Key areas covered increased transparency (Alstin 2017), environmental and social performance (Mancini and Sala 2018), sustainability (De Sa 2019) and climate change (United Nations Environmental Programme - UNEP 2020), as well as acceptance and trust of the mining industry. For example, a Strategic Implementation Plan for the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials (RM) was established and the Raw Materials Information System (RMIS) was created. In the mining sector many research projects have been supported by European Union (EU) financial instruments such as Horizon 2020 (H2020) and Knowledge and Innovation Community Raw Materials (KIC RM) partnership bringing together businesses, research centres and universities. The goal was to increase innovation in exploration, mining and processing, recycling and the substitution of raw materials, as well as to foster international co-operation and improve the framework conditions for sustainable development and increase resource efficiency. All activities should be consistent with the EU commitment to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2015 all EU Member States adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is based on 17 SDGs with 5 key elements: people, planet, partnership, prosperity, peace and 169 indicators. However, knowledge about the mining sector’s contribution to the SDGs is still limited (Endl et al. 2019). Moreover, in the EC reflection paper Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030, published in 2019, it was underlined that “the most serious sustainability deficit and the greatest challenge is the ecological debt which we are running up by overusing and depleting our natural resources and thereby threatening our ability to meet the needs of future generations within the limits of our planet”. The EU advised Member States to revise or develop their own minerals policy, taking into account their needs and priorities in the sector. Germany, Finland, United Kingdom, Portugal and Greece were the first European countries to introduce and develop a new mineral policy (2010–2012). They proposed sustainable access to mineral resources from primary and secondary sources and emphasized that the sustainable use of raw materials is in line with other environmental policies focusing on climate neutrality, resource efficiency and waste minimisation. The idea of the paper is to present general trends – the impact of the implementation of the mineral policy on the contribution of the mining sector to the achievement of SDGs. In the EU Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (COM 571, 2011) and most countries the aim of mineral policy were to boost domestic supply of raw materials, shift towards a resource efficient and low-carbon economy, therefore the analysis focusing on assessment data about CO2 emissions, mineral production and resource productivity in chosen EU countries in last 10 years.",13

In morphological terms, it is a hill range expanding in a north-south direction. Parts of it are Wzgórze Siodłowe, Szklana Góra, Wzgórze Tomickie, Wzgórze Koźmickie. Geologically, it belongs to the Fore-Sudetic block and the Dislocation zone Niemcza (Niśkiewicz 1967).
 The current state of Szklary area (2019); red colour — the simplified shape of the area of the deposits in Szklary (based on MIDAS 2020; GEOlog 2020); 1 – UAV photo — the northern part of the area; 2 – UAV photo — the southern part of the area Occurrences of nickel ores in Szklary are located within the elongated zone (Fig. 1). The central part was exploited from the XIX century until 1983 when the mine was closed. The decision was made due to the low grade of ore, inefficient processing technology, and the environmental aspects (Furmankiewicz and Krzyżanowski 2008). After the mine closure, the terrain was reclaimed and is currently covered with forest (Fig. 1). The processing waste (slag) remained as the tailing piles on the west side of Szklary (Fig. 1). In more recent times, the site was explored by two companies: KGHM Polska Miedź S.A. and Gepco Geologia i Ochrona Środowiska, but their work did not result in the mine reopening. Nowadays, the region is not under exploration or mining concession. Only a tourist attraction exists in one of the remaining adits called “Robert” (Kaczan and Wirth 2020). Recent economic interest in the nickel deposits were caused by the positive situation in the commodity markets and the increasing significance of this metal. The average price of nickel in recent years remains at a stable and high level. More than half of the recently produced nickel is consumed in the production of stainless steel (Wei et al. 2020). However, the rising demand for nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earths, mainly due to the development of battery production for electric vehicles is highly possible (Campagnol et al. 2017). It is assumed that the demand will result in the growing market price of nickel (Delevingne et al. 2020). Moreover, the latest critical raw material list for Europe refers to nickel as one of the significant metals in Europe’s future (European Comission 2020). The planning of mining investment needs special attention to environmental aspects (Wei et al. 2020). From the significant aspects, two are first to be met: a circular economy and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (Delevingne et al. 2020; Wei et al. 2020; European Comission 2019). The article presents the current state of knowledge about Szklar. The description of the history and potential of the remaining parts of the deposit justifies the possibility of using hydrometallurgy as an enrichment method suitable for this type of deposit. The authors present the results of preliminary research on this type of process.

Most academics and policy makers agree that improving institutional quality, sterilizing export revenue in a sovereign resource fund, and diversifying exports reduce the likelihood and severity of the resource curse (Van der Ploeg 2011; Bastida 2014). Our study contributes to this ongoing discussion of policies to support diversification and economic complexity in countries dependent on resource extraction (see Al-Rawashdeh et al. 2013; Bishoge and Mvile 2020; Ericsson and Löf 2019; International Monetary Fund 2016; Narankhuu 2018; Sadik-Zada et al. 2019; among others). Specifically, we analyze the service market in an oil-exporting country and propose recommendations for diversification policies. Our interest in services is motivated by their rising importance for the competitiveness of non-oil sectors (Hoekman and Shepherd 2019; Su et al. 2020) and their crucial role in petroleum value chain (Hawkins 2016; Wicken 2016; Atakhanova 2021). The petroleum industry’s value chain consists of interrelated processes that transform natural resources into consumer products: upstream, including exploration, production, and auxiliary oilfield services; midstream, consisting of transportation and storage; and downstream, including refining and marketing. In other words, the petroleum sector critically depends on general business services (financing, trading, and marketing) as well as specialized services (exploration, appraisal, transportation, storage) including the so-called oilfield services (design, construction, drilling, maintenance, R&D). As a result, oil output and exports embody services used in their production: in 2005, 13% of the value of the OECD energy extraction exports was attributed to domestic services, and by 2016, this indicator reached 18% (TiVA database,Footnote 12018). Intensive use of intermediate services is common to manufacturing production as well. Starting from the 1980s, manufacturing firms increased the use of intermediate services because the latter allowed for greater specialization and economies of scale (Francois 1990; Francois and Woerz 2008). The resulting enhanced productivity of manufacturing firms enabled them to engage in international trade more actively (Amiti and Wei 2005). Trade-in intermediate services and offshoring of medium- and high-skilled services were key features of this process (Markusen 2005). Unbundling, labor division, specialization, and greater sophistication of service production resulted in the rise of modern services (such as telemarketing or online education) that are characterized by technology use, transportability, and tradability (Triplett and Bosworth 2004). This rise in service exports and their sophistication contributed to economic growth in some developing countries, such as India, and its IT-based service exports (Mishra et al. 2011; Goswami et al. 2013). Have resource-rich countries managed to take advantage of the growing sophistication and tradability of services to diversify their economies? Indeed, certain high- and upper-middle-income petroleum-exporting countries such as Bahrain, Malaysia, and United Arab Emirates have managed to develop internationally competitive service industries (International Monetary Fund 2016). Furthermore, services make a considerable contribution to employment, manufacturing production, and exports in advanced resource-rich economies, as in the case of Australia (Connoly and Lewis 2010; Gretton 2013). However, some studies find that the service sector, especially modern services, grows at a lower rate in low- and middle-income resource-rich economies than in comparator countries (Battaile and Mishra 2015). Furthermore, there is evidence that barriers to service trade constrain the economic performance of major resource-producing countries (Jensen et al. 2007; Jensen and Tarr 2007). Thus, relevant literature reports both positive and negative dynamics of the service industry in resource-based economies. Furthermore, existing literature lacks in-depth country-level studies of the impact of resource-based development on the service sector. As a result, our study’s main contribution is in filling this research gap by investigating the following questions. What type of dynamics does the service sector exhibit during an oil boom? What are the causes for the observed behavior in the service markets? What service sector policies may be recommended to support non-oil producers in resource-rich countries? Using Kazakhstan as a case study of a middle-income oil-exporting country, we find that the oil boom resulted in crowding out of non-oil producers from the intermediate service market due to the high service intensity of petroleum production and service market inefficiencies. Rising prices and decreasing availability of intermediate services created additional challenges for non-oil producers in their struggle with rising input costs and domestic currency appreciation, common features of a resource boom. We find that a 1% increase in oil output value led to a 0.27% increase in intermediate service prices and a 1% decrease in intermediate service output purchased by non-oil producers (adjusted for inflation). As a result, we conclude that service sector reform should be a key diversification policy in countries that experience an oil boom. In addition, such policies would contribute to enhancing the efficiency of the petroleum sector itself. Our recommendations include increasing competition in domestic service markets, openness to service trade, and skill availability. Our analysis begins with the examination of the oil boom in Kazakhstan and its diversification policies (“Services and the oil boom”). Next, we introduce our conceptual framework that allows us to explain the impact of the oil boom on intermediate services (“Analytical framework”). Finally, we describe our estimation approach (“Estimation approach”), report and discuss the results (“Estimation results”), and conclude (“Discussion and conclusions”).",5
34,3,Mineral Economics,16 September 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-020-00238-z,Enhancing mine risk assessment through more accurate reproduction of correlations and interactions between uncertain variables,October 2021,Aldin Ardian,Mustafa Kumral,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A key challenge in mine project evaluation is to deal with social, environmental, technical, and financial uncertainties. Social and environmental issues are paramount: risk tolerance under any circumstance is low due to ethical and legal concerns. Therefore, this paper focuses on technical and financial uncertainties, which have a significant impact on a project’s cash flow (Dimitrakopoulos 2018; Groeneveld and Topal 2011; Martinez 2009; Lishchuk and Pettersson 2020). Risk quantification in mineral industries can be classified into approaches based on the following: (1) stochastic optimization techniques, such as stochastic optimization with recourse, chance-constrained programming, robust optimization, stochastic dynamic programming, and fuzzy programming (Zimmermann 1978), generating one solution to the problem (García and Guzmán 2019; Higle 2005); and (2) the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), generating a risk profile for a given project (Sauvageau and Kumral 2018; Ugwuegbu 2013). MCS is a standard technique to assess the risk that is heavily based on the probability concept. Stochastic optimization techniques usually generate a solution that considers the trade-off between risk and utility. As the risk increases, the utility decreases, vice versa. On the other hand, MSC does not generate a solution but a risk profile. Stochastic optimization techniques are widely used for various mining problems to deal with uncertainties such as grade, production tonnage, equipment availability, and geometallurgical variables. In a comprehensive review of these techniques, Dimitrakopoulos (2011) emphasized that errors emerging from uncertainties are propagated to subsequent mining processes and can result in financial disasters. Kumral (2011) developed a stochastic optimization model with recourse to consider uncertainties stemming from geometallurgical variables. MacNeil and Dimitrakopoulos (2017) focused on switching from open-pit to underground mining through a stochastic framework. Ruiseco et al. (2016) developed a dig-limit optimization approach using genetic algorithms. Rimélé et al. (2018) proposed stochastic integer programming to address mine planning integrated with an internal waste dump and tailing disposal facility as a method to reduce possible environmental problems. Villalba Matamoros and Kumral (2019) explored an uncertainty-based model using multiple images of stopes for underground mine planning. Using MCS to generate a risk profile is the most common technique to analyze risks associated with technical and financial uncertainties. Kumral (2006) used stochastic simulation to develop a stockpile simulator. Savolainen et al. (2017) explored a cycle-reverting process relating to metal prices to be used in investment decisions. MCS has been used in real options valuation in the mineral industries (Savolainen 2016). Sauvageau and Kumral (2018) proposed an approach to calibrate diffusion parameters used in time series simulation. Marañon and Kumral (2018) applied MCS to analyze if the path of commodity prices could be explained by the Elliott wave principle. Ozdemir and Kumral (2018, 2019) employed MCS for materials handling systems in open-pit mining operations. Soft computing techniques based on machine learning also were applied to risk analysis (Jiang et al. 2020). MCS is a standard risk analysis method. The quality of data to fit a distribution and reproduction of the correlations between variables determine the value of MCS application. MCS is a strong tool to evaluate the risk of any decision-making problem that involves uncertain variables. In MCS, several samples (i.e., outcomes of a random function) are generated for each random variable. The random samples are fed into a transfer function, transforming them into evaluation criteria such as the net present value (NPV). Then, a probability distribution is fitted to the outcomes of this criterion for each scenario. From this distribution, a probability is determined for the specified NPV level, or an NPV range is determined for a specified probability. This probability is used as a measure of the risk. In the sampling process, correlations between random variables must be reproduced. If these correlations are not accurately captured, risk assessment can mislead decision-makers, and the projects are under- or over-valued. Correlation quantifies the association of the movement of two uncertain parameters with regard to each other. However, it does not say anything about causality. Therefore, the analysis is extended to a better understanding of the interaction among the variables. Interaction profiles measure the concurrent effect of more than one exploratory variable on the response variable. Even though it is used in multiple regression analysis and the design of experiments, the interaction profiles, in this paper, test if copulas are capable of capturing interactions among parameters in mine project evaluation. Interaction profiles can help a risk analyst to apprehend the dependencies that correlations cannot capture. The paper concentrates on whether the interaction profiles are reproduced in simulation. This is a key requirement for the quality of a risk analysis work. The copulas and correlation coefficients can be seen as two different ways to quantify the association between two random variables. The copula defines a multivariate cumulative distribution function to capture correlations between uncertain variables that are non-linear (Nelsen 2006; Sklar 1959), whereas the correlation coefficients are used for two variables that are linearly related under the assumption of normal distribution. Copulas have been used in mine project valuation using one correlation in each case (i.e., two uncertain variables) (Torikian and Kumral 2014). In the other case, Kopacz et al. (2017) used empirical copula to evaluate the strength of sustainable development in hard-coal mining operations of Poland. Kopacz et al. (2018) proposed an integrated approach using bootstrap sampling, Gaussian copula, and empirical copula to assess the effect of fluctuations in variables in the hard-coal industry. Nevertheless, Pearson correlation was also used in the industry as a standard correlation method, for example, supply-demand analysis of a commodity (Shafiee and Topal 2010), trade projections (Lundmark 2018), or price simulation (Ardian and Kumral 2020). Moreover, the interaction effect indicates relationships among three uncertain variables: depending on the state of one exploratory variable, it quantifies the effect of a second explanatory variable on the response variable. This paper uses MCS to compare the performance of copula and Pearson correlations in terms of their ability to reproduce correlations between and interactions among uncertain variables in a mining project evaluation. Five uncertain variables were examined—commodity price, interest rate, operating cost, ore grade, and ore recovery. Price, interest rate, and operating price are uncertain because they depend on unknown future events (Jafarizadeh and Bratvold 2019). Ore grade, recovery, and operating costs are uncertain because they depend on sparse data used in ore characterization (Grieco and Dimitrakopoulos 2007; Koushavand et al. 2014). Finally, the uncertainty of operating cost is associated with both unknown future events and sparse data characterizing ore body. This paper’s originality lies in proposing an approach to determine if copulas are able to capture interactions among the uncertain variables used in MCS through a mining project evaluation problem. In the following section, the proposed methodology is described in detail, covering correlation, copulas, MCS, and interactions. The theoretical backgrounds of these concepts are provided. In a risk analysis work, how copulas are used is demonstrated. The next section describes the case study. The values of the parameters used are given. The specific project characteristics are detailed. The section of the results presents and describes the results from the case study and discusses the implications of the research outcomes. Also, the outcomes associated with the use of the Pearson correlation coefficient and copulas are shown. Finally, conclusions are drawn, and future research avenues for the researchers are provided.",4
34,3,Mineral Economics,15 June 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-021-00274-3,State-of-the-art and perspectives in the heavy mineral industry of Sri Lanka,October 2021,H. C. S. Subasinghe,Amila Sandaruwan Ratnayake,K. A. G. Sameera,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Heavy minerals can be defined as (i) having density greater than common rock-forming minerals such as quartz with a density of 2.65 g/cm3 (Elsner 2010), (ii) clastic grains having specific gravities greater than 2.9 g/cm3 (USGS 2021), and (iii) minerals having densities greater than 3.0 g/cm3 (IAEA 2007). Nevertheless, there is still no standard scientific or industry definition for heavy minerals (Perks and Mudd 2019). These heavy minerals are interested in many high-end applications such as pigments, tiles, ceramics, paints, refractory materials, commercial aerospace, nuclear reactors, photovoltaic cells, nanotechnology, electronics, and many other cutting-edge applications (Dushyantha et al. 2020; Elsner 2010; Perks and Mudd 2019). Ilmenite (FeOTiO2), rutile (TiO2), leucoxene (altered ilmenite), zircon (ZrSiO4), monazite ((Ce,La,Nd,Th)PO4), garnet ((Ca,Mg,Fe,Mn)3(Al,Fe,Mn,V,Cr)2(SiO4)3), and sillimanite (Al2SiO5) can be recognised as common minerals in the heavy mineral industry (Perks and Mudd 2019, 2020, 2021). Heavy mineral deposits are located in around 45 countries, prominently along the coastlines neighbouring the Indian Ocean (e.g. Australia, Asia, and Africa). Minerals bearing titanium, zirconium, and rare earth elements (REEs) have diversified applications in modern industries, and thus, these minerals have dominated the global mineral market (Jowitt et al. 2020; Mudd 2020). Consequently, the demand for ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and REE-bearing mineral sands has gradually increased over the last few decades in the global heavy mineral market. Interestingly, these minerals are found in two types of deposits typically classified as primary and secondary. The primary deposits are formed via magmatic, hydrothermal, and metamorphic processes whilst the secondary deposits are formed by weathering, erosion, and transportation (Dushyantha et al. 2020; Skinner and Barton 1973; Zahid and Barbeau 2010; Zhong et al. 2016). However, only a few hard rock deposits such as Russia’s Kovdor baddeleyite-apatite-magnetite deposit (zirconium mine, as a by-product) and Canada’s Lac Tio, Norway’s Tellnes, and China’s Damiao deposits (titanium mines) are currently being operated (Perks and Mudd 2019, 2020, 2021). Moreover, large-scale secondary deposits such as those found in Sri Lanka are economically mineable than most of the primary deposits, apart from technical, political, and environmental considerations (Perks and Mudd 2020, 2021). Although Sri Lanka is globally famed for the occurrence of high-grade heavy mineral deposits (e.g. Pulmoddai), the minerals exploited are not properly beneficiated in terms of value addition. Moreover, heavy minerals are exported in their raw form with only a fundamental value addition (i.e., separation). For example, the tonnages of raw ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and hi-titanium ilmenite exported in the year 2019 are 17704, 3173, 1270, and 16645, respectively (Unpublished data, Lanka Mineral Sands Limited Sri Lanka). Moreover, there are no records of the production and export of value-added products from Sri Lankan heavy minerals. This implies that the downstream heavy mineral industry of Sri Lanka is extremely weak, and it is really disadvantageous for the economy of the country. Consequently, the downfalls of rules and regulations must be duly examined along with political roadblocks such as the lack of long-term rules and plans for uplifting the heavy mineral industry of Sri Lanka. For example, the last cabinet paper on “Mining and Export of Mineral Sands” was issued in 2012 by the government of Sri Lanka. The term value addition stated in this cabinet paper has not been properly implemented in the mineral industry. Therefore, formulating timely required perceptions would really benefit the downstream heavy mineral industry of Sri Lanka. In contrast, the decreasing primary resource quantity has been identified as a common issue in the mineral industry (Humphreys 2020). Consequently, the exploration of potential heavy minerals deposits (i.e., resource availability) also plays a key role in the sustainability of the heavy mineral industry. The current status of the heavy mineral industry and its perspectives are poorly examined in Sri Lanka. Therefore, this paper presents and assesses the heavy mineral industry of Sri Lanka related to ilmenite, rutile, and zircon using real-time data, obtained from Lanka Mineral Sands Limited (LMSL), during the last decade. The work figured out in this paper would be the first assessment comparing the Sri Lankan heavy mineral industry with the global industry using United States Geological Survey (USGS) data. In addition, this study aims to discuss the present status, existing drawbacks, challenges, and recommendations for uplifting the downstream heavy mineral industry of Sri Lanka, based on mineral market analysis. Consequently, this article shares perspectives/new concepts on economic, legal, and political implications to enhance the future downstream heavy mineral industry of Sri Lanka. Furthermore, this study focusses to identify resource availability for maintaining a sustainable upstream heavy mineral industry in Sri Lanka.",10

A study in Talcher Coalfield of India,October 2021,Gayatree Sahoo,Asis Kumar Senapati,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The rapid growth of the population has caused a tremendous increase in demand for various goods and services. To meet these growing demands, governments of different countries across the world are emphasizing establishing varieties of industries. Coal is the dominant fuel in most industries. But, the intensive and unsustainable extraction of this mineral impacted the global community like anything. Extractive industries benefitted the national economy as well as the local economy by providing revenue, foreign exchange, employment scopes, foreign direct investments (FDIs), high standard of living, infrastructural development, and high literacy rate among the people (Yelpaala and Ali 2005; Fatah, 2008; Ghose and Roy, 2007; Reeson et al. 2012; Al Rawashdeh et al. 2016; Yang & Ho 2019). But these benefits are not sufficient to offset the negative impacts created from such activities (Hendryx and Ahern 2009; Zarsky and Stanley 2013). Negative impacts of this industrial sector put huge costs on the local communities in terms of the high rate of unemployment, poverty, and environmental degradation (air, water, soil, sound, and loss of vegetation); human health risks, loss of biodiversity, landlessness, and so on (Hilson 2002; Yaaba Baah-Ennumh and Forson 2017; Lei et al. 2009; Nigam et al. 2017; Singh et al. 2018) exceeded the economic benefits. Additionally, this sector provides diversified livelihood but for a short period (Brain 2017). The world is not on a course to achieve a sustainable energy future, and the global energy supply will continue to be dominated by fossil fuels for several decades (IPCC, 2007). Different countries of the world are striving for attaining high economic growth and adapting cheap fuel like coal as a major input for a large number of industries, particularly in thermal power plants. Again, due to the expensive nature of the use of natural gases, it is predicted that by 2050, various industries would show more inclination to use coal in their industries (International Energy Outlook 2019). Huertas et al. (2012) studied that households of developing countries are heavily dependent on this fossil fuel for cooking, warming, and drying purposes. This sector is helping the development process of developing countries via providing goods and services and distribution and sales of the product, jobs, social, and community development (CSE, 2020). Again, the governments of these countries are adopting easy policies to attract private and foreign investors to this sector (Hota and Behera 2016). Additionally, it has been observed that the developing countries are the worst sufferer of various health issues associated with environmental pollution than the developed ones (Pearce 1996; Hota and Behera 2016). Commencement of mining projects has economic, environmental, and social implications at the local, state, and national levels (Al Rawashdeh et al. 2016). Such industrial activities not only damaged the livelihood of the residents but also damaged their socio-cultural values. Although developing countries are more exposed to various health hazards, environmental hazards, the number of studies from ground level on these issues is far behind than that of the studies done in developed countries (Pearce 1996). Globally, there are more studies conducted on occupational health in the mining sector than that of community health (Stephens and Ahern 2001). A dearth of empirical studies underestimated the interests of the citizens, particularly of the residents of active mining regions. Hence, the vulnerability level of such people to various hazards is being intensified. Mineral resources are free gift of nature. The interaction of the domestic economy with the global economy is made possible by the mineral extractive industries (Yang and Ho 2018). This sector is playing an important role in providing diversified employments and development of periphery non-mining industries in the host regions (Von der Goltz and Barnwal 2019). Some studies advocated that mining is a dominant source of income for the local communities (Hazkowicz et al., 2011). Unfortunately, economic benefits derived from the mining operation are much less than the costs generated from such operation (Li et al., 2011; Boadi et al. 2016). Due to such industrial operation, the local residents are severely affected in terms of income inequality, high poverty rate, gender discrepancy, unemployment, etc. than that of the residents staying far away from this (Kitula, 2006; Fatah 2008; Hendryx and Ahern 2009; Hota and Behera 2016). For the sake of short-term benefits, they bear the long-term costs in terms of degraded environment, poor health status, loss of traditional livelihood, displacement, and so on ( Hilson 2002; Lahiri-dutt 2003; Zulig and Hnedryx 2010; Segerstedt & Abrahamsso, 2019). Interestingly, these residents are the main stakeholders of such industrial operations, but their interests are not taken seriously by the mining companies and government (Morrice and Colagiuri 2013). Further, resource-abundant countries have witnessed a low growth rate, poor socio-economic status, and various health issues than that of the countries’ poor in resource endowments (Pattanayak et al. 2010). Saha et al. (2011) proved the existence of resource curse at the micro level. The extraction of minerals is considered one of the most dangerous occupations (Castleden et al., 2011). Some studies have well documented the negative externalities of extractive industries on health and the natural environment (Dubinski 2013; Hota and Behera 2015; Mwakumanya et al. 2016; Saikia et al. 2018). The negative externalities are directly and indirectly borne by the locals. The health condition of the local people is gradually deteriorating, and diseases like respiratory illnesses, skin infection, lung cancer, malaria, hypertension, low weight birth, and gastritis are occurring very often among them (Saha et al. 2011; Hendryx 2013; Hota and Behara, 2015; Melody 2015; Fitzapatrick 2018). Lahiri-Dutt (2007) found that the disadvantaged and marginalized groups staying in active mining regions are the worst sufferer. Further, the commencement of mining projects severely affects the different elements of the natural environment like air, water, soil, and biodiversity (Chaulya 2004; Saini et al. 2016; Lei et al. 2009; Nigam, 2017). From a study, it has been advocated that during power generation, thermal power stations emitted 75 % of carbon dioxide (CO2) and 63% of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the environment (Garg et al. 2002). CO2 gas contributes significantly to greenhouse gases (GHGs), climate change which imposes the greatest threat to public health, and the natural environment (Goswami, 2010). Due to climate change and global warming, natural events such as floods, droughts, extreme heatwaves, and hurricanes are occurring very often. This has made the poor more vulnerable as they are mostly involved in the primary sector. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), climate change is the greatest emerging threat to public health and the environment. So, it is very much essential to understand the problems faced by the communities due to mining projects and undertake measures to protect their wellbeing. The paper is organized in this manner: after the introduction and background of the study in the first section, the second section highlights coal mining and households’ vulnerability. The third section highlights the coal mining activities in India and Odisha. Theoretical framework of the study takes place in the fourth section. After that, the study area, data collection, variable construction, and methodology take place in the fifth section; empirical results and subsequent discussions take place in the sixth section. Finally, the paper concludes with some policy suggestions.",2

The global mining industry has experienced a boom since early 20s, which not only create employment opportunities at the national, state (provincial) and local levels but also played a leading role in earning tax revenues and foreign exchange (Mishra 2009). At the same time, the production of mineral resources has negative impact on both environmental and social spheres. Studies show that most of the negative effects of mining activities greatly affect the local communities living in the vicinity of mining sites (Hota and Behera 2016; Kitula 2006; Mishra 2009; Sincovich et al. 2018; Segerstedt and Abrahamsson 2019; Nathan 2019). Literatures (McCullough and Lund 2006; Gisore and Matina 2015; Dold 2008) have found that mining is not confined within a single country; rather, it has been practiced worldwide and formulated the best practice to mitigate associated issues. Coal is one of the most important resources, which is being practiced worldwide (Petkova et al. 2009; Morrice and Colagiuri 2013; Frantal 2016). India is enriched with abundant mineral resources of international value. Over the past few decades, the growing demand for energy with the population has led to huge foreign investment in the extractive industries which supports the unprecedented growth in mineral production (Hota and Behera 2016). Like other developing countries, India generates more than 70% of its electricity from coal (Hota and Behera 2016). Coal mining in India first started in the Raniganj coalfield area, and later it spread to different parts of the country. In 2012–2013, a total of 33 million tons of coal was extracted nationally. At present, there are 98 active mines under Coal India Limited (Annual Reports and Accounts of CIL 2016-2017). Both Opencast and Under Ground mines are found in the country but maximum share is concentrated with opencast mining (Annual Reports and Accounts of CIL 2016-2017). By nature, these opencast mines often cause for loss of livelihood. Siddiqui and Lahiri-Dutt 2015estimated that in India, about 42% mining and quarrying households are highly vulnerable due to unsecure job. In contrast, several studies have shown that there is a strong interrelationship between mineral extraction and local livelihood generation (Mishra 2009). Many researchers argued that mining and development or costs and benefits of mining are uneven and unfairly distributed among the mining communities (Emel and Huber 2008), whereas, the long-lasting negative externalities of mining, such as environmental degradation, social disarticulation, depletion of agricultural land, and natural resources, are evenly affected the surrounding land and the local communities. Opencast mines require a massive land for waste disposal which increases vegetation clearance and land excavation. By the process of excavation, local communities are displaced from their ancestral land, causing loss of home, assets, and traditional livelihood system (Patrova and Marinova 2013; Lahiri-Dutt 2005). The World Bank (1994) estimates that one million people are displaced from their homes and land each year due to numerous development projects in developing countries. Several development projects in India have displaced around 21.3 million people from their original places in the last 50 years, where mining plays a major role (Parliament Library and Reference, Research, Documentation and Information Service 2013). The recent trend of neoliberal development has intensified the displacement of people from traditional places. Development-induced displacement also increases the conflict between the people dependent on natural resources and the elites (Meher 2009). Cernea 2002in his essay, makes it very clear that in some respects, displacement has a negative impact on society. According to him, the major risks of displacement are landlessness, homelessness, joblessness, marginalization, food insecurity, morbidity and mortality, loss of common property rights, and social disarticulation (Cernea 2002). From the time immemorial, it has been seen that all sorts of arguments start when people have to move from one place to another. Jaysawal and Saha (2016) mentioned in their article how industries are extracting natural resources to maintain the trend of development where the whole livelihood is at high risk. Sometimes alternative livelihood strategies also fail to meet the needs of local dwellers due to loss of assets, including physical, social, and natural capital. After the closure of mines, people are often unable to return to their traditional livelihoods because mining activities have changed the environment that support their traditional livelihoods (Mukhopadhyay and Ghosh 2013). It is noteworthy that the mining operation can give some basic facilities such as roads, schools, health clinics, and community halls in the rehabilitation sites and generate employment (conditional) opportunities. These conditional employment opportunities create an unequal distribution of livelihood within the community. On the one hand, unequal distribution of jobs as compensation from the mining authorities; on the other hand, loss of traditional rural livelihoods often marginalizes the poor local communities (Hota and Behera 2016). The rural livelihoods include agricultural activities, animal husbandry, hunting and gathering, wage labor, artisan work, and weaving (Fig. 1).
 Complex structure of rural livelihood and its sustainability. Source: Mphande 2016 Researchers have shown that 90% of rural households are intensively engaged in farming where agriculture plays an influential role (Davis et al. 2010). In addition to the main stream of society, a section of them is involved in non-farming activities to get better income opportunities and accomplished for sustainable livelihood (Mphande 2016). Mining not only has a negative impact upon physical, natural, and social capital but also it creates demand and conflict as compensation for lost resources. Coal India Limited (CIL) provides financial assistance to landowners (more than 2 acres) by providing employment as compensation. However, landless or less than 2 acres of land owners in the society did not get the benefit of employment as compensation (R and R Policy 2012). Rather, poor people get some benefits in terms of money and contractual jobs in the mining and associated activities in the area (Mishra 2009; Banerjee and Mistri 2019). However, social sustainability acts as an important factor in removing the negative externalities of mining and its related activities (Segerstedt and Abrahamsson 2019). To maintain this social sustainability, researchers have suggested the Sustainable Livelihood Framework, which is used to understand the complexities of rural livelihoods. At this stage of discussion, it is important to mention that, five types of capital have a direct impact on the livelihood scenario in rural society (Mphande 2016). Firstly, human capital includes knowledge, skills, habits, and social behavior of the people. Secondly, the physical capital which refers to the equipments used by the people. Thirdly, social capital, where norms, values, and relationships are the major indicators. Another two capitals are financial capital and natural capital. Natural capital includes water, air, land, and bio-diversity (Barbier and Hochard 2014; Ellis 1996, 2000). Coal mining activities directly and indirectly affect the aforesaid capitals that further influence the rural livelihood. The present study site Sonepur-Bazari opencast coal mine is located in the Raniganj coalfield area. Eastern Coalfield Limited (ECL), a subsidiary of CIL, is the governing body of the respective mine. The mine is dealing with the biggest rehabilitation project of ECL where 4623 families have been enlisted as project-affected families (PAFs). Some of them have displaced and some will be displaced in the recent future. The increasing nature of production of the respective mine from 4.2 MT in 2010–2011 to 10.03 MT in 2018–2019 (Annual Reports and Accounts of CIL 2018-2019) has resulted in serious problems in the area, as it has acquired agricultural land from the vicinity. Thus, the present study focuses on the impact of mining on the livelihood of local communities, which is largely neglected by the researchers. The objective of the present study is to identifying the impacts of coal mining on financial, physical, human, natural, and social capitals. Along with this, locating how it has affected the livelihood practices of the already displaced and yet to be displaced communities.",3

Regulation of this sector is a complex task too. Existing legal and institutional framework capacities play a key role in the development of this sector towards a friendly trend towards the private sector and foreign investors (Otto et al. 2006). The efficiency and functionality of this sector require review and analysis of some other sectors as the mining sector is associated with many other areas such as spatial conflict issues (infrastructure, settlements, blocking criteria, etc.) in general. In this context, special attention should be paid to the analysis of property issues and their connection with the mining sector, respectively, with the rights and obligations of the parties in the mining sector and possible difficulties that may pose different limitations in terms of ownership for the mining sector. Property issues may be concerning and negatively impact the efficiency and functionality of the sector, in cases when property is essential for conducting mining activity, which is usually the case. Ownership over mining resources is of crucial importance and may be an obstacle to the proper usage of minerals and hence foreign direct investments (Morgan 2002; Southland 2012). Studies show that there is more sustainability in countries where changes in laws and policies in the mining sector are measured changes, while there is a trend of applying more sovereign control for access to mineral resources (Williams 2012). Further, issues with many consents required to be obtained by companies that are interested in exploiting mines and minerals are additional obstacles for the efficiency of this sector. In this regard, Kosovo legislation has few collisions that negatively impact the development of mining sector. Implementation is of significance in all fields, and on this paper the reader may see how the lack of harmonization of norms and implementation may impact the efficiency of such an important sector. The methodology used during this research is the qualitative research methodology for the purpose of answering the question whether the existing legal and institutional framework is being properly implemented and serving the efficiency of the mining sector. Mainly, the methodology focused on the use and review of literature and legislation and participant observation. Interview approach was unstructured since this approach enabled understanding of the problem from the perspective of interviewed participants. The researcher used individual interview method since the discussion with participants was deemed more informative. During the interviews in-depth discussion took place with participants. In the first part of this paper an introduction to the institutional framework of the mining sector is provided, followed by a similar introduction regarding the legal framework. Third part focuses on the key legal issues that are of practical importance to the mining legal framework, while the last part provides a conclusion.",

These challenges have created an imperative to innovate. Parallel to the above, current development of digital innovations such as the Internet of Things (IoT), automated drones, and 3D printing are being implemented in many mining operations across the globe. Not only do these provide solutions to the existing problems but also radically transform mining processes increasing efficiency, profitability, and the ability to comply with stricter regulations. The incorporation of mature and incipient technologies into the mining industry has created many opportunities for long-established firms and for knowledge-based start-ups. This includes potential suppliers in countries where mining accounts for a significant share of the GDP, but the development of productive linkages remains suboptimal, as in Latin American countries. While in recent years, some suppliers in Latin America have made important contributions to innovation in the mining industry, most suppliers have not been able to do so. Several barriers have been identified in previous studies: from lack of testing spaces for prototypes, to broader issues, such as conservative business attitudes, hierarchical governance of the value chain, and limited communication channels between mining companies and suppliers. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the innovation paradigm of the mining sector from a global perspective, i.e., how innovation processes take place in countries with a long-established technological leadership in the sector, such as Australia and Canada. Given the importance of suppliers in this process, a special attention is paid to innovation in various stages of the supply chain. This is done to provide a departure point for identifying windows of opportunity for Latin American suppliers. The structure of this paper is as follows: The next section provides a historical perspective of countries considered leaders in terms of innovation. The third section analyzes characteristics of innovation in the mining industry—in particular, how recent changes in the organization and supply chain structures are shaping innovation in this sector. The fourth section presents a general analysis of supply-induced innovations by looking at every stage of the supply chain. The fifth section briefly reviews the opportunities and barriers that have been faced by suppliers in Latin America when attempting to integrate into global mining value chains. The sixth section provides a summary of the findings and ideas for further research.",11

According to the World Gold Council (2021a), Ghana is the seventh largest producer of gold in the world and the largest producer in Africa. In addition to its global contribution, the industry is a major contributor to the economy of Ghana. In 2016, the industry contributed 6% to total annual national tax revenue from 10% in 2012 (Bank of Ghana 2016). In terms of gross domestic product, the industry contributed 6.5% in 2016 from 10% in 2012 (Ghana Statistical Services 2017). Furthermore, an amount of US$4919.5 million was realised from mineral exports with gold accounting for 95% of that amount which also represents 45% of merchandise export (Bank of Ghana 2016). From the statistics above, the industry’s contribution to the national economy has been declining over the period under analysis. This can be attributed to several challenges that the industry faced during the period. These challenges include among others the volatility of gold price which rose from about US$630/oz. in January 2007 to a peak of US$1856/oz. in September 2011 but declined to about US$1076/oz. at the end of 2015 (World Gold Council 2021b). The price decline in the second half of this paper’s analysis period threatened the existence of high-cost gold producers in the country with imminent shut down. The other challenge that gold mining companies face is the fact that they produce a fungible product in a competitive market. This means that they are unable to dictate the selling price of their product. Consequently, mining companies must focus on controlling their production costs if they are to stay in business and create value for their various stakeholders (Yapo and Camm 2017). The significant contribution of Ghana’s gold mining industry to the global and national economies and the declining performance of the industry motivated this study. The aim of this paper was to analyse the declining performance of Ghana’s gold mining companies using industry cost curves for the period from 2007 to 2016. The period 2007 to 2016 was selected because it effectively captures a full major gold price cycle which is typically 10 years (van der Bijl and Tholana 2020). The period also captures the period prior and post the 2008 global financial crisis therefore enabling a complete analysis of the industry’s performance pre- and post-the crisis. The paper also aimed to identify the key cost drivers in Ghana using the correlation coefficient analysis method. The paper further analysed the cost competitiveness of Ghana’s gold mining industry against Australia, South Africa, and the global average. The analysis only focussed on the large-scale gold producers in the country because of the availability of verifiable data. Moreover, large-scale producers contribute approximately 70% of gold output in Ghana which makes them a reliable proxy for the country’s gold mining industry. Table 1 lists the mines that were analysed in this paper.",3

Wilmot,Jason F. Shogren,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In the USA, ten states have taxed or diverted fees to create Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF), publicly owned investment funds, to accumulate wealth for when their non-renewable natural resources are exhausted (e.g., natural gas, oil, coal and other minerals). Alaska, New Mexico, and Wyoming are three prominent examples. These states are trying to diversify their resource-dependent economies by transforming a stock of natural gas, oil, and coal reserves into a stock of wealth that can be invested broadly for citizens today and those off into the far distant future (see e.g., Megginson and Fotak 2015; van den Bremer et al. 2016). These SWF funds are progressive and forward-looking: revenues obtained from the resources accumulate and a portion is re-invested to promote intergenerational equity. Curiously, however, the state of Minnesota, which many view as progressive, does not have an SWF, even though companies have been mining iron ore and taconite for over 100 years. Three reasons suggest that Minnesota could have created and might still want to consider creating an SWF. First, Minnesota has the natural resources.Footnote 1 The state has a long history of mining both high-grade natural iron ore and low-grade iron ore rock. The first iron ore shipments were in the late 1800s (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources 2018). Starting in the mid-1950s, a noticeable change in production occurred; a significant shift toward more production of low-grade iron ore pellets. Iron ore pellets, a.k.a. taconite pellets, are created when low grade iron ore rock is crushed and separated, clay and water are then added to the ore to make a slurry pellet, which is then baked and capable of being shipped. In 1955, about 98% of iron ore production was from high-grade ore. This percentage fell to around 50% in 1967 and to about 5% in 1980 (Minnesota Department of Revenue 1985). The industry has been an important source of employment, especially for iron-range communities. Direct employment counts generally increased to approximately 14,500 in 1951 before generally declining to approximately 4,500 in 2014 (United States Geological Survey 2018). In total, from 1931 to 2014, Minnesota produced 3.89 billion metric tons of useable ore with a cumulative unadjusted shipped-value of $83.5 billion USD (USGS). Second, the potential size of the intergeneration transfer of wealth can be substantial. For example, Norway’s Government Pension Fund was established in 1990 and made headlines by eclipsing $1 trillion USD in total assets in September 2017 (see, e.g., Papaioannou and Rentsendorj 2015; McCarthy 2017). The purpose of the fund is “The Government Pension Fund Global is saving for future generations in Norway. One day the oil will run out, but the return on the fund will continue to benefit the Norwegian population” (Norges Bank Investment Management 2020). The same site suggests a portion of the fund value can be used in the national budget and that an estimated $28 billion USD was transferred in 2017. According to the Norwegian Ministry of Finance document “Budget 2017”, the total expenditure of the fiscal budget was about $156 billion USD. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that about 18% of budget expenditures were covered by the fund (Norwegian Ministry of Finance 2017). Third, having a recurring and potentially growing source of contributions to revenues could be advantageous for the state. The assets in most SWFs are managed using portfolio techniques and often yield significant returns. For example, the self-reported annual total returns from the Alaska Permanent Fund, with current assets of $62 billion, have averaged 9.6% (Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation 2017). Minnesota’s recent annual state budget expenditures are around $20 billion (Minnesota Department of Management and Budget 2017). In theory, the existence of an SWF for Minnesota with $20 billion in assets, that could generate a 10% return, would contribute a non-trivial 10% of the state’s budgeted expenditures. Of course, many other return and distribution scenarios are possible. Yet, the basic scenario highlights the point that a permanent SWFs can generate large sums of wealth with protected principles and the significant returns can be redistributed to current and future generations. Of course, such investments incur opportunity costs and we do not seek to answer the normative question of whether such a fund should be created. Empirically, many states and countries have moved forward with such funds despite their inherent opportunity costs. Herein, we explore three research questions to further understand: (1) What if Minnesota had created a permanent Sovereign Wealth Fund early in its production history or if it, as did several other states, had started one in the mid-1970s? (2) Would it be worthwhile to consider starting a fund in Minnesota, given the current level of estimated mineral reserves? And (3) What are the current economic issues associated with creating such a fund for Minnesota? We estimate two types of scenarios addressing a Minnesota SWF: “what-if” (backward-looking) and “what about the future” (forward-looking) scenarios. A 1.5% of value tax is used to fund the SWF. Based on historical iron ore extraction and financial investment returns, it is estimated that a fund, focused solely on principal growth, could have generated a fund balance between $2.3 and $27.1 billion (nominal USD) depending on the fund starting year and investment choices. After accounting for an estimated 4% production loss, due to an increased tax rate, results suggest enough minerals could still be extracted to create a permanent fund with about $930 million (US) to $1.6 billion dollars (US) in direct contributions by 2050 (depending on price). Using reasonable assumptions of a 2% inflation rate and a 5% annual investment return, the fund size could range from $3 billion to $5 billion by 2050. Although controversial within the state, two proposed copper-nickel mines could also contribute to an extraction based SWF. The paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. We create a framework for analyzing the foregone opportunity of creating an SWF based on several investment types, including the returns of several existing US state funds. We provide an updated supply and demand model and supply elasticity for US iron ore production. In addition, we utilize the model results to estimate the production effect from an increase in a mining tax; the authors are unaware of any papers doing so for iron ore. Also, we are able to use the production effect to increase the reliability of our forward-looking estimates. Further, we expect the results would be of interest to policy makers in states and countries that either have a history of extraction or potential new projects. This paper starts with a literature review on SWFs. The following section provides background on state SWFs and Minnesota. Next, we analyze backward-looking scenarios to estimate the potential size of an SWF, if one had been created, based on historic extraction and investment returns. In the forward-looking section, we begin by econometrically estimating the supply and demand of US iron ore production to better understand how an increase in mining taxes would likely effect mining output (i.e., the production effect). Subsequently, reserves and future price ranges are examined to provide estimates of the 2050 value of a newly created SWF. We conclude by trying to determine if it is too late to start an SWF by considering the estimated magnitude of the SWF principal, the amount of the possible annual investment rents that could be generated, and how those rents might be utilized.",1

Malala,Tsuyoshi Adachi,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Demand for mineral commodities has experienced drastic changes, as revealed by the sudden rise in metal prices beginning in the twenty-first century. Rapid technological advances over the past 20 years have led to demands for diverse mineral resources, and as populations increase and living standards improve, society uses items with more functionalities, which require even more mineral commodities to manufacture. The demand pressure will not end since the transition to a low-carbon society will take place over the decades to come, requiring investment in entirely new technologies and, therefore, accelerating mineral resource demand. The supply landscape has also been altered. The diversity of metal suppliers has shrunk compared to the beginning of the century. For example, the share of the total value of the top 5 mining companies in the world increased from 18% in 2000 to 35% in 2008; as of 2019, it was 21% (Humphreys 2015; S&P Global 2019). Moreover, for some minerals such as lithium, platinum, and niobium, close to the entire world's production occurs in two or three mining countries. Although mineral exploration technologies, together with recovery techniques, have improved, facilitating mining resources at a lower cost, some essential minerals are produced mainly as by-products and have highly concentrated production. The resurgence of protectionist thinking in the form of resource nationalism and considerable efforts by governments to limit the environmental impact of mining have also added stress to the changing mineral supply landscape. The mineral commodity landscape changes have led to renewed concerns about available mineral resources and the limits to access in countries that heavily depend on mineral resources for their economies, such as Japan. Japan has created competitive mineral resource-dependent industries such as the automobile, electronic equipment, and machine tools manufacturing industries, despite having no meaningful domestic supply of mineral resources. Notwithstanding the crucial role played by mineral resources, few studies have examined critical metals in Japan. In other established economies, concerns about mineral resource availability have prompted scholars to propose methods to measure and show important mineral resources with a high risk of supply disruption. However, there is little agreement on how to measure such metals, and questions have arisen regarding the proposed methods. A prominent trend in metal criticality studies is to show the relative risk of supply disruption for metals that are important to the economy and elucidate the results of disruption. Consequently, the studies borrow the idea of the risk matrix used in risk studies. In a traditional risk analysis, risk is tied to the concept of probability. However, current material criticality studies either overlook probability or make strong assumptions about probability functions by considering only the standard deviation of changes in the price of metals (volatility). However, probability distributions of price changes are not always normal distributions, as assumed when using standard deviations. There has been no attempt to use unique probability functions in criticality research to the best of our knowledge. This study attempts to incorporate a unique probability function of price changes for each metal to measure Japan’s critical metals. It, therefore, attempts to address one requirement of traditional risk assessment: the use of probability in risk assessment. A more concise examination of essential metals in Japan is required to protect its resource-dependent manufacturing industries. Consequently, this study proposes a quasi-dynamic approach to identifying critical metals for the medium term (5–10 years) for Japan by analyzing 18 metals—aluminum, chromium, cobalt, copper, gold, iron, lead, lithium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, niobium, platinum, rare earths, silver, tungsten, vanadium, and zinc—chosen based on the amount of metal consumed in Japan and on data availability. The term critical material is understood to have been coined in 1939 by the “Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act” of the USA. Several researchers dealing with the criticality of mineral resources have adopted various meanings for the term since then. For example, Buijs et al. (2012) define a material as critical if it has “a comparatively high economic importance with a comparatively high risk of supply disruptions.” Poulton et al. (2013) propose that material is critical if it is “essential to economic development but having limited supplies and being subject to supply-demand imbalances.” At the same time, Gleich et al. (2013) state that criticality “denotes the extent of current and future risks associated with a certain metal.” Although there is no standard definition of critical raw material, material criticality is associated with estimating whether a material has high economic importance and faces a significant risk of supply disruption. The underlying concern within criticality studies is to identify metals that pose economic or supply security risks should they experience extreme price increases. Economic risk can arise for several reasons, but the events contributing to high risk for businesses and economies involve price changes and cutting off the supply of mineral resources. Therefore, ensuring an adequate supply at a reasonable cost is the primary concern across different industries and countries. Mineral resources are critical to Japan’s economy. Japan has created competitive industries with strong connections to mineral resources, such as high-tech equipment and consumer electronics manufacturing. Japan is among the leaders in lithium-ion battery manufacturing and next-generation cars, fuel cells, and solar panel technology. The manufacturing industry is the single biggest contributor to Japan’s economy, with subsectors consuming a significant amount of metals contributing considerably to the economy. In addition, Japan accounts for a considerable share of global metal consumption, and the productivity of some metals (quantity of metal used to produce a unit of gross domestic product (GDP)) is rising. Consequently, Japan relies heavily on mineral resources to sustain its economy and requires a stable and predictable mineral resource supply. Figures 1 and 2 show that the productivity of metals such as cobalt has increased since 2000 and consumption of some metals, such as rare earths, has remained above 10% since 2009. We define a metal’s productivity as the quantity of metal used to produce a unit of gross domestic product and is measured by dividing the quantity of a particular metal consumed in a year by the respective gross domestic product.

Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation Despite the central role of metals in Japan’s economy, few published studies have investigated critical metals in Japan. While the study of critical metals in Japan began in the 1980s, when the country started a program to stockpile metals thought to be vulnerable to supply disruptions (Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation n.d.), a few scholars (see, for example, Glöser-Chahoud et al. 2016; Hatayama and Tahara 2015a, 2015b) joined efforts by government institutions such as the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization and the Japan Metal Economics Research Institute to conduct risk assessments of metals for the Japanese economy. Although these studies initiated by the government could be sufficient in themselves, they provide a general overview of matters, emphasizing the results and less on issues such as methodology. Additional studies by independent researchers could compliment the government’s efforts and possibly increase the trust in the government studies by providing independent views. Furthermore, the majority of these studies identified critical materials for a single year; therefore, the studies are static and could be considered of a very short-term view. Our study suggests a quasi-dynamic method to screen critical metals for Japan and propose critical metals for the medium term by analyzing the trends in material criticality from 2000 to 2015.",2
35,1,Mineral Economics,18 August 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-021-00276-1,The evolution of non-OECD countries in the twenty-first century: developments in steel trade and the role of technology,March 2022,Naoki Sekiguchi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The world economy has undergone several transformations in the twenty-first century, including the growing role of emerging/developing countries, exemplified by non-OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries.Footnote 1 In particular, the growing importance of BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) has driven this benign development (Dahlman and Wermelinger 2015). Thus, the rise of non-OECD countries is receiving increasing attention in the economic literature and the industry. The steel industry is a suitable example to discuss non-OECD countries’ catch-up at the industry level because it has been closely associated with national economic prowess since the Industrial Revolution (Shin 1996) and thus has been a strategic industry, crucial for latecomer countries’ economic development (Mattera and Silva 2018). What has happened in the global steel industry in the twenty-first century is notable from an industrial development viewpoint since latecomer countries have radically changed the structure of the industry. Although OECD countries had played a major role in the international steel market in the twentieth century, this supremacy has been challenged by the production and export volumes of non-OECD countries in the twenty-first century.Footnote 2 Over the last 20 years, the evolution of steel firms in non-OECD countries has fundamentally transformed the landscape of the global steel market.Footnote 3 Significant investments in steelmaking capacity have occurred in steel firms of non-OECD countries due to a sharp increase in steel-intensive economic activities (e.g. construction and infrastructure-building). Owing to rapid capacity expansions, non-OECD countries surpassed the OECD’s crude steel output in 2004, and the share of non-OECD countries in global crude steel output increased significantly from 44.7% in 2001 to 72.2% in 2018.Footnote 4 Thus, the growing role of non-OECD countries is seen as one of the most significant changes in the global steel industry today (OECD 2015a). The economic literature highlights the goods trade in countries since exports have implications for economic and industrial development (Lall 2000a, 2000b; Rodrik 2006; Hausmann et al. 2007; Schott 2008). Indeed, the empirical evidence in a number of studies indicates that the level of industrial development of latecomer countries can be observed with a focus on the export structure (e.g. Kumagai 2014; Kumagai and Kuroiwa 2020). Therefore, the discussion surrounding industrial development needs to take an international trade approach. In the global steel market, the concept of catch-up in emerging/developing countries is a highly relevant issue (Sekiguchi 2017, 2019), which is inextricably linked to the discussion about international trade. International steel trade has important implications for catch-up in latecomer countries; steel exports typically reflect technology, productivity, types of production items, and quality of steel products in a country (Sekiguchi 2017). Another dimension of catch-up relates to technology selection, which has been a crucial agenda for the industrialisation strategy of latecomer countries (Sato 2016). On the linkages between technology selection and steel exports in the 2010s, previous studies (Sekiguchi 2017, 2019) suggested that non-OECD countries that selected the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route are more likely to become net exporters of steel, gain comparative advantage, and diversify and upgrade steel exports. However, they did not focus on when the technology was selected. This issue raises the following important questions: have non-OECD countries acquired comparative advantage while strengthening international competitiveness in the global steel market in the twenty-first century? Have non-OECD countries that developed in the twenty-first century selected the BF-BOF technology to increase production/exports and upgrade steel products? To address these research questions, this study sheds light on the evolution of the steel trade in non-OECD countries in the twenty-first century. Focus on the linkages between technology selection and export performance could better help assess how non-OECD countries have evolved since the beginning of this century. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. The “Literature review” section provides a brief literature review. The “Stylised facts” section introduces stylised facts in the steel industry. The “Methodology” section explains the methodology used in this study. The “Macro-level analysis” section provides a macro-level analysis that focuses on the evolution of international competitiveness and comparative advantage between OECD and non-OECD countries since the early 2000s. The “Micro-level analysis” section presents a micro-level analysis that indicates the linkages between technology selection and export performance of major non-OECD steel-producing countries since the beginning of the century. The “Summary of findings and implications” section provides a summary of the findings and some implications of the study. Finally, the “Conclusion” section provides the conclusion and limitations of this study.",1

An explorative study of an anecdotal relation,March 2022,Tobias Olofsson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper sets out to explore a seemingly simple proposition: that rising commodity prices incentivize explorationists to apply for exploration permits. This link between prices and the volume of exploration permit applications filed in a year was proposed by several informants interviewed for a recent qualitative research project on mineral exploration, forecasting, and uncertainty in Sweden (Olofsson 2020a, 2020b). One example of this claim was provided by a senior officer with the Mining Inspectorate of Sweden (MIS) — the agency which reviews applications for exploration permits. In the interview, the officer said that the inspectorate tends to see a significant increase in the number of permit applications filed with them at times of increasing commodity prices. Another example of this proposition was provided by a mining engineer who explained that exploration companies find it easier to invest in exploration efforts following a rise in commodity prices as climbing prices often mean that there is greater interest from investors, which in turn means that there are usually greater volumes of equity available to explorationists when commodity prices go up. According to the mining engineer, such ebbs and flows in the accessibility of equity are more or less the nature of the game and while, he continued, it would often be preferable to invest counter-cyclically and build a pipeline of projects during bear markets, which could then be moved into production when prices eventually begin to climb again, most exploration and mining companies lack the resources to do so. Therefore, most companies, according to this informant’s experience, will usually have to wait for prices to attract investment capital to projects before they can begin spending money on exploration. On the surface, these claims make sense. Mineral exploration is both time-consuming and heavy on financial resources. Companies that have a number of projects in the desktop or archival stage, it could be suggested, may look at rising commodity prices and a resulting increase in interest from investors as a window to move into boots-on-the-ground-type work; and to be allowed to put boots on the ground, firms will first need to acquire an exploration permit. Then again, mineral exploration is a high-risk endeavor embedded in a complex institutional framework, there may be many different competing and even counteracting factors involved in the decision-making process behind the choice to file or not to file for an exploration permit. Nevertheless, an initial plot of the number of exploration permits filed with the MIS annually between 2000 and 2019 and the annual average commodity prices for some of the metals and minerals mined in Sweden is inconclusive. Graph 1 shows this plot with the number of applications plotted against the primary y-axis on the left-hand side and commodity prices (in natural logarithms of observed prices) plotted against the secondary y-axis on the right-hand side.
 Annual applications for exploration permits and annual average commodity prices As the plot shows, there appears to be some covariation between the two. The dramatic climb in application filings between 2003 and 2005, for example, coincided with an increase in commodity prices. Then again, the almost equally dramatic fall in exploration permit filing after 2005 appears only to coincide with a fall or plateau in base metal prices while ferrous and precious metals continued to go up in the period.Footnote 1 While the evidence on the surface therefore appears to be inconclusive, there are reasons to expect that prices could drive exploration activities. First, such a relation between commodity prices and exploration levels has been observed elsewhere, i.e., in Canada, where it was found that an increase in the price of a basket of minerals in the previous year could be linked to an increase in the level of exploration in the next year (Canadian Intergovernmental Working Group on the Mineral Industry 2005). Secondly, the anecdotal evidence for a relation between prices and exploration levels was corroborated by several informants independently of each other. Nevertheless, as the evidence for a link between prices and exploration levels appears to be compelling but inconclusive, it was decided that it would be interesting to explore this anecdotally given connection, and to see whether it could be reproduced quantitatively. The explorative analysis employed an autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) model to analyze the relation between the number of exploration permits filled with the MIS each year in the period 2000-2019 and the annual average prices for seven non-fuel metal commodities explored for and mined in Sweden.Footnote 2 The model tested the following hypothesis: H1: The annual number of new applications for exploration permits filed with the Mining Inspectorate of Sweden is positively correlated with movements in mineral commodity prices. The continuation of this paper explores the hypothesis through the four following sections. The “Background” section places the present explorative study in a broader universe of existing literature on the role of exogenous factors in exploration and mining companies’ decision-making. The “Data and model” section outlines the case, describes the dataset used in this analysis and specifies how the ARIMA model was constructed. The “Results” section accounts for the empirical results from the analysis. Above all, the “Discussion” section reports the results for each of the seven bivariate models analyzed and follows up on the results. These results indicated no significant connection between the commodity prices and exploration permit applications except for zinc. The paper concludes with a discussion on the estimated model, the results, and their implications. The discussion ends with a reflection stating that the failure to conclusively confirm or disprove the anecdotal connection between prices and application filings above all opens up for future studies of the relation between exploration and mining company decision-making and the exogenous factors influencing these processes.",1

The mining industry has a long history of using technology to overcome and solve problems such as work environmental and productivity issues. Indeed, the development and use of new mining technology have increased productivity, and these developments have also coincided with a general improvement of the work environments of the mining industry (Lööw and Nygren 2019; Lööw 2020). The development of new technology in the mining industry continues to address challenges such as these. The advent of digitalisation, for example, promises to help mines to remain competitive while at the same time offering operators comfortable jobs in control rooms (Lööw et al. 2019). However, it would be erroneous to believe that only positive effects follow from new technology, or that these positive effects occur automatically. In fact, a closer examination of the relationship between new technology in the mining industry and its effect on the work environment reveals a complex relationship, one in which unequivocal positive effects rarely surface. In part, the apparent complexity of the relationship between new technology and work environment effects stems from difficulties in determining the exact effect of new technology in the first place. This difficulty, in turn, partly lies in the fact that only rarely has mining technology developed revolutionarily — that is, brought about significant changes overnight, providing a clear “before-and-after,” the base upon of which studies could investigate the outcome of technology implementations. Change has instead been evolutionary and incremental, as has been the case with productivity (Bartos 2007; Hartman and Mutmansky 2002); thus, effects have emerged over time. For work environment improvements, the development and implementation of new technology in the mining industry have a more ambivalent relationship still. While one can discern a positive development in terms of, for example, the occurrence of the number of lost-time injuries in the mining industry, the true status of the work enviroment can seldom be deduced from singular indicators, because work environment improvements are not unequivocal (Blank et al. 1998). For example, previous studies have shown that technology that has offered better protection from rock fall also meant an increase in lone working and the stress associated with such a situation (Eriksson 1991); that new technology may reduce fatal accidents but increase the number of accidents in general (Blank et al. 1996); and that not all benefit equally from new technology (Laflamme and Blank 1996). Furthermore, studies of mining industry technology have found that only a third of technology projects take active consideration of the operator in their design (Horberry and Lynas 2012). With this lack of focus, we can expect only limited positive effects on the work environment. If one were to go by only a few indicators to determine the relationship between new technology and its effects on the mining industry’s work environments, this too presents a problematic picture. For instance, in many countries, the improvement rate of the accident frequency rate has tapered off so that the rate is stable but elevated (compared to other industrial sectors) (Lööw and Nygren 2019; Lööw 2020). Furthermore, while it is clearer that the industry’s safety record has improved, it is harder to determine if health effects have been as positive. Indeed, studies suggest that health problems have increased in the mining industry. The European Commission found that in 2007, the mining industry was the economic sector with most work-related health problems in the European Union (European Commission 2010). And that study also showed that the number of work-related health problems in mining had increased — rising more in mining than in other sectors. Yet, safety statistics had simultaneously improved, and improved more in mining than other sectors. Regardless of either development, the mining industry often still is the industry most susceptible to fatal accidents (Lilley et al. 2013), and Elgstrand and Vingård (2013) reported that “Where reliable national statistics exist, mining is generally the sector having the highest, or among 2–3 highest, rates of occupational fatal accidents and … occupational diseases.” As such, while the development and implementation of new mining technology are motivated by their ability to improve the work environments of the mining industry, often technology falls short of these goals. This is especially problematic today as new mining technology makes even wider claims regarding its positive effects: technology will help secure social licences to operate (Price 2019), ensure access to a new and younger workforce (Albanese and McGagh 2011; PwC 2012), and so on. These goals are laudable. But, worryingly, as we have no indication that previous issues with the development, implementation and use of new technology in mining have been addressed, there is a significant risk that these new project will fall short of accomplishing their intended goals. It is on this foundation that this paper offers an analysis of the relationship between mining technology and the mining industry’s work environments, and attempts to explain why mining technology does not continue to improve the work environments of the mining industry, why it fails to reach its intended effects.",3

35,2,Mineral Economics,22 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-021-00253-8,"Determination of optimal production rate under price uncertainty—Sari Gunay gold mine, Iran",June 2022,Parviz Sohrabi,Hesam Dehghani,Behshad Jodeiri Shokri,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Production planning in surface mines is one of the most complex operational issues in the design phase (Gershon 1983; Hartman 1992). Making important decisions such as expanding, closing, or outsourcing the mining activities largely depends on the production planning conditions (Quigley and Dimitrakopoulos 2020). Due to the long life, most mining projects face the risk of the parameters such as mineral price, grade, and cost (Akbari et al. 2009). Uncertainty can lead to unfavorable results of the decisions made by managers and mining investors (Dehghani and Ataee-pour 2012). Previous studies and experiences show that the higher the production rate, the lower the project’s price, and consequently, the higher the profit rate (Linder and Wilbourn 1973; Asghar and Kim 2020). In such conditions, the capital costs will increase, and the mine life will decrease. The production rate is generally affected by various uncertainties (Hustrulid et al. 1995). Unfavorable results may be achieved if the production rate is evaluated without considering the uncertainties. One of the most important sources of uncertainty for the evaluation of mining projects is economic uncertainty. The uncertainties over mineral price and operating costs are the most significant economic uncertainty examples (Cox et al. 1979; Dehghani and Ataee-pour 2012, 2013). Various researchers have done many works to determine the production rate and role of uncertainties, mostly based on the innovative Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo, and binomial tree methods. Lee (2018) estimated the commodity price using Black-Scholes model and binomial tree method and then used the results to evaluate the project using the real option valuation technique. In a study at the Segilola gold mine, Ugwuegbu (2013) used the Monte Carlo simulation method to estimate economic parameters, including metal prices. The results indicate that the project’s value is higher considering the uncertainty than the value obtained from classical project evaluation methods. Copeland and Antikarov (2001) and Costa Lima et al. (2005) stated that the calculated value of net present value (NPV) using the Monte Carlo simulation might be a good technique for evaluating the mining projects under the conditions of future price fluctuations (Lima and Suslick 2006). The only drawback of this method is that it can only estimate a single parameter such as price or cost, except using different scenarios to consider other parameters’ impact in the project evaluation. Ramazan (1996) and Ramazan and Dimitrakopoulos (2013) introduced a stochastic programming optimization model where the initial start model was fully developed. This model provided promising results. The economic parameters such as price, cost, tax, and inflation were considered in Costa Lima’s research. The dependency of the parameters was recognized by applying the GBM model and correlation coefficients. The research eventually proved that the other uncertainty sources’ volatility is like the price (Costa Lima et al. 2005). Osanloo et al. (2008) and Gholamnejad et al. (2006) studied long-term production planning (LTPP). They stated that traditional and uncertainty-based methods were used to solve the LTPP problem by many. These techniques to solve LTPP problems utilize one of the following strategies. First, the ultimate pit limit is determined, and then, production planning is obtained utilizing mathematical programming to maximize the NPV. Second, ultimate pit limits and production planning are determined simultaneously. Kumral (2010) used a robust stochastic optimization (RSO) approach to deal with mine production scheduling so that the solution is insensitive to changes in input data. The approach seeks a trade-off between optimality and feasibility. He concluded that the RSO method could be efficiently used in mine production scheduling problems. Ramazan and Dimitrakopoulos (2010) evaluated the mining production planning using the stochastic integer programming (SIP) method. Using the real options valuation (ROV), Haque (2016) was able to provide a highly reliable price prediction by solving partial differential equations (PDE) with MATLAB software. Dehghani and Ataee-pour (2012) provided a suitable approach by binomial tree method for evaluating a mineral project with determining the uncertainties of mineral price and cost. Soleimani and Jodeiri Shokri (2015) applied statistical methods for predicting chromite ore production rates in Iran. Chatterjee et al. (2016) used the network flow algorithm (splines algorithm with sequential Gaussian simulation) in a study to increase the NPV up to 48%. Using the Monte Carlo simulation and based on the Russian Polymetal Gold Mine research, Marchenko et al. (2017) achieved favorable results for evaluating mining projects. Mokhtarian and Sattarvand (2016) proposed a new approach for applying the product price uncertainty in the long-term production planning of open-pit mines. In this approach, the problem-solving process is based on a set of economic block models that are realized based on the prices sampled from the product price distribution function with the median Latin hypercube sampling and are solved by the integer programming method. The results show that the new method can reduce the risk, and the current net value of the new method is higher than that of the conventional methods with an 80% confidence level. Neingo et al. (2018) compared three methods for estimating the production rate in the platinum mines of South Africa and concluded that there is a weak correlation between the production rate of the methods based on the experimental laws and the actual value. However, the experimental methods are a good measure for achieving the optimal production rate. Liu et al. (2017) predicted the copper price using the decision tree algorithm. Chatterjee and Dimitrakopoulos (2019) proposed an algorithm to schedule an open-pit mine under geological uncertainty. Instead of solving the whole problem at once, the production schedule is generated by sequentially solving sub-problems. The subgradient method is used to generate the upper bound solution of a relaxed Lagrangian sub-problem. If the upper bound relaxed solution is infeasible, mixed-integer programming is applied to the latter solution. The results show that the proposed algorithm generates a very immediate solution, with less than a 3% optimality gap. Souza et al. (2019) presented new relationships for calculating the mining production rate using the price uncertainty, which showed better results than Taylor’s law. This relationship shows a direct relationship between the production rate and the metal price. The upper and lower limits of the price are also specified. Rimele et al. (2020) presented a new stochastic model for mine production planning under the price and geological uncertainties. Their proposed method first uses a two-stage model to manage the geological uncertainty that leads to a scenario-independent extraction sequence. A stochastic dynamic programming algorithm is then developed and employed to define the best policy in terms of metal production targets to follow, depending on the related commodity price evolution. This policy follows the scenario tree of the commodity price. It is scenario-dependent (price only) with non-anticipative constraints, similar to an operator that adapts to a fluctuating market. Maleki et al. (2020) combined two main sources of uncertainty to obtain multiple simulated block models in an iron ore deposit. The main sources of uncertainties included the rock type and seven quantitative variables (grades of Fe, SiO2, S, P, and K; magnetic ratio; and specific gravity). To assess the effect of integrating these two sources of uncertainty in mine planning decisions, stochastic and deterministic production scheduling models are applied based on the simulated block models. The results show the stochastic mine planning model’s capacity to identify and minimize risks, obtain valuable information in ore content or quality at the early stages of the project, and improve decision-making concerning the deterministic production scheduling. They concluded that the stochastic mine planning model improves 6% expected cumulative discounted cash flow and generates 16% more iron ore than the deterministic model. By reviewing the literature study, it can be concluded that price estimation methods are divided into three main groups, i.e., differential equations, simulation, and network. Methods based on differential equations such as Black and Scholes, approximate methods, and numerical methods have advantages such as risk reduction and accurate estimation. On the other hand, they have some disadvantages, such as high repetition and high cost and time. The complexity of this method is the main disadvantage. The binomial methods are belong to the network methods. The inability to estimate the uncertainty of more than two parameters simultaneously and the high dependence on historical data is the most critical problem of these versions (Topal 2008). According to the advantages and disadvantages of the various methods, it is concluded that the network and simulation methods are the primary technique in this study. In this research, the production rate is determined based on 22 different scenarios: the classical method, the Monte Carlo simulation, and binomial tree methods. The optimal production rate is determined by maximizing the net present value (NPV) among different scenarios.",8

Such risks are effectively a tax on businesses and the operations of organisations. They have the effect of redirecting and reallocating resources and cause cost distortions, shifts in supply, disruption to business and operating models and changes in expectations from investors. Good governance requires effective oversight of risks which is the role of board directors and governance and risk committees of those boards (Nicholson and Kiel 2004). Importantly, risks, whether emerging or long standing, provide an opportunity for organisations to differentiate themselves from their competitors if action is taken expeditiously to get in front of the changes that arise. How businesses in the extractives sector approach risk governance and management is important as it impacts upon supplier relationships through to how they are perceived in the market (Bravo-Ortega and Muñoz 2018; Gruenhagen and Parker 2020; Guerin 2020), through to relationships with customers and society more broadly.

35,2,Mineral Economics,30 August 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-021-00280-5,Mining and indigenous rights in Sweden: what is at stake and the role for legislation,June 2022,Håkan Tarras-Wahlberg,John Southalan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Conflicts between the extractive sector and indigenous peoples have long been a subject of study and interest, and initially most researchers focused on the Americas, South East Asia and Australia (Downing et al. 2002; Warden-Fernandez 2001). But in more recent times, the geographical focus has widened to also include the Nordic countries and Sweden which is the subject of this paper (Carstens 2016; Lassila 2018; Lawrence and Moritz 2019; Persson et al. 2017; Raitio et al. 2020; Wilson 2019). The international recognition of indigenous peoples’ rights has increased in recent decades. The most important guiding documents on the state’s responsibilities in this regard include the Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (ILO 169 1989) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP 2007). Other UN instruments of relevance include the Covenants on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR 1976) and the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD, 1969), as well as the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities (1992). Further, the scope of indigenous rights as defined in these UN treaties is addressed in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN 2011), which extends the responsibility for safeguarding indigenous rights to companies and businesses. Sweden often promotes human and indigenous rights internationally. Sweden voted in favour of UNDRIP at the UN General Assembly in 2007 and is a signatory to both ICCPR and ICERD. Sweden is, however, not a signatory to ILO169, and the country has also received significant international criticism regarding indigenous and minority rights-related issues (see “International assessments of Sweden” section below). Sweden’s apparent reticence in implementing key parts of the international rights framework “at home” for its indigenous Sámi represents a conundrum for some researchers (e.g. Lawrence and Moritz 2019; Mörkenstam 2019). In this regard, conflicts between mining and Sámi rights have attracted particular interest. Mining has been characterised as a method for colonisation (Lawrence and Åhrén 2017), whilst others have reported a lack of adequate consultation with Sámi in the permitting process (Lawrence and Moritz 2019). Conflicts that relate to specific mining projects and appeals by Sámi rights holders have been delaying permitting processes for mining projects (Beland Lindahl et al. 2016; Persson et al. 2017), and the Sami parliament of Sweden has also called for a moratorium for new mineral exploitation until such a time that ILO169 is ratified (Sametinget 2014). This, in turn, has contributed to calls for changes to be made to the mining legislative framework by researchers (e.g. Kløcker Larsen et al. 2018; Raitio et al. 2020) and more generally contributed to the government assessing the consequences of implementing stronger rights for the Sámi (SWE Gov 2015; SWE Gov 2019). Much of the focus of researchers and Sami representatives in this regard is placed on arguing that Sweden should ratify ILO169 and change its Mineral Law (SFS 1991; Kløcker Larsen et al. 2017; Sametinget 2014), rather than proposing wider legal reforms of the legal system. Furthermore, there has been comparatively less consideration for what the political stakes and full consequences of such proposed changes might be. This paper aims to: Investigate the extent to which indigenous rights — particularly as defined by UNDRIP and ILO169 — is provided for in the current Swedish minerals permitting process and the associated implications Consider the stakes if Sweden was to fully implement the international indigenous rights framework — and thereby better understand the reticence by government in doing so, with a special focus on mining Based on our findings in this regard, we also consider how Sweden could approach implementing an indigenous-rights framework in relation to mining specifically, but also in more general terms. However, as the focus is on the Mining Law and indigenous rights, other legal instruments of relevance are treated more cursorily. Our analysis focusses on the mining permitting process because, in Sweden, this includes the important aspects of consultation, establishes the mechanisms for compensation, and also the allocation of land for mining. We thus compare the procedural rights of the indigenous Sámi to that of other relevant stakeholders in the permitting process for mineral projects. Second, we assess whether the protection of Sámi interests in these processes is in line with the existing international indigenous rights framework more broadly. We further examine what the political stakes and consequences of any reform which align Sweden with the indigenous rights framework, specifically for the Sámi and the mining sector but also more generally, in an effort to better understand the apparent reservations of the Swedish state to fully implement said framework. This is performed by exploring some key data sourced from publicly available sources that relate to land use, and to the relative economic importance of different sectors of the national economy, and by studying relevant research that relates to impacts on reindeer herding activities by other anthropogenic activities.",3

The economic feasibility of these investments is largely dependent on the metal prices (see discussion, e.g. Humphreys 2010). In this paper, we propose a simulation-based decision-making system which considers the long-term price uncertainty while selecting the initial mine plan. This method addresses the gap identified by, e.g. Martinez 2010 that most of the current valuation methods and mine planning optimisation techniques are not integrated in the investment decision-making process. We focus the quantitative investment analysis where, according to the surveys of the mining industry, valuation methods revolve around discounted cash flow (DCF) metrics such as net present value (NPV), internal rate of return and payback period (see Bhappu and Guzman 1995; Moyen et al. 1996). Even though a vast scientific literature on more advanced valuation methodology, reviewed, e.g. by Savolainen (2016), has been published since the publication of the above-mentioned papers, it seems that the DCF-based screening analysis remains the de facto threshold that any project should pass before any further detail analysis (Humphreys 1996a; Smith 2002). The key issue with the resulting numbers of the DCF- analysis is that they are static in a sense that they take one price vector as an input of calculation that should represent the expected average of all the possible price scenarios and this averaged price vector is never realized in the volatile metal markets. Supplementing the analysis with alternative price scenarios or random simulation provides additional managerial insights but are practically inhibited by the inability to alter the mine plan as well to match the selected scenario. Automating this matching process between the optimal mine plan for the managerially estimated market price development is in the core of this paper. Strategic and long-term production planning have significant impacts on valuation and profitability of mining operations. The pit optimisation process is constrained with geometrical criteria such as slope/s, access, and smallest mining unit (SMU), plus economical parameters such as metal price, capital and operational costs, foreign exchange rate and discount rate. Another important concept related to mine planning is the cut-off grade (COG), which in mine planning means the minimum metal content of the block that is considered as ore. The blocks with a grade below this threshold are considered as waste. Today, the process of mine planning is done using dedicated software tools, which gives a set of alternative block sequences, with the different COGs using the above-mentioned metal price assumption from which the rational investor can choose the one that maximizes the overall cash flow (CF). In other words, if the price assumption would change, then also the optimal sequence within the given set of block sequences could change. In an operational level, mining companies do implement short to medium term optimisation by changing the implemented block sequence as the price fluctuates. However, the major decisions are often made in the start of the mining operations as the order of block extraction is irreversible. In other words, the mine planning selection problem is path-dependent which means that past decisions have an effect on today’s possibilities and the range of possible future actions. According to Espí and De La Torre (2013), there are two major ways to estimate future price development in projects: using either long-term price average price or aggregated expert estimate available from consultant reports or in-house experts. As discussed by Smith 2002, in a single scenario approach, there is an evident incentive for the project proponents to bias price (or any other input variable) forecasts in a direction of a positive investment decision. A supporting evidence consisting of 250 feasibility studies of mining investments, provided by Espí and De La Torre 2013, show that the most conservative price estimates were observed to be used in the projects with the highest margins in large companies operating in low-risk countries. These existing works indicate that this process of setting the price is not isolated from organizational politics which further motivates our effort of using managerial price estimates side-by-side with the statistical simulation in this paper. In the investment literature, a commonly used technique to estimate future metal prices is the use of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and especially its simplest form: geometric Brownian motion (GBM). The main criticism regarding modelling of the metals market concerns GBM’s property of attaining unrealistically high values in the long run in many of the scenarios simulated. In this paper, we take the existing capabilities of block sequencing software and combine it with the statistical modelling of metal prices to build a managerial decision-making system for mine plan selection. To motivate and highlight the need of such system, an illustrative gold mine case example is used. This case example is dealt with using in two phases; first a set of alternative mine plans is derived from the mine planning software, and second the expected range economic returns for each mine plan are modelled Monte Carlo random simulation (MCS) using different statistical price SDE models. We are not only interested in the initial price assumption, as is the usual case, but also the effects of price volatility and trend. We show that including volatility and drift into the analysis give additional considerations of risks and robustness into mine plan selection which is often seen as a simple economic value maximization exercise in the managerial setting. Finally, the structure of the managerial decision-making system is presented which automates the uncertainty simulation process to match the optimal mine plan with the managerially estimated price. This rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section contains a literature study on the strategic mine planning and investment decision-making. The “Methods and materials” section provides a methodology and case study descriptions. The “Results on project valuation” section reports simulation results which we use to demonstrate the mine plan decision-making system introduced in the “Simulation-based recommendation system for mine production scenario selection” section. The paper closes with conclusions and discussion.",3
35,2,Mineral Economics,08 March 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-021-00298-9,Impact of metal mining on per capita family income in Peru,June 2022,René Paz Paredes Mamani,Roberto Arpi Mayta,Faustino Ccama Uchiri,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Peru is one of the most important countries in Latin America and the world in mining production and export (Aron and Molina 2020). Worldwide, Peru ranks second in the production of copper, silver, and zinc, while in Latin America, it occupies the first place in the production of gold, zinc, lead, tin, diatomite, analucite, and selenium (Appendix Table 5). “Mining is an extractive activity that takes place all over the world” (Osinergmin, 2017); it influences the standard of living of the population through the impact on the environment and socioeconomic status (Kitula 2006; Ticci and Escobal 2015); it is a source of environmental liabilities and socio-environmental conflicts (Dammert and Molinelli 2007). The large-scale mining industry in general is relatively capital-intensive. “Capital is requerid to conduct exploration, feasibilility studies, design mines, purchase mining equipament, procesing plants, develop mine infraestructura or recapitalise producing mines” (Seeger 2019). The artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is a formal or informal sector with limited available information on production, revenues, explorations, and extraction, which is normally low capital-intensive and uses high labor-intensive technology (Sidorenko et al. 2020). Nevertheless, ASM mining is important for rural livelihoods for many rural and regional communities (Loayza and Rigolini 2016; Osumanu 2020; Ticci and Escobal 2015). From a macro-perspective, the contribution of the mining sector to the economy includes employment, exports, fiscal revenues, road infraestructura, livelihoods, investment, and contribution to GDP through linkage industries. The dynamism of the mining sector in Peru, at the macroeconomic level, has contributed to exports and the growth of the economy. Between 2010 and 2019, the GDP of the mining sector grew at an average annual rate of 3.9%, and in the period 2010–2020, it explained 10% of the national GDP (IPE 2021; MINEM 2019); likewise, it has contributed 59.26% of total exports (Appendix Table 5). At the microeconomic level, mining activity has contributed positively to household income, employment, education, and food expenses and negatively to the environment where mining is located (Balanay et al. 2014; Landa 2017; Loayza and Rigolini 2016; Torres 2015). In the case of Arequipa in Peru, they show that mining activity in a district increases the probability that households access basic services (water, hygienic services, and electricity) but decreases the likelihood that people engaged in this activity achieve a university higher education (Nolazco and Figueroa, 2015). 
The mining activity caused by the mining boom can influence the economic and social well-being of households through the following channels: first, the demand for labor and input by the mining company and the effect on non-mining sectors through back and forth linkage; second, the fiscal channel through the transfer of fiscal revenues and royalties to local governments; third, through mining company development projects and social responsibility initiatives; finally, through the environmental channel that generates the extraction of the mining resource (Antoci et al. 2019; Gamu et al. 2015; Ticci and Escobal 2015). From a technical regulatory point of view, mining activity in Peru is classified into two large groups: formal mining and non-formal mining. Non-formal mining in turn is subdivided into informal mining and illegal mining. “Formal mining is one that complies with all the mining, environmental, social, labor, tax requirements and permits established in legal regulations and includes large-scale mining, medium-scale mining, small-scale mining and artisanal mining” (Vargas 2014). “This activity carried out by a person, natural or legal, who has authorization to start or restart mineral exploration, exploitation and/or benefit activities and/or benefit concession title issued by the competent authority” (MINEM 2017). Informal mining is one that does not comply with permits to carry out mining activity, operates in non-prohibited areas, has a declaration of commitment and is in the process of formalization, and includes the small mining producerFootnote 1 (SMP) and the artisanal mining producerFootnote 2 (AMP) (Vargas 2014). This activity is carried out by natural or legal persons or a group of organized persons who have started a formalization process. This type of mining is carried out using equipment and machinery that do not correspond to the characteristics of the mining activity of the small mining producer or artisanal mining producer or without complying with the requirements of the administrative, technical, social, and environmental regulations that govern such activities in zones not prohibited for mining activity (MINEM 2017). Illegal mining is one that does not comply with the permits to carry out mining activity, operates in prohibited areas and/or uses large capacity machinery, and is subject to interdiction and eradication (Vargas 2014). Illegal mining is carried out by a natural or legal person or a group of people organized using equipment and machinery that does not correspond to the characteristics of the mining activity carried out by the SMP or AMP or without complying with the requirements of the regulations and of an administrative, technical, social, and environmental nature that govern these activities (MINEM 2017). According to ownership, mining activity is classified into two large regimes: the general regime and the regime of small mining and artisanal mining. The general regime includes medium- and large-scale mining, and the artisanal and small mining (ASM) regime includes the small mining producer (SMP) and the artisanal mining producer (AMP) (Wiener 2019). Large mining and medium mining are formal, while ASM is formal, informal, and illegal; most of it is informal and ilegal, and ASM carries out extractive activities on a small scale; however, the rise in mineral prices in recent decades has boosted this activity even outside of the law and current institutions (MINAM 2016). ASM’s mining activity has become more dynamic, mainly in the departments of Madre de Dios, Puno, Ica, Ayacucho, Arequipa, and La Libertad, respectively (Argota et al. 2014). The department of Madre de Dios, with greater intensity of informal gold extraction, attracts many migrants who moved to the Huepetue district basin from the Andean highlands, to work in mining as a means of subsistence. However, ASM is not exclusively a poverty-driven activity. There is an elite of small-scale mining entrepreneurs with a “resource nationalist” discourse who oppose large-scale mining projects (Cortés-McPherson 2019). Rich miners move easily between the formal, informal, and illegal world, in the middle of a city with unpaved streets and a lack of basic services, yet the local industry produces 9 tons of gold per year (Cortés-McPherson 2019). Regarding deforestation due to small mining and artisanal minerals, Espejo et al. (2018) estimate that in the period 1984–2017 in the southern Peruvian Amazon 100 thousand ha have been deforested, of which 10% occurred in 2017 and 53% between the years 2011 and 2017. Informal and illegal gold production generally ranks third or second nationally. It is estimated that between 300 and 500 thousand of the number of artisanal gold miners throughout the country and that 1 million people (3% of the country’s population) are directly or indirectly linked to the activity, of which it is estimated that the 90% are informal and illegal miners (Cano 2020). In 2012, with the aim of formalizing ASM’s informal miners, the Comprehensive Mining Formalization Registry (REINFO) was created, where natural or legal persons carry out the mining activity of exploitation and/or benefit. Until April 24, 2021, 88,729 miners were registered for the formalization, of which the majority correspond to the southern departments: Arequipa (21.40%), Ayacucho (12.04%), Puno (10.80%), Apurímac (10.4%), and Madre de Dios (8.81%) (MINEM 2021). The dynamism of the mining sector, driven by the extraordinary increase in international mineral prices since 2003, has increased the fiscal resources of local district and provincial governments above the levels observed before the price boom (Maldonado 2011). In the case of the southern Peruvian Amazon, where artisanal mining predominates, the dynamism of gold extraction is due not only to the rise in international prices, but also the construction of the Interoceanic Highway (Manrique and Sanborn 2021). However, small-scale mining and artisanal mining have multiple origins, such as the economic crisis during the 1970s and 1980s, easy access to exploitation areas, low monetary and technological investment, colonization, and emigration policies, as well as the emigration generated by political violence to areas with little state presence (Manrique and Sanborn 2021). Figure 1 shows the evolution of Peru’s average monthly district per capita family income between 2003 and 2019. As can be seen in the figure, per capita family income increased steadily from 2007 onwards. The per capita family income of the mining districts increased at a faster rate than that of non-mining districts during this period. In 2003, the income gap in favor of the mining districts was 18 soles;this gap increases to 227 soles in 2019. The average income of the districts evolves at the same speed as the total income of the country. Source: UNDP 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019. Elaboration.

 In relation to the distribution of per capita family income in the district of Peru, in 2013–2019, Fig. 2 shows that the income distribution curves tend to flatten over the years, which means that there is an increase in the dispersion of the incomes. Between 2003 and 2007, it is observed that there is a greater increase in the dispersion of income, despite the fact that in this period the average family income per district capital had a slight downward variation. These results are consistent with the findings of Escobal and Ponce (2012) that show that in the period 2004–2007, there is a stagnation in the Gini coefficient and a worsening in the polarization and segregation indicators. The authors show a trend of segregation and spatial polarization in favor of large cities as opposed to small cities and towns, as well as the polarization between indigenous and non-indigenous groups. As of 2007, the distribution curves tend to flatten over the years but in a more moderate way. Source: UNDP 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019. Elaboration. Own Distribution of district per capita family income.  In the period 2003–2019, the district’s per capita family income increased by an average of 319 soles; in the mining districts, this increase was 500 soles. However, the minimum and maximum values of the variation in income fluctuate between − 460 and 1471 considering all the mining and non-mining districts and between − 281 and 1471 in the mining districts. In 2003, the year in which the rise in the price of minerals began, the distribution of income at the district level was more homogeneous, but the majority of districts were poor. The richest quintile had a per capita family income between 359 and 1216 soles; these districts are located mainly on the southern coast of Peru and near mining sites (Fig. 3a). In 2019, the districts of the richest quintile in Peru have per capita family income levels that vary between 889 and 2037 soles. However, other districts of the sierra and jungle are incorporated into this group, which are located mainly near the mining centers of Arequipa, Madre de Dios, Puno, and Apurimac (Fig. 3a and b).

35,2,Mineral Economics,09 May 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-022-00320-8,The evolution of mining employment during the resource boom and bust cycle in Australia,June 2022,Nam Foo,Ruhul Salim,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The mining sector offers important economic benefits for citizens and communities of the Australian resource-rich states and is most notable in the form of employment opportunities, improved wages, developed infrastructure and tax revenues (Ejdemo 2013). In the resources sector, mining employment is categorized into three types: exploration, construction, and operation. These three types are based on the development stages of the mineral production cycle and are identified as being the main areas of employment in the resource and energy industry. In a notable address entitled Mining Booms and the Australian Economy, Battellino (2010) argues that the distinguishing feature of a mining boom is the substantial increase in mining investment in which reinvigorated wage demands and/or mining of the high demand mineral resources from emerging economies go on to have important macroeconomic impacts. These macroeconomic consequences are mainly caused by global events e.g., changes in the relative prices of commodities and the emergence of powerful new trading partners such as China and other Asian economies. An economic impact resulting from the mining boom was to strengthen the Australian economy. The mining boom increased investment in mining, improved income from mining activities and accelerated the need for increased infrastructure to service mining sites. Also, the mining boom accelerated population growth, which has added to the economic momentum. Assessing the macroeconomic impacts of labor mobility is, therefore, an important exercise. This is because the resource investment boom can be associated with a substantial adjustment in the labor market because strong demand for labor and the high wage rates on offer in the resources sector lures workers from other industries. A surge in Australian mining investment from the mid-2000s until 2012 significantly boosted resources in sector-related employment. Large numbers of mining workers were required to build new mining facilities, particularly in the remote regional areas of the state of Western Australia (WA). During the mining boom, employment in mining increased sharply (with a 13.6% annual growth) between May 2005 and May 2012. The resource industry, therefore, represented one of the fastest growing industries in Australia over this period (NAB Group Economics 2016). According to the NAB (National Australia Bank) Group Economics (2016), the employment trends during the three main mining development stages created at least 122,000 mining construction jobs between the beginning of the mining boom (2004–2005) and its peak (2012–2013), compared with 34,000 operational jobs and 13,000 exploration-related jobs. Labor mobility is an important aspect of the success of the mineral and resource industry (Mineral Council of Australia 2013). It plays a role in reallocating workers between jobs and is crucial in helping the economic flexibility that facilitates adjustment to economic shocks and structural change. Movement within the labor market allows workers to be matched with a suitable job that fits their interests and be economically productive (D'Arcy et al. 2012). In the Australian mineral and resource sector, Long Distance Commuting (LDC) or Fly-in/Fly-out (FIFO) plays a critical role in the economy by providing an alternative to permanent relocation that enables mining workers to take advantage of stronger labor market conditions without incurring all the costs of LDC. The advantage of the LDC is to solve the labor issue by helping mining companies meet their labor requirements by using mining workers who are reluctant to move permanently to remote areas (Mineral Council of Australia 2013). Given the extent of the downturn in mining investment in the current economic climate, mining employment in Australia has been relatively resilient. A study conducted by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has shown that mining investment and employment in the resource and energy sectors grew rapidly in 2013 but are expected to fall in the coming years due to the significant decline in commodity prices that began in 2014 (Kent 2016). In particular, resource construction activity in mining is expected to decline as a result of current mining projects reaching completion. Towards the end of the mining boom and the larger-than-expected declines in iron ore prices, it was predicted that 46,000 mining jobs would be shed between the peaks in 2012–2013 and 2014–2015. Economists have also estimated that another 50,000 mining-related jobs will be cut in WA and Queensland (Qld) (NAB Group Economics 2016). In particular, mining workers in WA are the most likely to encounter job losses. This is because total mining investment and employment cycles in WA are currently less developed. Western Australia accounts for a large proportion of the total mining investment employment in Australia and the labor intensity of commodity projects is lower during the operational phase in WA. This downturn has obliged mining companies to review their business strategies and contemplate laying off workers and closing down their least profitable mining sites (Cordes et al. 2016). The bust in the resource sector has caused significant turbulence in Australia and is expected to continue gradually over the next few years. However, the change in mining employment activities at the national level should still be manageable. More specifically, the remote regional areas and specialized skill groups will be disproportionately affected due to structural mismatches. Australia has experienced two major mining booms. The first was in the 1970s and the second (i.e., the mineral boom) was in the mid-2000s. In particular, the resources boom over the first decade of the 2000s underscores the spatial and temporal complexities and contrasts of contemporary globalization. To meet the demand for mineral resources for the growing markets in India and China, mining companies have utilized spatially expansive and capital-intensive mining technologies to mine purely fixed mineral ore bodies and reserves in remote regional countries’ towns. This remarkable resource and mining boom has been leveraged by near-frictionless capital movements and because the mining sector is serviced by highly mobile non-local mining workers (Robertson and Argent 2016). These services such as accommodation, social interaction, entertainment and food had been well established by State Governments and mining companies in post period of the 1980s in order to meet the day-to-day mining workers daily essential needs while working on-site. This includes State Governments’ attempts to ‘pin down’ investment capital, and mining, resource and service sector labor in planned township sites to create long-term, and socially and economically sustainable mining communities in remote mining sites. These arrangements have been preferred by mining companies (Storey 2001; McKenzie et al. 2014). In mineral and mining research, most of the literature has discussed the township adjacent to, or within close proximity, to mine sites (Robertson and Argent 2016). The mobility of labor is not necessarily seen in a positive light. Rampellini and Veenendaal (2016) suggest that the majority of research studies into labor force mobility in the mining and resource sector emphasize economic and social factors. Labor mobility, especially the subject of jobs and skills in the context of the resource industry, has been paid much attention. However, the question concerning how many and what types of jobs the resource industry can offer to local communities remains unresolved (Dietsche 2020). The Australian economy, during its different cycles, often experiences both labor and skill shortages (Atkinson and Hargreaves 2014). Therefore, this present study examines labor mobility and its structural changes that are linked to Australian business cycles in the resource sector. Importantly, this paper provides an in-depth analysis about Australian labor movement between sectors when the business cycles change and how retrenched mining workers use their skills to transfer from one sector to another. This study uses the real business cycle models to investigate the cyclical change in the mining industry. Real business models express the idea that aggregate economic variables are the outcomes of the decisions made by mining companies or individual agents acting to maximize their utilities subject to production possibilities and resource constraints (Plosser 1989). The decisions made by mining firms following a change in macroeconomic fluctuations can affect mining companies’ productivity and their workers. As a small open economy with free capital flows, the linkages (e.g., the effect of changes in world demand on commodity prices) can affect the Australian economy (Downes et al. 1997). Downes et al. 1997 argue that changes in labor market activities played a critical role in the Australian business cycles, especially the labor movement in the 1980s and 1990s, and are included in this present research on how business cycles can influence labor mobility in the Australian mineral resource sector. The predictions based on research into the sectoral labor market in North America and Europe are very similar. For example, these sectoral labor market studies in North America and Europe indicate that the dispersion of the sectoral employment growth rate (σ) is positively correlated with the unemployment rate. The Lilian index has been used to analyze sectoral labor mobility of mining workers moving from one sector to another. This index allows for measuring the sectoral shifts of employment activities among sectoral industries. In this study, the researchers employed quarterly data for six major Australian industries from 1950q1 to 2018q4 to investigate the relationship between sectoral industry workers’ turnover and the structural movement of employment from the mining industry to other sectors. To compute the index, the authors followed the method used in Ansari et al. (2013).Footnote 1 To compare with the previous literature that has applied the index, we use Australia’s aggregate data to examine the sectoral shift in labor mobility. By contrast, other mainstream literature has included a country’s geographical area or region to compute the index. Since Australia has experienced two major mining booms since the gold rush in the 1850s, the Australian mining industry is now experiencing a highly volatile situation concerning its commodity exports. This is a critical issue currently faced by the Australian economy because how mining contributes to job opportunities has become increasingly important in mining states such as WA and Qld (Grudnoff 2012). More specifically, while a boom in one sector such as the resources industry of the economy can improve national income, not every sector or individual is certain to gain (Anderson 2018). The following questions are asked and answered in the empirical analysis: Is the Australian economy strongly dependent on the resource industry? If so, can labor shortages result from the mining cycles? The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The “Australia’s mining employment cycle: an overview” section presents an overview of the Australian mining employment cycle. The “The economic impact of Australia’s mining cycle” section demonstrates the economic impact of mining employment both before and after the resource boom in Australia. This is followed by the research methodology in the “Research methodology” section. The “Descriptions of data sources” section discusses the sources of data and is followed by the empirical analysis in the “Analysis of empirical results” section. Finally, the “Conclusions” section provides concluding remarks.",

Wellmer’s contribution, from a French perspective",December 2022,Patrice Christmann,Pierre Toulhoat,Jacques Varet,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The use of subsurface resources is among the oldest human activities, dating back to about 3.3 million years BCE, when humans discovered the use of stone to manufacture tools (Roche 2015). Much later on, over 10,000 years BCE (Dixon et al. 1968; Laskaris et al. 2011), obsidian, a natural glass of volcanic origin then highly valued for the production of cutting tools and other objects, was the subject of seaborne trade in the Eastern Mediterranean area, the so-far oldest recorded long-distance trade. Since those early days, the production of minerals and metals both diversified and intensified, a major source of wealth to classical Athens, the Roman Empire, Aztecs, and Mayas. In the mediaeval times, mining was very active in many places within Europe, for instance in the German Harz region where Agricola (1556) described in great detail the mining activities of the Metalliferous Mountains (Erzgebirge), nowadays straddling the border between Germany and the Czech Republic. Agricola’s book is the oldest known treatise on mining engineering and metallurgy. It is also the oldest textbook discussing geology. Geological data and derived knowledge are essential to locate natural resources located in the Earth subsurface, such as geothermal energy sources, groundwater or mineral concentrations of potential economic value, or to use subsurface to develop infrastructure such as tunnels, or store CO2. Attempts to produce maps representing the geological nature of the rock formations available to direct observation on outcrops or in underground mines, developed throughout the eighteenth century. A major milestone in the early history of modern geology happened in the UK with the work of William “Strata” Smith (1769–1839). It is only much later, in 1815 that William “Strata” Smith, a surveyor who laid out the key concepts of modern stratigraphy and produced the first geological map almost entirely covering a nation, the Geological Map of England and Wales (1815). This map, and Smith’s stratigraphic knowledge, changed the world (Winchester 2001) or at least highly contributed to the then-burgeoning Industrial Revolution, as they provided previously missing scientific guidance to locate coal seams at depth, unlocking access to one of the most precious mineral resources of that time. Rulers of the nineteenth century were quick to understand the enormous value of geological knowledge as a key to discovering new mineral resources needed in increasing amounts to feed the Industrial Revolution and the state’s coffers. They supported, and financed, the creation of geological surveys (e.g.: UK: 1835, Austria: 1849, France: 1868, Prussia: 1873, Sweden: 1858) and the regional/ countrywide systematic geological mapping and prospecting. Geological surveys developed as institutions complementary to the existing mining schools, which were focused on mining and metallurgical engineering, with a number of them having been created decades earlier, during the course of the eighteenth century, in order to develop the engineering skills required to plan and operate mostly underground mines and related ore processing and metallurgical plants. It is one of the many ironies of history that Wilhelm Hauchecorne, a Prussian geologist and the founder and first Director of the Geological Survey of Prussia, was of French Huguenot descent. His family having, like many other Huguenots, fled France at the beginning of the eighteenth century, further to their persecution under King Louis XIV. From their foundation up to the end of World War II, geological surveys were institutions serving strictly national interests, and it happened that some of their maps and/or reports were classified, in order to not disclose sensitive information to potential enemies.",

Cook,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It is an honour and pleasure to have the opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding contribution that Professor Friedrich-Wilhelm Wellmer, Fred, has made to the earth sciences, throughout his long and distinguished career. It is a career that has covered the private and the public sectors both nationally and internationally. It has embraced management and leadership, research and exploration, onshore and offshore geology, climate change and environmental geology, metallic and industrial and energy resources. This is an extra-ordinarily diverse range of interests and impacts by any standard. My knowledge of and friendship with Fred extends back 30 years or more, first through our common interest in resources, especially phosphate resources, and then through a shared wish to strengthen the role of national geological surveys, in my case as Director of the British Geological Survey (BGS) and in Fred’s case as President of the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe (BGR)). Related to this, we both had a common vision (along with Martin Kursten and others) of encouraging closer collaboration between Europe’s geological surveys, through the establishment of EuroGeoSurveys. The first efforts to formally classify mineral deposits were made more than a century ago on the basis of whether or not their exploitation was commercially viable. Since that time, classification systems have become more comprehensive and more complex, moving from the relatively simple question “what have we found?” to “can we commercially exploit it?” to “how do we minimise the environmental impact of its exploitation” and “what scope for recycling?”. The pioneering work of M King Hubbert (1956) produced the bell-shaped Hubbert curve and the concept of “peak oil”. But as pointed out by Wellmer in a number of papers (Wellmer 2008; Wellmer and Dalheimer 2012; Wellmer and Scholz 2015, 2017; Weller and Hagelüken 2015), the actual pattern of resource production is found to deviate significantly from the ideal Hubbert curve. To illustrate this point, it is worth quoting at length from Wellmer and Scholz (2017) on their conceptual and empirical historic analysis of applications, misunderstandings and fallacies surrounding the Hubbert curve as it applies to phosphate and gold resources and reserves, but which includes principles that can be applied to other non-renewable resources, including energy. The ultimate recoverable resources (URR) cannot be predicted by fitting a symmetric curve to the data of past (historic) production for any commodity on a global scale. Without knowledge of the URR, it is not possible to determine the peak production time. For well-confined areas, in the case of a supply market, it might be possible today to construct a satisfactory Hubbert Curve and to determine peak production. For phosphate, the case of Nauru Island is a good example, but so far, it is not possible for any commodity worldwide. URR comprise past production, presently known reserves, and future reserves developed from resources (known, but uneconomic at present) and parts of the geopotential (not yet known, but by geological reasoning and technological innovations, reserves can be expected to be discovered). The concept of reserves is a dynamic one, determined by economic conditions, technological developments, etc. The reserves of today can be the resources of tomorrow and vice versa. These factors also influence production curves. Therefore, it is not justified to interpret every peak as caused by geological constraints. In most cases so far, peak curves are demand driven and not at all influenced by geological availability. In only a very few cases (like the curve for the lower 48 states of the USA for oil by Hubbert in 1956 or gold production in South Africa), they are supply driven, i.e., true Hubbert Curves. These insights led Wellmer and his co-authors to adopt an approach to reserves and resources that was more compatible with the “McKelvey box” (McKelvey 1972) rather than the Hubbert curve. They based their approach on the degree of certainty that a deposit exists (which in turn is reflected in the distinction between reserves and resources) and the profitability that will arise from the exploitation of the deposit. Wellmer extended this model to take into account the potential for recycling; an important addition if we are to plot a future course of mineral exploitation that takes the principle of sustainability and a circular economy into account (Sinding-Larsen and Wellmer 2012). Recycling of minerals and mineral products is not always feasible. In the case of phosphorus for example, it is not possible to recycle this essential commodity to any significant extent. Wellmer suggested that despite the abundance of phosphate reserves and resources, it nevertheless warrants particular attention because of its social significance in meeting the essential nutritional needs of society. He elevates phosphate, along with energy, to the top of the resource pyramid. Wellmer, through BGR, also contributed to the UN Framework Classification for Resources (UNECE 1997, 2021a, b) which allows a distinction to be made between the environmental, social economic and governance (ESEG) contingencies that need to be in place for a project to proceed. In 2021, the Sustainable Energy Subprogramme of the UNECE recognised his contribution to the UN Committee on Sustainable Energy. These contributions by Wellmer and others provide the basis for now considering energy-relevant resources and reserves in the context of the transition to low carbon energy and the pathway to net zero.",2

Pohl,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Earth’s growing population and the steady move of humanity to higher living standards cause an ever-increasing consumption of natural resources, in spite of great efforts to ‘make more with less’. Although in principle, metals and minerals are plentiful on the Earth, their provision to societies implies never-ceasing efforts to replace extracted reserves with ore in place. Copper, for example, is one of the metals, the consumption of which is predicted to increase far over past projections because of the world’s decarbonation and electrification. In spite of prophets of looming scarcity, future ‘ultimate’ resources of copper are huge; there are good arguments for giant accessible resources at a depth down to 3.3 km below ground level (Arndt et al 2017). Equivalent arguments apply to other metals and minerals. Can metallogeny be the toolbox for locating these hidden deposits? Moreover, annually, new metals, minerals, compounds or elements are declared as critical (e.g. CMMI 2021; European Commission 2020) as their essential role in the present and future economy is recognized. For some, such as lithium, cobalt, gallium and vanadium, consumption is predicted to explode. As demand rises and existing mines deplete reserves, more deposits must be found, developed and exploited. This depends on preconditions such as lively stock markets that collect the required funds from investors. Growing restrictions to exploration and mining are environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues that may become the main reason for metal and mineral shortages, more so than direct reserve depletion (Jowitt et al 2020). This shifts exploration into ‘mining-friendly’ or remote areas, and extraction toward giant underground operations, although there are strong economic and other arguments for open-cut mining (Ericsson et al 2019). At the same time, research toward zero-entry autonomous mining has been launched by the large mining concerns. Unconventional metal sources that allow extraction without breaking, shifting and milling rocks are considered. Brines below active or dormant volcanos, for example, may deliver Cu, Li, Zn, Pb, Au and Ag (Blundy et al 2021). Exploration methods that are founded on searching the Earth’s surface for outcropping indications of mineralization recede in relevance, although subtle indications of buried ore deposits such as hydrothermal alteration halos or geochemical anomalies remain to be targets, and new shallow deposits are being found. Examples for deep search are gold-rich porphyry copper deposits that are sought by drilling for blind deposits beneath advanced argillic lithocaps and to depths of 1000 m and more (Sillitoe 2020a). The giant magmatic-hydrothermal, subvolcanic, low-sulphur, iron oxide–copper–gold (IOCG) deposit Olympic Dam (Australia), covered by > 250 m of overburden, was discovered by drilling high-amplitude Bouguer gravity and aeromagnetic anomalies. The motivation for the search had been satellite-image lineaments and copper-depleted basaltic rocks (Skirrow et al 2019). As shown by these examples, the search horizon is gradually pushed to greater depths. Consequently, we argue that ever better metallogenic models are required to find the next generation of ore deposits hidden below the surface. Interestingly, metallogeny is more intensively and regularly used in brownfield exploration, extending resources near existing mines (Vearncombe and Phillips 2020), rather than in greenfield search, distant from established mines. In the second case, the nature of the target is necessarily reduced to some discoverable essentials of the respective class, whereas in the first, metallogenic details are fully known. The term metallogeny or metallogenesis (from Greek genesis = origin) designates the science or the study of the origin and distribution of mineral deposits in space and time (de Launay 1905, and later books). Today, we should add: ‘especially with regard to petrogenetic, tectonic and geodynamic process systems’. Following Lindgren (1909), who seems first to have used the term ‘metallogenetic epoch’, we strive to understand the geological timing of metallogenesis; the latter term rather designates the operation of metallogenic process systems. Metallogeny includes both metalliferous and non-metallic mineral deposits; for the latter, ‘minerogeny’ can be used. Note that the adjective form of the word ‘metallogeny’ is metallogenetic (see Lindgren 1909), although the abbreviated ‘metallogenic’ is commonly used. De Launay (1905) already suggested that metallogenic understanding greatly assists in the search for ore. In the second half of the twentieth century, a new move towards realization of this hope came in the form of metallogenic mapping. For the first time in human history, the general public gained access to elementary information about global raw material deposits. Metallogenic maps were produced in order to allow a synopsis of metallogenic, geological and basic economic data of ore deposits. A generalized geological background was used to display information on the main metals and elements contained, location, size, form and nature of deposits (ANNEX Fig. 1a, b). Many countries published national metallogenic maps, often advised and supported by UNESCO. Since the turn into the twenty-first century, digital maps and supporting mineral deposit data banks are replacing the printed media. The transition is marked by the 1:5,000,000 International Digital Metallogenic Map of Africa, sheets 5 and 6 (South of the Equator) compiled by Veselinovic-Williams et al. (1999) in GIS (geospatial/geographic information system) technology. The flood of digitization continues to rise unabatedly. At about the same time, Wyborn et al. (1994) proposed a systematic approach to metal exploration in Australia, calling for mineral system analysis (MSA), similar to the principles of the petroleum system (Magoon and Dow 1994). The latter had been conceived by Dow (1972) and, because of its demonstrated success in exploration, was quickly taken up by the global hydrocarbon industry. The gist was that by starting studies from the source rock, its origin, maturation and oil yield, the potential flow paths of oil fluids, to charging traps, boosted modelling the system. Magoon and Sánchez (1995) wrote: ‘As our ability to characterize and map a petroleum system improves, exploration risk decreases, and the probability of success increases’. Meanwhile, various data types and techniques are integrated towards a holistic petroleum system analysis (PSA). Big Data from basin analysis, wells, logs, cores, organic matter maturity, seismics and geochemistry offers the potential to make PSA an ever better predictor of the presence of hydrocarbons (Schlumberger 2022). In early 2021, accelerating its digital transformation, oil giant ARAMCO announced the launch of a new supercomputer (Dammam 7) that is among the ten most powerful in the world. It will assist in processing and analysing enormous oil and gas data sets. The aim is to use sophisticated imaging and deep-learning algorithms to run very detailed 3D Earth models. Modern exploration for minerals and metals is based on mineral system analysis (Wyborn et al 1994). Mineral system analysis (MSA) as practiced among others in Australia, Canada and Scandinavia, and in the novel Critical Minerals Mapping Initiative (CMMI 2021; Hofstra et al 2021), is the compilation of geological processes, conditions and factors that contribute to the formation of a mineral deposit, and the selection of discoverable proxies. Basically, the aim is to build an exploration model of hydrothermal or magmatic deposits, from the source through migration to ore precipitation. Because of the derivation from petroleum system analysis (PSA), the essentials of both models, MSA and PSA, are similar. MSAs for other raw materials and genetic classes are multiplying. So far, MSA is essentially a digital-age frame for quantitative metallogenic models that are introduced into the workflow as the ‘knowledge base’ (Skirrow et al 2019). In some cases, the metallogenic knowledge (‘conceptual mineral system criteria’) may be a minor part of the work (‘hybrid or data-only MSA’). Data-driven methods based on geochemical, geophysical or remote sensing features of known mineral deposits can be used as training sets (Lawley et al 2021). Lawley et al.’s paper also serves as an example of the current trend that ‘precompetitive’ geoscience datasets are made available by state geological survey organizations, allowing the public to apply the unlimited power of ingenuity, and methods such as probability mathematics in the search for areas of higher prospectivity. The aim is to effectively reduce the search space of targeting for more detailed mineral exploration. In Canada, for example, less than 8% of map pixels contain more than 80% of indicated Ni mineralization (Lawley et al 2021). In current ore geology research, metallogenic terms are frequently used, although most papers only treat single, specialized aspects of the whole source-to-deposit system. The usefulness of new contributions in exploration is often claimed by science authors but rarely backed up. This absence is comparable in company reports addressed to regulatory or listing authorities (e.g. SEDAR 2021) and in public websites of mining companies. This review article intends to provide an overview and guide on metallogenic principles, models and terms, and metallogeny’s use in exploration. Considering that the terms ‘mineral system’ and ‘metallogenic system’ are confusable, it will answer the question: What is the difference, or relation, between metallogeny and mineral systems? In this paper, gold is preferentially employed for reference cases, because methods vary greatly between different metals and other raw materials; also, gold is of highest interest considering that more than 50% of funds spent globally per annum for exploration target gold (S&P Global 2021). And, because ‘orogenic’ gold deposits deliver > 50 wt % of global mine production, orogenic gold metallogeny is more completely covered than other deposit classes. Finally, let us laud the numerous ‘junior’ exploration companies with limited resources targeting gold, often in greenfield settings. They are the innovative and most eager users of open-source precompetitive material.",1

Exploration strategies have been adopted to supply the society with metals with a fairly short commodity cycle focus and in this paper we review strategies developed in Sweden and discuss how the focus have shifted on both commodity types, i.e. what metals are we looking for, and deposit styles, i.e. high grade/low tonnage vs. low grade/high tonnage. In Sweden, exploration and mining of metallic mineral deposits goes back at least 1000 years (cf. Tegengren 1924). Well-known mines such as Falun copper mine and Sala silver mine sustained the Swedish crown for several centuries. Exploration strategies before the industrial revolution in the mid 1800-hundreds were not sophisticated and focused on maximizing income to the Swedish state from mining iron, base and precious metals from outcropping mineral deposits primarily in the Bergslagen region. With the onset of the industrial revolution the demand for these and other commodities grow, exploration intensified and many western countries, including Sweden, established geological survey organisations that were responsible for identifying the mineral potential of the country. In Sweden, this led to an intensified exploration for iron and copper in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. The global gold-rush at the same time also led to intensified exploration strategies for precious metals in Sweden. This also led to the establishment of the Boliden company, which is since then, the largest privately-owned mining and exploration company in Sweden. The demand for these commodities continued to be high during the world war II, and the high demand for these metals continued to be strong in the decades after the world war II. In Sweden, this led to intensified exploration strategies for iron, primarily led by the Swedish state, and for copper, primarily led by the Boliden company. In the 1970s, the price for copper increased and mining of low-grade high tonnage deposits increased dramatically world-wide. In Sweden the strategy of Boliden, who until then had mining high grade, so called volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits (VMS) in the Bergslagen area and the Skellefte district, now expanded their exploration programme to lower grade deposits and in 1967 the low-grade Cu-deposit Aitik was put in production. Meanwhile the state, through the Geological Survey and LKAB invested heavily in iron ore exploration, mainly in the northern part of Sweden. Many new deposits were found, and trial mining of several deposits took place and the mines in Kiirunavaara and Malmberget were extended. In the 1980s and 1990s, a new boom of precious metal exploration started, based on the upswing of the price of gold and until today many of the junior exploration companies are focused on gold. In the last decade, a high demand for called critical raw materials, such as REE, Li, Co a.o. important for the new green technology has mean that many junior exploration companies have shifted their strategies towards these commodities.",3

On the other hand, the discovery rate of new ore deposits, especially from the greenfield exploration, has kept declining over the recent years under more challenging conditions and circumstances for mineral exploration: e.g. thick overburden; isolated district; ore grade decline; social and environmental issues and so on. For that reason, technological innovation in mineral exploration is expected more than before to secure the sustainability of non-renewable resources. In this paper, breakthrough technologies for mineral exploration are discussed from the following two perspectives: (a) requirements and expectations for exploration technology in consideration of recent and expected future changes in the circumstances surrounding exploration, and (b) a review of examples of significant breakthrough technologies in the history of exploration technology development. Requirements and expectations for exploration technologies are clarified based on the discussion about the role of exploration in the mining industry, the characteristics of exploration technologies compared with those of other technical fields, and the recent situation of the mining industry where exploration technologies are applied. Breakthroughs in exploration technologies are clarified based on the discussion about the intrinsic value of exploration technologies and a review of specific examples of technological breakthroughs that actually brought about innovation to exploration: e.g. induced polarization (IP); airborne electromagnetics (EM); airborne gravity gradiometry (AGG); spectral remote sensing; global navigation satellite system (GNSS); unmanned survey platform; and neural networks/deep learning. The first perspective (a) is intended to discuss the important factors required for exploration technologies, derived deductively from a review of the role and expectations of exploration in the mining industry and the current situation of the mining industry. The second perspective (b), on the other hand, is intended to discuss the common characteristics of breakthrough technologies for mineral exploration derived inductively from a review of those breakthrough technologies. It would be useful to consider those discussions of both directions comprehensively to discuss breakthrough technologies for mineral exploration. Summarizing the results of the reviews and discussions, future prospects for breakthrough technologies for mineral exploration are discussed.",

In some cases, the hunt for mineral resources must be performed in terrains with rough climate conditions or with demanding topography or limited access (swamps). About 1070 discoveries have been made worldwide within the last decade. However, only 19 of them were classified as world class or “Tier 1” depositsFootnote 1; four of them were discovered each in China and Australia, three in each of Africa and Canada, two of them each in the USA and Pacific/Southeast Asia as well as one in Latin America (Schodde 2019). In order to meet all the earlier listed demands at the same time, magnetic and electromagnetic (EM) methods making use of quantum sensors with exceptional sensitivity and resolution are very promising for future exploration scenarios. In the long term, gravimetry using quantum sensors will also play a role in exploration. Over the years, various reviews were undertaken to report on state of the art and new developments in most important methods for metalliferous mining geophysics such as Fullagar and Fallon (1997), Nabighian and Asten (2002), or Vallée et al. (2011). They also provide some discussion of new sensor developments. The magnetic method is still one of the most popular and intensively used methods in mineral exploration. The reviews by Nabighian et al. (2005), Vallée et al. (2011), and lately Hinze et al. (2013) with included references provide a substantial overview on this method, the sensors used, the instrumentation, and data acquisition as well as according processing and interpretation techniques. State of the art sensors (Grosz et al. 2017) for the airborne magnetic method are scalar-type magnetic field sensors, called magnetometers, such as optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) or vector-type magnetometers such as fluxgates. Scalar-type magnetometers measure the amplitude of the Earth’s magnetic field, also called total magnetic field intensity (TMI), by making use of the Zeeman effect in alkali atom vapor (most often cesium) enclosed in glass cells. The best commercially available OPMs (Commercial OPM providers 2020) achieve a white noise floor of about \(0.3 \mathrm{pT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}\) in a bandwidth of \(<10\mathrm{Hz}\). OPMs in scalar magnetometry, left lower box in Fig. 1, suffer so-called dead zones and heading errors (GEM Systems Inc., 2020) which makes their response sensitive to their orientation (internally it relates to the direction of the light path through the glass cell and orthogonal to it) in the external magnetic field. Multiple sensors may be arranged to enable scalar gradiometry (Hogg 2004). Airborne exploration methods which may benefit from the application of quantum sensors. The abbreviation AFMAG corresponds to the audio-frequency magnetic method. In this article, the gravimetric method will not be covered Fluxgate magnetometers (FGMs) have a main sensitive axis along the internal core of highly permeable material and measure the corresponding magnetic field component. The best commercial fluxgates provide a white noise floor of \(\approx 1 \mathrm{pT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}\) with bandwidths of about 1–25 kHz, e.g., Bartington instruments Ltd. (2020). However, they exhibit a significant increase of the noise spectra for low frequencies of \(<10\mathrm{ Hz}\). There is also progress in research towards FGMs with higher resolution. This is reviewed in Grosz et al. (2017) and the included references. Three orthogonal FGMs would thus enable vector magnetometry (Christensen and Dransfield 2002), see Fig. 1. The state of the art of the quantum sensors will be reviewed in the “Short review on quantum sensing” section. Special focus is laid on superconducting quantum interference devices, so-called SQUIDs in the “Superconducting quantum magnetometers” section. Electromagnetic methods have been successfully used since the 1920s as a toolset for sensing conductive bodies or conductance contrasts in rock materials and can thus be used to explore the sub-surface for certain mineral deposits (Grant and West 1965; Nabighian 1991; Zhdanov 2010; Smith 2014). These methods acquire an electromagnetic response excited by natural or artificial sources either in the frequency (FD) or time domain (TD). These electromagnetic (EM) source fields interact with conductive structures and lead to secondary responses which are often of very weak amplitude and demand magnetic field sensors, so-called magnetometers, of utmost sensitivity and low noise. This leads to a large ratio between the amplitude of the excitation signal and the noise which is a measure of the signal to noise ratio \(SNR\), which should be covered by the sensing instrument and the associated data acquisition system. Thus, 24-bit digitizers are today state of the art. The demand of the high \(SNR\) was significantly increased by the tremendous improvements in the EM methods achieved by both the industry and the academia, in the past decade, namely by increasing the transmitting power (for the active EM methods) and the resolution of the sensing instruments, developing new operating platforms and according peripheral instrumentation. Quantum sensors may in this context play an important role to gain an improved \(SNR\) which e.g. facilitates more robust observations at late acquisition times, very low frequencies, or at large transmitter–receiver separations and is thus the pathway to increase exploration depths. The higher resolution of sensing instruments is also beneficial for natural source EM measurements, where the signal amplitude is even weaker compared to active source methods. All the listed advances and new software toolchains for the forward modeling and inversion of EM data using state of the art computing facilities lead to improved Earth models describing the 3D distribution of conductivities of rocks which may vary over several orders of magnitude. For example, graphite or sulfide bearing structures can give rise to significant conductivity anomalies, hydrothermal alteration zones can exhibit elevated conductivity, and conductive clay caps are indicative of geothermal reservoirs. Furthermore, geotechnical applications such as the detection of pipes, foundations, or unexploded ordnances are possible targets for electromagnetic methods. By increasing the \(SNR\), even more subtle EM features can be detected which will help to decipher other physical or chemical phenomena in sub-surface geological structures alike superparamagnetism (Macnae 2016b, 2017) and induced polarization (IP; Kaminski and Viezzoli 2017; Macnae 2016a). To date, the plurality of those EM instruments uses induction coils (abbreviated as “coils” herein) of various sizes ranging from centimeters to hundreds of meters. FGMs or OPMs are also used for some instruments or complement coil instruments for EM field measurement at very low frequencies. The introduced EM methods are widely used in mineral exploration during airborne, submarine and marine, onshore and borehole surveys, respectively. Airborne electromagnetic methods (AEM) as one topic of this article provide a cost- and time-effective operation also in areas with critical environmental conditions, e.g., swamp, or the lack of access permission. Legault (2015) provides a recent overview on state of the art and future directions of AEM methods. In order to increase the investigation depth further, also semi-airborne EM methods (SAEM) using airborne receivers and ground-based transmitters or vice versa are currently under development. Examples for implementing the SAEM method are discussed in detail e.g. by Wu et al. (2019) or Steuer et al. (2020). This work will provide a short insight how AEM methods may benefit from the application of quantum sensors (QS) namely SQUIDs from today’s perspective. A detailed review on the use of SQUIDs in geophysics is given by Stolz et al. (2021b). Figure 1 lists all airborne magnetic, gravimetric, and AEM methods which may use quantum sensor instrumentation in future. The first section provides the background information for this article. The “Short review on quantum sensing” section introduces the quantum sensors, and the “Airborne superconducting QS instruments” section focusses on first realizations of airborne QS instrumentation. Therein, the according systems are introduced. They are either close to the threshold of being in operation or already in commercial use. One key concept is to reduce the motion noise of the airborne platform for the successful operation of the QSs. This topic will also be introduced and discussed towards the end of this section. Therein, validation studies performed with two QS instruments on helicopter-based platforms will be drawn. The “Performance evaluation and demonstrations of the airborne SQUID instruments” section demonstrates a ground-based application of SQUID instruments in mineral exploration based on the time domain EM method. It is now a standard method in industry and a number of instruments are in operation. One case study proves the performance and advantages of these QS instruments in mineral exploration. Finally, the work is concluded and a short outlook provides insights of the next steps of the recent QS instrument development.",6

35,3,Mineral Economics,29 March 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-022-00313-7,"Metallurgical infrastructure and technology criticality: the link between photovoltaics, sustainability, and the metals industry",December 2022,Neill Bartie,Lucero Cobos-Becerra,Markus Reuter,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Technologies that enable the harnessing of renewable energy contain various metals that facilitate specific functionalities. These include a number of precious and special metals/metalloids, often in miniscule—but essential—quantities. Most of the minor metals are only produced as co-products of their carrier metals (Bleiwas 2010), thereby drawing all associated carrier metal value chains, including the associated infrastructure, into the life cycle. As demand for some of these metals is on the increase (UNEP 2013), several of them have been classified as critical raw materials (CRMs) because of the combination of their economic importance, supply disruption risk, and the resource intensity associated with their extraction from lower-grade deposits (Frenzel et al. 2017; Nassar and Fortier 2021). Not all critical materials are necessarily scarce—in some cases, supply risk can be alleviated by having and keeping the right infrastructure in the right locations. Without the associated critical infrastructure, however, critical materials cannot be produced. Manufacturing processes cause pure metals and other materials to become heavily intertwined, the degree to which directly impacts the effectiveness of recycling—in terms of quantity and quality—and thus circularity potential. Upon entering the end-of-life stage, devices collected for recycling become complex urban minerals in which no elements are present in pure form. As with the extraction of valuable metals from primary geological minerals, urban mineral beneficiation and extraction processes need to be designed to run at their thermodynamic limits, so optimising resource efficiency and consumption. This complexity has been visualised in the Metal Wheel, which can be found in various publications, e.g. Reuter et al. (2019) and Verhoef et al. (2004). Negative impacts on sustainability, i.e. the environmental, economy, and society, need to be minimised at the same time, while still increasing economic welfare for the stakeholders operating in the life cycle. Before such optimisation can be performed, all material and energy flows (losses and entropy creation included), and potential environmental, economic, and social impacts need to be quantified for the entire system (Reuter et al. 2019). Of particular importance is also the location of infrastructure in the supply chain, as it strongly affects sustainability—environmental impacts related to power consumption can change dramatically depending on the combination of fossil- and non-fossil energy sources in the local electricity grid. Production and recycling costs and social impacts can also change significantly between locations. With this information in hand, the potentially many trade-offs in this complex optimisation problem can be identified and quantified. Good separation of the multitude of intertwined materials, compounds, alloys, and others usually cannot be achieved in only one reactor, but rather in a system of reactors (i.e. a plant) or a system of plants and processes which then form part of the circular economy. It is self-evident that the production and recycling of metals are not only about the technology but how best to manipulate the exchange of materials between different phases in individual reactors, between different reactors, and between systems of reactors (Reuter 2016; Reuter et al. 2021). To achieve this, mass and heat transfer between different phases in a reactor, process kinetics and dynamics, chemistry, and thermodynamics need to be understood well. Furthermore, it is about the exchange of information between life cycle stages, e.g. making available recycling data to facilitate design-for-recycling, and financial exchanges to keep the life cycle going. Two PV technologies, cadmium-telluride (CdTe) and monocrystalline Si (mono-Si) PV, will be presented to illustrate these concepts. This paper demonstrates the benefits of simulating these large life cycle systems at the process level, and linking simulations with environmental assessment and cost models, and provides insights on their sustainability and circular economy potential. For the results presented here, the authors expanded the methodologies presented in previous publications, in which the resource consumption (RC), resource efficiency (RE), and environmental impacts of the CdTe (Bartie et al. 2020) and mono-Si (Bartie et al. 2021a) PV module life cycles were assessed. Dominant PV technologies include first-generation wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si) and second-generation CdTe and copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) thin-film cells in which several semiconductor and other metal layers are deposited onto sub- or superstrates and laminated into modules with another layer of glass polymer sheet as backing. Between these three technologies, the metals and other elements needed include Ag, Al, Au, B, Cd, Cu, Ga, In, Mg, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Se, Si, Sn, Te, Ti, Zn, and others in various combinations. Between the CRM lists of the USA and Europe, more than half of these are considered critical (European Commission 2020; Graedel et al. 2022). Significant research and development are also underway to further develop tandem modules, which consist of combinations of these and new third-generation technologies that utilise, e.g. Pb-based perovskites to maximise power conversion efficiency (PCE) (Lal et al. 2017; Mohammad Bagher et al. 2015). As the production of tandem modules effectively combines the life cycles of two different PV technologies, the resulting step changes in PCE come with increased life cycle complexity, resource requirements, losses, and impacts. Therefore, it is important to analyse PV life cycles at a detail level that enables the identification and optimisation of relevant sustainability and CE-related hotspots and trade-offs. This is important for the PV industry, to be able to assess resource and recycling requirements in the long run, and to optimise and strategise accordingly (e.g. Haegel et al. 2019). Process simulation provides a platform for creating digital twins of systems of linked value chains and allows one to capture the detail level often missing from approaches that use aggregated input data (Jacquemin et al. 2012; Reuter 2016; Reuter et al. 2015) and often consider quantity, but not quality (Reuter et al. 2019). The work discussed in this paper has been realised using the HSC Chemistry (Metso:Outotec 2021) process simulation software. The complete supply chains have been mapped to consider all the complex nonlinear combinations and chemistries in a large number of different reactors and systems. Following this approach permits calculating both energy and exergy flows (enthalpy and entropy of all streams) and linking them to power using a common unit, i.e. kW. Figure 1 shows the typical stages in a circular life cycle of a PV module with materials and energy also entering from outside the system to keep it functioning. The energy balance is represented by the orange ring, and the inevitable dissipation of exergy along the life cycle by the changing thickness of the red ring. Running the life cycle at its thermodynamic limits would minimise the thinning of this ring and reduce the amounts of external energy and materials that need to enter the system to slow down losses and keep value within the life cycle. Note that the resulting environmental and other impacts are strongly influenced by the location of each part of the complete CE infrastructure. This is discussed in Sects. 3.2.2 and 3.4. PV module life cycle stages showing the consumption of external materials and energy, and their dissipation along the life cycle High-detail simulations such as these facilitate simultaneous assessments of RC, RE, and potential environmental, social, and economic impacts using up-to-date operational data for existing technologies and relatively straightforward adaptation to create alternative datasets for the exploration of future scenarios. By linking these dimensions, the approach lends itself to design for sustainability and design for circularity by complementing design activities with relevant resource and sustainability information from the outset. The life cycle of a CdTe PV module is presented here as the first example of a system that encompasses several base and minor metal production chains. To manufacture a state-of-the-art CdTe PV cell, the metals needed include, among others, Al, Cd, Cu, Se, Sn, Te, and Zn. In this system, Cd is a co-product of Zn and Pb, while Te and Se are co-products of Cu (Bartie and Reuter 2021). A schematic diagram of the CdTe module life cycle is shown in Fig. 2. A thin-film PV module typically consists of a glass substrate onto which several semiconductor, metal contact, and other layers are deposited. Apart from the encapsulant and back glass, all layers contain metals (First Solar 2020a, b). Physical flows in the CdTe PV module life cycle (Bartie and Reuter 2021) As mentioned, Cd, Te, and Se are mainly produced as by-products, and therefore, the life cycle includes the production of their carrier metals, and not just finished semi-conductors. By expanding the foreground system boundaries in this way, resource, environmental, and other hot spots can also be identified within individual processes in metal value chains, opening up more opportunities for improvement in sustainability throughout the value chain. Recycling closes the life cycle loop, albeit only partially due to material and energy inefficiencies and losses, and the creation of entropy. Silicon PV technologies dominate the PV market and also rely on the availability of various materials. Despite its abundance in the earth’s crust, Si metal itself is considered a critical raw material because of its economic importance and potentially increased supply risk (European Commission 2020). Continued research and development over the last decades have resulted in higher cell and module efficiencies and considerable decreases in the amount of solar grade Si (SG-Si) required to generate a Watt of power, reaching 3.6 g/WDC in 2019, half of the consumption a decade prior (IEA-PVPS 2019). At the same time, however, PV deployment is growing rapidly, the net effect being an increase in demand from 33 kt in 2015 to 235 kt in 2030 in the European PV industry (Gislev and Grohol 2018). Opportunities are emerging to compensate, at least partially, for the net growth in demand from secondary resources. End-of-life (EOL) PV module quantities are expected to increase significantly between 2025 and 2030 with cumulative global PV waste quantities forecast to reach eight million tons by 2030 and almost 80 million tonnes by 2050 (IRENA and IEA-PVPS 2016). It is clear that design for circularity and sustainability and the development of complementary business models and high-quality recycling processes need to be prioritised. The objective of recycling is to maximise RE by closing material loops. What cannot be ignored is that losses occur at every step along the way, meaning that these loops can only ever approach closure up to limits determined by life cycle design and the laws of nature. These losses cannot be designed out if they are not identified in the first place. Therefore, while EOL recycling is critically important, losses and inefficiencies need to be identified and minimised throughout the life cycle, in manufacturing processes as well as during product design. A block flow diagram of the mono-Si system analysed is shown in Fig. 3. Physical flows in the mono-Si PERC PV module life cycle system where PERC refers to passivated emitter and rear cell, the current industry-standard Si cell configuration (VDMA 2021)",4

Even more so, a broad range of metals and minerals is required for achieving the transition towards greener and carbon-free economies as well as for the development of future high-tech applications. With the projected growth in demand for metals and minerals in the coming decades, which cannot be met even if recycling rates substantially increase, the mining industry, for the foreseeable future, will remain the leading producer of the materials we need to build our low carbon sustainable future (IEA and International Energy Agency 2021). The mining industry is not only providing the building blocks for a more sustainable future, it directly and indirectly contributes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (World Economic Forum 2016). Even though the mining sector is a significant emitter of greenhouse gases and often located in ecologically sensitive and less-developed areas including indigenous lands and territories, it does have the opportunity and potential to positively contribute to all 17 SDGs. This can be achieved, for example, through a commitment to provide inclusive employment opportunities, support local supply capacity, and strengthen local procurement, as well as investments in renewable energy and shared infrastructure or infrastructure linkages with agriculture and local communities, and increased financial transparency. It is important to note that positive contributions by mining companies can include improvements towards the SDGs and corresponding targets as well as mitigating or preventing negative impacts on the SDGs (World Economic Forum 2016). However, in order to actively contribute to achieving the SDGs, the mining industry “must ramp up community engagement, partnership and dialogue with other industry sectors, government, civil society and local communities” (World Economic Forum 2016). It is precisely these rising expectations of a wide range of stakeholders that has moved the global mining industry to the spotlight and put increasing pressure on performing not only economically, but also socially and environmentally in a more sustainable way. Aside from well-known industry inherent challenges of increasing productivity and operational efficiency due to lowering ore grades, farther transportation routes and, consequently, increasing development and production costs, this value shift that has taken place in recent years means that sustainability is no longer a “nice-to-have” but has become imperative for long-term competitiveness and existence of mining companies  (Clausen et al. 2020b; Ellis 2020; Durrant-Whyte et al. 2015; Mitchell 2021). Investors are increasingly judging companies on factors such as their environmental footprint, carbon footprint, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy consumption, as well as their safety record and benefits to employees (Burns 2020). Companies with higher ESG ratings outperformed not only during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic but also in the longer term (PwC 2021). In addition, (end-) consumers increasingly demand products coming from traceable sources produced in a responsible manner that they offer fair and secure jobs to their employees, and that they protect the environment and support the communities in which they operate (Clausen et al. 2020b). Notwithstanding the technological challenges of digital transformation, the real game changer in mining, therefore, can be considered to be the changing societal values and shifting stakeholder expectations, embedded in the larger transformation towards low-carbon economies to mitigate climate change. It means that mining companies have to rethink and redefine their role within society. The mining industry needs to align with the values of today’s generation, which include transparency, responsible technological innovation, sustainability, and shared prosperity. This means that mining companies need to rethink how they can and will create sustainable value for all stakeholders (Jamasmie 2020). Technological innovation and the transformation towards increasing automation, digitalisation, and electrification present important enabler, not only for improving economic performance and ensure mining operations to remain profitable but also for meeting sustainability targets and stakeholder expectations. However, to date, the discussion on technological innovation in mining has strongly focused on improving economic parameters and safety (Barnewold and Lottermoser 2020; Sánchez and Hartlieb 2020). The concept of Mining 4.0, or the Smart Mine, has been established as a technological transformation driven by digitalisation and automation, and to some extent electrification, in the mining sector. Against the backdrop of the wider societal challenges around climate change and sustainability, however, the concept of Mining 4.0 should be expanded to more explicitly include social and environmental dimensions. While technology is an important enabler for change, it should and cannot be considered independently from its purpose and its impact on miner’s triple bottom line to ensure continued trust of stakeholders and thus ensure that mining companies can thrive alongside the societies and communities they operate in. Therefore, mining companies and researchers could benefit from an expanded notion of Mining 4.0 to make their efforts more explicit to make mineral extraction not only more efficient and safe, but also environmentally friendly, and more socially acceptable. Furthermore, the concept of Mining 4.0 encompasses an understanding of the interrelationships between technologies and thus aims for a more integrated view of technological transformation. Recent publications on innovation and digitalisation tend to give anecdotal examples for the implementation of specific digital or automation solutions without providing deeper insight on how these technologies build on each other and relate to one another. For example, when considering battery-electric equipment, rather than just replacing diesel equipment with electric vehicles, the electrification of mines and elimination of greenhouse gas emissions needs to include a redesign of processes and also include the dimension of energy supply to the mine site. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce an expanded notion of Mining 4.0 to include a range of non-technological dimensions and to frame this expanded concept as the “Human Centered Climate Smart Mine”. In the following paragraphs, first, technological dimensions and challenges will be outlined, leading technologies of Mining 4.0 introduced, and a more integrated understanding of the technologies commonly subsumed under the term “Smart Mining” or, respectively, Mining 4.0, will be presented using the data-information-value chain. Secondly, various non-technological dimensions that should be considered in conjunction with the technological transformation are introduced and discussed. The conclusion provides a summarising argument for the “Human Centered Climate Smart Mine”.",1

The focus is on reducing the consumption of resources, especially energy and raw materials. While raw materials are the basis of our material world, their excessive consumption over the last decades has also contributed significantly to climate change. However, raw materials, and here especially metals, play a key enabling role as well for climate protection technologies, such as electro mobility, the hydrogen economy, and solar and wind power plants, and also for digitalization. Accordingly, it is necessary to make the use of raw materials much more resource-efficient than before and to use them as purposefully as possible instead of consuming them. A key approach to this is the circular economy, because metals can basically be reused “infinitely,” mostly without any loss of quality.Footnote 1 If modern recycling technologies are applied consistently, pure metals are available again at the end of the processes that are identical in their chemical and physical properties to those from mining. But how can metals such as cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), and lithium (Li) in electric car batteries; platinum group metals (PGM) in catalysts; or precious metals, copper (Cu), and tin (Sn); and other technology metals in electronic components be used and recycled as resource-efficiently as possible? We will look at this question in more detail in the following chapter, with a focus on metals in consumer products. After pointing out the significance and policy approach of recycling and the circular economy, we will briefly explain the technical and economic fundamentals of metal recycling. We will then look into concrete examples: Where do we stand today with regard to circularity and recycling with established products such as cars, catalysts, or electronics? What can we learn from this for new emerging products such as batteries for electric vehicles (EV)? Taking these in-praxis insights as basis, the general opportunities and challenges of metal recycling will be identified. As will be shown, many of these challenges are beyond technology—legal framework conditions, business models, and stakeholder collaboration are of key importance as well. EV batteries are considered here on purpose in an own sub-chapter, as they have a high relevance for (critical) metals. They are an example of an emerging, highly dynamic market (also on the technology side) where circularity strategies and recycling will become a “policy must.” Although currently only small volumes of end-of-life EV batteries are available, it is now the right time to develop technologies and set up appropriate framework conditions and business models. It offers a chance to overcome recycling deficits we have experienced in established products such as cars or electronics. In this context, electromobility could become a role model to establish a circular economy. The final part of this chapter will look into new developments and requirements in collection, mechanical processing and extractive metallurgy, including slag engineering and slag processing. It will emphasis the importance of systemic approaches which make use of various complementing technologies, considering interdependencies and interface optimization. The benefits of metal recycling go far beyond proper waste management. While responsible sourcing of raw materials, specifically metals, rightfully has drawn more attention over the last years, also effective and responsible recycling needs to be understood as a cornerstone for a more sustainable and competitive economy (Goldmann 2010a, b). In this context, responsible metal recycling: Contributes to the conservation of raw materials, complementing the primary supply of important and partially critical metals for our society. Can significantly improve supply security, especially for many technology metals which currently are imported from outside Europe. Many metal imports derive from regions with higher geopolitical risks, hence making the European economy vulnerable to supply disruptions. Exploiting the European “urban mine” built from our end-of-life (EoL) products, infrastructure, and other residue streams reduces import dependence, improves the resilience of crucial value chains, and hence supports economic activities and jobs in Europe. The need for more supply chain resilience has become even more obvious in the context of the Covid 19 pandemic and the Ukraine war. Contributes to cushion volatile metal prices as the additional supply of recycled metals can help to overcome demand–supply imbalances and increases the number of metal sources beyond the primary producers. Reduces the CO2 footprint and overall environmental impact of raw materials supply. If taking place in state-of-the-art recycling facilities, in most cases the energy efficiency (per kg of metal) is better and the impact on water, air, soil, and biosphere is considerably lower than in mining operations. Main reason is that the metal concentration in most of our products is much higher than in geological deposits. Is one pillar of responsible sourcing by providing transparent and clean supply chains. Is important as well for the protection of the environment as non-recycling or landfilling of EoL products such as electronics, batteries, or vehicles bears the risk of emitting hazardous and harmful substances. This does not mean to strive for 100% recycling of all metals, as technical and economical limits need to be considered. As discussed in Wellmer and Hagelüken (2015), an optimum mix of secondary and primary metal supply exists. Recovering the last bits of metals from low-grade and complex materials can become more energy intensive than supplying these from primary resources. However, as will be shown in this chapter, there is significant room to improve recycling, especially of precious and special metals from industrial residue streams and EoL consumer goods such as electronic devices, vehicles, or batteries. Due to the permanent nature of metals and the long lifetime of some metal-bearing products and infrastructures (which can stay in stock for tens, e.g., vehicles, or hundreds, e.g., buildings, of years) or the huge sales volumes of consumer products such as electronic devices or batteries (with relatively short use times), we have been building up a significant anthropogenic stock, creating a potential future urban mine for technology metals. Setting up a circular economy means that at the end of these products’ lives—whenever and wherever this will take place—they need to be responsibly and efficiently recycled (Hagelüken 2014), (Hagelüken et al. 2016). Today’s growing demand for metals, however, cannot be met by recycling alone. Primary (mining) and secondary (recycling) supply will remain complementary in the future. But with an increasing utilization of the recycling potential, and as mining conditions are expected to become more difficult (lower ore grades, more complexity, greater depths, etc.), the optimum supply mix will move towards an increasing share of secondary metals (Wellmer and Hagelüken 2015). With the Raw Materials Initiative started in 2008, the EU Commission has placed the significance of raw materials for the European Economy high on the European policy agenda. “Resource efficiency and supply of secondary raw materials through recycling” is one of three pillars of this initiative, in addition to a “Fair and sustainable supply of raw materials from global markets” and a “Sustainable supply of raw materials within the EU” (EU-COM 2008, 699). Linked to this, from 2010 onwards, the EU commission started the assessment of Critical Raw Materials (CRM) for the EU economy. The first list of 14 CRMs was published in 2011 (EU-COM 2011, 25). It is updated every 3 years; the most recent edition from 2020 comprises 30 raw materials, 21 out of which are metals (EU-COM 2020b, 474). A Commission report from January 2018 highlights the potential for a more circular usage of CRMs. “Reviewing important sectors for CRMs, it describes relevant EU policies, refers to key initiatives, presents and gives sources of data, identifies good practices and indicates possible further actions” (Gislev et al. 2018). Recycling is one of the factors addressed in these assessments and publications because it reduces the supply risk for raw materials. For a positioning of the European Union, studies on international developments can provide relevant benchmarks (Goldmann et al. 2014). This work has been complemented by a number of further policy actions. In July 2014, the Commission published the communication “Towards a Circular Economy—A zero waste programme for Europe” (EU-COM 2014, 398), followed in Dec. 2015 by “Closing the Loop—An EU action plan for the Circular Economy” and a number of revised legislative proposals on waste (EU-COM 2015, 614). The essence of the approach in this “Circular Economy package” becomes clear in the following quote from the 2015 communication: Circular Economy is defined as “an economy where the value of products, materials and resources is maintained in the economy for as long as possible, and the generation of waste is minimized. … to develop a low carbon, resource efficient and competitive economy” (EU-COM 2015, 614). This shows that circular economy is not a target in itself but is linked to carbon reduction, resource efficiency, as well as to industrial competitiveness. In this context, metals are the ideal candidate, because—in principle—they are “eternally” recyclable. They are not physically lost like fossil raw materials and—if recycling is taking place in state-of-the-art processes—down cycling or materials quality issues can mostly be avoided, as we will see later in this chapter. Their comprehensive recycling and reintroduction into new lifecycles enables a secured access to metals, a key building block for a competitive economy. Figure 1 shows the widely used circular economy loop from this communication. The circular economy approach of the EU Commission (EU-COM 2014, 398), Towards a circular economy A more recent important initiative is the “European Green Deal,” launched in December 2019. It lists 11 main action areas for transforming the EU’s economy for a sustainable future. Among these are four with a high relevance for materials and metals, either needed as enabler and/or becoming a key subject for circularity themselves. These are “Supplying clean, affordable and secure energy,” “Mobilizing industry for a clean and circular economy,” “Accelerating the shift to sustainable and smart mobility,” and “A zero-pollution ambition for toxic-free environment.” Linked to this is also “Mobilizing research and fostering innovation” (EU-COM 2019). The “Circular Economy Action Plan” published in March 2020 builds on the Green Deal and the preceding circular economy actions and “provides a future-oriented agenda for achieving a cleaner and more competitive Europe in co-creation with economic actors, consumers, citizens and civil society organizations.” It “presents a set of interrelated initiatives to establish a strong and coherent product policy framework that will make sustainable products, services and business models the norm and transform consumption patterns so that no waste is produced in the first place. This product policy framework will be progressively rolled out, while key product value chains will be addressed as a matter of priority. Further measures will be put in place to reduce waste and ensure that the EU has a well-functioning internal market for high quality secondary raw materials.” This new Circular Economy Action Plan addresses specifically electronics and ICT as well as batteries and vehicles as key product value chains (EU-COM 2020a, 98). From these communications, it becomes evident that the Circular Economy will play a key role to achieve the climate goals for 2050. This is also referred to in the “Fit for 55” communication from July 2021 (EU-COM 2021, 550). It is crucial to understand that circular economy means more than recycling, it is a conceptual approach on how to develop, design, distribute, use, repair, reuse, and finally recycle products (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Sun, McKinsey 2015). While effective product recycling is a key measure to increase and secure the supply of raw materials, there are additional important measures which impact the demand side. These so-called “inner loops” of the circular economy comprise better utilization rates of products, reuse, repair, refurbishment, and remanufacturing; they all contribute to extend the lifetime and/or utilization of products and hence delay the demand for new raw materials. In this context, an appropriate product design (e.g., modular devices) is crucial to support repair, refurbishment, and remanufacturing. Such products usually can also be recycled (disassembled) easier. For example, if a battery in a tablet computer or smart phone is removable, this facilitates both the repair by exchanging a defect battery and the battery dismantling at end-of-life of the device as prerequisite for high-quality recycling (see below). However, ultimately reuse must lead into-high quality recycling. Exporting old products to regions where a subsequent high-quality recycling is rather unlikely to happen creates the so-called “reuse paradox” as it in fact extends the product lifetime but decreases resource efficiency by failing to finally close the material loop. Hence, in this contribution, we will focus on the “outer loop,” i.e., the recycling of metals as the final step in the circular economy, which in an ideal case has been delayed by lifetime extension via successful measures for the “inner loops.” Industry can make use of circular strategies and appropriate business models to mitigate supply risk for (critical) raw materials (Tercero Espinoza et al. 2020; Cimprich et al. 2022). The level of recycling and circularity differs quite a lot, depending on products and metals taken into focus. The UNEP report from 2011 on “Metal Recycling” (UNEP 2011) gives an overview on the share of secondary raw materials in the global metal production (so called “Recycling input rate”) (Fig. 2). However, the numbers in this graphic just partly indicate the recycling effectiveness as also dynamic effects such as market growth have a big impact. In case of a rapid demand increase for a metal due to emerging product use even at 100% recycling, the secondary supply will not be able to meet the new demand (e.g., Co or Li in rechargeable batteries). Secondary raw materials in metal production (UNEP 2011) Especially in comparison with the recycling rates of metals from EoL products (Fig. 3), major differences get visible. Only these “EoL recycling rates” are a useful circularity indicator, i.e., how well specific metal loops are physically closed. They indicated which share of a metal originally placed on the market within certain products finally is recycled from these products. Recycling rates of metals from End of Life products (UNEP 2011) While some production residues are recycled already effectively in some stages along the production chain, there is still a way to go for others. The higher the value of the constituents and the lower the complexity of a specific residue, the more of that material will be recirculated, preferably if this can be accomplished in a closed production loop. Major avoidable problems appear, when different residual streams from different production steps within one plant are mixed. While producers care thoroughly for their precursors and products, they partly still do not pay sufficient attention to those side streams. Classical examples are downgrading of aluminum scrap by a common collection of different alloys, used in one product. A separation afterwards is possible but at higher efforts. Even more critical is the mixing of residues from different sputtering or galvanization processes. In some cases, mixing of specific material streams also can lead to a higher recycling potential if this improves the overall thermodynamic environment of the process. An optimization can be reached by a better understanding of the overall chain and easily applicable information tools, supplying all essential information at one sight. Such developments are fostered by what is called digitized circular economy. New developments on “Recycling 4.0” offer opportunities to transfer “Industry 4.0” approaches onto the field of recycling (Lawrenz et al. 2021). Certainly more complex are the challenges when dealing with EoL products. While recycling rates for some classical commodities are quite high (Fig. 3), many critical metals are lost almost completely yet. This is especially true for those elements, used as very low concentrated “spice metals” with respect to the overall composition of a product. Typical examples would be tantalum in capacitors of electronic equipment or indium in LCD panels. While the value of precious metals like gold or platinum and the content in products compared to natural ores are very high, their recovery rates even from EoL products reach higher, though partly still not satisfying levels. Major attention has been put therefore over the last years on critical metals, essential for high-tech products but with limited markets. An efficient and economical viable recovery and recycling of these metals is a major technological challenge. This challenge can be met by complex treatment chains comprising modern pre-sorting and robotic-based dismantling steps followed by multistage mechanical, thermal/metallurgical, and chemical treatment steps in multi-metal recovery processes. To push that further, reliable research strategies and research funding, safeguarding of investments on new technologies by reliable political economic setting, and a strengthened societal understanding are necessary. So where do we stand today? Let us have a closer look to Germany. A set of papers has been published between December 2020 and June 2021 dealing with the situation, the challenges, and necessary next steps. A very good overview and the state of the art is given in a paper, published by nine leading associations in the field of waste management and recycling in Germany in 2020 (Statusbericht Kreislaufwirtschaft 2020). It can be seen that approximately 45% of the feed for steel production is coming from scrap in German steel plants. Aluminum production is already based on scrap for about 57% and copper production for around 41% (data from 2015 to 2016). Focusing on future challenges and measures to be taken, the “CEID Circular Economy Initiative Deutschland” sketches out a Circular Economy Roadmap for Germany (CEID 2021). Specific parts have been dedicated to packaging and batteries. The latter ones are of superior importance for the recycling of several important metals like cobalt, nickel, and lithium. Beyond specific questions on process chains, major attention has to be paid on new business models for circularity. Finally GERRI, the German Research Platform on Raw Materials recently published a position paper on responsible raw materials supply, addressing effects on climate change as well (GERRI 2021). Summing up, there is still significant potential to improve circularity and recycling of most metals. But it needs to be understood that “100%” recycling will not be possible. Some metal losses will be inevitable as there are limits of metal recycling due to a dissipative use in some applications and technical/thermodynamic constraints especially in the case of multi-metal mixes. The following parts of this chapter will provide a closer view on opportunities and limits of metal recycling.",4

However, it is clear that the potential resources represented by the millions of tonnes of waste generated by human activities are not necessarily exploitable under current technical and economic conditions. In mining, the distinction between “resource” and “reserve” is fundamental. If these millions of tonnes of waste can be considered as a resource, they are far to be considered as reserves. A reserve is an identified mineral concentration (a deposit, if it has been located) that is economically, socially and environmentally exploitable. Therefore, great caution should be exercised when comparing a metal demand with the potential amount of such a metal in urban mines. By analogy with the mine, the first requirement is a perfect knowledge of the waste deposits. Then viable recycling processes will have to be developed, taking into account the specificity of their geographical dispersion and the evolving composition of the objects to be recycled. The implementation of sustainable long-term and profitable waste management and reuse solutions is therefore based on (i) the ability to properly sample and characterise the potential waste deposits (in quantity and quality) (ii) and the ability to collect high volume of waste over a long enough period to justify the Capex and Opex of a recycling plant. In spite of numerous works of the producer responsibility organisations and other actors of the recycling sector involved in the recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (ADEME 2018), sampling and characterisation of urban mine deposits are still problematic. The theory of Pierre Gy (1992), widely used for the sampling of fragmented materials (ores, etc.), does not directly apply to post-consumer waste. Some work is necessary to develop specific “material model” dedicated to the object category studied. Beside the challenge on urban mining, it is also important to note that to date, mining and mineral processing wastes, especially historical wastes, have been poorly sampled, with little or no characterisation. Although their location and associated risks (metals in effluents, acidic drainage) are well covered by the European directive on waste from the extractive industries (Directive 2006/21/EC), the potential for treatment as a by-product remains poorly studied. For the last 10 years, several European projects (FP7-Promine (http://promine.gtk.fi/), Era-Min ENVIREE (http://www.enviree.eu/home/), H2020-Prosum (http://www.urbanmineplatform.eu), H2020 NEMO (https://h2020-nemo.eu/), etc.) have been carried out to assess the metal content of these wastes and to propose some technical solutions. However, to date, industrial actions to treat produce value from those wastes remain opportunistic and are still mainly focused on processing mining waste containing gold. Some examples targeting other metals such as copper or cobalt are describe in a recent publication from the JRC (Blengini et al. 2019). The recovery of zinc and lead ores from post-flotation waste in Poland is currently on going in ZGH Bolesław, Poland. The issue of wastes from the manufacturing industry (scraps and production wastes) is somewhat different: whilst there may be strong similarities between these wastes, the ability to pool them to achieve the volume necessary for the development of treatment processes that would be profitable is still an issue. The main reason for that is that the confidentiality associated with the industrial operations that generate them. With regard to objects that have reached their end of life, sampling and characterisation methodologies (chemical and structural) are being developed to take their complexity into account. Whilst complex polymetallic ores (that are increasingly mined) may contain six to ten different metals, WEEE often contains more than forty. The concept of metals that are associated with the base metals, the main value carriers, is well known and partly exploited by the mining world. In the field of recycling, this is still a characterisation issue when it comes to metals, often strategic, found in low concentrations in complex matrices. The collection of data on the presence and quantification of these strategic metals in three main streams of the Urban Mine (end-of-life vehicles, WEEE and batteries) has been undertaken within the framework of the European H2020 Prosum project (http://www.urbanmineplatform.eu). However, the obstacles regarding the long-term access to detailed information from product content remain to be overcome as most of the data are difficult to collect and often confidential.",

Anthony Hodge,Magnus Ericsson,Paul Semkowich,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Mined materials play a critical role in supporting life in both developed and emerging nations. This was the case historically, is true for contemporary society, and will remain so in the future. With pursuit of the transition to a low-carbon global economy and implementation of circular economy concepts, even with greatly enhanced recycling, the demand for mined materials will only increase. The nature of the positive and negative implications of mining ripples out across space and time—for people and ecosystems. However, these implications are not fully understood and addressed. Often, the distribution of costs, risks, and benefits is skewed. A sense of unfairness has emerged that many carrying significant costs and risks—particularly the host communities and countries—are not seeing a fair level of benefit. In contrast, within the industry, there is frustration—and also a sense of unfairness—that they are not receiving recognition for the important role mining plays in society. Much effort has been put to addressing this lack of synchronicity from both within and outside the industry. These have all been accompanied by a dependence on a “trickle-down” model of change in which leadership companies develop new approaches that are then made available to the rest of the industry in the hopes that performance improvement will, in due course, trickle down or ripple out across the whole industry to bring industry-wide change. However, aspirations have not always been reflected by industry action and in spite of some improvements, a trust divide continues, something that has been labeled one of the most significant risks facing the industry. It is apparent that the following questions have not been adequately addressed: (1) what and who is the mining industry? (2) what is the appetite and capacity for change within the mining industry? and (3) what are the keys to achieving efficient and effective change across a whole complex industry like mining, not just individual companies? Comprehensive answers to these questions will take time to fully develop. Doing so must involve the full “global mining community” which includes not only the complex array of companies that lie at its core, but also the surrounding supporting, dependent, and affected interests. Without seeking, finding, and acting on the answers, the trust deficit will continue. A key element of this quest lies in examining and better understanding the culture of the global mining community as a foundation for change. This paper offers a start to addressing this challenge. Our objectives are (1) to estimate the number of companies that lie at the core of the global mining community and whose profiles contribute to understanding the mining community’s “culture”; (2) to identify some of the key additional complexities that characterize the industry and that are important to the challenge of strengthening social and environmental performance; and (3) to draw together a number of observations that lead to a call for a fresh dialog aimed at developing and implementing the needed set of integrated, collaboratively-created change strategies for strengthening environmental and social performance across the full global mining industry.",3

Hotelling (1931) and extensions such as Dasgupta and Heal (1974), Nordhaus et al. (1992), and Weitzman (1999) suggest that the production from a non-renewable resource would decline at the rate of interest as its deposits get exhausted. However, Wellmer and Hagelüken (2015), Wellmer et al. (2019), and Wellmer and Dahlheimer (2020), and others argue that supply is driven by the so called feedback control cycle of mineral supply. If there is a shortage in the market, prices will rise, and encourage investment and innovation in mining, recycling, and processing of minerals. Schwerhoff et al. (2019) provide a formal general equilibrium growth model, where a rise in resource demand incentivizes firms to invest into new extraction technology and to expand production. This paper is to my knowledge the first to examine empirically the long-run drivers of non-renewable resource production. Stuermer and Von Hagen (2012) and Stuermer (2017) find that periods of industrialization are a major driver of the demand for copper and other minerals, while a broad literature has established that such global commodity demand shocks are a major driver of various commodity prices (see, e.g., Kilian 2009; Stuermer 2018; Jacks and Stuermer 2020; Baumeister and Hamilton 2021 and others). This paper goes one step further and shows how global commodity demand shocks drive global copper production. I use a standard structural Bayesian VAR model for commodity markets to decompose global copper production into a predictable trend component and unpredictable fluctuations driven by three different types of shocks (e.g., Kilian 2009; Baumeister and Peersman 2013; Jacks and Stuermer 2020; Boer et al. 2021 and many others). We use global copper market data from 1880 to 2020. In line with the literature, I define shocks as changes in the variables that are unpredictable based on the model. I include three endogenous variables, namely the percentage change in global real GDP, the percentage change in global copper mine production, and the real price of copper. Sign restrictions based on standard economic theory allow me to distinguish three different shocks that I interpret as follows: first, a global commodity demand shock driven by the global business cycle. This type of shock captures an unexpected shift in the demand curve for all commodities, e.g., an unexpected strong increase in the consumption of all commodities due to rapid industrialization in Asia. As markets adjust, this type of shock leads to a global supply response and hence drives copper production up. Second, I define a copper supply shock as an unexpected shift in the supply curve. Examples include strikes, natural disasters that affect mines, or the earlier than expected opening of a major mine. Finally, I assume a copper-specific demand shock that shifts the demand curve due to unexpected changes in consumption that are specific to the copper market. I find that most of the rise in copper production is driven by a deterministic constant and a linear trend in the annual average growth rate of copper production. The linear trend declines, implying that the growth rate of output decreases from roughly 9% at the beginning to about 2% at the end of our sample. This result shows that mining firms base their investment decisions on predictable long-term trends unaffected by price shocks. At the same time, there are substantial medium- and long-term fluctuations in global output around the constant and the long-term trend. These fluctuations are driven by demand and supply shocks in roughly similar proportions. Global commodity demand shocks that are, for example, linked to fast industrialization and an expansion of the world economy drive up prices and lead to an increase in mine production. An unexpected expansion of the global economy by 3% causes a 10% rise in real copper prices, incentivizing a 5% increase in global copper production. This paper hence provides empirical evidence for the feedback control cycle of mineral supply. The methodology also allows to zoom-in on different sub-periods. For example, a series of subsequent negative demand shocks drove down copper production during the 1980s and early 1990s. A mix of positive demand and supply shocks led to increasing production since the late 1990s. Since 2013, copper-specific demand shocks and positive supply shocks led to strong production increases. These were interrupted by strong negative demand shocks due to the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis is subject to three major limitations. First, I find a relatively short-cycled but persistent supply response peaking in the second year after the shock. Data limitation does not allow the model to disentangle the different factors that may drive this, including expansions of existing mines, higher capacity utilization of existing mines, and the building of new mines. These factors could also play varying roles at different time horizons, offsetting each other at the aggregate. Furthermore, the model is a global model over a long sample period. Controlling for the world war periods, the long sample period is a sensible assumption as copper has mostly been traded in relatively integrated global markets, where the law of one price holds approximately. Historical data issues may still bias results. Finally, I assume no structural break or shift over the long-time horizon. It follows that estimated coefficients are presumed to be constant. Major changes are interpreted as shocks in our framework. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The “Data” section provides a description of the data. The “Econometric model” section lays out the econometric model including the identification strategy, and the “Empirical results” section presents the results. Finally, the “Conclusion” section concludes.",1

The economic upswing in the People’s Republic (PRC) was achieved through favourable production conditions, good integration into global value chains, strategic partnerships and export-oriented industrialisation controlled by state leadership. For many foreign companies, China was also attractive because of its size as a labour and consumer market. In 2018, China had a population of 1430 million (18.7% of the world’s population), compared to 510 million (6.7%) in the European Union (EU) and 330 million (4.3%) in the United States (US) (UN/WPP 2019). With increasing globalisation, many industries from Europe and the US have moved to more favourable production locations in terms of lower production costs, weaker social and environmental legislation, and proximity to growing target markets. The most important destination has been, and probably still is, China. But how are these developments and shifts reflected in the commodity markets? Have extraction and production sites for metal raw materials within the three economic powers actually been relocated? How have commodity trade flows involving China, the EU and the US changed? The aim of this study is to compare the positions of China, EU and US in the metal markets. It uses a range of economic and commodity indicators to present their respective positions in a data-driven analysis. In order to make long-term developments visible, indicators are always considered for the reference years 2002 and 2018. These two years were selected for the following reasons: (1) Some of the most recent commodity data refer to 2018, when the UK was still part of the European Union in all datasets. (2) Trade data from the Global Trade Atlas (GTA 2020) are available for the EU’s external commodity trade from 2002, which is also the year China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO). For better comparison, the EU is defined as the EU-28 in both years, which includes the UK as well as especially Eastern European countries that actually joined the economic area in 2004, 2007 and 2013. The commodities considered are the base metals aluminium, lead, copper, nickel, zinc and tin as well as iron and steel.",

Wars have been fought, especially by European nations, to secure their mineral resources supplies, partly reflecting the geographic disconnect between the location of the quarries and mines where minerals were produced, and the places of the use of the products and services based on minerals and/or metals. A cause of this geographic disconnect is geology, which controls the locations of mineral concentrations of sufficient quality to make them economically exploitable. Geology explains the geography of the global mining industry, which is quite different from the geography of smelters and metal refineries, which much depends on the availability of cheap energy and of the needed qualified workforce. Again, this geography differs from the location of the end-users of products and services depending on minerals and metals which depends on the per capita income levels and lifestyles. Table 1 illustrates the geographic disconnects of copper- and iron-dependent supply chains, these two metals being chosen due to the availability of easily accessible public statistical data. After World War II, mineral import–dependent OECD countries widely relied on the development of free, undistorted, investment and trade supposed to link suppliers and customers, all along the various steps of mineral- and metal-dependent supply chains. After World War II, believing in the virtues of private, rather than public investment, and in free trade, the governments of major global economies, especially the European Union (and its Member States) and the USA, have progressively abandoned any active role in public policy making related to minerals and metals, with the exception of stockpiling of minerals and metals considered strategic by some countries, especially in China, Japan and the USA. In the latter case, stockpiling is limited to defence needs.
 Nowadays, minerals and metals are globally considered commodities, globally traded standardised products. While market forces have so far worked well to globally supply the world economy with the minerals and metals it demands, national development strategies are distorting the markets through the development of trade barriers (Korinek, 2018) and subsidies to industrial sectors considered strategic for the development of a given country’s economy, further distorting free market principles. Over the last two decades, the global structure of the global minerals and metals industry and of many downstream industrial sectors dependent on minerals and metals, such as the photovoltaic panel, windmill or Li-ion battery industry, have undergone major changes, challenging the European technological and economic dominance over the global economy developed since the Renaissance period, a dominance that spilled over to the USA in the course of the nineteenth century. Beginning with the rapid industrial development of Japan and South Korea after World War II, Asia became the main global economic region. Within that region, China, who three decades ago (about 1990) was a very minor global economic and industrial player, is now the largest global industrial powerhouse. In 2018, it was the world largest producer of about 40 minerals and metals (Christmann, 2021; Reichl and Schatz 2021), with a share of over 50% of the global production for 15 of them, either at the mining stage or at the metallurgical/refining stage. It also is the world largest industrial hub. This unprecedented development, deeply modifying mineral and metal markets, was made possible thanks to a very continuous Chinese industrial policy, whereby ‘China’ needs to be understood as ‘(the set of) Principles and guidelines laid out by the (Chinese) Communist Party. When the State Council/President set out a vision, a number of different government departments and agencies, state-owned and private enterprises work together to achieve the same objectives’. (Farooki, 2018). China’s leadership has identified minerals and metals as strategic assets for the development of added-value downstream industries, which China considers essential to the development of its economic and social wealth, and to its political and military ambition to be the global superpower of the twenty-first century. It worked hard, and still is working, to develop vertically integrated industrial value chains, from mining to the final product in economic sectors the Communist Party considers as vital for its future development. This includes aeronautics, defence, electromobility, information and communication technologies, photovoltaics and windmill and all the technologies and innovations required to be an undisputed world leader in these sectors of major importance to the global economy. This ambition and all the related developments were initiated by China’s leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979 with the creation of China’s first Special Economic Zones and the recognition of the strategic importance of some mineral raw materials for the further economic development of China, with the now famous Deng Xiaoping statement, made in 1992 during a tour to South China (Metafilter.com, 2014): ‘The Middle East has its oil, China has rare earth: China’s rare earth deposits account for 80 percent of identified global reserves, you can compare the status of these reserves to that of oil in the Middle East: it is of extremely important strategic significance; we must be sure to handle the rare earth issue properly and make the fullest use of our country’s advantage in rare earth resources’. This statement, and its deep strategic significance, was for many years totally overlooked by OECD governments. Rare earth–based (neodymium-iron-boron (Nd-Fe-B)) permanent magnets are so far the highest performance industrially available magnetic material, essential to many modern downstream industrial goods production, such as smartphones, electric cars, hard discs, offshore windmills, aircraft and defence systems (from aircraft to smart bombs and cruise missiles). These magnets were independently discovered by General Motors (USA) and Sumitomo Special Metals (Japan) in 1984 (Wikipedia Contributors, 2021). In the USA, manufacturing was ensured by Magnequench, a General Motors subsidiary, sold to Chinese interests in 1995, with the Indiana-based manufacturing plant closing in 2004 (St. Clair, 2006), amidst political indifference. Now, the attempt to revive a full US Nd-Fe-B permanent magnet industry, from mining to the separation of individual pure rare earth metals and then manufacturing of the magnets, is a prime US political priority, featuring high amongst the priorities of the current Biden administration, with billions of public funds invested to support the effort (Subin , 2021; The White House, 2021). After World War II, the interest of the US and European governments for mineral and metal markets and the many dependent industrial supply chains declined. Industrial policy making was considered by many governments to be best left to the private sector. The first oil shock happened in 1973 triggered some alarm in the European Union and in the USA about their dependence on raw material imports. The European Commission (European Commission, 1975) publishes a Communication to the Council COM (1975) 50 titled ‘The Community’s supplies of raw materials’ that provides an analysis and recommendations that remain widely valid today. But, despite the Commission noting that ‘the risks involved in Europe’s higher level of dependences on imports than other continents have continued to multiply’, this Communication soon faded to oblivion as mineral and metal prices were low and supply was abundant. Comparably, in the USA, President Nixon (The White House, 1974) directed ‘a further examination of the potential threat posed by foreign manipulation of the supply or price of critical non-fuel commodities’. The steady decline of average metal prices that followed the 1973 oil shock–related increase continued up to the beginning of the current millennium, with brief fly-ups in 1979, related to the Iranian Revolution, and in 1997/1998, further to the Asian financial crisis. Supplies to Western economies, during 1945–2000, were abundant as these economies represented by far the largest share of the global demand. As a consequence, political interest for mineral and metal markets was very low in OECD countries, the general belief being that demand- and supply-related issues were best left to market forces. China’s rise to the status of a mineral, metal and industrial superpower from 2000 onwards triggered concerns amongst scholars and governments, especially in Japan, the USA and Europe. Being rather poor in quality resources for some minerals and metals essential to its economy (for instance, cobalt, coking coal, copper, high-grade iron ore, lithium, manganese, lithium, tantalum), China became the world largest importer of these resources, partly further to the investment in mining projects abroad. Growing geopolitical tensions between the USA and its allies on one hand, and China on the other, with the existence of a series of geopolitical flashpoints that so far could not be addressed by benevolent negotiations, triggered a renewed political interest in mineral- and metal-related issues that in the European Union is materialised by the launch of the European Raw Materials Initiative (European Commission, 2008; Christmann, 2021) and its ongoing developments, particularly in mineral raw material–related research and innovation. The 2010 Rare Earth crisis, triggered by a Sino-Japanese incident in the disputed waters around the Senkaku Islands (Kalantzakos, 2018; Pamment and al., 2019), is a typical example how unsolved geopolitical issues can rapidly disrupt some key global mineral- and metal-dependent supply chains. Political awareness of the vulnerability of complex global supply chains started to develop in the first decade of the twenty-first century, in Europe, Japan and the USA. It is likely to attract much further attention as a consequence of the war waged on Ukraine by Russia since February 2022. Amongst the responses to growing concerns was the development of mineral and metal criticality assessments. The first contemporary English-language criticality assessment was published in the USA in 2008 (Committee on Critical Mineral Impacts on the U.S. Economy, 2008). It was followed by the European Commission who in 2010 published the first edition of its triennial assessment of raw materials critical to the EU economy (European Commission—Ad-hoc working group on defining critical raw materials, 2010). Three additional editions of the EU assessment have been published since (2014, 2017 and 2020) with the list of minerals and metals considered critical to the EU economy getting a bit longer each time.",2

The interlocking developments have impacted on global production, investment into new production capacities, global trade including transport logistics, as well as global financial stability with respect to increasing national depts, prolongation of low interest rates and rising inflation. On top of that, national infrastructure programs, the global energy transition and new mobility concepts are driving the demand for energy and mineral raw materials causing pressure to supply of the raw materials. Resilient supply chains have become a key issue for manufacturing companies to ensure a stable supply for their manufacturing processes and for governments to ensure the stable supply of essential goods to society. Our study intends to push forward a discussion to improve the resilience of supply chains by using big data analytics applied to mineral raw material markets. This study highlights the results of big data analyses applied to the mineral raw material markets, particularly in the mining sector, which stands at the beginning of many supply chains. Timely information is a key influence for performance of companies, competitiveness, sustainability, eco-friendliness and customer satisfaction. It also is a source of various types of incidents that may affect supply chains. These incidents are unforeseen or predictive, exogenous or endogenous in nature. Common to all these types is the importance to acknowledge the incidents in due time in order to devise prudent management decisions to mitigate adverse effects. The major research questions are as follows: (i) whether such big data analyses and combined alerting systems are precise enough to detect potential, globally relevant, supply shortages for individual mineral raw material markets in due time; (ii) which risk indicators are most relevant for mineral raw material markets and how they differ between these markets; and (iii) how to improve the relevance of results to better apply big data analyses to mineral raw material markets. To our knowledge, big data analyses for real-time tracking of supply risks applied to mineral raw material markets have not yet been scientifically analysed and evaluated in such detail. Commercial supply chain management tools do exist since about 10 years time, are expensive and were originally programmed to monitor the performance of specific suppliers along a companies’ supply chain. For this study, we designed a global approach to specifically analyse global mineral raw material markets as a whole. The approach is rather simple: We selected the largest mines for several mineral raw material markets, calculated their share of global production and studied—a period of 1.5 years—to see how certain risk incidents disrupted important mines or supply routes and how they influenced the global market. There is a big research gap in ranking the severity of risks and how they might be classified more correctly with computer intelligence. The current approach cannot answer all these questions but can be a starting point for further research. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives a background about fundamental terminology and methodology with respect to big data analytics and tools and data sources which were used for this study. The data sources vary greatly in form and detail and may include economic, environmental, political, social, regulatory or operational risks affecting supply. Since the variety and volume of data sources are constantly increasing, big data and machine learning techniques also grow more important. Section 2 hence also gives some background about big data and machine learning techniques, which are profoundly useful for real-time tracking of incidents in mineral raw material markets. Section 3 briefly reviews the methodology of a commercial supply chain risk management tool, provided by Everstream Analytics (2021). The tool deploys big data analytics to turn data into structured information for supply chain risk analysis. The information age produces a huge amount of data that may be used for analyses once adequately processed. The aim of such information systems is to inform decision-makers in industry and politics more timely about risks affecting supply chains and in this case mineral raw materials markets. The development of such information systems incorporates various data sources and incidents affecting global production and distribution of mineral raw materials. The benefits of supplying intelligence faster and more accurately not only improve the basis for decision-making but also extend the reaction time for disruptions. Section 3 also presents an adapted approach for this study developed by the authors and outlines the structure of the analysis in detail. Section 4 presents the results of the monitoring and real-time tracking analysis implementing a big data and machine learning framework provided by the Everstream Analytics tool (former DHL Resilience360). This section also highlights examples of the techniques that are applied to set up an early warning system for raw materials markets and to put forward examples that affected these markets, most often detrimentally. For the period 2019 to 2021, 12 mineral raw materials and relevant mine sites and company headquarters were tracked for a wide range of incidents and events. Out of these 12 mineral raw materials, five were studied in more detail, and the exemplary results of the tracking analysis are presented. Section 5 discusses the results and the applicability and capability of such big data applications in relation to mineral raw material markets. We discuss many examples of detected risks incidents, which had the potential to severely affect individual supply chains, whereby others were irrelevant (natural occurrence risks, transportation risks, socio-political risks, supplier risks). We also calculate how much of global production was at risk for a single global mineral raw material market. The discussion closes with some remarks about limitations of big data analytics and sources and gives a brief outlook about further applications of big data analytics in mineral raw material markets. Section 6 presents the conclusions and points to further research.",1

Scholz,Gerald Steiner,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Mineral economics is a genuine interdisciplinary field of a special type (Kesler et al. 2015; Radetzki and Wårell 2020; Rankin 2011; Rudawsky 2013; Tilton and Guzmán 2016). It connects the natural, social, and engineering sciences. The inner science knowledge integration (i.e., between disciplines) itself is a big challenge. For instance, John Tilton noted several requirements for a mineral economist: One needs a good understanding of the constraints imposed … by existing technologies, economic considerations, governmental policies, and what is now widely recognized as the social license to operate. This requires some knowledge of geology and the earth sciences, finance, mining engineering, international relations and political science, and a host of other fields of relevance to mining and resources. In addition, … international trade, economic development, environmental economics, natural resource economics, and industrial organization … are often quite helpful as well in understanding the behavior of mineral industries and markets. (Tilton 2020, p. 274)  In this paper, we argue that, in transdisciplinary processes, such comprehensive interdisciplinary knowledge is a foundation beyond science by initiating processes of mutual learning between mineral economists and practitioners in a large range of fields from political affairs to community concerns (Scholz 2000; Scholz and Steiner 2015a). The behavior of mineral market actors, for example, depends on social values, norms, and personal priorities. We consider mining as an example. To understand how individual, cultural, and socioeconomic drivers might promote or hinder mining activities in certain ecologically and socially sensitive domains requires knowledge about the humanities as well. The role of values is essential in the opinion formation of mining projects. Usually, the proponents and opponents have different worldviews values and economic needs or pressures related to a mining project. In addition, public health concerns related to workers, communities, and the environment matter (Stephens and Ahern 2001). If societies become concerned about the inclusion of heavy metals in phosphorus (Marini et al. 2020; McLaughlin et al. 2021), new regulations may be applied to heavy-metal loads in P-fertilizers, which require additional chemical treatments that make mining in certain deposits uneconomic. Mineral resource management has become a backbone of life and civilization that is embedded in a human-made, widely mineral resource–based material environment. This requires a broader perspective that goes beyond scientific disciplinary knowledge to incorporate experiential knowledge and the wisdom of practice. The integration of science and practice knowledge leads us to transdisciplinarity. This paper aims to demonstrate why practice and science are mutually dependent in sustainable mineral economics. This paper is of hybrid form. It discusses the need for transdisciplinary processes. This is done when considering a set of known fallacies such as the scarcity fallacy (Scholz and Wellmer 2013b, 2021) and the phosphorus supply causes prices peak fallacy (Weber et al. 2014) and two fallacies which have not been discussed that far much, i.e., the only few countries have mineable phosphorus fallacy and phosphorus ore grades increased by 3.2% between 1983 and 2013, which is due to Simpson’s paradox. The paper illustrates the value of transdisciplinarity by the example of Friedrich-W. Wellmer’s disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary contributions. Transdisciplinarity differs from interdisciplinarity (see Box 1). Transdisciplinarity provides added value by relating knowledge from science and practice to address and cope with ill-defined, complex, societally relevant challenges (Klein et al., 2001; Scholz et al. 2000; Scholz and Steiner 2015a). The term emerged in Europe (Jantsch 1970; Piaget 1972) and the USA (Mahan Jr., 1970) around 1970 because of insufficiencies in the integration and coherence of disciplinary and/or inner science knowledge (mode 1 knowledge) and for utilizing or generating scientific knowledge for understanding the increasingly complex challenges of the industrial society (Gibbons et al. 1994; Nowotny et al. 2001). From a mode 1 perspective, for instance, Einstein’s basic assumptions about the general theory of relativity or principles of quantum mechanics are incompatible with the basic postulate of particle physics (because, e.g., as quantum gravitation is missing in particular physics; see Ananthaswamy 2018; Hossenfelder 2017, 2018). This results in the call for a new, integrative, and consistent form of physics. These inner physical incompatibilities became a trigger and concern in regard to Nicolescu’s conception of transdisciplinarity. He conceived spirituality not only as an integrating level of all types of knowledge but also as a moral driver for aspiring to social justice as a goal of transdisciplinary processes in the frame of sustainability, for example, in the appreciation of indigenous knowledge (Nicolescu 2011, 2014). We consider the integration of concepts and methods of different disciplines as interdisciplinarity. Game theory and hyphenated sciences (Sabelli 2006) such as biophysics or socio-psychology are interdisciplinary fields of scientific disciplines. However, the integration between sciences becomes difficult—if not impossible—when the rationales of reasoning and validation between disciplinary fields are incompatible. For example, the search for equilibria in economics cannot be merged with the evolution of technological innovations that may not be quantitatively represented, as Freeman stated earlier (1994). Therefore, the integration of certain fields of mineral economics often does not lead to interdisciplinarity but rather to multidisciplinarity, in which knowledge from different domains is constructed but fails to close with a full integration (Gordon and Tilton 2008). Transdisciplinarity, as we conceive it, aspires to mode 2, that is, the integration of epistemics from science and practice (Gibbons et al. 1994; mode 1 denotes inner science disciplinary and interdisciplinary). This particularly calls for reflecting on and mitigating the conflicts of goals, interests, values, and needs among stakeholders. Thus, mutual learning between science and practice offers consensus-building, mediation, capacity-building, and legitimization. In many cases, a facilitated multistakeholder discourse is beneficial (see Fig. 1, ii). We would add that transdisciplinarity may also take place in industrial settings. Large mining and IT companies have research departments that conduct and publish applied basic research as well as profit-driven departments at the frontline of the market whose knowledge may be synergized in strategic planning. taken from Scholz and Le 2014) Transdisciplinarity as facilitation-based mutual learning process including a targeted interdisciplinary process and a facilitated stakeholder discourse for producing socially robust orientations (SoROs) for sustainable phosphorus (P) management (figure  The public often views extractive industries as scrupulous economic agents that endanger cultural heritage, social equity, and people’s work and health due to self-interests, as well as engaging in greenwashing, corruption, and other destructive activities (Barton 2022; Rae, Rouse, & Solomon, 2002). The degree of corporate responsibility differs between companies (MMSD 2002), and their behavior and corporate social responsibility (CSR) differ significantly between nations and according to situations and opportunities related to the “interaction of survival instinct at the notion of social license to operate” (Owen and Kemp 2013, p. 13). We argue that transdisciplinarity is the appropriate means for engaging community consent and utilizing CSR to develop a social license to operate when dealing (a) with the trade-offs between stakeholder interests, environmental and social responsibility, etc., and (b) the economic/market and political constraints of companies (Agudelo et al. 2019). This also challenges mineral economics, as a scientific domain, to provide proper models for integrating external costs and social welfare functions in a specific place or in general. Transdisciplinary projects on nuclear waste management (Krutli et al. 2010), sustainable phosphorus management (Scholz et al. 2014a, b), and mobility (Loukopoulos and Scholz 2004), among others, have demonstrated that socially robust orientations (SoROs; see Box 1) are effective main outcomes. Production curve of guano phosphate on Nauru Island (Déry and Anderson 2007) and reserve-based peak phosphorus prediction by Cordell et al. (2009) Box 1 Friedrich-Wilhelm (Fred) Wellmer and transdisciplinarity — a boundary walker meets boundary objects Successfully coping with the complex, societally relevant, ill-defined, ambiguous, and frequently contested challenges of the twenty-first century calls for thorough, discipline-based interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinary processes (Scholz 2011). To achieve these, scientists must venture beyond their inner scientific comfort zones and become transdisciplinarians. During his professional life, Fred Wellmer took on different roles working at the interface of mineral science as a scientific field and as a participant in various societal interest and actor groups (Wellmer 2022). Doing so requires the ability to interact with stakeholders who have different roles and interests and who are concerned about, causing, or regulating challenges and contestation among key actors and other stakeholders in the context of often-sensitive issues related to the mineral supply chain. The costs and benefits of mining may be viewed as boundary objects. The value assigned to the external costs of mining in the frame of sustainability, as part of the total operating costs, is an issue that asks a boundary walker “to translate across culturally defined boundaries, for example, between communities of knowledge or practice” (Fox 2011, p. 70). Fred Wellmer has successfully done so by taking on these different roles.  After earning a PhD in geology, Wellmer began his career as an exploration geologist with a mining background working for the Metallgesellschaft, the largest German company in this domain at that time. One of his assignments was the search for non-ferrous metal deposits in Canada, applying geological, geophysical, and geochemical methods. In addition to his practical exploratory work with colleagues from public research institutions, he initiated the development of geochemical tools to discover subtle halos and gradients to ore in situations where geophysical signals are masked (Schoell and Wellmer 1981; Wellmer et al. 1999).  Other subjects of his work include the physical exploration of the Western Australian Callion gold deposit (Glasson et al. 1988) and the zinc–lead–copper deposits of the Toqui District in Chile (Wellmer et al. 1983). Later, however, Wellmer moved from exploration to geo-economic analysis. One analysis involved the (economic and, later, sustainable) evaluation of exploratory activities (Wellmer, Dahlheimer, & Wagner, 2008; Wellmer and Drobe 2018), particularly in regard to the optimal lifetime of a potential deposit (Wellmer and Scholz 2018). In this context, the conception and study of feedback control cycles (including the impacts of recycling and the substitution of minerals in product development through innovation) emerged. Another was geostatistics (Wellmer 2012) and geostatistic modeling (Wellmer and Giroux 1980) in connection with discovery as the economic output of exploration (Sames and Wellmer 1981). The uncertainties in the data as well as in the knowledge necessitate an in-depth understanding of economic and financial risk management.  Wellmer exchanged his practice hat for a governmental (public agency) one when he worked at the Ministry of Economics and later as department head and president of the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR, i.e., the German federal geological survey). Given his profound interest in the scientific foundations of mineral science, economics, and politics, he became a professor at the Technical University of Berlin in 1991 in the field of Raw Materials Policy and Mineral Economics, thus acknowledging his high-profile scientific contributions to the geosciences.  One of Wellmer’s most seminal and groundbreaking contributions to ecological economics is the concept of the feedback control cycle (FeedbaCC; Wellmer and Becker-Platen 2002; see Fig. 2). The FeedbaCC is a boundary object par excellence. FeedbaCCs are always unique and specific as well as generic, but as boundary objects, they “are plastic enough to be adaptable across multiple viewpoints, yet maintain continuity of identity” (Star 1989).  The societal, global perspective, and the global responsibility perspective certainly emerged from his international experience as an exploration geologist with a mining background and his insights as the leader of the BGR in the fundamental socioeconomic, technological transition from the industrial age to the digital society, and coping with multiple disruptive environmental, social, and cultural changes in the departure from the fossil age. The particular role of geosciences and geological services and the necessity of taking a system view that focuses on the resilience of human–environment interactions and the need to change the perspective from a life on Earth to a life with Earth have been saliently demonstrated by the 1999 book Living with the  Earth: Contributions of Geological Surveys for the Services to the Public and . Sustainable Development (Wellmer and Becker-Platen 1999). Wellmer’s strong involvement in transdisciplinarity is part of this vision. The range of approaches to and definitions of science–practice collaboration is broad (Renn, 2021; Scholz 2011). We can observe an increasing differentiation between an approach in which scientists function as activists (Scholz 2020; Scholz and Wellmer 2021) promoting advocacy-based solutions and one where scientists with a real-world problem orientation serve all societal stakeholder groups that follow national institutions and human rights. In the following, we refer only to the second approach. This is because the proposed approach of transdisciplinarity much relates to agenda setting (i.e., joint problem definition), whereas later stages of monitoring, evaluating, and solution finding may allow for other forms of collaboration. Mutual learning between science and practice forms the core of transdisciplinary processes. Thus, herein, we propose to illustrate how sustainability-oriented mineral economics can assist practice in more effectively coping with misunderstandings, misconceptions, and the challenges of practice and how mineral economics is challenged to contribute to sustainable-resource management in the real world. We conclude this introduction by distinguishing between three ways that knowledge from science and practice can be integrated. The first is the functional mode of transdisciplinarity. Here, participating scientists and practitioners collaborate to better understand the complexity of a certain issue, e.g., increasing the energy efficiency of beneficiation as a step in mineral production. The knowledge that is generated helps practitioners to improve a mine’s production processes, whereas mineral scientists may better understand the interaction between certain stages and variables of the chemo-physical transformation processes in beneficiation (Steiner et al. 2015). Second, from a democratic perspective, we aim to include all key stakeholders in a balanced manner. Stakeholders are actors who are responsible for, who are concerned, or who regulate important factors such as critical social and/or economic costs. Attaining a balanced stakeholder representation from among those who are not only willing but also capable of participating in a transdisciplinary process is a significant challenge and one that may, indeed, not be possible in certain political and/or cultural settings (Arenas et al. 2020; Mielke et al. 2017). However, we do not address this problem in detail here. In general, a democratic culture that embraces principles such as “accepting the otherness of the other” and evidence-based reasoning as part of the code of conduct is necessary. Finally, we define self-referential transdisciplinarity. We speak about self-referential transdisciplinarity, if someone has acquired elaborated, mature knowledge in a field of science and of practice, and can explicitly synergize these two modes of knowledge. The idea is that individuals working in various roles and having different functions acquire different types of knowledge, rationales, and experiences. Friedrich-Wilhelm Wellmer (see Box 2), to whom the present special issue of Mineral Economics is dedicated, may be considered an example. Wellmer, professor at the Technical University of Berlin, conducted high-profile research and published papers specializing in geochemistry, geo-economic and geostatistical modeling, and raw materials and sustainability. He served as the head of the German Geological Survey from 1996 to 2002 and before that worked as chief exploration engineer of a large mining company in Canada, Australia, and other countries. Thus, he has worn different hats, and we may speak about self-referential transdisciplinarity in relation to him. Box 2 Guiding question and goals of the Global TraPs project The aim of the Global TraPs project is to engage key stakeholders through transdisciplinary mutual learning in building a human–environment, system-based understanding of the complete phosphorus supply and demand chain, identifying pools, sinks, and the underlying dynamics of flows, in order to jointly identify alternatives for use, reuse, and recycling through case study research with strategic stakeholders (see the NSSI Td pages).  Answering the guiding question, “What new knowledge, technologies, and policy options are needed to ensure that future phosphorus use is sustainable, improves food security and environmental quality, and provides benefits for the poor?” will lead to improved resource understanding and awareness, leading to sustainable P management and stewardship. The Global TraPs project aspired • To be a leading global learning forum for sustainable P use, management, and stewardship in providing an open discourse space for all stakeholders along the P supply chain in a transdisciplinary (joint, eye-level, transparent), complementary, and non-politicized arena • To define the current state of knowledge on phosphorus and its use, and what new knowledge is necessary to ensure sustainability over the whole P value chain from diverse case studies being conducted by partners in 2013 and 2014 • To define new technologies that are required in order to better process, use, and reuse phosphorus • To define the most valuable areas for policy intervention to ensure sustainable P use in the future  (Taken from the Global TraPs web page: http://www.globaltraps.ch; November 3, 2021) For self-referential transdisciplinarity, it is important for the person who practices it to know which types of knowledge belong to which backgrounds and can, thereby, be applied to which types of problems. Transdisciplinary processes are different from those generated by the triple helix model (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 1995), which describes the collaboration between industry, politics, and government. One reason is that the model has been shaped mostly by an industrial and a capitalization of knowledge perspective (Etzkowitz et al. 1998). Transdisciplinarity, by contrast and as conceived by Wellmer and the authors of this paper, is seen as a tool for sustainable development (Wellmer and Becker-Platen 2002; Wellmer and Hakelüken 2015) that focuses on a resilient social system. This includes the allocation of balanced benefits and burdens for all stakeholder groups and requires some degree of commitment to inter- and intragenerational justice (Brundtland et al. 1987; 
WSSD 2002), thereby demonstrating how normative aspects are included in any sustainable action (Scholz 2017). The structure of the paper is as follows. Part 2 reviews how questions of mineral economics first became the subject of transdisciplinary processes. With a mineral and phosphorus scarcity discussion, part 3 illustrates the central roles and functions that mineral economics may play to empower civil society and decision-makers to understand and meaningfully cope with problems such as scarcity and regulatory schemes, technology innovation, and others. In the discussion in part 4, several demands that have emerged in the course of transdisciplinary processes regarding phosphorus in relation to mineral economics are formulated.",2

Parton,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In developing countries around the world, mining can provide substantial economic opportunities that can lead to sustainable growth. However, mining continues to be contentious, as genuinely sustainable development has been shown to be dependent on far more than economic opportunities. Several notable environmental, social and economic problems have resulted from mining operations that have been poorly planned and implemented. This has led to a questioning of the potential for mining to produce sustainable outcomes. Much more these days, mining development is assessed in a multifaceted way in terms of its technical feasibility, economic opportunities, ecological impact and social equity. As a consequence of different emphases given to these various aspects, there are extremely different views of the effects of mining in developing countries. Pegg (2006) provides a useful summary by comparing the World Bank’s traditional position with that of recent empirical evidence. The positive position is sustained by the following arguments: many of the most advanced countries today became so on the basis of resource extraction; government revenue is generated for use in social development and infrastructure; because mining creates jobs, families have income opportunities that would otherwise be unavailable; such microeconomic developments create a multiplier effect leading to macroeconomic growth; technology transfer into the country is encouraged first through small-scale industries engaged by the mining companies and then generally; and downstream manufacturing industry develops as mineral resources become available. In contrast, there is a plethora of empirical analysis that suggests that this view is overly optimistic and that a number of the above linkages are questionable. Ross (2001) found that countries dependent on minerals and relying on mineral exports tend to have higher levels of inequality. Also, mining often fails to provide jobs for the poor, who are unskilled. In the case of each given country such as Papua New Guinea, empirical research is necessary to investigate whether mining has led to a reduction in poverty. Hence, a primary objective of the study was to estimate the impact of mining on poverty in the significant mining locations of Ok Tedi and Porgera. With this objective in mind, the sustainable livelihood framework (Scoones 1998) was used as the conceptual basis. This is described in the next section. The data that forms the basis of the study and a description of the case study region are presented in the following two sections. Then, the propensity score matching method is outlined. Results and discussion and then conclusions are the subjects of the final two sections of the paper.",3

An ARDL bound testing approach in Bangladesh,January 2023,Md. Mominul Islam,Al Amin Al Abbasi,Subroto Dey,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"“The possession of a sizable and diversified natural resource base is a major advantage to any country embarking on a period of rapid economic growth” Norton GinsburgFootnote 1 A more common topic of debate around the world nowadays is the allocations of natural resources. Magnetic, gravitational, electrical properties and forces, etc., are mainly the inclusion of the natural resources that secure its own existence. Resource extraction is involved with the withdrawals of resources from nature. Along with agriculture, the extractive industries form the fundamental branch of the economy. These resources extraction such as mining, oil and gas drilling, and forestry, compile a handsome amount to the economy by the procession of crude materials. In economics, the difference between the final price and the overall costs is called rent. This rent in the case of natural resources which may include coastal space or minerals is known as resource rent, along with abnormal or supernormal profit. In the real world, various barriers make it troublesome to identify and collect resource rent. Economic valuation refers to natural resource rent as “resource rents.” The difference between the total revenue generated from resource extraction and the extracting cost is known as resource rent. The total natural resources of the world GDP in 2009 were valued around 3.7%. Table 1 represents top 5 countries with Most Natural Resources below. An old proposition is that growth and sustainable population size becomes limited with natural resources being limited. Now, this has become invalid. The extent of a country’s natural resource dependency determines its natural resource intensity. Many countries’ diversified economic activities have outgrown their dependency on natural resources. This has become an important challenge to the policy makers in the developing countries. Natural resource exploitation involves the use of resources for economic growth. At times, environmental degradation accompanies negative connotations. Today, extracting fossil fuel sustains resembling 80% of the world’s energy consumption. Natural resources have a vital part in the transition of a country’s “underdevelopment” to industrial “take-off.” Negative attributes with resource abundance from scholars’ view had risen by the 1980s, which suggested natural resources abundance may result in negative outcomes within an economy. This negative outcome has emerged from the term “resource curse.” According to the IMF, a country where non-renewable natural resources dominate at least 20% of fiscal revenues or exports is resource-cursed, which expands to cover around 51 countries. More than three-quarters of exports in 25 of these nations are made up of these resources while in 20 of them, from resource-based sectors, half of the government revenues are secured. Among the largest producers of natural gas in Asia, Bangladesh ranks nineteenth, supplying 56% domestic energy demand. Nevertheless, in fulfilling demand, the country is faced with an acute energy crisis because of its vast and growing population. Crude oil and petroleum products are imported here which is under control by state-owned companies like Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation and Petro Bangla. Chevron, which is one of the international companies embedded in Bangladesh’s hydrocarbon industry, accounts for 50% natural gas production. To avoid the gas shortage problem, two LNG terminals and a gas pipeline are being developed. The gradual contribution of natural resources to GDP for Bangladesh is presented in Figure 1. World Development Indicator Database (2019) Natural resource rent of Bangladesh.  The experts always have kept an eye on the connection between resource rent and economic growth. Despite this, Bangladesh lacks adequate study regarding this issue. The Bangladesh government, for a huge requirement of energy, has set up many power stations and energy situations. As a result, the import cost declines. Not only that but also the export of these resources has played a significant role in improving the livelihoods and professions of a large number of people. The Bangladesh government has been trying to sustain the improvement. A few statistics related to import and export along with foreign remittance earnings are shown in Table 2. So far in comparison to its high population, the mineral resources found in Bangladesh are scant. Sustainable development will be unattainable if more mineral resources are not found and developed. However, without the assistance of foreign countries, it is difficult for a developing country like Bangladesh to carry out the exploration and exploitation of hidden mineral resources. This is one of the major drawbacks for Bangladesh. Until the 1980s, resource abundance generally was perceived to be advantageous, whereas in the 1990s, some influential literature reached seemingly opposite conclusions. From 1970 to 2017, the average value for natural resource rent in Bangladesh was 0.77%, being a minimum of 0.26% in 1971 and a maximum of 2.48% in 1977. In 2017, this value was 0.66%, whereas 187 countries made the world average to be 6.56%. To some extent among developing countries, natural resources may reflect their underdevelopment being relatively more prevalent. Agriculture and other economic activity based on natural resources are considered to be relatively more important in the modern sector of the economy. Notwithstanding, there also are found clear examples of some countries being rich in natural resources but have failed to sustain economic growth. It thus comes into sight that sometimes- although by no means always, the generosity of nature may turn out to be a mixed blessing. In spite of creating income, supplying foreign exchange, and providing government revenue, the net economic performance of natural resources has often been negative. This relationship has been studied by numerous researchers. Many econometric studies show that the quality of governance shapes the effect of natural resources. Inexpedient natural resources use and incompetent environmental degradation level for economic development sustenance can result negatively. Apparently, a significant negative association of natural resource and per capita GDP growth rate plots the “resource curse hypothesisFootnote 2.” Natural resources occupy a pivotal role for both the developed and developing economies. The connection between resource rent and economic growth has always been the focal point of the experts. The world is experiencing ever increasing production throughout history, which naturally also has increased the need for resource rent. However, oil and natural gas resources pose, being of finite nature, a threat to overall economic growth of the world. The study will determine the answers to the following questions mentioned:
 What is the effect and the size of impact natural resource rent places on the economic growth in Bangladesh?
 How does the domestic credit to the financial sector affect the economy? Is there a causal relationship between natural resource rent and economic growth in Bangladesh? The particular purpose of this study is finding out the influence natural resource rent has on the economy of Bangladesh. More rigorously, to evaluate the connection between natural resources and growth of Bangladesh. We put emphasis on investigating whether in Bangladesh resource rent is really a curse or not for economic growth. The particular objectives are: To inquire into the effect, natural resource rent put on the growth of Bangladesh. To measure the size of impact, resource rent places on economic growth in Bangladesh. To investigate how the domestic credit to the financial sector affects the economy. To look into if causal relationship between economic growth and natural resource rent exists in Bangladesh. The reason behind resource curse emersion and more importantly, the resolution of it has been under consideration effort for understanding. Of resource abundant countries, the problem might lie, according to one prominent theory of sustainability, in the mismanagement of the wealth or assets portfolio. Every country, to stimulate economic activity, needs an efficient and sound financial system. However, limited research on resource rented in Bangladesh has been carried out. This study, using resource rent data from 1990 to 2017 in Bangladesh, aims to provide information on the effects of natural resource rent. Our study is premised on the assumption whether the theory of resource curse hypothesis is present in Bangladesh or not. As we have mentioned earlier that Bangladesh lacks proper study regarding this issue, our study has the intention to fill up that research gap. The econometric methods involved are robust for accounting the dependence of economic growth on the relevant variables.",1

Azubuike,Susan Nakanwagi,Jaqueline Pinto,Unknown,Female,Female,Female,"The plunge in oil prices between 2018 and 2019 (US EIA 2020) and the COVID-19 pandemic induced fall in crude oil prices (Rizvi and Itani, 2021) are among the major drivers for the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Nigeria) to develop a Mining Resource Corridor (MRC). In 2020, global oil demand plunged when governments closed business operations and limited travel or imposed total economy lockdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Nakanwagi and Rukundo, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic induced a great demand shock in the oil sector, resulting in the unprecedented market and worldwide economic collapse, including in Nigeria (Ozili, 2020). This situation highlights the need for economic diversification. One way of achieving it in a mono-economy like Nigeria is by developing a MRC and upscaling access to its mineral resources. A MRC has the potential to assist Nigeria in diversifying the economy through mineral extraction, processing and transportation, infrastructural development, and possible sectoral integration and connection with other regional corridors. This could, in turn, create jobs and promote inclusive growth and development. For instance, since the mining sector is important to the country’s development objectives (MMSD, 2016), a MRC will aid the sector’s resurgence. Nigeria is endowed with various mineral resources, like gold, iron ore, coal, bitumen, baryte, lead–zinc, limestone, copper, lithium, and many other minerals and metals (Olade, 2019). These minerals provide options for economic diversification and sustainable development through a MRC. Previously, mining contributed a higher percentage of economic output before the sectorial dominance of the hydrocarbon sector in Nigeria in the 1950s and 1960s (Chete et al., 2017). Developing a Resource Corridor (RC) requires an understanding of its operation to enable a diversified economy. A RC is an order of investments and actions to leverage a significant extractive industry investment in infrastructure, goods and services, into viable economic development and diversification along a specific geographic area (Jaffrin, 2013). RCs create development corridors alongside extractive-related infrastructure by linking investments through mines, ports, rails, and roads that catalyses ancillary economic activity (Cameron and Stanley, 2017). They also exist in various types and focus on transportation, agriculture, and mining. RCs require active collaboration, coordination, and integrated planning for effective implementation (Hope and Cox, 2015). Toledano (2015) notes that RCs present opportunities to connect communities and attract economic growth and sustainable development, mainly through the collateral impact on other sectors catalysed through access to resource infrastructure. An analysis of the literature on RCs reveals that their development can result in social and environmental disruptions and community opposition when communities along the corridor routes are not engaged in the development process (Mtegha et al., 2012). They also can result in spatial exclusions, thus making it necessary to use a new mobility paradigm to avoid spatial exclusion, immobility, and uneven and conflicting mobilities in new corridor routes (Enns, 2018). Furthermore, as was the case with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, security challenges can halt the development process due to armed militia and terrorist groups (Ahmad et al., 2020). Given the difficulties highlighted, Nigeria requires a well-articulated delivery mechanism. This strategy must be drawn up and initiated through a corridor programme setting out the strategic plan and governance mechanism. Further, security apparatuses must be in place to check extremist groups’ activities, especially in the northern part of Nigeria. Community engagement is also essential to prevent conflicts that can halt the development process. There is also a need for social and environmental impact assessments to determine the corridor’s viability vis-a-vis the sustainable development agenda. The full support of government at all levels and the political will to drive the corridor’s implementation is critical to its success, including infrastructural development and anchor projects. Funding options and development assistance from donor agencies and development partners are crucial aspects of corridor establishment in Nigeria. Lessons from the successes and challenges of corridors in Mozambique, such as the Maputo Development Corridor (MDC), and the Nacala Corridor, can assist Nigeria in planning and implementing its MRC. This study chose Mozambique’s corridors because it houses some of the most developed corridors in Sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, these corridors are essential to Mozambique’s planning for various sectors and appear in its 2011–2020 Strategic Plan for the Development of the Agriculture Sector. Again, Mozambique has an established coal mining industry and a burgeoning hydrocarbon industry. This article utilises an applied research approach to examine the critical considerations and actions that Nigeria can follow in developing a MRC. The “Developing a Resource Corridor” section presents an overview of MRCs and some discussions critical to RC development. The “Nigeria’s mining sector in focus” section provides a brief background to mining in Nigeria. The “Lessons from Resource Corridors in Mozambique” section evaluates the MRCs in Mozambique and highlights lessons that Nigeria can learn from them. The “Applying the lessons to the Nigerian context” section applies those lessons to the Nigerian situation, and the “Recommendations and conclusion” section sets out key recommendations for Nigeria to actualise its MRC development.",2

Several scholars claim that export diversification, for instance, can be conducive to sustained growth by reducing the macroeconomic impact of market volatility and reduce exposure to price/production shocks associated with specific commodities (see Bleaney and Greenaway 2001; Ghosh and Ostry 1994; Koren and Tenreyro 2007). Others also argue that diversification enhances long-term growth, since it allows the utilization of multiple production factors, facilitates the introduction of new economic activities and prevents revenue volatility and external events from restricting employment opportunities (Albassam 2015; Alhowais and Al-Shihri 2010; Auty 1994; Hesse 2008). Several studies also establish a positive link between innovation and diversification, since the latter tends to stimulate competition for scarce resources and development of new products. In other words, firms in markets with little diversification, especially in economies with excessive reliance on unprocessed primary commodities with little differentiation, have little incentive to innovate as a means of sustaining their market share; see Klinger and Lederman (2009). Herzer and Nowak-Lehnmann (2006) also emphasize the additional dynamic learning-by-doing (productivity) spillovers that arise when firms specializing in different sectors establish contacts with foreign purchasers and partners over a broader range of products. Some political economy scholars also link diversification to better institutions. Economic diversification prevents the concentration of power in the hands of few actors, with multiple economic stakeholders instead demanding accountable and transparent administrations (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012; Bjorvatn et al. 2012; Dunning 2005; Olander 2019). Naturally, there can also be reverse causality running from income levels to export diversification patterns—during the early stages of economic development, low-income levels and the corresponding limitations of skills and resources can hinder the transition to more diversified export structures (Fonchamnyo and Akame 2017; Papageorgiou and Spatafora 2012). At the same time, scholars working on the developmental effects of the extractive industry have highlighted the limited export diversification often observed in mineral-dependent economies (Alsharif et al. 2017; Bahar and Santos 2018; Omgba 2014). In other words, the lack of diversification is presented within this literature as a possible transmission channel of the so-called resource curse (i.e., the tendency of mineral-rich nations to underperform in long-term economic growth). A booming mineral sector often reduces export diversification through Dutch Disease effects (inflationary pressures, exchange rate appreciation, loss of competitiveness and wage premia in the extractive sector; see Corden and Neary 1982; Harding and Venables 2016; Ross 2019; John et al. 2020). Export concentration then worsens the growth prospects of mineral-dependent economies by further exacerbating their vulnerability to external price shocks and international market volatility and discouraging foreign direct investment (van der Ploeg and Poelhekke 2009). Furthermore, excessive economic dependence on the mineral sector enhances rent-seeking and frustrates the development of a pro-development institutional framework based on accountability and transparency (Baland and Francois 2000; Deacon and Rode 2015; Tsui 2010). Sudan has also faced several of these macroeconomic and institutional challenges. Significant oil production commenced in 1999, during the presidency of Omar Al-Bashir, whose 30-year authoritarian regime started with a military coup in 1989. Oil exports grew steadily and accounted for the vast majority of total exports in the 2000s (more than 90% since the mid-2000s); see Fig. 1 and also Nour (2011) and Suliman (2016). Between 1999 and 2011, during the years when Sudan was still in control of the oil fields currently located in South Sudan, the economy grew rapidly at an average rate of 5.8%, higher than in the pre-oil extraction period beginning in the 1960s, when the growth rate was on average about 1% lower. During the same period, growth largely remained positive and stable. As the oil sector grew to dominate exports, the economy’s vulnerability to external price shocks also increased, with 2010 being the first year when the economy contracted since the early 1990s as a result of the oil price collapse in the preceding year. The secession of South Sudan in 2011 triggered a major economic shock with a loss of approximately three quarters of all known oil reserves. As a result of this, Sudan’s oil dependence decreased substantially and abruptly, and no other sector was able to compensate for the loss of oil revenues. Average growth since 2011 has been close to 2%, a third of the corresponding rate during the 1999–2011 period. This was largely attributed to the absence of policies aiming at diversifying the economy and export structure during the years of the oil boom, or attempts to revive traditional sectors that were competitive prior to the oil-boom, such as agriculture and livestock; see Suliman (2016). At the same time, Sudan has consistently scored poorly in international rankings of institutional performance, a common feature of many Sub-Saharan mineral-rich economies (Dwumfour and Ntow-Gyamfi 2018). Rampant corruption and the limited application of the rule of law may have dampened growth prospects and stifled opportunities for an alternative development model based on export diversification and private entrepreneurship. ) Sudanese oil exports in total exports (1999–2017). 2020 Source: World Development Indicators ( Our analysis contributes to the literature by empirically investigating the simultaneous interaction between oil dependence captured by the share of oil rents in GDP, export diversification, economic growth and institutional quality for Sudan. We do this with the help of a VAR model using annual data between 1960 and 2018. Compared to earlier studies, ours uses more recent data that also cover Sudan’s post-oil boom period after the cessation of South Sudan in 2011. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the literature on mineral dependence and economic diversification. The first part of Sect. 3 presents our data and methodological approach; the second half of Sect. 3 presents the results of our VAR analysis. We find that oil rents appear to have a statistically-significant and negative effect on export diversification although contemporaneously rather than in the long-term. However, in contrast to the resource curse hypotheses, we find no evidence of a statistically-significant impact of either oil dependence or export diversification on growth either in the short or long run. An extension of the VAR model including institutions (captured by a rule-of-law index) also shows no empirical support of an institutional resource curse. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes with some policy recommendations.",1
36,1,Mineral Economics,05 April 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-022-00316-4,Further investigation of the total natural resource rents and economic growth nexus in resource-abundant sub-Saharan African countries,January 2023,Gideon Minua Kwaku Ampofo,Prosper Basommi Laari,Williams Shaw,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Globally, natural resources, both renewable and nonrenewable, and ecosystem services are a part of the physical wealth of nations. Other forms of capital are derived from natural capital. They contribute towards fiscal revenue, income, and poverty reduction (OECD 2011). Sub-Saharan African nations continue to be home to a significant quantity of the world’s natural resource deposits despite centuries of mineral exploration on the continent. Although some sub-Saharan countries have been performing relatively well economically in recent years, most are still mired in abject poverty. The continent is a classic case of a wealthy beggar that mostly relies on external aid, loans, and grants for survival instead of its national wealth. Political leaders are often blamed for their rent-seeking behaviors and economic mismanagement, which accounts for the poor economic performance of the continent over the years. Other factors include political conflicts, high import dependency, relatively low level of education by citizens, unrestrained population growth rates, among others (Janda and Quarshie 2017). However, two main reasons identified by (Carmignani and Chowdhury 2010) for the stagnant growth in Africa are the curse of natural resources and the continent’s lack of significant growth drivers such as productive human capital, international trade openness, and public infrastructure. Empirical studies after pioneering works by Gelb (1988); R. M. Auty and Auty (1990); R. Auty and Warhurst (1993); J. D. Sachs and Warner (1995); and Karl (1997) support natural resource abundance does not spur economic development in most mineral-rich countries mostly mineral-rich sub-Saharan African countries. Few success stories of resources being a blessing reported, for instance, in countries such as Botswana (Stevens and Olsen 2004; McFerson 2009). A negative relationship exists between natural resource abundance and democratic regimes in Africa (Wantchekon 2004). Studies that have confirmed the resource curse hypothesis identified weak institutions, poor governance, corruption, deteriorating terms of trade, conflicts, and debt overhang as channels through which natural resources adversely affect economic growth, especially in mineral-rich African countries (Mehlum et al. 2006a; Gylfason and Zoega 2006; Papyrakis and Gerlagh 2006; Iimi 2007; Kolstad and Wiig 2008; Tsani 2013; Sovacool and Andrews 2015; Öge 2016; Kasekende et al. 2016). In their studies, Havranek et al. (2016) research established that about 40% of empirical papers reported a negative effect, 20% a positive effect, and 40% finding no effect of natural resources on economic growth. A recent meta-analysis done on 69 empirical studies by Dauvin and Guerreiro (2017) provides favorable evidence supporting the time horizon hypothesis. They show that studies focusing on long-term relationships through cointegration estimations reported a higher negative effect of natural resources on growth compared to more shortsighted methodologies. Empirical results from studies that have assessed the relationships between trade openness and economic growth are without a consensus. In their studies, Singh (2011); Keho (2017); and Khobai et al. (2018) reported that in the long run, a significant positive relationship exists between trade openness and economic growth. Similar findings were made by Rao and Jani (2009) and Sakyi (2011), who confirmed that trade openness positively affects economic growth in Fiji, Pakistan, and Ghana, respectively. According to Zahonogo (2017), up to a certain threshold, trade openness positively contributes to economic growth in sub-Saharan African countries, but beyond the threshold, growth declines in the long run. Karras (2003) examined the correlation between trade openness and economic growth between 1950 and 1992 in 56 economies. Results from the studies reveal real GDP per capita growth rate increases by 0.5%, with a 10% increase in trade openness, which confirms the positive impact of trade openness on economic growth. Furthermore, external borrowing is considered an essential resource in the finance for development in the developing countries; however, in recent years, borrowing has become a critical economic problem not only for developing countries but for the developed countries (Doğan and Bilgili 2014). Mineral resource-rich governments tend to overspend on salaries, unproductive subsidies, and over-ambitious infrastructural projects. They also underspend on critical sectors such as health, education, and other social services. Therefore, governments usually over-borrow because they have improved creditworthiness when revenues from mineral resources are high. A decline in growth rates and growing external debt levels became apparent when most sub-Saharan African countries discovered mineral resources in commercial quantities for exports and generated significant resource rents as well (Janda and Quarshie 2017). It is widely known that natural resources serve as attractive collateral to obtain loans, especially from the international market. Therefore, predictably at the time where it became evident enough that countries in the sub-Saharan region, due to their resource endowment, their governments embarked on a borrowing spree. The loans are mostly not to invest in developments but to fund political parties, elections, and other extravagant expenditures. According to Teles and Mussolini (2014), public debt could have a more significant adverse effect on economic outcomes if it affects the productivity of government spending. Koffi (2019) explored the nonlinear relationship between public debt on economic growth in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries from 1960 to 2015. The study found that public debt enhances economic growth when its level is less than 36.18 percent threshold and threshold, an increase in public debt would lower economic growth. Resource-rich African countries are usually saddled with high external indebtedness. Yet, their management of resource endowment, a logical source of debt repayment, also remains a challenge, alongside their characteristic weak institutions. Mamo (2012) assessed the impact of inflation on economic growth in 13 African countries from 1969 to 2009 using the correlation matrix, fixed effect, and panel granger causality tests. The study revealed inflation negatively affects economic growth in the study sample. In another study conducted by Eggoh and Khan (2014) for a sample of 102 countries for the period 1960–2009 using PSTR and dynamic GMM, they also reported a negative and nonlinear relationship between inflation and economic growth. In Kuwait, Saaed (2007) found a negative correlation between inflation and development, and similar findings were made by Ahmed and Mortaza (2005) in Bangladesh. Kasidi and Mwakanemela (2013) also confirmed a negative relationship between inflation and economic growth in Tanzania for the period 1990–2001 using the correlation matrix. In contrast, Mallik and Chowdhury (2001) identified a positive relationship between inflation and economic growth after assessing Four Asian countries for 1970–2000 using cointegration tests and error correction model (ECM). Pollin and Zhu (2006) also found a positive correlation between up to 18% of inflation in a study of 80 countries for the period 1961–2000 using a nonlinear regression approach. Similarly, findings of the positive relationship below the threshold level were found in the work of López-Villavicencio and Mignon (2011). They studied the nexus between inflation and economic growth in 44 countries using the GMM method. According to Muzaffar and Junankar (2014), a positive correlation exists between inflation and growth at a threshold below 13% from a study conducted using a sample of 14 countries between 1961 and 2010. Manamperi (2014) found mixed results in BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) after examining the link between inflation and economic growth from 1980 to 2012 using Johansen cointegration and ARDL. A positive relationship was identified in India and an adverse effect on others. According to Cincotta and Engelman (1997), population growth hurts renewable and nonrenewable natural resources. They, however, noted that the negative effect is higher on renewable resources than on nonrenewable natural resources. Low population growth in high-income nations is likely to create social and economic problems. In contrast, high population growth in low-income countries may slow their development (Peterson 2017). Several researchers believe economic growth in high-income countries to be relatively slow as the years go by due to population growth in these countries (Baker et al. 2005). Other studies such as Mahmood and Linden (2017) are of the view that population growth will continue to pose a challenge as more people unavoidably use more of the limited resources available on earth, thus decreasing potential long-term growth. On the other hand, human beings can provide solutions to environmental constraints that hinder development; therefore, the more the population, the higher the chances of getting a country’s economic woes solved (Boserup 1990; Simon 1990). Recent studies have, however, shown that economic growth in developing countries is negatively affected by rapid population growth (Barro and Martin 2004; J. Sachs 2008; Headey and Hodge 2009). Although most of the macroeconomic variables comprise nonlinear characteristics, however, the most significant part of the existing research on modeling the natural resource-growth nexus was performed in a linear structure that assumes a symmetric relationship, using different time series methodologies. Such linear assumptions could have been the reason for the mixed results found regarding the natural resource-growth relationship. Assuming the homogeneous panel of mineral-rich countries is considered, the natural resource endowment of each country and also its exploration capacities vary with time which therefore implies that the effect of resource rent on economic growth should be different. Furthermore, most of the standard approaches employed in previous studies, as noted, assumed that the impact of natural resources reported is constant over the period. This assumption is mainly unreliable because, in most cases, the minerals market, due to supply and demand uncertainties, experiences significant time fluctuations. That is why it is imperative to employ a methodology to deal with these nonlinearities. Using linear models might not be a suitable approach in examining the relationship between natural resource rents and economic growth, as it could offer misleading suggestions on such a relationship. Moreover, as shown in a recent study by Ampofo et al. (2020), the response of GDP per capita to a positive change of total natural resource rents (increase) could be different than the reaction to negative change (decrease). As such, in this study, we also aim to examine further the possible asymmetric relationship between total natural resource rents and economic growth for eight mineral-rich countries in Africa based on the World Bank’s Changing Wealth of Nations 2018. They are Nigeria, South Africa, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Sudan, Zambia, Botswana, and the Republic of Congo. This study, however, differs from previous studies by making the following contributions. First, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to examine the asymmetric relationship between natural resources and economic growth in the eight top natural resource-abundant countries in Africa using the NARDL model for the individual countries scenario (country-by-country). Thus, this econometric approach efficiently explains the asymmetric relationship between the variables because it incorporates short-run and long-run asymmetries. This method is an extension of the autoregressive distributed lags (ARDL) bounds testing approach (Pesaran et al. 2001) to allow for estimating asymmetric long-run and short-run coefficients. It also concurrently identifies asymmetries existing in the dynamic adjustment allowing regressors of mixed order I(0) and I(1). Second, the study incorporates public debt, inflation, and population. The choice and inclusion of these explanatory variables in our model, which extends previous nonlinear estimations, will throw more light on the transmission channels in establishing the relationship between natural resources and growth in Africa. It is also the first to empirically explore the simultaneous effect of natural resource abundance and excessive government borrowing in the study sample. We also employ Diks and Panchenko (2006) to determine the asymmetric causality direction in the relationship between natural resource wealth and growth in the study sample. Due to the limitation of small sample size and in cases, the information available for developing countries is annual. Therefore generating short time series of data, it is more appropriate to pool countries in a panel setting to overcome such limitation (Narayan and Narayan 2010). The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: the next section presents a summary of the literature review regarding natural resources and economic growth. In the “Data and methodology” section, we provide the data sources and empirical methodology of the study. The “Data analysis and findings” section presents the empirical results. Conclusion and policy implication is outlined in the “Concluding remarks and policy implications” section.",3

This has resulted in the establishment of international, national, and local regulatory institutions, policies, and laws to effectively govern the extractive societies (Darimani et al. 2013; Antabe et al. 2019; Franken and Schütte 2022). In most countries, a greater proportion of the mineral policies and laws are constructed along state ownership, control, and appropriation of these mineral resources (Ayee et al. 2011; Johnson and Ericsson 2015; Narankhuu 2018; Baddianaah et al. 2022b). In the Global South, particularly in countries such as Peru Brazil, Mongolia, Burkina Faso, and Ghana, state control of the mineral resources has worked largely in favour of large-scale mining activities (Ouoba 2017; Narankhuu 2018; Matlaba et al. 2018; Bazillier and Girard 2019; Pokorny et al. 2019; Mamani et al. 2022; Baddianaah et al. 2022a). However, artisanal and small-scale mining, which remains the oldest form of mining in developing countries, continues to receive a chunk of the local miners, and a major livelihood trajectory to the indigenous people (Ouoba 2017; Hausermann et al. 2020; Mamani et al. 2022). Following the boom in the global price for minerals and metals, particularly from the last decade onwards, coupled with unemployment hurdles, local communities have increased participation in mining activities with increased adverse environmental, health, and social implications (Antabe et al. 2017; Bazillier and Girard 2019; Mamani et al. 2022). Ghana has more than 1 million out of its approximated 31 million population directly employed in the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector and 4.5 million indirect beneficiaries (Mcquilken and Hilson 2016, 2016; Hilson 2016). Ghana’s ASM sector operates in two distinct forms: the registered small-scale miners (officially and legally captured in the Constitution) and the galamsey operators (unregistered, illegal, and criminalised by the Constitution of Ghana) (Ofosu-Mensah 2010; Tuokuu et al. 2020). Galamsey is a common word in the local dialect in Ghana, framed from the English phrase “gather or get them and sell” (Aryee et al. 2003:139; Ofosu-Mensah 2011). In Ghana, legal miners are identified by certificates (licenses) of registration that are attached to a designated mineralised area called a concession, which must not exceed 25 acres (see Afriyie et al. 2016; Obeng et al. 2019; Hausermann et al. 2020). A license to mine in a designated concession could last between 3 and 5 years (Hilson 2001). However, the galamsey operators chose to operate on a “hit and run” mode because the entire process is illegal (Tuokuu et al. 2020), and some scholars claim that the majority of illegal miners are doing so because of the bureaucratic nature and high cost involved in registering a small-scale mining enterprise in the country (Tuokuu et al. 2020; Adu-Baffour et al. 2021; Baddianaah et al. 2022b). The effect of politics, corruption, favouritism, sidestepping, and weakening of the responsible state institutions are likewise highlighted in the literature (Botchwey and Crawford 2018; Eduful et al. 2020). The majority of about 85% of the ASM operators choose to remain in the galamsey sector (Ofosu-Mensah 2010). This is largely attributed to the drawbacks associated with registering with the responsible state institutions such as the Minerals Commission and Environmental Protection Agency, and the host Metropolitan, Municipal and Districts Assemblies (MMDAs). Consequently, the unregistered ASM sector is the focus of this study. As the majority of the local miners are attracted to the illegal mining sector, the environmental and social ramifications including the destruction of forest landscapes, pollution, siltation and diversion of rivers and streams channels, school drop-out cases, armed robbery and petty theft, prostitution, and child labour skyrocketed in the country around 2016 (University of Ghana Business School [UGBS] 2017; Botchwey and Crawford 2018; Baddianaah et al. 2022b). Some studies blamed the involvement of foreigners, particularly the Chinese, and their innovative and technological drive in mechanising the ASM sector as the cause of the surge in the illegal mining’s adverse consequences in the country (Hilson et al. 2014; Botchwey and Crawford 2018; Hausermann et al. 2020). Away from the blame games, the Government of Ghana, through the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources and civil society organisations, have recently put in place measures, initiatives, commitments, and reactive strategies towards addressing the adverse ramifications of local mining activities in the country. In 2016, institutions, governmental and non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations, farmers, and media groups waged a serious protest (“war”) against galamsey in Ghana (Hilson 2017) and called for a moratorium on all ASM operations, irrespective of legality, in March 2017 (Owusu et al. 2019; Tuokuu et al. 2020; Adu-Baffour et al. 2021). In connection to this, various military groups (“Operation Vanguard” and later, “Operation Halt”) were constituted to enforce the ban and flush out all recalcitrant illegal miners (Hilson 2017; Adu-Baffour et al. 2021). In addition, the government of Ghana, under the Multi-Sectoral Integrated Mining Project, came up with a road map to restore all galamsey degraded landscapes in the country to ecologically functionable limits, committing an amount of US$100 million to the reclamation agenda (see CSIR-Forestry Research Institute of Ghana 2017). In the process, a pilot reclamation project was commenced in the Eastern Region in 2017, but could not be sustained because of the cost involved in the reclamation agenda (Baddianaah et al. 2021): vast areas of destroyed galamsey lands are recorded across local mining communities in Ghana including the Upper West Region. This paper informs a second thought of getting the local communities involved in working towards reclaiming the degraded areas under their sphere of influence. Indeed, the extraction of precious minerals is surrounded by an array of actors (state institutions and local level actors) who equally have diverse and opposing interests. Thus, in remedying the adverse implications of mining activities in local communities, it is imperative to understand the perspectives and interest of all the actors and — strike a balance through collaboration and effective participation in governing these natural resources (Suopajärvi et al. 2016; Caripis et al. 2018; Baddianaah et al. 2022b). According to Darimani et al. (2013:47), effective natural resource governance underpins not only balancing the actors conflicting interest, but “between them and nature.” Thus, addressing the various actors’ interests is a significant pathway to producing effective environmental outcomes in Ghana’s ASM landscape. In light of the above, the impetus of the paper is to investigate the extent to which the local communities evaluate and appreciate the adverse effects of ASM activities on the physical environment and the commitment to address them, and the level of collaborative engagements between them and the state institutions in reclaiming mined degraded areas. The adverse environmental effects of ASM activities are locally created (Darimani et al. 2013; Suopajärvi et al. 2016). In an attempt to resolve these effects, the dwellers must play key roles and commit to the environmental restoration agenda. However, few studies have attempted to investigate the local communities’ perspectives and commitment towards resolving the environmental ramifications caused by ASM operations in mineral-rich societies. We posit that the dearth of involvement of the local communities in mineral resources decision-making, poor quality of the regulatory institutions, and the lack of collaboration between state and local institutions contribute to the irresponsible ASM activities currently ongoing in Ghana. The study contributes to the extant literature through igniting the sense of environmentalism in local mining communities for the attainment of sustainable mining operations. The next section of the study presents empirical and theoretical literature on the effects of institutional and stakeholder engagement in the ASM sector, followed by the materials and methods, results and discussion, conclusion, and policy implications for reclaiming galamsey degraded landscapes in Ghana and related ASM dominated areas in developing countries.",

Teseletso,Tsuyoshi Adachi,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The twenty-first century has witnessed exponential resource exploitation, which aligns with the economic growth of nations; therefore, sustainable development is critically required. Resource exploitation is driven by the increasing global metal demand consumed at an average growth rate of approximately 3.2% (Van Vuuren et al. 1999; Krausmann et al. 2018). For example, copper (Cu) has high demands because of its applications in both electrical and electronic applications due to the rapid industrial growth in China. The contribution of gold (Au) was the highest in the industrial sectors, such as in jewelry (52%), investment and banks (39%), and technology (9%), thereby creating an increasing stable market (World Gold Council 2021). Mineral resources exhibit a “limit to growth” with “peaking metals”; furthermore, mining is an unsustainable practice due to its intrinsic nature (Hubbert 1956; Meadows et al. 1972; Meadows et al. 2004; Pagani and Bardi 2016; Mudd et al. 2013; Northey et al. 2014; Meinert et al. 2016). Since mineral reserves are finite, they will be exhausted with the progress in production. The limit of the ultimate recoverable resources (URR), which is the total amount of metal recovered throughout its extraction history and potential extraction of a mine project, is influenced by the degree of exploration, rate of discovery, and technological advancement to reach the predetermined cutoff grade (COG). The ore grade reflects the metal content in the ore. Currently, the global average COG is 0.49% for Cu (Mudd 2012; Henkens and Worrell 2020), 6.05% for lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) (Cox and Singer 1992), 0.3–1% for nickel (Ni) (Berger et al. 2011), and 1–4 g/t and 8–10 g/t for Au in open pits and underground mines, respectively (Calvo et al. 2016; World Gold Council 2021). Medium-grade iron (Fe) ore ranges from 30 to 40%. In addition, with the advancement of mineral extraction from high-grade ores that are economical to low-grade sub-economic ores, huge volumes of used and unused extractives composed of overburden and gangue are left over from economic business. Over time, the volumes of these accumulated ores increase against the extracted ores, and can thus, be used to measure strip ratio (SR). The strip ratio, which depicts the ratio of summation in either mine waste, surface soil, or muck to the mine ore, increases with increasing degree of mine activity, including mine depth. Open pit mines generally exhibit higher strip ratios than underground mines. This has been evidently observed in Australia (Mudd 2009, 2010). Furthermore, this has been observed at the global-scale (Crowson 2011; Calvo et al. 2016, Rötzer and Schmidt 2018), for Cu (Mudd and Weng 2012; Mudd et al. 2013; Northey et al. 2014; Koppelaar and Koppelaar 2016), Ni (Mudd and Jowitt 2014; Henkens and Worrell 2020), Pb–Zn (Mudd et al. 2017), and Au (Mudd 2007; Wellmer and Scholz 2017). Future mineral availability regarding until when could producer countries and/or regions supply these metals to consumers for various applications is a growing concern. Additionally, whether these practices will remain sustainable under constant supply is another impending question. With a view to conserve the environment, the United Nations Environmental Programme International-Resource Panel (UNEP-IRP) addressed the importance of decoupling resource use and negative environmental impacts arising from various economic activities (IRP 2016, IRP 2019) on ecosystems and social communities. Increasing metal demand for its varied applications in modern society fulfilled through increased metal production is associated with potential environmentally degrading impacts at regional and/or global scales. Furthermore, high material consumption rates are linked to low ore grades and high strip ratios, thus, raising questions regarding physical or economic sustainability, especially in developing countries with poor legislative infrastructure that is insufficient to monitor and regulate environmental vulnerability. Various studies have revealed that hidden flows created by resources can be accounted through the ore grade and strip ratio from “used” and “unused” material along their lifecycle (Bringezu et al. 2004; Wuppertal Institute 2014; Tokimatsu et al. 2017; Tokimatsu et al. 2019; Nakajima et al. 2019; Watari et al. 2019). For example, during metal mining, economically valuable ore material, commercially valueless material comprising gangue, and “unused” extracted material, such as overburden, are produced. These material remnants, thus, “degrade” into the environment. Total material requirement (TMR) is an indicator used to measure the environmental vulnerability caused by metal production. It was originally developed for economy-based material flow that reflects the physical material flow, including export and import volumes, and “hidden” and non-economic materials, such as overburden, within and outside the boundaries of an economy (OECD 2008). The physical material flows included in TMR evaluations account for in situ Earth movements during mining. In addition, metal mining activities cause the highest environmental damage in upstream areas. The degree of mineral exploitation through mining largely depends on the ore grade and strip ratio (Northey et al. 2014, Kosai and Yamasue 2019). Thus, TMR includes these mining factors during assessments. Over time, TMR increases as more gangue and overburden is produced and as the ore depletes. Metal depletion requires an understanding of the regional resource conditions, such as “how much metal is being produced?,” “where to explore?,” and “what is the temporal grade variation?” These questions provide a better understanding of the rate of technological improvement and can further highlight the need for metal substitution. Therefore, understanding the long-term trends of metals regarding the URR, grade, and the associated environmental impacts is important. Furthermore, previous studies assumed that a constant ore grade is mined for each region; however, this may underestimate URR (Crowson 2011; Northey et al. 2014). In reality, a wide distribution of ore grade is mined. The intrinsic relationship between environmental impacts and declining ore grade indicates that hidden flows of the material output exist within the system interaction (Tokimatsu et al. 2017). Therefore, in this study, we aimed to measure the environmental vulnerability through the Au, Cu Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn TMRs to delineate the environmental impacts of mining on the environment. These metals are selected because Au has a very long production history dating to as early as 4000 B.C; thus, its ore grades have fallen over the centuries with huge extraction material quantities removed from the ground to access the precious metal. For base metals Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn, these metals coexist in the environments in which they are found in. Their physiochemical properties are important for their applications which has significantly grown over the last century. Fe is a bulk commodity with huge production quantities. The main purpose for iron is for industrial purpose which is currently fundamental in the present human society to improve the human development. Finally, this study investigated the future quantities of resource supply (scarcity) that will be available for future demands.",3

Coal consumption every year accounts for about 70% of the world’s total energy consumption. According to the latest report by International Energy Agency in 2017, titled “World energy outlook for 2040,” the direction of new investments in the world moves toward producing energy from renewable sources using government incentives. However, fossil fuels remain the primary sources of energy production and supply globally for at least the next three decades. According to this report, it is estimated that the amount of electricity production from coal by 2040 will grow by 10% compared to 2015. This forecast prediction suggests that the world is still investing in energy production from coal resources, and this will continue for many years to come. In addition, more than 74% of the world’s steel production is done by kiln and converter methods (Bachmeier and Griffin 2006). Due to the application of coal in the production of metals such as steel, aluminum, and copper, its price plays an essential role in many metal transactions other than directly related industries. Thus, the coal price plays a massive role in the market of these metals (Bai et al. 2018). Since price is a non-deterministic variable, the researchers have proposed numerous methods to estimate it (Cox et al. 1979). The research and forecast of the future trend of coal prices seem to be particularly important, which can help companies estimate their costs, make judgments, and lay a foundation for the stable development of the coal market. Therefore, evaluating the price of coal plays a significant role for many industries, such as steelmaking and metals related to coal. The purpose of this article is to create a new method for predicting coal prices more accurately to ensure investor confidence in the market. The better performance of coal price forecasting is beneficial for all of the participants in the coal market. An accurate forecasting model for the future coal price fluctuations provides critical information and early warning for government and policymakers to provide a stable supply of energy which is considered the main concern for policymakers. In 1999, Pindyck introduced a single-variable model for estimating coal, oil, and gas prices, using a random process. In 2008, Fan et al. proposed a general adaptive algorithm based on the genetic algorithm; their model predicted crude oil prices based on the simulated historical data. Yu-zhao et al. (2009) proposed particle swarm optimization (PSO) and RBF neural network-based approximations for the price of coal and electricity. The PSO algorithm optimized the RBS parameters and the neural network’s weights in their model. This method was validated using a simulation program developed in the MATLAB environment, and the results showed that the convergence speed and prediction accuracy have improved with satisfaction. García-Martos et al. (2013) estimated energy price by constructing a multivariable model and comparing it with the single-variable model. Mahdiani and Khamehchi (2016) introduced a modified neural network model, based on a genetics algorithm, for the prediction of crude oil prices, where the variables are optimized along the model length, the advantage of which is that the optimal solution of the model is obtained using only a small number of input data. Han et al. (2019) predicted carbon price in China’s Shenzhen market using the role of constant frequency environmental factors. They used a combined sampling regression model and neural network backpropagation (BS-MIDAS) to provide a weekly prediction of the carbon price. In addition to daily energy, economic conditions, and climatic conditions, environmental factors were added to the prediction indicators. The experimental results showed that carbon prices are more sensitive to temperature and Air Quality Index (AQI) than other factors. Matyjaszek et al. (2019) estimated coal price using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and ROBUST models, along with generalized regression neural network (GRNN), MLFN, and traditional time series model. This article analyzes two types of time series, namely full-time time series and transgenic time series. Using the full-time time series model, the GRNN model provides better results than the MLFN and ARIMA models, etc. However, using the transgenic time series model, the ARIMA model provided better results. Jiang et al. (2018) applied the ARIMA method to predict the price and consumption ratio of China’s coal consumption by 2030; experimental results show that the average annual rate of coal consumption and investment will experience a reduction between 2016 and 2030, except for the coal prices which fluctuated during the period. Syamni et al. (2018) evaluated the stock price trends of coal companies in Indonesia using the Olson, Almant Modification, Grover Springate, and Zmijewski models, which suggested that the two Ohlson and Almant modification models were identified as these models proved to be most effective in predicting the stock prices of coal companies in Indonesia. State-of-the-art methods for time series forecasting are commonly based on a combination of univariate forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA or Holt-Winters) and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest and classic neural networks). In particular, the traditional neural networks such as RBF networks, MLPs, and traditional versions of recurrent neural networks RNNs are limited to one hidden layer network, making such models poor to forecast multistep-ahead accurately (Lago et al. 2018). Renner and Wellmer (2019) examined the drivers of fluctuations in the energy market and the effects of exposure to producing countries. Alameer et al. (2019) predicted the monthly price of coal in several stages, using a hybrid deep learning model. The LSTM-DNN model combines short-term memory (LSTM) and deep neural network (DNN). The LSTM-DNN model results are compared to the multivariable Perceptron neural networks (MLP) and support vector machines (SVM). Rademeyer et al. (2020) examined the implications of coal prices for the South African domestic market. They had well demonstrated the distribution of multi-product coal production, pricing for domestic markets through mathematical optimization. In 2021, Liu, with coal price as the research object, selects six factors that affect coal prices and uses deep learning technology to propose an LSTM neural network model with an improved Adam optimizer to forecast it. Liao et al. (2021) proposed a data-driven medium and short-term electricity coal price forecasting method based on feature transformation and LSTM. The feature transformation method of different time scale granularity information was presented to fully excavate the electricity coal price law contained in the massive data. The feature transformation correlation analysis method was used to determine the hysteresis of different influencing feature sequences based on the LSTM neural network. The model’s information redundancy was optimized by the primary analytic method, and on this basis, a deep learning model was formed based on feature trends. In this paper, the neural network method is used to evaluate the ability to predict the future price of coal. RBF can be applied to a wide range of time series prediction problems with a high degree of accuracy. In fact, by using time series, we will be able to achieve autocorrelation between data. Also, based on the basic principles and concepts of neural networks with radial and temporal basis function (RBF), a model of the combination of these two methods is proposed to predict the time series of coal prices. In the method used in this article, by estimating coal price, it is possible to reduce the risk in the coal market and show a broader view of the coal market in the future.",8

Phosphate rock was first produced commercially in the UK in 1847 (Cathcart, 1980), and mining was almost certainly done by hand at the time. Mining of phosphate in the USA began in 1867 in South Carolina, where phosphate deposits were extracted manually and later by dredges (Shepard, 1880). According to Van Kauwenbergh (2010), phosphate rocks in Africa countries especially those in Algeria and Tunisia were discovered in the late nineteenth century, whereas phosphate rock production began in Morocco, the country with the world’s greatest phosphate reserves, in the early and mid-twentieth centuries. As US Geological Survey Data (various years) revealed, between the 1920s and 1950s, at least five countries extracted phosphate, and major companies were mainly operating in two nations – USA and Tunisia – which were jointly accounting for nearly 70% of the total production; however, in the latter half of the twentieth century, the geography of the industry has changed, and currently, firms based in China, Morocco, and Russia have emerged and have become major producers in the market. The global market rivalry is intense and relatively integrated, with a small number of prominent competitors taking a significant portion of the total revenue in 2020. Annual global production in 2020 reached to around 223 million tons, while estimated reserves stood at 71 billion tons (US Geological Survey, 2020). Using modern technologies, this figure indicates that the reserve may be drained in roughly 318 years.Footnote 1 The world’s top producers in 2020 – many of them are government ownedFootnote 2 – include China (Yuntianhua Group), Morocco (Office Cherifien de Phosphate), the USA (Mosaic), and Russia (EuroChem). Figure 1 depicts the global phosphate output percentage shares by country in 2020. China contributed to 40.4%, followed by Morocco,Footnote 3 the USA, Russia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil which accounted for 16.6%, 10.8%, 5.8%, 4.1%, 2.9%, and 2.5%, respectively. Major phosphate producers and their market share in 2020 As illustrated in Fig. 2, the most rapid expansion in phosphate consumption occurs from 1961 to 1988, when annual growth averaged more than 4.4 percent. Between 1988 and 1993, rock phosphate consumption dropped from 37.6 to 28.9 million tons, respectively; most likely was a consequence of political factors such as the collapse of the Soviet Union and decreased fertilizer demand from Western Europe and North AmericaFootnote 4 (Cordell et al., 2009). Nevertheless, consumption started to recover in the late 1990s and has continued to increase in the 2000s until it reached 37.7 million tons in 2007; it had then fallen to 32.8 million tons in 2008 due to the global financial crisis and continued rising after that due to rising economies such as China and India till 2019, when it hit 45.6 million tons. Phosphate consumption (in \({\mathrm{P}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{5}\)) from 1961 to 2018 The significance of this study arises from the fact that phosphate is regarded as a criticalFootnote 5 and crucial commodity on a global scale. Indeed, almost 90% of all phosphate mined is used in the manufacturing of fertilizers (Tirado & Allsopp, 2012). An analysis of 362 seasons of crop output conducted by Stewart et al. (2005) found that commercial fertilizer inputs are responsible for at least 40 to 60% of crop yield. If global population is anticipated to reach over 9.7 billion in 2050 (United Nations, 2019), it is critical to ensure that the fertilizers required to improve global food production are available. The Tomlinson (2013) study argued that in order to ensure that the world’s population will be fed by the year 2050, food output needs to expand by 70 to 100%, and hence, most experts agree that, with genetics, biotechnology, and other inputs, the most important factor to consider is how to ensure a sufficient supply of phosphate fertilizer in order to boost harvest yields in the future. The examination of the key elements influencing the phosphate market in the past has aroused the interest of an increasing number of analysts. Al Rawashdeh and Maxwell presented a paper in 2011 in which they explored in greater details the major factors affecting phosphate demand and supply. Several authors like Geissler et al. (2019), Mew et al. (2018), Manning (2015), and Horn and Sartorius (2009) have also made significant contributions to the literature. Although phosphate is relatively a cheap product with each person in the world consuming around $US 6 of rock phosphate every year (Scholz et al., 2013), many impoverished farmers around the world are unable to enter the phosphate fertilizer market due to low purchasing power or insufficient funding. Indeed, many empirical studies of demand functions focus on the dynamic implications of price, income, or technology changes over time in order to derive demand elasticities that measure the degree to which individuals and consumers change their demand in response to price, income, or technology changes. For example, as Ridder et al. (2012) asserted, the sudden price surge in 2007 weakened the purchasing power of poor farmers, limiting their access to fertilizers; this resulted in a decrease in overall demand for phosphate fertilizers from 37.8 to 32.8 million tons (see Fig. 2). The consequences of economic circumstances such as declining income in a recession or substantial rises in energy or fertilizer costs can be predicted using elasticity estimates generated with data acquired under normal market conditions. Given, for example, the income elasticity of demand, one can forecast the amount of consumption growth that will occur in response to an increase in income. For instance, if the income elasticity is 0.3, which is inelastic, and income increases by 1%, consumption should increase by less than 1% (~ 0.3%). This suggests that if baseline consumption was 1000 units, a 1% rise in income would likely raise consumption to 1003 units (1000 + 1000*0.3%). Production mainly depends on consumer demand, and care should be taken to adjust it to the extent of demand. Hence, elasticity is a concept which enables all producers to take correct decision regarding the quantum of output based on the demand, a knowledge of the elasticity of demand helps the governments and market players in formulating their plans and policies in cases of price, income, and technology changes. Upon this brief introduction, this paper attempts to answer the question “How would global phosphate demand be affected by changes in its own price, cross price, income, and other factors that may affect it?” The goal of this study is to identify the major determinants of phosphate demand; to estimate price, income, and cross elasticities; and to forecast future phosphate consumption. To determine short- and long-run elasticities, the study typically employs a comprehensive econometric model. The first section has already introduced the paper. The second section provides a literature review on the various factors affecting fertilizers demand in general and discusses previous studies that have estimated demand elasticities related to different types of fertilizers. The third section discusses the demand function and specifies the main variables used in our model. It also examines the major tests (e.g., stationarity, cointegration, lag selection and weak exogeneity) required in order to reach to an appropriate estimation of the model. In section four, with reference to the error correction model (ECM), long- and short-run elasticities results have been discussed, and a forecasting model has been utilized to project phosphate consumption and prices for the next decade. The final section concludes the paper with some comments. Studies on fertilizer demand, such as those by Chianu and Tsujii (2004), Croppenstedt and Demeke (1996), Zhou et al. (2010), and Maganga et al. (2011) have revealed that the primary causes of low fertilizer demand are inadequate revenues and low production levels, as well as lack of access to financial resources. Randive et al. (2021) reported that the limited geological resources of raw material for the manufacture of fertilizers and market fluctuations of fertilizer minerals initiate wide-reaching competition and raise challenge of food security. Previous research papers, such as those conducted by Hsu (1972), analyzed the impact of prices on the demand for fertilizers in Taiwan and concluded that fertilizer prices have a big impact on nitrogen demand, and less impact on phosphate and potash demand. Quddus et al. (2008) argued that while demand for nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers in Pakistan is inelastic, demand for potash fertilizer is elastic (Quddus et al, 2008). Furthermore, they found that the time variable employed to quantify the progress in technology had a large significant positive effect on fertilizer consumption. Rayner and Cooper (1994) employed appropriate error correction models to come to the conclusion that nitrogen’s short- and long-run price elasticities were both quite low. Al Rawashdeh et al. (2016) developed an econometric model to evaluate short- and long-term demand elasticities for potash fertilizers. They discovered that potash demand is price, income, and cross price inelastic in both short and long term. The study by Zhou et al. (2010) demonstrated that fertilizer’s use in Northern China is heavily influenced by crop output and overall revenues. Their findings also showed that the area of the land, soil fertility, and the cost of delivery all had an inverse relationship with the amount of fertilizer used. According to Likoya and Mangisoni (2006), who examined the factors that drive the demand for fertilizers in Malawi, the main factors affecting demand in their study are fertilizers prices, loans access, food production index, and farm size. As Williamson (2010) observed, most industrialized countries’ fertilizer consumption is price inelastic, but recently, farmers’ response to rising fertilizer prices has become more sensitive. Griliches (1958) and Gunjal et al. (1980) both reported that the demand for fertilizers for grain is more responsive to price than cash crops. On the other hand, the influence of income on the cash crop model is large, while that of wheat and soybean models is negligible. Socioeconomic factors, market access, information, and agricultural characteristics (e.g., soil fertility; irrigation) can influence farmers’ use of inorganic fertilizers (Shrestha et al., 2013; Fishman et al., 2016; Kpadonou et al., 2019; Ward et al., 2019). A study by Acheampong and Dicks (2012) concluded that increased global demand for fertilizers is the result of global population and general economic growth. Enk et al. (2011) and Steiner et al. (2019) have noted that the main drivers of phosphate demand include population growth, increased food demand, increasing economic wealth, modifications in dietary habits, and increasing need for biofuels. Nygards and Svenungsson (2020) estimated phosphate fertilizer demand function in Sweden and found that, by including total harvest area variable or arable land variable in their econometric model, both would have a significant statistical positive impact on fertilizers consumption. Parthasarathy (1994) claimed that rainfall distribution over time is a fundamental predictor of fertilizer usage, and the greater the threat of adverse weather, the more farmers are reluctant to use fertilizers even if the cost–benefit analysis is favorable. Gruyter (2020) discovered that fertilizer use in Rwanda is dependent on various parameters relating to market access, financial liquidity, household assets, human resources, and extension services. Tilton (1992) published a seminal work in which he listed the most critical parameters influencing minerals demand. The general form of the demand function is presented in Eq. 1. Demanded quantity of phosphate = f (real price of phosphate, real prices of complementary/substitute products, real income, technological progress, other variables) (1). A mineral’s own price is usually an important determinant of its demand, with demand tending to fall as price rises. Recall that, in general, if the price of a product increases, buyers will purchase less of it, all other factors being equal. In other words, if the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases; if the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases. This is the law of demand; it denotes that if the price of a product rises, there will be a leftward movement along its demand curve, and vice versa. Because there are no alternatives or substitutes for phosphate in its predominant usage (US Geological Survey, 2021), this expression in Eq. 1 does not account for any substitute minerals’ price. In addition, nitrogen and potash fertilizers, which are also essential for plant growth, are complementary products. According to al Rawashdeh and Maxwell (2014), changes in income are directly tied to mineral demand. Mineral consumption tends to rise over long periods as real incomes rise. Mineral demandFootnote 6 moves more closely with the business cycle over shorter time periods; it is high during economic expansions but low during recessions. Historical data on phosphate prices, the price of its complementary products (e.g., potash fertilizers), and world income are widely accessible. In order to catch the technology variable, crop yield (cereal yield per hectare), which measures the quantity of agricultural output produced per unit of land area, can be used. Many scientific investigations have proven the positive influence of phosphate fertilizer applications on agriculture quality and yields. Tilman et al. (2011) evaluated how breakthroughs in technology could boost agricultural yields and then utilized his estimates to forecast demand for crops. Gordon (1998) note that the Green Revolution, which they claimed was connected with a more sophisticated application of fertilizers, was substantially responsible for the ability of formerly less fertile land to support increased food production. Pei and Tilton (1999) and Stuermer (2014) have both employed time variables instead to gauge the effects of changing technology on mineral demand, but as Scot (1964) reported, a time variable may imply that a continuous function represents a change in technology, and it is doubtful that development of technology follows a continuous function; therefore, the use of a time variable to represent change in technology is not wholly satisfactory. Dummy variables can be included in the empirical analysis to reflect big shocks in the phosphate market, such as the break up of Soviet Union (USSR) in 1989 to1990 or the last world economic crisis of 2007–2008. Other variables like world population have not been included into our model; currently, the global population is above 7 billion, compared to the 2.5 billion people in 1950. Recent estimates by the United Nations (2019) indicate that it will grow to 9.7 billion by the year 2050. There is a strong tendency for real GDP and populationFootnote 7 to be closely related (Mankiw (2010), Sibe et al. (2016). This presents a problem with setting up an empirical model that has both variables present; therefore, (GDP/population (GDP per capita)) may be a more realistic alternative. Total calorie food intake can also be measured as a proxy for food consumption (Matthews & Hammond, 1999), because as food consumption increases, demand for phosphate fertilizers increases. However, the World Health Organization (2014) and Fukase and Martin (2020) discovered substantial levels of collinearity between total calorie food intake and world real GDP estimations. Based on the findings of Tilman et al. (2011), an effective method for forecasting global crop demand entails using real per capita income as a proxy without taking into account other variables such as population or agricultural calorie intake.",4

Therefore, knowing the factors that influence the behavior of recycling activity has been an important part in building secondary market models. It also involves understanding the classification of copper scrap according to its generation, treatment cost, and impurities. There are two types of copper scrap: new scrap,Footnote 1 which is often generated as discards in manufacturing processes and is used directly without further refining, and old scrap, which is generated once the copper-containing products have finished their useful life (Tilton and Guzmán 2016). Thereafter, old scrap is either stored, finally disposed, or further refined. This paper analyzes the supply of refined old scrap which has been refined and which reenters copper’s use cycle, and it is referred as secondary refined copper (SRC) supply throughout this paper. The study of SRC supply has become even more important due to numerous efforts to estimate the carbon footprint that copper production would have in the long and very long term (Ayres et al. 2013; Giurco and Petrie 2007) . This is because copper’s carbon footprint from primary sources is much higher than its carbon footprint from secondary sources (Kuckshinrichs et al., 2007). Therefore, numerous future copper supply forecasts place high expectations on the gradual replacement of mine, or primary copper with secondary copper (Ali et al. 2017; Northey et al. 2014), based on a circular economy (Schipper et al., 2018). Understanding the factors that influence SRC supply should aid the development and implementation of corporate, government, and international multilateral organization policies (Tilton 1999). These actors seek to use the explanatory power of models to predict short- and long-run behavior of the dependent variable under different scenarios. The study of SRC supply and its interaction with explanatory market variables have been expressed through the supply function, which estimates the quantity of SRC supplied according to a set of causal or determining variables (Tilton and Guzmán 2016). What variables must be considered to explain the SRC supply function? The answer depends on the time frame of the analysis, the availability of information, and considerable judgment from the analyst. There is no single list of appropriate variables, but the following are often considered to be relevant, especially over the long run: copper scrap price, scrap availability, input costs, technological change, government activities, market structure, strikes, and other disturbances (Tilton and Guzmán 2016). On recent decades, it has been possible to find various studies of the SRC supply estimation, featuring Fischer et al. (1972), Slade (1980), Tan (1987), Vial (1988), Valencia (2005), Gómez et al. (2007), and Fu et al. (2017), all of which created different functions intended to explain the behavior of the dependent variable. This research aims to establish a reliable procedure to obtain a robust SRC supply function in time, which means that it is stable, unbiased, and with asymptotic convergence in time. It is important to emphasize that when the robustness of the parameter is indicated, it does not necessarily mean that they are invariable over time; instead, it is sought that the estimated parameters show a low variability when modifying the number of variables and/or observations included in the estimation. Here, the robustness of the model is understood to occur when there is a high probability that the estimated parameter \((\widehat{\beta })\) is statistically significant regardless of the number of variables in the SRC supply model. Additionally, the estimated parameter together with the explanatory variable must have a low standard deviation\({({\sigma }_{\widehat{\beta }} and \sigma }_{v} )\), since the impact generated by the multiplication of both factors must cause the least possible uncertainty. Furthermore, the estimated parameters \((\widehat{\beta })\) must remain stable when modifying the number of variables of the SRC supply function \((n)\) or increasing the number of available observations \(\left(T\right).\)Footnote 2 The concept of parameter stability introduced in this work refers to the invariance of the estimated parameter \(\widehat{\beta }\) to changes in estimation horizons \((T)\) or the number of explanatory variables \((n)\). For example, when estimating the copper price parameter between 1960 and 1980, a parameter is obtained that links the price with the SRC supply according to several variables \((n)\). This estimate will be considered stable if and only if, by modifying the time frame of the estimate, or by adding or removing an explanatory variable to the model, the new estimated parameter \((\widehat{\beta })\) does not differ significantly from the previously estimated parameter (in statistical terms). A limited range in the parameter estimation indicates that the variables do not show a high degree of response as the number of variables \((n)\) in the model changes, thus demonstrating greater certainty to understand the reality. At this point, it is important to make it clear that the estimated parameter is not expected to be constant over time, since there may be technological changes or market evolution giving different weight to the estimated parameters \((\widehat{\beta })\). However, these estimated parameters \((\widehat{\beta })\) are expected to move within a limited range. To evaluate the concept of stability in this work, the estimated parameters \((\widehat{\beta })\) are associated with a random behavior according to the number of variables \((n)\) and the number of observations \(\left(T\right).\) The parameter  \(\beta\) is considered random when there is a sample of observations that do not represent the total population. For example, when constructing a SRC supply equation with the copper price as a variable, the estimated parameter \((\widehat{\beta })\) is interpreted as a random variable because not all possible observations between the copper price and the SRC supply have been made. In this case, it is assumed that a sampling error exists and depends on the outlook of available observations and the variables that intervene in the model. To confirm the parameter stability, it is assumed that the parameter acquires different values associated with a particular mathematical expression for each period of study. Therefore, by taking a probability distribution for these parameters, it could be estimated whether the distribution is stationary over time or not. The estimated parameter can be considered stable if it is stationary in terms of the estimation period and the number of variables \((n)\). This paper suggests that to ensure a good result of the estimated parameters, it is necessary to observe the universe of variables related to a phenomenon that links them in time (for example, a theoretical economic model). Then, a space would open up where all possible combinations of the potential variables observed for different time segments must be analyzed. Also, it is possible that the SRC supply function is not a robust estimate and presents, for example, variability of all or some of its estimated parameters \((\widehat{\beta })\) over time. To start a procedure that delivers the creation of a robust model, and for simplicity, this paper assumes that the secondary supply function is linear, and thus, only the model concerning the number of variables \((n)\) and period \((T)\) were analyzed. However, the model specification could also vary and not necessarily be linear or log-linear. Instead, it could have a non-linear dependency. The working hypothesis indicates that it is possible to find adequate explanatory variables to represent a robust function of SRC supply and other variables that are not recommended due to their low association with the dependent variable. With a limited number of variables and observed information, it is complex to capture all the richness that reality has. Still, a fraction of it can be interpreted with the choice of suitable variables. The article is structured as follows: the “Discussion of the instability of the estimated parameters” section discusses the stability of the estimated parameters. The “Methodology” section describes the proposed methodology. The “Results” section shows the investigation results. The “Comparison of the robustness of different models” section compares the robustness of different econometric models. Finally, conclusions and recommendations are presented in the “Conclusions and recommendations” section.",1

Ipek Tunc,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Price determination has been a great concern in economics since price signals are thought to reflect important information about markets. The price behavior of exhaustible or non-renewable resources has been of importance to researchers, policymakers, and investors as well as firms for a long time for several reasons, including their scarce nature. First, comprehending stochastic structures of commodity prices is essential for commodity-dependent economies to manage and forecast their export earnings. It is also crucial for all other economies due to the potential of commodity prices to influence the current and upcoming production and investment decisions. Moreover, understanding the stochastic properties of commodity prices is essential for forming and forecasting investors’ and firms’ short-term and long-term investment decisions and diversification strategies. Besides being one way of diversifying portfolios and improving trading strategies, investing in metal commodities always attracts investors’ and firms’ attention due to the high volatility of metal prices, which could provide investors and firms the opportunity of achieving major returns. Analyzing the price behavior of non-renewable resources conveys further information about the efficiency of the market, which is important for arbitrageurs and speculators. A market is said to be efficient if all relevant and available information is simultaneously reflected in prices so that no participant can earn excess returns consistently by utilizing past, current, or new information (Fama 1970). Depending upon the level of available information, three types of market efficiency are defined. While the weak form efficiency is based on an information set that involves only historical prices, the semi-strong and strong forms, respectively, account for publicly available information and any publicly or privately provided information. In the empirical literature, the most commonly examined form of market efficiency is the weak form. The weak form of the efficient market hypothesis implies that prices follow unpredictable patterns, referred to as random walk processes. Therefore, they are expected to have a nonstationary and persistent structure and cannot be forecasted by using historical prices. Unlike theoretical specifications, natural resource markets could display deviations from the efficient market hypothesis due to several empirical issues. Lo (2004) underlines that, since there are mainly information and trading costs, market participants generally have limited information and may make irrational decisions. Moreover, as argued by Ghoshray (2021), one of the drivers that shape the pattern of prices is the fixed supply of non-renewable natural resources. An increase in resource prices might attract firms and investors to invest in research and technological development to increase reserves and supply. Depending on the speed of the supply response, the increase in the prices could be persistent or transitory.Footnote 1 Similarly, a sudden decrease in demand (supply) that might result from a severe recession (production cutbacks due to natural problems) can create short- or long-lived changes in metal prices depending on how long it takes to balance between supply and demand. Hence, market efficiency is a reflection of the complex interaction of natural (environmental problems), economic (recession), political (economic policies, country risks), and social (globalization) factors, and it is an empirical question of interest. Many studies are available on the empirical validity of the efficient market hypothesis in the field of energy. While a major strand of this literature has focused on the efficiency of oil markets (e.g., Maslyuk and Smyth 2008; Charles and Darné 2009; Ozdemir et al. 2013; Stevens and de Lamirande 2014), the literature on the market efficiency of non-renewable resources is relatively thin. When examining the literature for the market efficiency of non-renewable resources, it appears that earlier studies have employed standard unit root tests. Despite some differences, almost all of these studies concluded that most of the metal prices are nonstationary, and therefore, they can be characterized by the efficient market hypothesis. Later on, the studies, including Ahrens and Sharma (1997), Lee et al. (2006), Kellard and Wohar (2006), Narayan and Liu (2011), Ghoshray (2021), and Presno et al. (2014), have ascribed the nonstationarity finding of the earlier studies to the low power of conventional unit root tests in the presence of structural breaks. Given that natural resource markets are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and episodes of world geopolitical tensions, as underlined by Lee and Lee (2009) and Gil-Alana et al. (2015), these studies have investigated the stationarity of various metals through tests that allow for structural breaks. In this paper, we intend to investigate whether real quarterly prices of copper, lead, tin, nickel, zinc, aluminum, gold, platinum, and silver can be characterized by the efficient market hypothesis or not over the period 1980Q1 and 2019Q4. Our main contribution to the existing empirical literature is on methodological grounds. Methodologically, unlike most current studies, employing unit root tests, we utilize different stationarity tests. With the use of stationarity tests, we aim to overcome the potential low power problem of unit root tests when applied to stationary but persistent data, which could be quite typical in non-renewable resource prices due to investment lags. Moreover, through two different tests, we allow not only for abrupt changes but also for smooth breaks in resource prices. Since the consequences of misspecification of the functional form of the breaks are as severe as those of ignoring the breaks, it is crucial to consider both smooth and instant breaks in the analysis. The rest of the study is organized as follows. The following section reviews some studies that are relevant to our research. “Data and methodology” describes the data and econometric methodologies we adopt, while “Empirical results” discusses the empirical results, and the “Conclusion” section concludes the study.",

Mining can generate considerable revenues, which in turn is often due to the existence of significant economic rents. These rents differ from normal profits as they derive from a range of factors that may be only weakly related to the performance and efficiency of any specific mining operation—such as the quality of the exploited ore and its geographical location. Given that precious mineral resources often, or even generally, are the property of the state, the issue of how this rent should be allocated is the subject of considerable interest. And it is increasingly often stressed that mineral resources should be exploited in a way to financially benefit not only the miners, but also the state and society as a whole (e.g. OECD 2020a, b). A variety of fiscal tools and instruments exist to ensure that the state and/or communities receive a share of the financial rewards that mining generates. This may be achieved in many ways and range from the right to mine being restricted to state owned entities, to ensuring that mine operators contribute to society through taxes, fees or other commitments and/or obligatory undertakings. The mining sector is important to Sweden, and especially so in the northern regions where mining and smelting companies are the most important industrial employers, and account for some 20% of the GDP (SGU - The Geological Survey of Sweden 2020; Copenhagen Economics 2021). The most important commodities mined include iron, base metals and gold (SGU - The Geological Survey of Sweden 2020). Sweden’s mineral strategy states that the country’s position as the leading mining nation within the EU should be strengthened (Swedish Government 2013). However, the strategy and its longer-term aims have been criticised by some researchers and there has been increased pressure from various stakeholders as well as in political discourse to increase the sector’s contribution to the economy overall, and to local communities specifically (e.g. Roine & Spiro, 2013; Johansson et al., 2014; Liedholm Johnson & Ericsson, 2015). The critique has been levelled at the whole of the mining sector, although it is most relevant for the parts the sector that is in private hands (the largest mining operations are held by the state owned company LKAB). The aims of this paper are to describe how mining in Sweden is taxed, and to consider how the existing set up compares internationally. The research methods used include financial modelling of the existing taxation regime, as well as modelling of cases where additional fiscal instruments are included. Furthermore, the outcomes of the modelling, and the assessment of the fiscal system more generally, are also assessed against the OECD Guiding Principles for Durable Extractive Contracts, which is seen as a relevant and recent example of international good practice (OECD, 2020a, b). The paper is structured as follows. The introduction is followed by a section which introduces taxation regimes for mining as well as some international trends in this regard. Sweden’s taxation regime for mining is presented thereafter, and this is followed by sections that model outcomes of the current set up, as well as selected alternatives. The current taxation regime is then assessed against the OECD Guiding Principles and, finally, the conclusions of the research are presented.",1

These indicators are framed under ‘Environment, Social and Governance’ (ESG) and inform on asset performance against ethical and responsible investment criteria (Pedersen et al. 2021). For example, to list some ESG considerations, environment data could include emissions from energy use, incorporation of nature within facilities or adaptability to intense weather events; social data could include contractual interactions with impacted communities, reports and transparency on labour compensations and negotiations with syndicates or economic disclosure broken down per activity; governance data could include supply chain reporting, institutional stability or transparency in directors board affiliations. During the last 24 to 30 months, company-reporting frameworks have increased in robustness, particularly in the disclosure that ESG-aware companies hold on company reports. Still, ESG indicators have remained inconsistent, their measurements tend to lack replicability, and often they do not provide functions of setting commitments in the form of forward looking targets. Shortcomings for ESG data have been argued to exist mostly due to data gaps in ESG considerations and to disconnects between ESG reports with financial reports.Footnote 1 The lack of industry-wide systematic approaches to identify and categorise ESG indicators has resulted in ESG risking of being arbitrary and thereby loosing significance. This paper takes a specific focus on the governance indicator within mining ESG criteria in the context of lithium mining in Chile, particularly following Dietsche (2019) and Petavratzi et al. (2022). Dietsche (2019) highlights that mining governance at the level of States is mostly handled through bilateral contracts and mining legislation. Developing countries have predominantly relied on mining contracts whereas more developed countries with a mature mining industry tend to rely on mining legislations and general regulatory and legal systems (Dietsche 2019). Dietsche (2019) remarks three main aspects of mining contracts: (i) mining contracts do not ensure greater investment condition stability, (ii) mining contracts leave space for governance challenges as corruption and (iii) mining contracts pose greater administrative burden on host countries. This paper builds from these remarks to explore how do different branches of mining governance engage when State actors accountable for mining contracts demand specific functions from other State actors involved in competition law for mining activities. On another hand, Petavratzi et al. (2022) discuss the impacts that ESG challenges have for prospects of lithium supply from South America. Building on Prior et al. (2013), Petavratzi et al. (2022) mention that sustainable governance on critical metals is commonly focused on future availability. They also remark that current research on ESG associated with lithium extraction in the Andean regions is focused on quantitative data, that is often generic and lacks systemic understandings of governance and social, along with geo-environmental processes. Following Perreault (2006) and Himley (2008), Petavratzi et al. (2022) remark the notion of governance to include control over resources and the articulations among stakeholders. In the context of lithium mining in South America, Petavratzi et al. (2022) highlight that governance frameworks define modes and structures for social participation that establish ‘who are the relevant stakeholders and their degree of influence with the state as well as with mining companies’ (p.16). As part of its overarching intention to assess paths for addressing ESG challenges in lithium mining in South America, Petavratzi’s et al. (2022) work aims to tackle the diversity of governance issues that go beyond the spectrum of material classification for lithium for national development, e.g. as strategic resource which ties its extraction with some form of State intervention. This intention is shared in this paper which takes it to examine the impact of governance in a sharper view on risks for investments in lithium mining in Chile from the aspect of relations between State agencies. With these angles as outset, this paper examines the interactions between sections of the State in Chile that govern lithium mining contracts and that govern competition regulation and law. It thereby explores governance aspects that might go unnoticed in ESG risk evaluations in mining that understand the figure of the State in governance frameworks in spectrums limited to a single unified stakeholder. For instance, Chen et al. (2015) remark that mining governance is significantly affected by sovereign States who are main players in setting groundwork for mining activities. However, as Chen et al. (2015) further point, stakeholders in mining governance often have different targets. This needs to be understood from scopes that segment stakeholders into subgroups to visualise governance stakeholders and their impact on investment risk in a clearer way. This paper finds some of the tensions that exist within sovereign States when they aim to define a unified interest in mining governance and to use legal instruments to impose a dominant view and action towards mining. The paper argues that frameworks for competition regulation in mining in the context of Mineral States, that is economies largely bound to raw material export, with immature competition regulatory frameworks cannot provide governance stability when State actors are influenced by imageries of national development through nation-making and resource protectionism. This paper then proposes criteria that should be incorporated into governance assessments and reports to enhance ESG evaluations in the mining industry. These are notably domestic economic regulation maturity, domestic political geography histories of private equity and imageries of corporate shares and natural resources. Empirical data for this study was collected during a 7-month fieldwork period in Santiago, Chile, in 2019. Data was extracted from archival analyses, conversations with mining firm directors and interviews to personnel of the Chilean Economic Development Agency (CORFO) and to academics formerly involved as public officials in the Chilean Competition Regulation Agency (FNE). Data gathering involved publicly available information and conversations that reflected personal opinions. This provided access to novel data but it limited the scope of mining governance analysis to context-specific settings and to opinions that do not confer the official position of involved authorities. This paper first identifies conventional and emerging governance frameworks used in ESG evaluations and places these in the context of the mining industry. Secondly, the paper brings forth empirical data on an equity acquisition in the lithium mining industry between Tianqi Lithium and SQM to discuss governance aspects in the context of critical mineral extraction in Chile. The empirical section first details the link between the Chilean nation and private equity of mining firms—it elaborates on the role of equity markets in making the Chilean nation as a material-exporting country, and on how competition regulation agencies enter this grounded structure. There, the paper reflects on the historical use of private equity in Chile to build a national identity through mining. Thereafter, the empirical section presents the case of the SQM-Tianqi equity purchase to observe the contemporary tensions between national politics on materials and firm governance structures. The paper then follows to discuss national politics and firm governance, and addresses the following aspects of mining governance: (i) interactions among private-sector firms, nations and State regulation; (ii) material interpretations of shares as economic resources anchored to territories and (iii) differences between economic regulation based on national politics and on competition law. The paper closes with key remarks observed throughout the discussion to argue that governance structures on mining are substantially formed by the interactions between equity markets, histories of private equity in national development and national competition regulation. The paper concludes by presenting governance criteria specific to lithium mining in Chile, expanding understandings of governance in mining and presenting points to improve ESG risk evaluations for the mining industry.",1

36,2,Mineral Economics,31 January 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-023-00366-2,Mining within the context of a “preferential option for the poor”,June 2023,James P. Cooney,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Among the most outspoken critics of mining projects in developing countries are nuns, priests and bishops of the Catholic Church in Latin America, the Philippines and various countries of Africa. The sphere of reference within which such criticisms originate is Catholic social teaching,Footnote 1 whose core concept is the “preferential option for the poor”. This concept is more than a commitment to reduce the sufferings and hardships of the impoverished members of society. It is a commitment to transform society so as to become truly inclusive, no longer with marginalized groups of people, whose numbers may actually represent a majority in some jurisdictions. The vision is of a society where human dignity, human rights, human well-being and social justice are respected and promoted by all.Footnote 2 The preferential option is, of course, not a matter of choice for the poor themselves, who have little or no power to achieve the social change that is envisioned. The preferential option is proposed for governmental and business decision-makers who dominate society and the economy. It is a call for them to change their priorities from favouring their own interests to pursuing the common good by righting the imbalance between the rich and powerful and the poor and powerless. “Solidarity” and “subsidiarity” are the two pre-eminent normative principles in Catholic social teaching whereby the preferential option for the poor is to be expressed. Solidarity refers to the unity in vision and purpose of those that have embraced the preferential option for the poor with those who are impoverished and marginalized. Solidarity is characterized by relationships of mutual respect, trust and support and manifested through collective action towards achieving an equitable balance of decision-making power and distribution of social goods. From a theological perspective, solidarity is the expression of the Christian commandment to love one’s neighbour as oneself (agape) within the social, economic and political sphere of action.Footnote 3 Subsidiarity prescribes that social, economic and political decisions should be the prerogative of the lowest competent authority within the gradation of decision-making institutions. In other words, if a community organization is capable of making decisions for the community, it should be empowered to do so, and not be subject to decisions by some higher authority, such as a national or sub-national government. Empowerment through subsidiarity is a necessary means of achieving individual and communal self-actualization. In sociological terms, subsidiarity implies strong families and robust civil society organizations, including parishes.Footnote 4 To the advocates of the preferential option for the poor, mining companies appear to be allied with the dominant political and economic powers in the countries where the companies are active. The government grants companies permits to explore for minerals and to build and operate mines. The government is the main recipient of in-country revenue flows from mining operations, in the form of royalties, taxes and other imposts. The leading domestic companies and financial institutions are the principal beneficiaries of in-country commercial transactions with mining companies. Thus, mining companies are inextricably linked to the host country’s political and economic elite, whose decisions and actions are perceived as oppressing and marginalizing the poor, not necessarily because of evil intent (though that may exist) but because of structural flaws in the economic and political system within which the leadership group is accustomed to operating. Understandably, therefore, advocates of the preferential option for the poor are inclined to criticize the mining companies in their midst. From their perspective, though mining may contribute to overall economic growth and poverty reduction in local communities and host countries, it does not contribute to structural change in the political and economic system. They perceive the preferential option of mining companies to be ultimately for their shareholders, not for the poor. Mining companies are large institutions that are well endowed with financial, technical and managerial resources. They have the power to make and implement decisions with immense potential impact on the lives of people living in host countries, and particularly in the vicinity of their operations. Mining can provide significant economic benefits to local communities, but mining can also have adverse impacts on the surrounding natural environment and traditional ways of life. The decision-making and operational framework of leading mining companies is sustainable development.Footnote 5 The core concept of this framework is that the economic, environmental and socio-cultural dimensions of the industry’s activities and impacts need to receive equal respect.Footnote 6 Sustainable development is an on-going process to harmonize and integrate contending economic, environmental and socio-cultural values and perspectives. Mining companies cannot unilaterally implement sustainable development. Through the exercise of corporate social responsibility, mining companies can contribute to sustainable development, but the overall success of such efforts requires an alignment of the sustainability contributions of mining with those of other societal actors. The integration of mining with sustainable development, therefore, can only be achieved through continuous dialogue and complementary initiatives among mining companies, government agencies, community representatives, civil society leaders, environmentalists, social activists, trade unions and other groups that feel affected by mining activities, ideally including advocates of the preferential option for the poor. Mining companies are deeply familiar with the issues of poverty, indeed much more so than other industries. Undiscovered or undeveloped mineral deposits more often than not are located in the more remote regions of the developing world. Consequently, the people that mining companies encounter in the vicinity of many exploration and mine development projects are often very poor. They typically live under conditions of inadequate housing, employment, education, health care and security. Their governments are generally incapable or disinclined to help improve their living conditions, and corruption, oppression and violence are common. Under such circumstances, mining companies have a choice: to insulate their projects from the adversities of local social and economic conditions and function as enclaves, or to integrate their projects with the local economy and endeavour to improve the quality of life for the local population. Most mining companies, motivated by the principles of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility, are inclined to do what they can to improve the lives of the local population, within the constraints of available corporate expertise and financial resources.Footnote 7 This means, first of all, that all adverse environmental or socio-cultural impacts need to be anticipated, evaluated and eliminated through programs of mitigation or compensation. All potential benefits need to be identified, prioritized and delivered with the strategic objective of ensuring long lasting improvements in the economic and social conditions of the local population. Mining companies understand that they must earn a social licence to operate from local communities, or risk opposition and conflict over time sufficient to damage their reputation and profitability. Finding the fine balance between profits made by the company and the economic flows into society is in my mind the essence of sustainable development. It could also be expressed as an equitable distribution of the rewards and risks from mining. However, from my experience there is too little transparency about the distribution of rewards and even less about the distribution of risks (or costs) of mining, both globally and inside host countries. This creates a lot of suspicion in host countries that foreigners are getting more than their fair share of the rewards from mining and imposing a disproportionate share of the risks (or costs) on the local communities and the government. Hence the current quest, sometimes quite forceful, all over the developing world by governments and communities to extract a larger share of the wealth created by mining and thus achieve a better balance. Strategies to improve living conditions in local communities typically include: providing employment and business opportunities for the local population and training people to qualify for those jobs and contracts; investing in improvements in local physical and social infrastructure (such as paved roads and bridges, potable water and sanitation, health and education, recreation facilities and other amenities); strengthening local governance capacity by sponsoring education and mentoring programs for community leaders; reducing violence and oppression by supporting the training of local security forces in policing practices that respect human rights; and enhancing social capital by encouraging the formation and growth of local civil society organizations. The sustainable development strategies of mining companies, particularly their interactions with local communities, are generally guided by certain international standards for multinational corporations, especially extractive sector companies, which have been carefully refined and broadly endorsed during the past 15 years. The most detailed standards and guidelines for mining companies operating in developing countries are as follows: the Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank; the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, articulated and promoted by certain concerned governments, extractive sector companies and non-governmental organizations; the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework, adopted and promoted by the UN Human Rights Council; and the Sustainable Development Framework, the Community Development Toolkit and other related guidelines promoted by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). The mining industry’s vision of its potential contribution to poverty reduction and improved standards of living in local communities is captured by this statement of the ICMM: “Community development is the process of increasing the strength and effectiveness of communities, improving people’s quality of life, and enabling people to participate in decision making and to achieve greater long term control over their lives. Community development aims to empower and help communities to improve their social and political environments, increase equity and social justice, overcome social exclusion, build social capital and capacities, and involve communities in the strategic assessment and decision-making processes that influence their local conditions.” Footnote 8 The orientation and best practices of mining companies in addressing issues of poverty in developing countries would appear, in principle, to be convergent with the vision and imperatives of the preferential option for the poor. Obviously, many mining companies fall short of the industry’s best practices in their community relations, and some mining companies do not endorse sustainable development as their decision-making framework for managing economic and social impacts. So there is an issue of consistency in the industry’s performance. However, statements by representatives of the Catholic Church continue to view mining projects in developing countries, including mines operated by the industry’s leaders in sustainable development, as being part of the problem of systemic poverty and oppression, not part of a constructive and productive response. It seems that either the Church-based criticism of mining is rooted in a misperception or misunderstanding of the industry’s collective intention of contributing to sustainable developments and of the best practices of the leading mining companies in relating to communities, or that mining companies, in spite of their strategic intent and best practices, are not addressing issues of impoverishment and marginalization in a manner that reflects the vision and aspiration of the Church. Is there more that the industry could be doing in order to achieve a closer convergence between mining and the preferential option for the poor? Contributing to long-term economic and social progress in local communities is a core objective of the sustainable development framework adopted by the leading mining companies. Without doubt, community economic and social progress is best demonstrated by a measurable reduction in poverty, the basic indicator of which is a quantifiable improvement in living standards. However, there are two ways to measure living standards, in absolute terms or in relative terms. Typically in communities that receive economic benefits from a nearby mine, living standards improve in absolute terms, as households experience higher family incomes, access to better education and healthcare facilities, improved local infrastructure, and so forth. However, living standards cannot be said to improve in relative terms if the income gap between the wealthiest quintile in the community and the least wealthy quintile widens. Anecdotally, it is frequently noted that while everyone in a community may benefit economically from a nearby mine, the “haves” generally benefit much more than the “have-nots”. I have had other difficult conversations in developing countries, with bishops and priests and ministers of other denominations, whose primary concern is the spiritual well-being of their communities. I tell them that our project will create jobs, business opportunities and other revenue flows that will benefit local communities. My clerical interlocutors generally acknowledge the potential benefits, but invariably add: “These rural people live largely in a cashless society. They are best off tending to their gardens, chickens and pigs. Going to work in a mine will change their lives. When you start paying them wages and pumping money into their villages, what if the result is gambling, prostitution, drunkenness, family violence and the general disintegration of the community? Who will take responsibility for that? What will you do?” Our answer has been: “We need partners. We need to work with organizations like churches to shore up community values and morality”. Certainly, corporations cannot take on total responsibility for the actions of individuals or the well-being of the community.Footnote 9 That a widening income gap should occur should not be surprising when economic benefits from mining are distributed within local community through reliance on the free market. In contrast to this typical distribution of economic benefits within a community, the implementation of the preferential option for the poor would call for a channelling of the economic benefits from mining to local communities in a manner that would pre-eminently favour the “have-nots”, with a consequent narrowing of the wealth gap. It is questionable to what extent mining companies are willing or able to concentrate the distribution of economic benefits on the poorest members of the community, particularly if the richer and more powerful members object to the relative diminishment of their share of benefits. After all, the rich and powerful members of the community are generally the decision-makers with whom a mining company must engage to reach agreement on managing impacts and benefits. However, at the very least, companies should make sure that their negotiations with communities about impacts and benefits address the issue of a possible widening of the of the income gap. For, while a widening income gap may be of little concern to community leaders, it should be a concern to any mining company that is committed to the durability of the community economic and social progress that the company intends as its post-minelife legacy. If mining companies can show through their practice of sustainable development that they are indeed concerned about reducing poverty in local communities in relative terms as well as in absolute terms, they will be able to claim with at least some degree of credibility that they are being sensitive and responsive to the vision of the preferential option for the poor. The preferential option for the poor calls for solidarity among all members of the community, irrespective of economic disparity, for the purpose of eliminating conditions of destitution, marginalization and oppression. This call for solidarity extends beyond the community to include its external would-be benefactors, which in principle could include mining companies. However, mining companies more often than not, despite their best intentions, create or deepen divisions within local communities. First contact with local communities by explorationists or mine developers is usually with those are most willing to talk to them, generally a formal or informal leadership group. Those in the community who stand most to benefit from investment and employment in their area are generally supportive of the company’s project to one extent or another. However, those who for one reason or another feel left out or adversely affected by the project or who are disaffected by their current leaders are often suspicious of the conversations with exploration or mining companies, and so distance themselves from the project and its supporters. This division in the community is further deepened when advocates of social justice and poverty reduction (non-governmental organizations and Church groups) align themselves with mining opponents, whom they perceive to be marginalized or oppressed by the pressures of a foreign company. Meanwhile, mining companies are inclined to ignore internal conflicts in the community and criticism by their opponents, as long as the leadership group supports their project. So they press on with development, confident that the majority in the community is supportive and the others will come around once the benefits begin to flow. It is understandable that this pattern of interaction between mining companies and local communities should stimulate criticism of mining by advocates of the preferential option for the poor. Mining companies are restricted from asserting solidarity with neighbouring impoverished communities in the manner espoused by advocates of the preferential option for the poor, as that would imply a corporate commitment to a thorough restructuring of the political, economic and social order. Foreign companies as guests in host countries, subject to agreements with national governments and laws of general application, are not free to be advocates of radical systemic change. However, mining companies could conceivably give priority to community solidarity, and abandon the current practice of stimulating community division in response to their projects. Mining companies should insist on receiving community consent that is broadly based and not based solely on the views of the leadership group and its supporters within the community.Footnote 10 This would require that a mining company make it clear at the time of its first interaction with a community that its project will not go forward unless it is clear to the company that the community is solidly supportive. This orientation in favour of community solidarity would enable mining companies to converge at least partway towards the imperatives of the preferential option for the poor. The principle of subsidiarity is already an essential part of the mining industry’s vision of its potential contribution to community development. Strengthening the ability of community organizations to defend community rights, make collective decisions and implement programs of community improvement is described by the industry as helping to “build social capital and capacities”. With respect to subsidiarity, therefore, the industry’s best practices in implementing sustainable development would appear to be demonstrably convergent with the imperatives of the preferential option for the poor. Nevertheless, it would seem useful for the industry to engage with advocates of the preferential option for the poor to develop a more extensive mutual understanding of how the principle of subsidiarity can best find expression through mining company programs to strengthen social capital. The foregoing analysis suggests certain steps that leading mining companies operating within the framework of sustainable development might take bridge the chasm with their Church-based critics and achieve a closer convergence with the imperatives of the preferential option for the poor. Develop a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of poverty in all aspects beyond the purely economic dimension as measured by quantifiable indicators of living standards. Mining companies need to recognize the political, social, cultural, psychological and environmental aspects of poverty, as well as its physical dimensions in terms of nutrition, health, housing and personal security. Improve baseline social impact assessments of local communities in a manner that will better capture the nature, causes and effects of poverty in all of its dimensions, in both absolute terms and relative terms. This improved SIA should include a risk assessment of a possible widening of the income gap in local communities based on a distribution of benefits biased to favour the “haves” over the “have-nots”. Incorporate the objective of narrowing the income gap in local communities within the mining industry’s sustainable development framework. Recognizing its relative lack of experience and competency in achieving this objective, mining companies should collaborate with the IFCFootnote 11 and other sources of expertise on poverty reduction, including Church-based organizations, to develop practical approaches for bringing about a more equitable and sustainable distribution of the benefits from mining. Place poverty reduction, in relative terms as well as absolute terms, on the agenda in negotiations with community leaders and government officials concerning the impacts and benefits of proposed mining projects. At regular stages during the life of the mine, an assessment should be made of changes in the income gaps in local communities, and if a widening is evident corrective interventions should be implemented. Contribute to the empowerment of the poorest segments of local communities and to their improved quality of life through the establishment and strengthening of local civil society institutions that are able to assert and advance the best interests of communities within the communities themselves and with higher governmental authorities. From the perspective of the advocates of the preferential option for the poor, these steps will not totally align mining with their vision, but such action may be perceived as progress in the right direction. As already noted, mining companies cannot detach themselves from the decision-makers in government and the heads of large business companies in the host countries of their operations. They cannot become instruments of radical structural change in the political, economic and social order of the countries where they are guests. Yet for the advocates of the preferential option for the poor, such radical change is perceived to be necessary to achieve the elimination of the impoverishment, marginalization and oppression that affect large parts of the population, sometimes even the majority, in host countries. Consequently, mining companies in developing countries, though they may be credited with making positive contributions to poverty reduction, will always be subject to criticism as being agents of the ruling elite, as being part of the political and economic system that perpetuates all the adversities of poverty, even in the local communities that receive benefits from mining. At present, the Church-based critics of mining are generally unwilling to enter into dialogue with mining companies, since they perceive the industry’s objectives and priorities, even when expressed in terms of sustainable development, to be very distant from and largely incompatible with the preferential option for the poor. However, if the mining industry can demonstrate progress in the manner suggested towards better understanding and responding to the conditions of poverty in all of its aspects, especially in local communities, then dialogue with advocates of the preferential option for the poor may become possible. A dialogue among sincere and committed participants from the Church and from the mining industry could not only increase mutual understanding of the causes and conditions of poverty, but ideally would also drive continuous improvement in the industry’s policies, practices and capabilities to contribute to reducing income disparity and marginalization and to strengthening community inclusiveness and solidarity. Although the mining industry is not able to fully exercise the preferential option for the poor as defined in Catholic social teaching, it is apparent that the industry can, and to some extent already does, relate to communities and host countries through decisions and actions that are demonstrably convergent with that vision and spirit.Footnote 12",
