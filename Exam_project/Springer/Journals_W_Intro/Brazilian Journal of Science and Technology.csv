The smart phone mobile market today is fast asserting itself as the bedrock for games that most users enjoy. Our proposed work aims to build on the idea of cloud computing (Zaharia 2009) and design an architecture based on the client–server game concept. The central idea behind this paper is to explore commercial tools available to host games on a server over 3G mobile networks. A mobile phone user connected on a 3G mobile network would not have to download an entire game to play. In fact, he/she would be able to request single or multi-player sessions with relative ease and without having to use up sizeable amount of memory space in order to install a game to begin playing it. We bring together two robust and eminently powerful technologies in tandem to allow mobile users on a 3G network to enjoy gaming experience without the need to install game applications on mobile devices. As an emerging trend in the gaming industry, Gaming-on-Demand technology has become one of the most discussed topics. Gaming-on-Demand makes use of cloud computing as it fundamental basis on which the framework operates. Leading the commercial segment in this field are companies such as OnLive, Gaikai, and G-Cluster. These companies host almost all their games on their own supported cloud computing networks. These companies have adopted almost a common fundamental method to deliver game play to their respective customers. In this method, video games do not quite run on the end-user’s device. Private servers hosted in cloud networks run the video games. A string of continuous frames are then transmitted over the internet to the computers, or even to interactive television sets on which the users are able to play video games. The user’s responses and video game interactions are sent back to the game server hosted on the cloud, via the same network. A mobile cloud video gaming (MCVG) technology is essentially a Gaming-on-Demand model that has been adapted and put into operation for mobile devices with wireless communication capabilities. In order to support mobile gaming on clients which are not required to process game play on their own, two integral components comprising the game engine and game streaming servers in the form of virtual machines are required. Whenever a user logs on to a game server from a mobile gadget, the game content server would first confirm the connection. Subject to successful confirmation, it would then begin to initialize a game engine server and examine the dynamics affecting the quality of service (QoS) which influences the quality of mobile cloud gaming (MCG) experience. The client’s account information and game data are then pulled in by the game engine server. From this point on, the processing of the game flow and corresponding user data begins. The resultant streaming output, influenced by the game logic, is continuously translated into game video. Converted by the game streaming server, the game video which is considered to be a raw format for delivery is sent through appropriate wireless communication channels to the mobile client on which the game is to be actually played. For the responses of the user to be channelled to the game engine, the user’s continuous feedback using the buttons and sensors of the mobile device, is sent to the cloud server. The feedback which is continuously streamed during the course of the game play is fed into the game content server directly (Wang and Dey 2009). Fundamentally, combined with MCVG, the cloud assumes the role of a video generator which continuously communicates, and a server that streams video frames of the game being played. The mobile devices are simply controllers of the game events in play, and receive streaming videos of the game play. Owing to certain limitations imposed by features available for mobile communication networks on a viable commercial scale, video-rendering technologies, video compression, and QoS transmission controls assume enormous significance in designing of a MCVG system (Wang and Dey 2010; Cai and Leung 2012). As far as we have researched, the Android app version of OnLive was the first MCVG commercial application available on Google Play Android App market. Browser-based games have already amassed a considerable fan following. Many of these games are to be found on social networking sites, and are enjoyed by users across the globe. Such games have the following features (Vanhatupa 2010) which are inherent to the development and existence of the games on browser-based platforms: Support for multi-player game sessions: a large number of concurrent game playing sessions can be enjoyed by users with access to browser-based games. Web browser as client: games which are played on web browsers do not require software to be installed. Although some browser-based games may need appropriate browser add-ons to function properly or at all. Always on: with a cloud-based game actually being hosted and processed on cloud computers, it is possible for a game session to continue and associated messages received even when a player is not connected to the Internet. Different time scales: a browser-based game can be real-time, turn-based, or might execute actions at set intervals within a given time period based on preset queued commands received. Every player has a unique account with which controlling of a game character role is made possible. Such a character role can be akin to that of a role-playing game, turn-based games—such as strategy games where entire nations or groups may be controlled, or real-time games. Browser-based games can be of different genres. These can range from the ones already mentioned, to manager games and social networking types. The common trait of all browser-based games is the web browser itself which acts as the container within which every browser-based game is played. Simultaneously with the evolution of mobile devices, progress is being made towards development of games that can be played on mobile browsers (mobile browser-based games or MBG). A cloud gaming architecture has to integrate a wide array of cutting edge technologies in order to deliver optimum performance levels. These technologies include video streaming that offer low response times, to 3D rendering methods which are able to support extraordinary operations. Our analysis starts by examining the key design issues and considerations that most cloud game operators have focussed their attention. A typical cloud gaming architecture comprises a system or a collection of systems that work together to collect users’ inputs, conveying these signals to the cloud server or servers, process the signals into relevant game actions, condense and deliver the encoded/compressed information to the game play, and then transmit the game scenes to the mobile device user. All of these operations have to take place in the least amount of time usually measured in terms of milliseconds or less. The less time it takes to complete processing these operations, smoother is the interactive session that a user would be able to enjoy. Naturally, this period of time—called as interaction delay, is to be maintained at the lowest possible mark so as to ensure a gaming experience that is vibrant and highly responsive to all connected players of a given cloud game. There are, however, certain unavoidable consequences to such a design. With shorter latency times, the entire cloud gaming system has to process vital screen rendering and video compression operations within a very narrow range of duration. In addition to this, high network latency can leave a negative impact on the gaming experience and user interaction. Keeping this in view, we commence our discussion on designing a model for delay tolerance. Streaming requirements for live video telecast and cloud gaming are near identical. In both cases, incoming video feeds have to be quickly encoded for proper viewing by users, and compressed in a very short span of time prior to transmission. Further, encoding is required and must be accomplished for a very few frames which represent a small number of the most recent video frames. However, major differences can be observed between the two. Cloud gaming almost nearly offers no capability to buffer video frames on a client device. Live media streaming, on the other hand, does have the advantage to do so. The reason cloud gaming does not offer buffering of video is because whenever a player performs an action on the local client, the command has to travel through the Internet to the cloud system. This command must then be processed by the game engine and the resultant video frames in relation to the game generated. These video frames are then compressed by an appropriate video codec and transmitted back to the player. Considering the incredibly short duration—within 100–200 ms—it takes to complete this cycle, it becomes obvious that there is infinitesimal amount of time to buffer. In contrast, live media streaming can extend a buffer in the order of hundreds of milliseconds to even a few seconds without compromising QoS. Our work features Citrix XenApp 6.5 with HDX features. This enables us to take advantage of superior streaming capabilities. Citrix HDX projects capabilities that deliver high definition video streaming to any device over any network. We have used Citrix HDX to help our users enjoy improved graphics performance when connecting to virtual desktops using the Citrix Independent Architecture (ICA) protocol. This technology is appropriate in applications that involve a large number of pixels changing at a high frequency rate. To make desktop virtualization both scalable and practicable regardless of low bandwidth and/or high latency wide area network conditions, ICA is included with Citrix HDX tools.",2
2.0,1.0,Brazilian Journal of Science and Technology,14 September 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40552-015-0011-2,The practice of innovation at brazilian public university: the case of the University of São Paulo,December 2015,Luciane Meneguin Ortega,Vanderlei Salvador Bagnato,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Innovation is in the agenda of any research institution nowadays. Obviously, everyone is aware that innovation is a word that is now in everyday use and is increasingly acknowledged as one of the main factors with a positive impact on competitiveness and economic development. Enterprises know that innovation is necessary in order to survive in a world as dynamics as ours, where products change not only in relation to their design, but also to their functional aspects. From a time perspective, many countries discovered this decades ago, but, in the case of Brazil, only a few years ago. This is why the country is attempting to speed up the process to enable innovation to really have the same impact on development as it did in North American and European countries. If we were to conduct an analysis from the perspective of the universities, what role should they play in the generation of innovation? Or furthermore, knowing their specific characteristics, what are the ways of creating an environment which is suitable for the practice of innovation, without competing with other activities or replacing the same. Based on the principle that Universities should be generators of knowledge, which when appropriately processed becomes capable of generating direct benefits for society, they should assume a leading role in the process of practical innovation. This leading role should commence by taking into consideration that a university should not serve merely as a site for training human resources and course administrators, but needs to be a shaper of behavior and skills for the development of innovation with a direct impact on society. This scenario, with such questions and statements, leads the formulation of this article where we analyze a case study and presents reflections on the role of a public university and how to contribute to overcome the technological challenges. It is within this context that this work presents what the University of São Paulo (USP) has been doing in relation to Brazil its Technological Innovation Center called USP Agency of Innovation, with regard to practical innovation, not only for the academic community, but also for external partners and society as a whole. This discussion and presentation of the modus operandi for innovation provides a model of how to practice innovation in a pragmatic manner at public universities. However, in order to understand the role of public universities in developing countries regarding the practice of innovation it is necessary to consider key concepts regarding innovation and its management. There are numerous approaches to the issue of innovation. In theory, this work first addresses some of the concepts and the importance of innovation, and then goes on to deal with the management of innovation demonstrating the need for interaction between actors in the innovation system, where the University plays a role of importance. Regarding the role of the University, the article discusses its responsibility when it comes to innovation, presenting the context of the public university and its background face the technological challenges not only with its internal environment, but also with the productive sector. Following the literature review presents the scenario of Brazilian public university in terms of barrerias and opportunities in order to give subsidies to analyze the case study proposed by this article. One of the great forerunners of the concept of innovation was the German economist Friedrich List (1789–1846). Concerned with finding means of helping his country achieve the same level of economic development as England after the Industrial Revolution, List advocated not only protection for the emerging German industries, but also proposed policies to speed up the industrialization process. Not by chance, List was a pioneer in the introduction of the concept of intangible investment, which he classified as the intellectual capital of the human race. As far as he was concerned, the current state of a country depends on a series of discoveries, enhancements and efforts of previous generations. If List was the forerunner of the idea of a “National Innovation System”, the technology first began to be analyzed in depth with regard to the theory of economic development beginning with the works of Karl Marx (1818–1883), in the second half of the 19th century, and Joseph Alois Schumpeter (1883–1950), an Austrian economist and professor at the University of Harvard, in the first half of the 20th century. The work “The Theory of Economic Development” analyzed the role of entrepreneurs and inventors in the expansion of capitalism. In the opinion of the economist, these two categories of players had the gift of triggering waves of change in production processes, generating vast profit with the emergence of new products, processes and technologies implemented, while burning the bridges to the past and disposing of obsolete methods of production. According to Schumpeter (1950), any innovation produces what he defined as “creative destruction”, whereby the new thrives alongside the old and then takes its place, leaving the dead and wounded behind, but boosting progress. According to this author, innovation is a means of obtaining a strategic advantage, and is responsible for the process of “creative destruction”. This process involves a constant quest for the creation of something new which provides new sources of profitability, resulting in the destruction of old rules and the creation of new ones. Sawhney et al. (2006) underline the importance of the use, on defining innovation as the creation of a new and consistent value both for the consumer and the organization by means of the creative change of one or more of the dimensions of the system. The importance of innovation lies in the creation of value for the customer and the organization, or in other words, the creation of new products is not sufficient to innovate. According to Tidd et al. (2008), innovation is something new which provides social value or wealth. Far more than a new product, something innovatory may be behind new technologies, new operational processes, new market practices, small-scale changes, adaptations, in short, new features which generate profit. In other words, the authors state that innovation implies a process which, generally speaking, involves knowledge, information and creativity. It should be pointed out that these in the opinion of these authors innovation should be regarded from three angles: technological innovation, market innovation and organizational innovation. As such, innovation “is driven by the ability to establish relations, identify opportunities and take advantage of the same” (p. 24). Another contribution to the definitions of innovation comes from Bagnato (2012), based on the principle that innovation is knowledge being incorporated into products, processes and methodologies which render society more viable, on breaking into the business market. In other words, it is when a piece of knowledge generates a change which is absorbed by the population, by the market. Innovation then becomes more important as a natural means of implementing scientific knowledge. In days gone by, and particularly in the Middle Ages, humanity surrounded itself with spiritual protection. European cities tended to expand around their cathedral, as this served as a refuge, a search for support for the protection and development of each individual from a spiritual point of view. Over time, people´s life experience began to change and they started to realize there was more to life than spiritual factors, and began diversifying their points of attraction, paying greater attention to earthly nature and its vicissitudes. It has always been known that knowledge is vital. So much so that in times gone by wise men were kept close to kings and governors as advisors. Nowadays, the situation has been inverted: the knowledge of how nature works determines everything. People, despite continuing to need several kinds of support to live, including spiritual support, realize this not sufficient to determine their progress, either as an individual or economically speaking in relation to the inclusion of their countries in the modern world. Only the conversion of knowledge into innovation, into wealth, enables modern societies to achieve this progress and to secure prominent positions as a means of providing their citizens with the best possible welfare. This is reinforced by Tidd et al. (2008) (p. 35), who state that “….. innovation is a question of knowledge—of creating new possibilities through combining different sets of knowledge. These can be in the form of knowledge about what is technically possible or what particular configuration of this would meet an articulated or latent need”. Talking about configuration of knowledge being channeled into innovation stresses the importance of managing innovation. The work of Henderson and Clark apud Tidd et al. (2008) provides a key contribution to our understanding of this idea. They state that innovation rarely involves dealing with a single technology or market, but rather with a bundle of knowledge which is brought together into a configuration. Successful innovation management requires getting hold of and using knowledge about actors, but also about how these can be put together—which they termed the “architecture of an innovation”. According to Maculan (2002), innovation management requires of the organization a capacity to integrate and coordinate human, financial, technical and organizational resources for the generation of new ideas which will enhance products, services and processes; the creation of new knowledge; the development of solutions which will put these ideas into practice and the transfer of these results to the organization´s practices. Innovation activities generally require interactions with a variety of actors comprising the innovation system. These components include government laboratories, universities, policy departments, regulators, competitors, suppliers and consumers. In the case of the actors involved, we should emphasize the vital role of educational and research entities (particularly universities), which play a minimum dual role in innovation processes: that of generating scientific knowledge and of providing a skilled workforce capable of innovating. It is in this scenario that we need to address the role of universities in innovation management. The 21st century features peculiar characteristics which have been under management since the second half of the 20th century. Although there is no consensus among the various authors on this period, some have termed it post-modernity. It is in this context that this work intends to (re) assess Brazilian universities with regard to space for the creation and disclosure of scientific knowledge, and, furthermore, space for training the citizens of the 21st century and a new society. What role should universities play in relation to the paradigm of post-modernity? How does one effective conduct activities involving the production and socialization of knowledge in a socially responsible manner? How do we convert the ideas generated in the university environment into wealth for use in the lives of people and organizations? The ability of a nation to generate knowledge and convert it into wealth and social development depends on the performance of certain institutional agents dedicated to the generation and application of knowledge. The principal agents comprising a national system for the generation and appropriation of knowledge are companies, universities and the government. As such, what role do universities play? And what about public universities with their own specific characteristics? The importance of the development of technology and innovation at universities is an almost universal concept. But how can this perception really be mirrored in the reality of these institutions? Universities need to understand that activities conducted in a university environment take on significant importance. Universities are no longer an institution for training human resources and course administrators, but are now shapers of behavior and skills for the development of innovation. In the post-modernity era from a scientific viewpoint as a subset of the vast set of knowledge, learning is now related to practical skills such as know-how, savoir-vivre and the art of listening, thereby related to customs, and should, a priori, meet the practical demands of the working world, with a priority on applied research. Or in other words, the general idea of a kind of “linear model” in the 20th century was consolidated, which suggests that innovation begins with basic research, followed by applied research, followed by development, and, finally, production and disclosure. The final two stages are regarded as those most associated with innovation. Moreover, what is clear today is that innovation is no longer a possible distant consequence of basic research or the end of the line. Innovation has often turned out to be the source of research programs, shaping and stimulating science to be produced as a consequence of the word innovation. At the same time, the traditional assumption that innovation arises from the need to meet demand, has been replaced by the idea that, at times, innovation generates demand on a scale never previously imagined. Hence, in accordance with the paradigm of post-modernity, this means rethinking the role of education in this trajectory, and within the different schooling institutions, universities should undoubtedly play a major role. How, based at a public university, can one create “prudent knowledge for a decent life”? The current stage of scientific and technological development does not match the development of human moral capacity, or in other words, the recognition of the responsibility of the self to the other. This lack of responsibility, this inability to think beyond the subjective desire of self-satisfaction, gives rise to the disasters which have marked society in recent times (Bauman 1998). As such, the primary role of society and its institutions shall be that of rethinking a new benchmark ethic for human relations and a brake on consumerism and the sovereignty of individual liberty in favor of a new collective order. In accordance with free discussion and debate, whose place, above all, is at public universities, we need to discover and create the foundations for the advent of a society based on justice. The triple helix concept developed by Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (1995) assumes that the university, in accordance with the post second revolution, should be an entrepreneurial university with the following characteristics: basic research with business potential; a tradition in business start-ups; an entrepreneurial culture on the Campus; policies defining rules for the appropriation of intellectual property; the sharing of profit and regulation of conflicts of interest; and participation in the regional innovation strategy (Etzkowitz and Zhou 2006). Thus, the entrepreneurial university is the base for regional economic development, encompassing teaching, research and services to society, not as a linear process, but as spiral feedback involving the constant accrual and distribution of knowledge. According to Etzkowitz (2008), when the university assumes a new role in the promotion of innovation, its missions in relation to education and research also change. Paradoxically, the greater the influence of the university on society, the more it is subject to the influence of society, which in this sense is desirable, given public research universities are financed by society to generate common benefits for the same. The importance of the development of technology and innovation at universities is an almost universal concept. But how can this perception really be mirrored in the reality of these institutions? And what is the importance of the relationship between the universities and the companies for which innovation effectively occurs? It is believed universities need to be given priority, as without the training of skilled professionals and the generation of scientific-technological knowledge, companies will lack the most important source of basic scientific knowledge, due to the fact it is the university environment which generates the ideas which can be turned into wealth for use by individuals and organizations. However, the companies are not only responsible for the role of converting scientific knowledge into innovation, as they can and should generate ideas for new solutions for the problems facing the economic agents. As such, the company also needs to conduct research and development activities, which are often similar to the research conducted at universities. Only there is a small detail here: companies, in principle, do not train or generate professionals, but use the knowledge of individuals. This is why there is a need for the partnership between the universities, the trainers of human resources and providers of the innovators, and the companies, which take in these professionals to develop their technology and to create innovative material for the market. Hence, at the end of this line of thought, we conclude that there is a need to strengthen relations between the universities and the companies. The company needs to report its requirements to the universities. Failure to do so will make it almost impossible for the universities to provide what the companies need in terms of human resources and knowledge, and it is almost impossible for the companies to absorb the knowledge of the universities if the same is only contained in scientific articles. Hence, the company-university relationship is vital for a model capable of achieving success in this new trend of economic development based on technological innovation. The role of the university is to be the generating hub of scientific border knowledge, and, in partnership with the companies, transform this knowledge into technology products for the market, positively changing the living standards of the people and everything which is done for society in the quest for well-being. The academic environment needs to be a generator of new ideas. Academics, above all others, are responsible for the generation of ideas, in addition to assembling laboratories and the production of human resources for the quest for knowledge, be it for immediate technological use or not. But this alone is not enough. When science is being produced one can extract a small fraction to be transformed into a product to meet a need of society and to create economic wealth. Hence, to ensure innovation exists in the academic environment it is not necessary for the application of knowledge to be given priority over the generation of knowledge, as knowledge represents the great pillar which supports the use of the same. Both the generation and the application of knowledge are important. The application of knowledge, in turn, should accompany the generation of knowledge, to ensure the knowledge is implemented in a competitive and accurate manner. Technological innovation arises, therefore, from the application of the knowledge generated at the institutions of education. Thus, innovation in the academic environment goes beyond the science of good quality and not “instead of” it. It is no coincidence that the major global centers of basic science are also the major centers of technological innovation. If we take the ten best universities in the world, we will see that they are not only the biggest producers of science, but also the ten which are most concerned and busy with technological innovation. So, how do we create a situation where technological innovation becomes part of the natural routine of the academic environment? First of all these activities should be well coordinated. Technological innovation must be a part of the day-to-day activities of the university. Researchers at these institutions need to be ready to use, whenever possible, their ideas and results for the good of society and not merely for the good of the evolution of knowledge. This is where the greatest innovations of all time are. Thus, an academic environment should feature sectors which generate technological activity on a daily basis. In the case of developing countries, such as Brazil, the practice of innovation through public universities it is very incipient and it needs to be enhanced through the adoption of specific measures. There is also a limited literature to be able to clarify how the universities of such countries practice innovation, demonstrating the importance of the results in this article to academia. Thus, seeking to contribute to scientific research, this work exposes the context Brazil and more specifically, the context of a Brazilian Public Univeridade and ways to practice and manage innovation. With regard to Brazil, the city of Sao Paulo today has the University of São Paulo (USP) and innovation management is the responsibility of Technological Innovation Center called Agency for Innovation, the function of which is to create an environment at the university geared to the practice of innovation, without competing with other activities or replacing the same. To the contrary, strengthening the generation of scientific knowledge and the training of human resources, while taking advantage of everything possible for the generation of technological innovation. Bolstered by this theoretical study, this paper aims to present and analyze as a brasileria public university can practice innovation and technological innovation challenges in order that the results may bring contributions to a theoretical and practical reflection on the role of public university in the form to manage their innovation in developing countries.",7
2.0,1.0,Brazilian Journal of Science and Technology,04 September 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40552-015-0010-3,Public policies and selective visual attention: the effectiveness of awareness messages among young people about the consumption of alcoholic beverages in Brazil,December 2015,Renê de Oliveira Joaquim dos Santos,Jorge Henrique Caldeira de Oliveira,Adriano Rogério Bruno Tech,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Since the 1990s, Brazil is among the five largest brewers in the world, with high per capita consumption and wide consumption among young people, representing almost 70 % of the national beer consumption (Rosa et al. 2006). The excessive alcohol consumption is associated with more than sixty types of diseases, directly or indirectly resulting from the uncontrolled alcohol intake and its continued excessive consumption. Diseases such as cirrhosis and cancer, mental disorders and aggressive behavior, and often these consequences go beyond the individuals themselves and cause damage to users’ families (Albuquerque et al. 2007; Boffetta and Hashibe 2006; D’Andrea et al. 2013; Eloah et al. 2013; Pöschl and Seitz 2004). In addition, there have been an increasing number of new customers in the age group of 12–18 years caused by family encouragement, positive associations made in the media or under the influence of friends encouraging consumption initiation and as a distorted form of reputation search among peers and closer interpersonal bonding. To control all these social and public health problems, measures and public policies have been developed in the world and in Brazil to prevent excessive and irresponsible alcohol consumption (Duailibi and Laranjeira 2007; Visser et al. 2013). One of these practices is the implementation of a Brazilian law prohibiting any alcohol concentration in the blood of drivers. Law 11.705, the “Dry law” of June 20, 2008, penalizes drivers caught driving under influence of alcohol (Malta et al. 2014). The penalty may consist of an administrative offense or even a criminal case, depending on the alcohol concentration. Two years after the implementation of the law, deaths caused by traffic accidents reduced by 6.2 % across the country, ranging in federal states proportionally to the intensity of supervision (Ministério da Saúde 2010). However, beverage industries use a great tool to increase the sales of their products, including beer advertisement. This is a powerful marketing tool and is part of the activities of creation and delivery of value to the customer. The marketing communication, including the use of new and more efficient technologies, plays the role of seeking, informing, persuading and reminding consumers, directly or indirectly, on the products and brands marketed by companies (Caswell 2004; Caswell and Maxwell 2005). The Americas Beverage Company (AmBev), the largest Brazilian brewing company responsible for producing some of the major beer brands (such as Brahma, Antarctica and Skol), was the fourth company to invest more in advertising in Brazil in 2011. The Petrópolis Brewery (producer of Itaipava and Crystal brands) was the sixth more investing company. Their spending patterns aimed at encouraging consumption reproduce every year. The sector is always among the top investors in advertisement in Brazil. In a movement to improve public health in Brazil, Law 9.294 was released in 1996. By means of visual warning communication, according to this law, companies must support the prevention of problems caused by alcohol and other harmful products, requiring a written warning against abuse. From that moment, all alcohol advertisements, smoking, drugs, therapies and others would contain phrases established by the Ministry of Health with warnings about the dangers of consuming the products. In the case of alcohol, phrases are: “don’t drink and drive”, “drink responsibly” and “product intended for adults” (Falcão and Rangel-S 2010). Despite the importance of this issue to public health, there are no studies on the effectiveness of warning communications and if the target audience was really appropriately exposed to warning messages. That is, it is not known whether the proposed goals of reading warning messages are met. The reading would be the first step for the law to reach the proposed goals. One of the best ways to answer this question is to use the Eye Tracking technology. Eye-trackers are systems that estimate the gaze direction of an individual, that is, this technology enables checking where the individual is looking at. This enables identified which parts of the stimulus attracted the consumer’s attention. Therefore, the eye-tracking is one of the most suitable techniques to understand how advertising incentives and warning messages are affecting consumer behavior, especially regarding the visual attention of these stimuli (Weigle and Banks 2008). Modern eye-tracking technology, where devices have high precision in tracking the human eye under specific stimuli, is used today as one of the main tools in Neuromarketing and Biofeedback studies, in which neural and physiological responses are analyzed in a scientific manner with equipment typically used in medicine and related areas (Oliveira et al. 2014). Eye-tracking provides different methods to understand consumer behavior and evaluate packaging design, promotions, product placement and store planning and enables testing the effectiveness of print ads, television commercials, sports marketing and others (Fiszman et al. 2013). Another example is the use of this technique to analyze the website designer, the correct distribution of the website content to improve the navigation of users and make it more attractive and interactive (Buscher et al. 2010). According to Velásquez (2013), eye movement can be divided into two categories; fixation movement, which is characterized as when the observer kept the gaze fixed at the stimulation point and the saccade movement, which represents the movement performed from one fixation to another. In this context, Nielsen and Pernice (2009) define fixation as the moment when the eyes are still on an object and one can see it in detail, while saccade corresponds to the rapid eye movements between two fixations. Each neuromarketing technique studies different responses. Positron emission tomography (PET), Magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and of course eye-tracking are among the main neuromarketing equipment. PET, MEG and EEG techniques are linked to brain anatomy images (Fugate 2007), while GSR identifies emotions based on the measurement of the electrical conductivity in the palms of hands and feet in the event of an imperceptible sweat (Montagu and Coles 1966; Oliveira et al. 2014). One of the great benefits of neuromarketing techniques is to provide tools to investigate intentions, behavior and reactions of consumers. By simply conducting an interview with the consumer after a stimulus, he or she is often not willing to reveal his emotional reasons and preferences and decisions or what really caught his attention (Fugate 2007), or possibly does not remember or was not aware of what really attracted his attention. Using Eye Tracking, these barriers are overcome, allowing us to understand exactly what happened or at least to have a more precise idea of behaviors and reactions. Social problems caused by excessive alcohol consumption has been a serious public health problem in many countries and in Brazil, bringing serious consequences for society in various aspects such as violence, diseases, accidents, increases in public spending and others (Almeida et al. 2013; Ferreira et al. 2011; Malta et al. 2014). Given the above, one may ask whether Law 9.294/96 is really useful as a measure to warn about excessive alcohol consumption. This study aims to understand the effectiveness of prevention and awareness messages to alcohol consumption in beer commercials by visual attention identification. Therefore, the main aim of this research was to verify at laboratory using high-precision equipment, the immediate effectiveness of warning messages regarding excessive alcohol consumption in beer advertisements. These warning messages are critical for changes of unsustainable and irresponsible behavior regarding excessive alcohol consumption. Without this step, many public prevention policies do not go to a next step of results, which would basically be the effective behavior change. Thus, two secondary objectives that supported the main objective were elaborated: To measure the viewing attention of young adults for warning visual stimuli in beer advertisements in an attempt to understand the visual behavior of individuals exposed to stimuli. To achieve this goal, two important visual attention data will be processed: duration of each fixation on areas of interest (AOIs)—the advertising regions linked to the brand, and total duration in all AOIs. To understand the level of memory and awareness of individuals that had just viewed images with warning messages. To achieve this goal, questionnaires were applied to understand the effectiveness of warning messages in the short-term memory of individuals exposed to stimuli.",2

These materials are important to our daily life with respect to their properties which enable human beings to construct buildings all around the world according to their mechanical strength, durability, water absorption or chemical resistance (Aubert et al. 2013). Sub-Saharan Africa countries have potential sources of clay deposits for which kaolinite is generally the main mineral associated among other with quartz, goethite, hematite, anatase and alkaline oxides (Yakoubi et al. 2006; Traoré et al. 2007). These last oxides require low temperature to melt and act as binders which link particles of clay during the sintering process. However clays with low alkaline oxide and great amount of iron oxide require high temperature for maturation so as to get suitable ceramic products (Aliprandi 1979; Sei et al. 2004; Elimbi et al. 2014). It is an appeal to reduce energy consumption and to protect our environment for sustainable development (Oti and Kinuthia 2012; Sultana et al. 2015). The world over, treatment and management of wastes is crucial (Suzuki and Tanaka 1997; Sultana et al. 2015). Studies referring to addition of low quantity of certain types of waste to clays in order to manufacture reliable ceramic products such as fired bricks remain of date (Zhang 2013). Waste glass must receive careful attention for environmental issues according to their non-biodegradable nature and can be recycling into new items. Waste glass can be utilized as flux to replace common fluxes such as feldspar or other mineral fluxes to save energy in ceramic manufacturing process (Bragança and Bergmann 2004; Rozenstrauha et al. 2006; Raimondo et al. 2007; Rambaldi et al. 2007; Andreola et al. 2008; Dondi et al. 2009; Djangang et al. 2014). The present study focused on determination of physical characteristics (such as linear shrinkage, water absorption, variation of color) and flexural strength of ceramics obtained at 750°C using waste glass and reddish yellow colored kaolinite clay whose composition contains high mass percentage of iron oxide and low mass percentage of alkaline oxides. However, waste glass is abundant and available especially in urban zones as consequence of daily activities. In spite of this, in many African countries and particularly in Cameroon, there is not always specialized industries in charge of collecting, storing and reusing of waste materials, while it can provide added economical benefits if waste glass can be converted to useful materials and be recycled (Rambaldi et al. 2007; Djangang et al. 2014). Hence this can make waste glass potential secondary input for traditional ceramics production. Such formulations are typically used to manufacture building materials such as fired bricks or roofing tiles. Clays are very common raw materials of such products and glass addition is the opportunity to reuse waste glass to lower maturation temperature in order to reduce the cost of production of these ceramic products in economic plan.",22

2.0,1.0,Brazilian Journal of Science and Technology,07 May 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40552-015-0007-y,The scientific information provided through patents and its limited use in scientific research at universities,December 2015,Cristiano Gonçalves Pereira,Rodrigo Ribeiro da Silva,Geciane Silveira Porto,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"According to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO World Intellectual Property Organization [2015]) a patent is an exclusive right granted by the State for an invention, which is a product or a process that provides, in general, a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. In return, the inventors agree to disclose all the technical information about the invention to the public in a patent application. Over twenty years ago, Rapp and Rozek ([1990]) proposed a link between the protection of intellectual property rights and a country’s economic development. They claimed that countries which have a well-structured patent system experience faster economic growth for three reasons: a) Patent rights stimulate economic growth, by enabling these countries to attract a larger influx of inventions as well as greater investment in innovative activities; b) Inadequate protection of industrial property rights is linked to economic underdevelopment; c) Patents and other protective mechanisms increase sales prospects and potential profit. These three types of categories involved in the process of innovation can take on different roles depending on the country, but their presence is essential for economic and technological development. Nowadays it has become clear that the strength and the appropriate type of intellectual property rights enhance innovation and economic growth. In developed countries, where the ability to conduct innovative research exists, the patent protection play more important role in innovation process than in developing countries, which the link innovation-economic growth is given by minor or incremental inventions based on utility models (Kim et al. [2012]). Most countries are massively investing on R&D activity aiming to reach a stable and sustainable growth based on innovation (Chen et al., [2013]). Universities play a critical role in the development and dissemination of new insights that have innovative and technological potential. The Government is also an important player as, subject to their policies, universities can function in an environment that favors collaboration on innovative projects, integrating technology-based enterprises including the creation of joint ventures with companies (Eun et al. [2006]). In addition to encouraging companies to hire graduates or post-graduates to lead R&D projects (Tödtling et al. 2009), or creating an environment which attracts new technology-based start-ups (Etzkowitz et al. [2005]). The research conducted at the university has provide a great improvements such as drug discovery (Toole and Czarnitzki, [2007]) and pharmaceutical innovation contributing to lower hospital cost and increased life expectancy (Lichtenberg [2007]). Moreover, the U.S. Biotechnology industries have been formed mostly influenced by the university research (Czarnitzki et al., [2011]; Zucker and Darby, [1997]). In Brazil, the management of Intellectual Property within Universities has deserved special attention in recent years, particularly after the Law of Innovation. According to Oliveira and Velho ([2009]), patents resulting from academic research were virtually non-existent before 1980. Up until 1996, the number of applications remained irregular and below fifty per year. Between 1997 and 2001, there was significant growth in the number of approved patents compared to the period directly before it. Meanwhile, it was during 2002–2007 when growth was even more marked, reaching around 350 approved patents resulting from academic research. Even though the growth in the number of patents for academic research and other sources is encouraging, the situation remains critical. Brazil is in 25th place in terms of the number of patents filed to the WIPO using PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) system, behind other emerging economies such as China (3th place), India (17th) and Russia (20st) (WIPO World Intellectual Property Organization [2013]). WIPO also record that among the BRICs nations, China went from occupying a marginal position a little over a decade ago to now occupying 3th place in the world rankings. Indeed, they filed 825,136 patents in 2013, which represents 32.1% of world total patents, ranking the top country of patents fillings in 2013. Brazil has undergone very slow growth recently; with only 1.5% increase in 2013 compared to previous year, with two universities among top three applicants, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) and Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). Despite all efforts, protecting inventions with patents at universities is still a fledgling practice: University researchers predominantly use electronic libraries of scientific articles, failing to take advantage of the wealth of content available in the patent database and to stay updated with regard to the state of technology in their respective research areas. It is beyond debate that a patent document is a formal source of scientific and technological information, as it allows access to technical and legal data of inventions. It is estimated that 70% of information contained in patent documents are not available in books, technical-scientific articles or any other medium of information (US Patent Trademark Office [1978]). For these reasons, this source contain much recent research into the state of technology of many different aspects of human development and it is of great relevance to the development of innovative research. Using patent databases means that duplication of research into technological innovations can be avoided as well as paving the way to identifying emerging or alternative technologies; providing a platform for commercial applications, showing, for instance, viable alternatives to acquiring technology. It allows the verification of technology availability in Brazil, avoiding litigation, as well as monitoring competing technology (Oliveira et al., [2005]). According to the Austrian Patent Organization (APO), around 30% of costs could be saved in the area of R&D in Europe by using information available in patent databases (WIPO and IFIA, [1998]). An estimate made by the European Patent Office (EPO and European Patent [2013]) showed that approximately US$20 billion are wasted in the European Community every year because of duplicate inventions. Based on the current context of the importance of universities to include the search for patents as a source of scientific and technological knowledge in their research projects, the enquiry arose for the study presented in this paper. Its main aim has been to assess patent applications in relation to new insights unearthed at universities, as contained in doctoral theses. It has tracked the efforts of those on the post-graduate program as well as other national and/or international research groups unconnected to this study. The objective was to monitor if there had been duplicate investments in research and to protect new discoveries via patents. This study examines the practice of intellectual protection within the Immunology program, which includes one of the Post-Graduate programs from Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto (FMRP/USP), awarded with the highest concept (number 7) on CAPES ranking (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education).",3
2.0,1.0,Brazilian Journal of Science and Technology,06 March 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40552-014-0006-4,Eco-innovation in the Brazilian sugar-ethanol industry: a case study,December 2015,David Ferreira Lopes Santos,Leonardo Fernando Cruz Basso,Vinicius Amorim Sobreiro,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The growing interest of the developed countries in eco-innovation lies in their commitments to the United Nations (UN) regarding greenhouse gas emissions during the meetings in Kyoto and Marrakesh (Hellström, [2007]; Zapata & Nieuwenhuis, [2009]; United Nations, [1998]). The literature has focused on the understanding of this society movement. Therefore, several authors have adopted different names to refer to environmental impact reduction-related innovations in business activities. Some examples are as follows: Environmental Innovation, Eco-innovation (Andersen, [2006]; Hellström, [2007]), Clean Innovation (Veugelers, [2012]), Green Innovation (Chang, [2011]; Dangelico & Pujari, [2010]), Sustainable Innovation (Barbieri et al. [2010]), Ecotechnology or Green Technology (Kobayashi et al. [2011]; Sarkar, [2013]). In this article, the term adopted was “eco-innovation”, as it has been largely adopted the in literature and technical reports. This term succeeds to cover the entire scope provided by the other terms (Schiederig et al. [2012]). Energy and fuel production-associated economic sectors are crucial to the efforts for global sustainability, due to their environmental impact and their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions caused by their activities. Therefore, the sugar-ethanol industry has become importance due to their power and fuel generation potential from renewable sources. In Brazil, the traditional benchmark has been the agricultural sector since its colonial period. Indeed, the country has been the top sugar producer and exporter in the world for a long time. In addition, the technology ownership of large-scale biofuel production (ethanol) and electricity generation (biomass) resulted in US$ 48 billion for the 2013 GDP, accounting for 1.2 million direct jobs (Zapata & Nieuwenhuis, [2009]; Gouvea & Kassicieh, [2012]; Neves & Trombin, [2014]). As the best renewable alternative to oil, the Brazilian sugarcane-derived ethanol has gained scope with the capacity to produce co-generate energy (electrical and thermal) in the same factory by processing sugarcane straw and bagasse (sugar and ethanol by products) (Santos et al. [2010]; Chandel et al. [2010]; Lima et al. [2012]; Hall et al. [2012]). Sugar, ethanol and electricity production consist of two macroactivities: agriculture and industry. The processes of which demand natural resources, such as water and soil, and material and energy resources. Also, labor conditions are often unhealthy and dangerous, and they generate a great amount of inert and hazardous waste. Therefore, even if the energy balance favors the sugar-ethanol industry, there are still several opportunities to enhance the companies’ economic, environmental and social sustainability. All things considered, this research aims to analyze the eco-innovation performance of a sugar-ethanol company located in São Paulo, Brazil, as its characteristics represent the technological stage of the Brazilian sugar-ethanol sector as a whole. For this purpose, an empirical approach was not adopted. Instead, a theoretical model was chosen for the analysis, in order to assess whether the variables mentioned in the literature were taken into account by the company management, and also to foster discussions for more extensive researches that would compare the companies and eventually build a historical series. Apart from its introduction, this article was organized as follows: the theoretical foundation that supports the model adopted for the case study analysis, as well as the technological stage, the boundaries of research, and innovation-related issues of the Brazilian sugar-ethanol industry. After that, the methodological procedures and conditions that shaped this research are described. The research outcomes are introduced and discussed in the following section; then, the conclusions and new opportunities for research are analyzed. The terminology “eco-innovation” was proposed in the mid-1990s, and it was first defined by Fussler & James (Fussler & James, [1996]; Schiederig et al. [2012]). Eco-innovation refers to a new product and/or process that adds value to an organization and simultaneously has lower environmental impact (Hellström, [2007]; Schiederig et al. [2012]; Sarkar, [2013]). According to Jansson ([2011]), eco-innovation is the creation of goods, processes, systems, services and procedures that can meet the human needs and improve the quality of life of the population with minimal use of natural resources and emissions of toxic substances. Eco-innovation is “eco-efficient” innovation, as its adoption or development in technology minimizes the “environmental footprint”. Therefore, eco-innovation efforts should take the life cycle of products into account, from the primary source of raw material to the final place of destination (Hellström, [2007]; Jansson, [2011]). The eco-innovation theoretical framework is still an ongoing process. In particular, the measurement and evaluation process through indicators is still incipient (Rennings & Wiggering, [1997]; Blum-Kusterer & Hussain, [2001]). It is highlighted as a management practice of eco-innovation Eco-innovation Observatory - EIO, the European Union, which monitors regional and national levels of efforts and results in eco-innovation. However, the indicators adopted by this organization are too broad, ideal for macroeconomic variables, but not for companies, as they provide several indicators, without defined patterns or typologies. The need to associate eco-innovative results and business performance is important to meet the sustainability dimensions proposed by Elkington ([1998]). Indeed, management models and systems for presentation of results such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) aim to guide the companies in order to promote their actions towards their employees, the society and the natural environment. Brazil has failed to produce company-level quantitative aggregated data regarding eco-innovation. Quantitative research in the country have used data from the Social Report - IBASE, environmental certification or data taken by case studies (Ceretta et al. [2009]; Bufoni, [2009]; Alberton and Costa [2007]; Oliveira et al. [2012]) and the variables used are many and the environmental and social outcomes as they relate to business performance is controversial results (Bufoni, [2009]). Because of this theory-practice gap, (Basso et al. [2013]) have suggested the model shown in Figure 1 as a measurement tool to provide a co-innovation index for the Brazillian companies. The authors report the difficulty in proposing and formulation of variables for the index as well as in obtaining the data. Concept Model of the Brazilian eco-innovation Index. Source: Adapted from (Basso et al. [2013], p. 12). This model introduces three latent dimensions (entrepreneur, environmental and social) to represent the eco-innovative results. It is similar to what has been suggested by Blum-Kusterer & Hussain ([2001]) and Chang ([2011]). However, the construction of the variables adopted by the authors differ. The variables suggested by (Basso et al. [2013]) have the advantage to collect quantitative results from the companies that adopt the GRI model in their reports, and need to report their actions and results for GHG emission, wastewater emission, solid waste, material consumption, energy consumption, work accidents, absenteeism and staff turnover (Global Reporting Initiative - GRI, [2013]). In the business dimension, the performance achieved through eco-innovation effort is theoretically supported in the studies by (Santos et al. [2014]), Ngo & O’Cass ([2013]) and (Bowen et al. [2010]). Nevertheless, for economic analysis purposes, profitability and market share-related variables may be obtained from the companies’ standard financial statements. The eco-innovation capacity, similarly to innovation, is a latent variable involving human capital, internal capital and relational capital. They refer to the variables associated with the number of technicians, graduates and postgraduates employees, internal R&D investment, training, machinery, marketing, management systems, R&D and external knowledge (Santos et al. [2014]). All things considered, the exploration model suggested here is based on empirical studies, and is aligned with the corporate sustainability dimensions. However, these suggested variables require a qualitative research that verify their capacity to support eco-business innovation, and to provide data for the development of a historical series or cross-section info for the sectors. The creation of models for the analysis of eco-innovation efforts and results in companies is aligned with several researches on innovation in different countries. These models succeeds to provide a better understanding of the current stage of the adopted strategies and the opportunities to be developed. The Brazilian industry moves toward the commitment of more environmentally “clean” and “balance” processes (Hall et al. [2012]). The Research on Technological Innovation (PINTEC/IBGE) has brought qualitative issues that commonly result in categorical data, e.g. distributed items such as “high”, “average”, “low” and “not relevant”, as for the environmental impacts of innovation (IBGE, [2010]). Figure 2 highlights the average evolution of the indicators published in the survey’s last three editions, considering the sectors rated as “high” regarding the impact of their innovations in that period. The Figure 2 also shows that the environmental impact of innovations in Brazil increased, the most significant being safety, environment and health-related items. Evolution of the environmental impacts of innovations in Brazil. Source: Based on data taken from the PINTEC/IBGE. This scenario is no different in the sugar-ethanol industry, as sugarcane is the one of the most traditional cultivations in Brazil. Indeed, it began with Brazil’s first settlers, and today is part of the economy of 21 Brazilian states, the country being the largest sugar producer and exporter in the world. The 2012/2013 harvest is expected to reach about 779.862.000 50 kg bags (Higman, [2000]; Informa Economics, [2013]). The efforts for sustainability-oriented innovation in the sugar-ethanol industry has been growing, involving different areas of knowledge in Brazil and other countries (Higman, [2000]; Shukla et al. [2004]; Banerjee, [2005]; Carvalho & Barbieri, [2010]; Chandel et al. [2010]; Ortiz et al. [2013]; Hall et al. [2012]). (Furtado et al. [2011]) point out that the prominence of the Brazilian industry in the international markets is not due to its natural resources, but rather a consolidated innovation system that began in 1930 and was boosted in the 1970s and 1980 because of the Proálcool Program (Banerjee, [2005]; Zapata & Nieuwenhuis, [2009]; Leopold, [2010]). The sugarcane chain has gained scale and scope. From its primary product, sugarcane, ethanol and electricity is generated. Nowadays, chemical and pharmaceutical companies have already developed projects and plans for biorefining. As a consequence, sugarcane-derived products have been replacing oil and natural gas-derived products (Banerjee, [2005]; Santos et al. [2010]; Chandel et al. [2010]). Due to the growing need to increase agricultural and industrial productivity, the companies need to develop and implement technologies to enhance the reutilization of waste, to reduce water, energy and material consumption, to reduce CO2 emission and, at the same time, to preserve the biodiversity surrounding the facilities and cultivated areas, as well as to ensure safe, healthy working conditions (Pires, [2008]; Cirani et al. [2010]; Santos et al. [2010]; Leopold, [2010]; Chandel et al. [2010]; Gomiero et al. [2010]; Spetic et al. [2012]). Figure 3 shows the emerging issues related to the sugar-ethanol industry, highlighted in a research proposed by (Spetic et al. [2012]), which corroborate the remarks already mentioned. Emerging themes in the sugarcane industry sustainability. Source: Adapted from (Spetic et al. [2012], p. 378). It is important to highlight that some sugar-ethanol companies are focusing their strategies on organic sugar production and, therefore, have adapted or are implementing processes, practices and lifecycle control that are more appropriate to sustainability (Carvalho & Barbieri, [2010]; Hall et al. [2012]). The development of the sugar-ethanol industry and its inherent technological and institutional apparatus have turned it into one of the most prominent sectors in the Brazilian economy. On the other hand, such statues requires the companies to develop technology and management methodologies aiming at the market competition (Banerjee, [2005]; Shikida et al. [2010]; Gouvea & Kassicieh, [2012]). Based on this scenario, this study focus on a topic that has gained scale among all layers of society. The industry studied here has the potential to meet the energy demands through renewable sources, and the potential to boost new business through innovative products that might be applied in several different industries.",8

These devices, which served exclusively as a way of communication, in the course of time have acquired new features, such as text messaging, access to media content, colorful touch screen, camera, etc. Recent releases of mobile phones, announced by the manufacturers and the media as “smartphones”, have ever more high technology embedded, and are true portable computers, where capabilities such as data processing and virtual memory increment with every new release. It is notorious also that other objective and subjective aspects critical to the full user satisfaction, studied in detail by Han et al. (2004), as weight, shape, finish, elegance, simplicity, among others, are still present in making the decision to purchase or not one of these devices. As a thermometer of smartphones representativeness in the global mobile phone market, smartphone world sales would achieve 918.6 million units, exceeding the conventional mobile phones in 2013 (Mlot 2013). The Brazilian market, fourth largest in number of smartphones in the world, would reach the milestone of 75 million units sold in 2013, and may even surpass Japan, which currently ranks third, behind China and the United States (Savitz 2012). As far as we try to understand decision making regarding smartphone acquisition, we need tools that help us to provide measures, which can consider factors and variables that allow differentiating devices. The importance of each of these variables can change significantly according to the profile of the consumer. It is also necessary that the information is both readily available and reliable. Performance assessment through best practice frontier is an attractive methodology, since it minimizes the subjective assumptions regarding weights assigned either to devices or to factors/variables. One linear programming based method that allows comparison across different units is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). However, technological homogeneity is one important assumption in DEA, since it allows direct comparison between operational units. By complying with this concept, we propose a multimethodology approach (Pessoa et al. 2015) that first applies cluster analysis to search for homogeneous clusters of smartphones, which still stand for consumer preference profiles. After that, we use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to assess the performance of units inside each cluster, thus providing smartphones assessment model that analyzes different alternatives of smartphones, appropriate to specific profiles to support smartphone consumers in decision-making. All the necessary information to feed the model is available through web recommendations systems. In late 1990s and early 2000s, the available devices on the market were traditional mobile phones, the first and second generation (1G and 2G). Preliminary studies aimed at determining critical aspects regarding user satisfaction, which is defined according to Han et al. (2004), as subjective feelings that users conceive in their mind about the image or impression on the product. They analyze the expressions of users in the form of adjectives and verbal phrases, representing subjective feelings, and from them, extracted 10 dimensions applied to evaluate user satisfaction with corresponding aspects in mobile phones. On the other hand, drawing a parallel between the use of smartphones and computers, some theories originated from Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) and Davis et al. (1989), namely the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) respectively. They focus on the use of subjective measures to predict, explain and increase user acceptance when using computers, which afforded several studies in the area of software selection and development of new information technologies. Işıklar and Büyüközkan (2007) propose product-related and user-related variables corresponding to aspects that influence the experience gained by the user in devices of the generation 2G, which already had color display, WAP access and camera, besides objective aspects quantified (specified) by the manufacturers. Two recent papers by Chen et al. (2010) and Akyene (2012) present assessments based solely on product-related variables. The latter included 10 different models of mobile phones that were assessed using 12 objective variables. In this study, the variables were grouped into categories, which are related to both the product and the user. Table 1 summarizes the variables used in each aforementioned study. The present study considers objective aspects previously quantified (specified) by the manufacturers through variables obtained from (Plant 2000) for the devices of the 2G generation, which had already a colorful screen, WAP access and camera. Besides literature review, the analysis of available data basis will support variable selection for the present assessment, however taking into account that we dropped the primary focus on the problem structuring in favor of data availability. The study also comprises the experience obtained by the user This section displays the information available in specialized mobile phone recommendation systems, preferentially existing in the web, in order to select the variables that we want to investigate. We will consider the following assumptions to distinguish between smartphones and traditional mobile phones. The devices included in the study are those that have touch screen with size between 2.5 and 6.9 inches, with a CPU and RAM memory capacities of at least 400 MHz and 140 MB, respectively, and must have advanced operating system, similar iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Symbian, or equivalent functional variety. These characteristics distinguish the smartphone from the conventional devices, regarding the considerable amount of existing mobile phones. We consider as a premise that the complete information for a particular device should be available in data basis. The following data basis were used: 
Buscapé Presents website prices for a number of products and online stores, which ranges from small traders to popular retail chains. This portal is present in over 20 countries in Latin America, receives30-million page views/month and has 11 million products (Naspers 1999). 
TestFreaks Recommendation system based on web, which aims to recommend products supported by subjective character assessment provided by consumers and experts, collected from websites or specialized magazines. Currently this system has 15 million reviews to 450,000 products (TestFreaks AB 2007). 
PassMark Hardware and software web-based benchmark system for performance of computers, and more recently, cell phones (PassMark Software 2013). It presents performance tests for smartphones comprising17 different tests grouped in five sets (CPU, Storage, RAM, 2D and 3D graphics). 
GSMArena Web-based system, which among other features, stores a fairly complete database of mobile phones, containing detailed specifications of handsets launched by most diverse manufacturers (GSMArena.com 2000). The operational task of organizing the dataset accordingly would require a great effort, since there are many manufacturers, each of them produce a large number of devices, and each device contains a web page with a lot of specifications. Therefore, we overcome this restriction by using software resources that performs this task automatically. We started the extraction of the specifications based on information for 982 devices from 17 manufacturers. After several crossings of information from different queried recommendation systems, we obtained complete information for122 smartphones from ten manufacturers: Acer (2) Apple (5) ASUS (1) HTC (23), Huawei (7), LG (19) Motorola (8) Pantech (1) Samsung (37) and Sony (19). Table 2 summarizes the available technical product-oriented variables and those that are easily perceived by the consumer. It should be noted that this study did not address product quality, technical support, respect to their consumers and socio-environmental variables, which can be used, as new data become available.",

This means that there are, at least, two ways of approaching its history. It is possible to consider, on the one hand, the traditional rituals that native Indigenous people, such as the Bororo and Kadiweu tribes, have practiced for more than 500 years. From this broad point of view, theatre and religion are intertwined in ceremonies that must help people to overcome the struggles of life and death. In all the diversity of rituals that celebrated events and milestones in Indian’s trajectories, there lies the basic principle of theatre: the transformation of one person into another. In a narrower perspective, Brazilian performing arts was born along with the Portuguese discovery in 1500. From this date on, theatre was used by the Catholic Church as a powerful tool of catechism of Indians and Africans. During the first decades of colonization, priests, like José de Anchieta (1534–1597), created some plays that were usually performed in Catholic festivities. Frequently written in three different languages (Portuguese, Spanish and Tupi), these plays staged the main Bible’s episodes in order to pacify Indian and African audience, showing them how to act and behave under the intense cultural imperialism of the colonial period. It was not until the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil that a formalized theatre has been established in the country. Escaping from the invasion of Lisbon by Napoleonic forces, Braganza Royal Family and its court departed for the Portuguese colony of Brazil in 1808. This “metropolitan reversal” that made Rio de Janeiro the capital of the Portuguese Kingdom and elevated Brazil to the same rank as Portugal, provided the basic structures for the development of the country’s theatrical production. Theatre, then, became not a tool of catechism, but one important device of the Romantic civilizatory project. Since then, performing arts have long played a vital and essential role in Brazilian culture. In the past two centuries, theatre directors, costume and light designers, dramatists, performers and other professionals created some of the country’s masterpieces (Heliodora 2013). Many European genres were adapted to Brazilian colors, such as the comedy of manners, created originally by Molière, then developed by Martins Pena (1815–1848). Artur de Azevedo (1855–1908) actualized the Revue, a multi-act popular theatrical entertainment, in plays of grand impact and success among the audience. In 1943, Nelson Rodrigues, one of the best of Brazilian playwrights, settled the milestone of Brazilian Modern Theatre with “Vestido de Noiva” (Wedding Dress). Nowadays, contemporary production have flourished due to the work of distinguished theatre directors such as José Celso Martinez Correa, Amir Haddad, Antunes Filho, Aderbal Freire-Filho, Enrique Diaz, Felipe Hirsch, Bia Lessa, Gerald Thomas, Roberto Alvim, Georgette Fadel, among others. Therefore, the cultural importance of Brazilian theatre is undeniable. Nevertheless, even from a broad or a narrow point of view of Brazilian theatre’s history, there has never been published a single book focused on the economics of its production. Why did that happen? One argument that justifies the lack of economical analyses on Brazilian theatre is what Ruth Towse call “facts for advocacy”: “the, to an economist, curious belief that policy can be influenced by the presentation of facts about that for which support is sought. This belief […] rests on the notion that ‘size counts’ – the bigger the item under investigation, the more it counts politically” (Towse 2000). Following the basic assumptions of William Baumol’s cost disease (Benhamou 2007), Brazilian theatre is not profitable. In contrast to the successful, long-running Broadway plays, most of the theatrical productions are subsidized by the government. Furthermore, they struggle to run theirs performances for more than 1 month. Folha de São Paulo’s 2014 survey shows that the average running of plays in São Paulo—one of the most productive clusters of Brazilian theatre—is 38 days (Fig. 1). From: Folha de São Paulo Average running of plays in São Paulo between 2014 July and 2014 October. Considering the “facts of advocacy”, it is possible to say that Brazilian theatre doesn’t count economically because its size doesn’t count. But the fact that this artistic manifestation does not profit regularly means that its size is null, so does it not deserve any economic investigations? Brazilian theatre is invisible from an economic point of view because of its “cost diseases”? Or, is it imperceptible because nobody have never been interested in perceiving it? The lack of information in the Performing Arts has made its economic perception often misunderstood. However, this field, as the whole cultural field, can present distinct and interesting features under the economic point of view. This paper attempts to assess and analyze the economics of Brazilian contemporary performing arts, focusing on financing and employment indicators. It aims to gather economic and cultural reports and to extract information related to performing arts, in order to collate their characteristics and evaluate its economic importance. The unavailability of such studies stimulated an interest in gathering data on the performing arts to help theatre policy-making in the future. Doing so, this article initiates to overcome the paradoxical situation: the lack of information about Brazilian theatre economics on the verge of Information Economy (Castells 2006).",
3.0,1.0,Brazilian Journal of Science and Technology,22 July 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40552-016-0032-5,"Creativity, Production Engineering and entertainment industry",December 2016,Vinícius Carvalho Cardoso,Gabriel Bouhid Barradas,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Flusser (2007) argues that by studying the history of factories one can understand the history of humanity, involving the lives, thoughts, actions and sufferings of the people. His work divides history into four manufacturing periods: in the first period—Hand—man uses his own hands to act in the world, being in direct contact with nature but being defenseless. In the second period—Tools—the man uses tools for the transformation of the natural world into the cultural world. During this period the man surrounds himself by tools, alienating himself from the world, getting protected from nature, but at the same being imprisoned by the culture he creates, thus becoming part of the cultural world. There is high mobility in these manufacturing processes since the factory exists wherever the man is. He can even make his own tools wherever he is and carry out his manufacturing activities, the tool being a replaceable and changeable object. The third period—Machines—is the one in which the tables are turned. Now the machine becomes constant, absorbing raw materials and turning them into cultural products, while the man becomes the replaceable variable—if man “breaks”, he is replaced. With this further step towards man’s alienation, the factory adopts fixed positioning, housing machines, as is still common today. It is in this industrial context that Production Engineering blooms, studying the organization and solutions for problems occurring in Machine Era factories. In recent years, however, humankind entered a new manufacturing period, the period of the Electronics. Unlike the machine, that is only capable of simulating the physiological functions of man, the electronics are focused on neurological functions, an attribute that brings major changes to production methods. First, in the current context, man once again becomes constant, but also the device occupies this position, they can only work together. Second, the trend in electronics is increasingly mobility, which returned a freedom to work of the man who had long ago been removed, the freedom of producing, at any given time, anywhere he is. Finally, these electronic devices require abstract learning, which can only be carried out from disciplines that still largely do not exist. So, after presenting this panorama, Flusser (2007) poses the question: what will factories be like in the future? We believe the factory of the future will be a place of creation and learning. As the factory during the period of the machines allowed the popularization of various goods and food from mass production systems—which not only improved, as it allowed people’s lives, being noteworthy the exponential population growth since the nineteenth century—electronic equipment free people to creative activities and mobility. Production Engineering must adapt and anticipate this new industrial paradigm, working in the gradual adaptation of existing organizations and the development of new organizations to the period of the devices. It is the role of the production engineer to study ways to better manage and organize the factory and the productive environment with a focus on creativity—a word that, due to its immaterial nature, still faces resistance in the field of engineering when it comes to management and organization, although, ironically, it is exactly the way the engineer operates. The engineer is already, by nature, a designer, and the difference between our current period and the former ones is precisely the popularization of the ability to design. In this paper, as illustrated in Fig. 1, we discuss the concepts of Organizational Creativity and its tight relationship with the future of Production Engineering. It is our belief, as presented in a brief discussion, that production engineers working and studying the entertainment industry may prove to be the first ones to enjoy this new trend. Some ideas for future studies linking classical production engineering subjects with the creative challenge are also presented.

As it is, we are witnessing changes in climate around various regions around the globe (Yavasli et al. 2015). These climatic changes have caused natural habitats that have existed for aeons to slowly disappear. Without a suitable environment in which to survive, many species have begun to go extinct (Allsopp et al. 2012). Around the world, researchers are concentrating on ways to protect not wildlife, but also the flora and fauna that support the existence of native wildlife. One of the most debilitating factors threatening conservation efforts are incidents of forest fires. The United States Forest Service and other similar agencies take this threat very seriously. Forest fires not only cause extensive damage in areas where these occur, but also influence weather patterns. With the help of applications developed based on Internet of Everything (Bradley et al. 2013) and Internet of Things (Biet 2014), increase in carbon monoxide levels can be detected in advance. Using data generated, researchers can provide visual cues to residents living in and around forested areas and to the public at large. For reasons related to health and safety, humans cannot be deployed in forest areas and especially in dry seasons where forest fires can break out without warning. Recording stations and posts are also somewhat limited when it comes to adaptability. Wireless sensor network technology is comparatively cheaper and more readily deployable. Further, the technology can be automated to collect information not only of the environment, but also of wildlife in motion. For these reasons alone, wireless sensor network technology can be a boon for researchers and agencies engaged in preservation and monitoring of wildlife in forests (Trifa et al. 2007). The challenges posed in operating in such conditions are significant. Camera traps are useful and provide important visual information. However, these cannot be deployed in significant numbers without incurring considerable costs. Cameras also required batteries to operate. While motion sensors can set off a camera for recording either still or video images, power consumption is quite high and, therefore, require frequent replenishments in the form of fresh batteries. Wireless sensors, on the other hand, have lower power requirements and can remain in the field for a longer period of time (Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2010). For any detection and monitoring system to be effective, it has to be relatively cheap and has to have a long life in practical conditions (Dyo et al. 2010). Therefore, the objective of implementing any wireless sensor technology is to be practical, reliable and self-aware. In combination with radio tracking collars and static sensors, WSN technology can help track movements of animals and continually monitor local weather and climatic conditions. Reducing maintenance costs involved in replacing batteries for sensors yields a longer life for the overall network. In our paper, we approach this aspect with the ultimate aim of sustaining network life and network throughput. We do so through a mix of deploying fixed and mobile sensors in a pre-determined ratio. This ratio is dependent on the application and eventual deployment conditions. We have designed a model in which information is relayed through a path which involves the least number of mobile sensors. We also take into account the possibility of premature death of a certain percentage of sensors. The technique we propose relies on this assumption and selects the best route suitable for sending information packet to the selected destination. Reducing the number of sensors involved for transmission, in turn, minimizes overall network power consumption. As a result, life of the network can be extended and a higher network duty cycle can be achieved. Consequently, researchers and agencies engaged in wildlife conservation can sift through larger amounts of data while keeping maintenance and investments under greater control. American biologist and explorer, Sylvia Earle, once remarked that wildlife was more abundant than the population of almost two billion human beings when she was born. The situation, she observed, is now reversed. While many others have tried to impress upon the need to conserve forests and protect wildlife in their natural environments, few have encapsulated this thinking more succinctly the way she has.",8

Despite of the widespread expansion and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) mainly in the last 20 years (Caird and Lane 2015), a relatively limited number of studies on the role of Distance Learning (DL) and Environmental Education (EE) is described in the literature, as can be seen in Fig. 1. A total of 78 articles have been published since 1996, with an increasing trend along the years (ISIS Web of Knowledge; Thomson Reuters). The majority of these articles are related to EE research (31 %), related to the study of specific didactic practices in order to build sustainability literacy. One of the articles that has the highest number of citations (n = 54) examines the impact of social presence on learning in function of the prevalence of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in education (Tu 2000a). Not surprisingly, the successful use of CMC in the classroom requires the selection of the correct medium and group specific instructional design, not replacing face-to-face communication, but provides a more flexible delivery and a greater selection of communication channels for online users (Tu 2000b). Number of papers containing the terms “Distance Learning” and “Environmental Education” by ISIS Web of Knowledge (January 1996 to December 2015) In fact, DL has a history of about two centuries and this time period represents significant changes in how learning takes place and how it is communicated. From writing letters through postal service to the large variety of tools available on the internet, society has embraced new ways and patterns of communication along the years. As computers became more involved in these processes since the 1980’s, a proposed definition for DL is the delivery of instructional materials using both print and electronic media, including an instructor who can be physically located in a different place from the learner, as well as possibly providing the instruction at disparate times with diverse forms of materials (Moore et al. 2011). According to Diamond and Irwin (2013), DL is an important niche to be studied, which can provide effective and imaginative educational ways to embed student sustainability literacy (SL), especially in majors such as engineering, in which the technical training is a preponderant feature. The SL enables someone having the understanding, abilities and attitudes to take informed action for the benefit of themselves and others, presently and into a long-term future. More recently, some initiatives to include green issues using DL and its communication technologies in environmental engineering undergraduate courses have been reported. A program offered by the University of Cincinnati, USA, combining an integrated BS in civil engineering and an MS in environmental engineering with DL extensive practical cooperative education experience was described by Bishop et al. (2004). The authors argue that the result was well-trained graduates who received higher pay and more challenging career opportunities, beyond those from traditional engineering programs. Brenner et al. (2005) analised the simulation of the oxygen-sag model to demonstrate the potential benefits of the application of friendly numerical software packages in environmental engineering education and practice. The use of such software tools (as POLYMATH) encouraged the students to ask open questions. An approach based on undergraduate student survey methodology by DL at the Department of Process and Environmental Engineering, University of Oulu, Finland, was described by Huuhtanen et al. (2008). Discendum Optima was the learning tool developed to conduct online studying and teaching, as a support for campus-lessons and as a web-based environment for DL. The findings were that the students and lecturers see as the main benefits of DL those related to course management, material logistics and the use of new, more illustrative education methods (simulations and animations). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study introducing EE via DL in an environmental engineering undergraduate course in Brazil, highlighting the research educational aspects related to the role, possibilities and areas for improvement according to the student´s view. Torres (2002) states that the close relation between engineering field and productive sectors demands that the education of the professionals in these areas fulfill the needs of the market, although the resolution CNE/CES n.11/2002 of the Ministry of Education advocates that the undergraduates at such majors should be able to “(…) develop new technologies, stimulate their critical and creative actions in identifying and resolving problems, considering political, economical, social, environmental and cultural aspects with ethical and humanistic views in order to respond to the needs of the society” (Brazil 2002). This means that the professionals should be educated beyond the technical sphere, which allows them to reflect on the political, economical, social and environmental implications of techno-scientific products in the society, enabling them to act professionally in a more critical manner and coherent with the contemporary needs. The main mission of the paper is to assess the critical EE effectiveness through DL by a case study conducted at Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), Brazil, taking into account the student´s understanding of the sustainability and EE concepts. Thus, the main research question is: which potentialities and limitations has an EE module in a DL environmental engineering undergraduate course toward a critical education according to the students? The Critical Theory referential adopted in this research brings an important contribution to understanding current society, especially the influence that science and technology dimensions exerts as productive forces, which can promote a scenario of inequalities and socio-environmental degradation (Adorno and Horkeimer 1985; Zuin 2012). Such reality may be understood by the private appropriation of natural resources, which are submitted to the only logic of production. A very elucidative example of this argument is presented by Maar (1995, p. 15): “What to say of a world in which hunger is overwhelming while, from a scientific-technical point of view, it could have already been eliminated? Or else: how could such a scientifically developed world exhibit so much misery? Adorno and Horkeimer (1985) understand that the techno-scientific progress not only functions as the main productive force of the system, but also has ideological functions. Science and technology are fetichised, interpreted as objectives in themselves, while nature is understood as a mere resource at the will of human needs. Marcuse (1998) defends that they hold the function of legitimating this system, since they have the promise of well-being and happiness through what they can produce. Therefore, the training engendered by the productive system obeys this logic and aims at the production of adapted students to the detriment of cultural formation, which lead the individual to reflexion and freedom of thoughts. However, several authors defend the need to develop higher education courses that overcomes that logic and takes into consideration the historic relation between mankind, nature and the values that permeate this relation in current society. Environmental Education (EE) in its critical current is a questioning alternative of the formative model, which takes to a superficial understanding of the socio-environmental crisis as well as the adoption of scarcely effective proposals for tackling those problems. The so-called technicist EE tends to blame the individuals for environmental problems without questioning the system in which they are inserted and the complex dynamics which determine them (Guimarães 2004). For Loureiro (2012), this facet shows the instrumentalisation of life and supremacy of techno-science and thus perpetuates not only the current system but also human alienation once it praises technique in a non-critical way. The distancing between social theories and environmental matters leads to consolidation of a system that is based on managing natural resources and searching for the resolution of immediate problems without considering the complex relations among science, technology and society in a historically situated manner. Sauvé (2005) presented a typology of the different practical and theoretical propositions in the form of 15 currents of EE, i.e., general ways of envisioning and practicing them. Some categories have a longer history, as are the cases of naturalist and conservationist currents (more centered on human relationships with nature; centered on resource “conservation,” in terms of quantity and quality). For the last one, the main EE programs are based around the classic three R’s or those rooted in environmental management concerns (water, waste or energy management). On the other hand, critical-oriented EE defends that a radical transformation of the relation between the individual and its natural and constructed environment implies in a structural transformation of the society itself, leading to understanding the complexity of such relations and enabling the social actors to intervene in this reality in an adequate and just manner (Loureiro 2012). For Guimarães (2004), a new practice may take place through praxis, i.e., dynamics in which reflexion supports practice, enabling the construction of a new understanding of the world. This movement, in its turn, must be made in a collective participation environment, relating to each other and not isolatedly. In this paper it is understood that the insertion of critical EE at HEIs corresponds (1) to a curricular environmentalisation encompassing sustainability literacy; (2) which nature is a complex interlinked dynamic system, and life its process of self-organization; (3) humans are natural beings who can redefine the way of existing in nature by cultural dynamics; (4) human beings are historical and social individuals, multiply constituted; (5) education is a praxis, in a dialogical process of objective and subjective states of reality; (6) social transformation aims at building democratic sustainable societies, which are ecologically prudent, fair, economically feasible and posses cultural diversity (Zuin 2012). These are the references and principles that guided this research and offered subsidies to investigate the formative processes of the students of the DL in environmental engineering at UFSCar from the EE module. At UFSCar, the target course is offered as DL, having started  its activities in September 2007 and with the first group graduated in 2012. This is the first undergraduate course in environmental engineering offered by a public HEI as DL in Brazil, and recently it has been recognised by the council in the area CREA/SP as a model for the registration of new courses as DL (UFSCar 2014). It has the aim of forming a professional who is able to act in conservation, preservation and management of environmental resources, to develop projects to control environmental impacts, to aid in recovering degraded areas and in reforesting projects, besides developing strategies in EE. In order to do that, the student must have a general formation, founded on biology and engineering fields and with strong social and ethical bases (UFSCar 2013). The 6-year course is composed by a fixed number of core modules divided in 12 semesters, totalising 71 components such as DL, digital literacy, introduction to environmental engineering, Biology, Chemistry, EE being offered in the third semester. The EE module is the main drive for the humanistic background of this course, and it aims at educating professionals qualified to analyse and diagnose environmental problems, to identify their causes and to adopt preventive and correcting measures facing future risks and environmental damages. The lecturer has the responsibility to plan and prepare the module, continuously coordinate the team of tutors and students and, the tutors in their turn, are in charge of the accompanying and supervising teaching and learning processes of a group with 25–30 students. Therefore, this research aims to analyse the limits of an EE module so that it enables a critical education of undergraduates in DL environmental engineering at UFSCar according to their views, which are consistent with the theoretical and methodological references adopted in this work. A case study was proposed based on the assessment of the writing production of students, their answers for questionnaire surveys and the final intervention project, using analysis content to identify their conceptions about sustainability and EE. A framework of 3 main didactic movements conducted by one of the authors during the application of the EE module, who was also a tutor of 21 students from a total of 195, was proposed as a basis for the present investigation.",

Becker,Maria Kowald,Female,Unknown,Female,Female,"One of the main issues discussed today refers to striving for sustainability. The argument in favor of a change is not new but has been on the agenda for at least 50 years (Gadotti 2008) on international, national and local levels. To Chalkley and Sterling (2011, p. 672), “the transition of society towards sustainability cannot be left to a handful of experts in sustainability, but will require a major transformation that affects all sectors of society and requires contributions from a wide range of professions and organizations”. According to Wals and Jickling (2002), a serious didactic reorientation is needed, to identify, test and implement new and different ways of learning and teaching. Moreover, it becomes more and more important to consider local contexts of the intervention to be performed successfully. According to Sidiropoulos (2013), each person or group interprets sustainability through their own value lens, thus promoting messages of sustainability need to be positioned according to the receptivity of the audience. There are multiple definitions of Education for sustainability (EfS). Yet a common train of thought appears to be the notion of enabling transformative change (see, for example, Cloud 2014). For example, one of the goals of education for sustainability is to instigate behavioral change (Moore 2005). However, the reference to education is not the same as of the last century, a reorientation of existing education needs to take place, taking into account principles and guiding practices of sustainability (Brunton 2006). There appears to be a distinctive need to better integrate formal and non-formal education, higher education, distance and online education, always adjusting for the various educational target groups. With specific reference to SIDS, Crossley and Sprague (2013: 94) argue that “there is much that the wider international community can learn from the ESD [Education for Sustainable Development; the author] experience of Small Island Developing States”. Paulo Freire (2013, p. 121) argues that it is necessary, above all, “that the student [who can be anyone; the author] takes the role of producer of his intelligence of the world and not just the recipient of transferred to it by the teacher”. Harris et al. (2010) underscore the relevance of new forms of participation to revitalize interest in the processes of democratic decision-making, and also sensitize learners and teachers to emerging forms of participation, new ways to develop and express identities. Sustainability, according to Sidiropoulos (2013, p. 10) “is a journey of learning and each educational intervention contributes to building a greater understanding and guidance”. Thus, there is not only an urgent need to understand how new knowledge emerges, but also how this new knowledge can be transferred and implemented to foster societal transformation and enable the world to finally enter a sustainable development pathway. After briefly introducing the underlying methodology, i.e. case study research, this paper will briefly outline the relevance of sustainable energy for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and current and emerging socio-economic challenges and opportunities for the sustainable development of SIDS. Moreover, this paper recalls the main theoretical concepts of capacity-building, international technology transfer as well as life-long learning in the field of energy and outlines their relevance in a SIDS context. Thirdly, a specific case study addressing key themes of education for sustainability (EfS) will be discussed and common entry points for sustainable lifelong learning and capacity-building programs focusing on themes such as energy access, energy security and energy efficiency are identified. Finally, it will be discussed to which extent these examples may resemble replicable solutions to further education on sustainable energy in SIDS, and some recommendations for further development of lifelong learning activities in SIDS will be given.",6

The subject of creative economy has been at the focus of discussions in international organizations and communities in recent decades, highlighting itself as strategic for the economic and social development and growth of both developed and developing countries. The academic community has expanded this debate beyond fundamental reflections in an effort to achieve a greater understanding of the concepts involved, their impacts, and their limits within each country’s historical, political, economic, social and cultural contexts. Emerging in the last decade of the twentieth century, the concept of creative economy—an economic system based on the synthesis between economics, culture, science and technology—has gradually gained recognition as an increasing number of individuals and organizations come to understand creativity as a motor that fuels development processes (UNCTAD 2010). From a sectorial perspective, creative economy is understood by many as an expansion of cultural economy because, in addition to encompassing the traditional cultural sectors (music, dance, circus, visual arts etc.), creative economy also includes sectors related to information and communication technologies (such as digital games, animation, and software development) as well as culturally-based sectors related to traditional industries (such as fashion, design, architecture, and advertising). As an alternative model of development, creative economy converges with the concept of “Economy of Experience” to surpass a model based on the production of commodities in favor of assuming a model in which goods and services have as their main value their aesthetic-symbolic nature and their capacity to create experiences rather than just products (Kamel and Souza 2012). If on one hand this “new economy” is understood within a post-industrial context as a propeller of growth in developing countries and defended as a solution to the challenges of economic repositioning, creative economy is on the other hand regarded with suspicion due to the tensions and fears it raises about the production of and access to culture as well as the commercialization of goods and services, the latter of which submits creative goods and services to a purely mercantile logic (Bendassolli et al. 2009). In this way, the debates, discourses, and narratives surrounding creative economies makes itself present in both technical and academic publications. At times the discourse is in favor of creative economies and of the possible development and growth it can foster. At others, however, the creative economy is criticized for catalyzing exclusionary and neo-liberal policies that are subjected to mercantile market practices. The debate has thus revolved around reflections about the polarisations and conceptual confusions surrounding the identification of characteristics of the creative economy and the definitions and implications of creative economy, cultural economy, and related topics such as cultural industries, creative industries, creative cities, and creative classes. Although still growing, the academic bibliography produced on the subject of creative economy represents the beginning of a reflection that invites more discussion and research, especially given the extent and the ambiguity of the theme. Considering the publications classified by the Qualis System of the Coordination of the Improvement of Higher Level Personnel (Sistema Qualis da Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—CAPES), one notices a prevalence of articles that deal with aspects within the scope of the subject matter. More specifically, there is a plethora of case studies that present sectoral analyses, the development of management strategies, and the strengthening of entrepreneurial ventures in cultural and creative sectors. The objective of this article is to analyze the bibliography produced on the subject of creative economy, identifying research and research methodologies used in [these] reflections on the creative economy, and sub-themes related to creative economy (creative industries, cultural industries, creative cities, creative classes, innovation, education and professional development among others). This bibliographic research was conducted in the database Portal Capes in journals whose classification, according to Qualis criteria, complied with the following categories: A1, A2, B1 and B2. The use of these criteria for the selection of articles and periodicals was intended to ensure that the articles were selected and analyzed in accordance with the high quality standards and requirements of academic production. This work is structured in four parts: the first corresponds to an introduction to the theme of creative economy[economies], consisting of a brief history of the main concepts and public policies formulated in the world and in Brazil; the second presents the methodology used for this bibliographic research, identifying criteria and information sources used; the third presents an analysis of the panorama of the studies, research methodologies, and debates on and surrounding creative economies, indicating both central and sub-themes; finally, the fourth part refers to the conclusions of this study, indicating/pointing to opportunities for the advancement of studies on creative economy and related sub-themes. When we analyze the history and evolution of the concepts associated with the theme of the creative economy in the world, we can see how creative economy has been increasingly understood as a viable measure of growth for both emerging and developed countries. More people are beginning to consider creative economy as a function of public policies that have drawn inspiration from concepts such as creativity, sustainability, cultural diversity and innovation. The creative economy is perceived as an economy based on abundance rather than on the scarcity of resources. This is because the its main inputs—creativity and human knowledge—are infinite. The creative economy’s greatest value is its association with a diversity of cultural expressions in different localities and regions. The creative economy is collaborative because it consists of a series of arrangements between persons, institutions and governments, and increasingly potent because it reconciles national strategies with global international processes. Australia is considered by many as the founding father of creative economy. In 1994, the Australian Government, as part of an initiative of the Ministry of Culture, coined the concept of Creative Nation as the basis of a policy geared towards upgrading the role of the State in the cultural development of the country. At the core of this policy is the Australian Government’s responsibility to foster and increase access to Australian culture at a national level, ensuring that: (1) innovation and ideas are continually encouraged; (2) self-expression and creativity are nurtured; (3) patrimony and the development of patrimony is preserved, and (4) all Australians have the opportunity to participate in and benefit from the creative economy, all of which will invigorate national life and uplift Australian citizens. The Creative Nation policy has expanded considerably since its inception. Between 1994 and 1995, the Department of Communications and Arts expanded the role of the Creative Nation policy and direct expenditure for this new economy was estimated at over a billion [australian] dollars (Australia 2013). Beyond the Office of the Prime Minister, additional funding for Australian cultural development was provided through other means, including external relations, trade, education, employment, environment, and sport. The intended objectives of this cultural development policy fall into five main categories: nurture creativity and excellence allow all Australians to enjoy as many cultural experiences as possible preserving the patrimony of Australia promote the expression of cultural identity and diversity of Australia promote sustainable development and creative industries, including those that evolve with the emergence of new technologies. 
Creative Nation quickly gained recognition among the academic and economic world and ended up reaching the United Kingdom. It was brought to England by New Labour, a programme for the renewal of the Labour Party who, in their 1997 pre-election manifesto, identified creative industries as a particular sector of the economy and recognized the need for specific public policies that tapped into its growth potential. Between 2007 and 2010, then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown established a Department of Creative Industries and Tourism under the Ministry of Culture, Media, and Sport (Corazza 2013). The Creative Economy Programme identifies the creative sectors with the highest growth rates and clarifies the distinctions between economic and cultural objectives. In addition, the Department of Creative Industries and Tourism created “Centers of Excellence” for creativity/innovation in all regions of the UK. A third focal point of this program was the analysis of the legal frameworks of intellectual property and their impact on how the private initiative and society are able to reconcile their diverging interests. While on one hand, there is a growing movement focused on increasing digital rights and measures of protection of technical intellectual property from easier and often illegal ways to access and use digital content, on the other hand there is public interest in promoting greater and more affordable access to this digital content. The success of Australia and the UK’s creative economies led to the development and implementation of public policies for creative industries throughout the world. In 2008, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) launched the first world report on the creative economy, Creative Economy Report, in an effort to compile information/data on the creative economy from a global perspective/within a global context. This report was a milestone in the recognition of the strategic relevance of creative economy as a vector for development with a promising average annual growth mean of 10%. In 2010, the UNCTAD released a second edition of the report, expanding an already lively discussion of the importance, relevance, and feasibility of creative economy. The creative economy is a horizontal, evolving concept based on creative assets that can potentially generate economic growth and development. It can stimulate the generation of income, the creation of jobs and the exporting/exportation/export of profit, simultaneously promoting social inclusion, cultural diversity and human development. It embraces economic, cultural and social aspects that interact with the objectives of technology, intellectual property and tourism. It works in conjunction with a set of economic activities based on knowledge, with an/the added dimension of development and interconnections on both macro and micro levels for the economy in general. It is a viable development option that demands politically innovative and multidisciplinary answers in addition to interministerial action. “At the center of the creative economy, there is creative industry/Creative industries are at the center of the creative economy.” (UNCTAD 2010, p. 10) Creative industries—the core of creative economy—are sustained by public policies and systems of classification that vary by country. The Fig. 1 below outlines the classification proposed by UNCTAD. 
Source: UNCTAD (2010, p. 8) UNCTAD classification(s) for creative industries. According to UNCTAD (2010, p. 8), creative industries: Are cycles of creation, production and distribution of products and services that use creativity and intellectual capital as primary inputs; Constitute a series of activities based on knowledge centered, among other things, in the arts, which potentially generate profit and intellectual property rights; Constitute tangible products and intellectual or artistic intangible services with creative content, economic value and market goals. Position themselves at the crossroads of artistic, service-oriented, and industrial sectors; Constitute a new, dynamic sector in the world market. A remarkable fact about the creative economy during this period is that exports of creative goods and services kept growing in spite of the world financial crisis in 2008, which caused a decrease (word choice) in the international market. World exports of creative products and services reached a revenue of $592 billion in 2008—more than the double the amount reached in 2002—which indicates an annual growth rate of 14% over six consecutive years. These numbers are evidence of the fact that creative industries present an enormous potential for developing countries that seek to diversify their economies and take a leap into one of the most dynamic sectors of world economy. That being said, Brazil is still incipient in its data production on creative economies. The Federation of the Industries of Rio de Janeiro State [Federação das Indústrias do Estado do Rio de Janeiro—FIRJAN] (2013) realized in 2008 a pioneer study called “The Creative Industry Chain in Brazil” as a Brazil’s first exercise in economic data projection, produced from data by the Brazilian Geographic and Statistical Institute [Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística—IBGE] and from data extracted from the Annual Relation on Social Information [Relação Anual de Informações Sociais—RAIS] (Ministry of Work and Employment). By 2012, a complement of this research that considered database information from 2011 was published considered the database information of 2011. Analysing the following Table 1,
 it may be verified the percentual contribution of the creative sectors’ GDP in the formation of different countries’ total GDP, including Brazil’s. It is interesting to note that, even without precise data about Brazil, the country already figures in the fifth position on the ranking presented below. In 2014, FIRJAN launched a new study, the Creative Industries Mapping in Brazil, where it is shown info and data that express the evolution of creative field in Brazil from 2004 to 2013. The share of GDP of creative sectors on Brazil’s entire GDP, in this decade, has gradually grown reaching the point of 2.6% in 2013, as it can be seen on the following Fig. 2.
 
Source: FIRJAN (2014) Estimated creative GDP and and its participation on Brazil’s total GDP (2004–2013). Considering the fact that FIRJAN’s research is based on formal data on the creative economy, it is likely that creative economy’s contribution to GDP would be even greater if it also considered data obtained from productive sectors of the informal economy. In any case, data on the formal market are meaningful and shows already the strength of an economy that has only been growing on. The Creative Industries’ Mapping in Brazil (FIRJAN 2014), presents relevant data that demands more attention, relatively to the participation of creative employees in the total amount of employees per state in the country as well as the median monthly income of these professional. According to Graphic 3, the two states with bigger percentual participation—as expected—are Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. In 2014, FIRJAN launched The Mapping of Creative Industries in Brazil (FIRJAN 2014), a study that presents the growth in both the number and the median monthly income of employees working in creative fields in Brazil from 2004 to 2013. According to Fig. 3, the two states with biggest percentual participation are—as expected—Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. 
Source: FIRJAN (2014) Participation of creative employees on the total amount of employees in the State (2004–2013). Illustrating the median monthly income of professionals working in Brazil’s cultural and creative sector, Fig. 4 shows that there was significant growth in practically all Brazilian states between 2004 and 2013. 
Source: FIRJAN (2014) Creative professionals’ median monthly income, per state in 2004 and 2013. A comprehensive approach to the economic evolution of creative sectors in Brazil requires an understanding of the evolution of cultural consumption. The Fig. 5 below shows a study of FGV Projetos (2015) produced a study on the economic aspects of Brazilian culture and noticed an increase of $ 1 billion in Brazilian consumption of culture between 2003 and 2009. 
Source: FGV Projetos (2015) Culture’s area consumption—comparison between 2003 and 2009. Both FGV and FIRJAN base their studies off of data on the formal market. However, if their data considered the cultural consumption generated by creative sectors of the informal economy,
 we would see that Brazilian creative economy is much bigger than the studies show. The power and potential of the Brazilian creative economy is clear. The data presented above demonstrate its gradual growth and strengthening despite its being limited to an economy generated by formalized organizations that are recognized as legal entities. In practice, many entrepreneurs and professionals in creative sectors operate in the informal economy, which was not captured by these surveys. The impact of creative sectors in Brazil is thus underestimated as to their real economic movement. The informality in most of these cases occurs due to the immaturity of legal and institutional frameworks of these sectors and as a result of the relative lack of public policies and investments needed for the strengthening of the Brazilian creative economy, whether at the federal, state or municipal level. Despite the strategic potential of culture as a vector of development in the country, public cultural policies in Brazil still have a long way to go. From 2003 onwards, with Gilberto Gil as the Minister of Culture, there has been a widening of the conceptual scope and acting of this Ministry. There has been a wide process of empowerment in Brazilian civil society that gave birth to the National Plan of Culture [Plano Nacional de Cultura—PNC], instituted by the law 12.243 in 2 December 2010. This document defines the concept of culture through a symbolic, civic and economic dimensions. The subject of creative economy emerged in Brazil in 2004 during the XI Conference of UNCTAD in São Paulo via a panel dedicated exclusively to the question of creative industries from the perspective of developing countries. Nevertheless, the institutionalization of public policies in this field has been but gradual, reaching its peak with the creation of the Ministry of Culture’s Secretary of Creative Economy. During the realization of its 2011 Strategic Plan, the Secretary of Creative Economy [Secretaria de Economia Criativa—SEC] defined cultural diversity, sustainability, social inclusion and innovation as its principles for the formulation process of public policies for Brazilian creative economy. This “Brazilian creative economy” should be structured according to the comprehension of the need for the drafting of an endogenous model of development, one which would consider Brazil’s characteristics and specificities as well those of its regions. The “importation” of international development models was soon discarded, although some references have been considered and adjusted to the Brazilian reality. Although countries face common challenges regarding the theme of the creative economy, it is important to understand and identify the different stages and specific characteristics related to each country in order to formulate and implement effective, consistent, and structural policies. However, the need to deepen the subject is imperative, especially considering the complexity of a field of studies whose transversality constitutes both its virtue and fragility. The methodology used for the development of this work is of a qualitative nature, and descriptive as well as exploratory. The growing relevance of the creative economy has sparked a lot of bibliographic research, much of which is available on the CAPES online database. Because it is a recent subject and because of its multidisciplinary nature, it has been treated by researchers from different knowledge areas that end up publishing in periodicals from the most distinct areas. Therefore, the choose to realize a survey on the articles through the “search by subject” mechanism in the CAPES ‘website’, being distinguished the following expressions associated with the theme: creative economy, creative industries, creative cities, creative classes, public policies on culture and creative economy. According to this procedure, it has been identified 58 publications, composed by 3 doctoral thesis, 2 dissertations and 53 scientific articles. This bibliographic research was conducted using articles published by the CAPES Integrated System [Sistema Integrado CAPES—SICAPES] and classified into the following categories: A1, A2, B1 and B2. Of the 53 identified articles, 36 were published in periodicals within these categories, 19 were national, and 17 were international. These 36 selected articles were then analysed one by one according to their themes, subthemes, objectives, and research methodologies so as to identify which aspects of creative economy were prioritized by researchers in the field. These analyses drew from the panorama of the most common research methodologies with the hope of shedding light on the areas that lacked depth and discussion as well as on methodologies that may be used in the future. Of the 36 selected articles, 4 institutional documents were published by the governments of Brazil (Ministry of Culture) and Australia (Australia Council of Arts), 3 research reports by the Rio de Janeiro Federal Industries [Federação das Indústrias do Rio de Janeiro—FIRJAN], one by Getúlio Vargas Foundation [Fundação Getúlio Vargas—FGV] (FGV Projetos), and two by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).",4

The sociologist Domenico de Masi summarizes this concept: “(…) The workers – increasingly cultured, specialized and educated – would be ready for these creativity tasks if their intellectual fertility was not frequently castrated by an outdated industrial organization, that still enforces them to follow rules that were made a hundred years ago, focusing semiliterate operators responsible for the assembly line and already widely unsuitable to impregnate the invention continually intended by the market’s rapaciousness for new products” (De Masi 2003, 2005). Christensen et al. (2006) says that around the world, countries, individuals and organizations spend a significantly amount of Money trying to solve social problems—many times in vain. However, how to explain bad results? Such organizations rarely affect a larger population, satisfactory with simpler solutions. “The disruptive innovation model overturns any sector, by bringing simpler alternatives, however satisfactory, to an underserved group.” It touches a large range of organizations and economic sectors, clearly indispensable in times which technological race improves its practices and interpretations of daily life. And in fact we should seek simpler measures to improve social repercussion”. The flexible capitalism in our days corrodes personality and weakens the values once fundamental (Sennett 2000). We are producers, and, at the same time, victims of a regimen imposed in an authoritarian way, where corporate and personal happiness are taken for granted in order to maximize profits, no matter what. Sennett describes in its own “Corrosion of Character” the path to follow to become “healthily self-sufficient, based on its own time control”. He considers work routine the flexibility and legitimacy of work and life ethics. The typical worker’s alienation of the capitalism model of production is a key factor to understanding this system, characterized by the existence of private property, division of manual and intellectual work and the usage of the work as a commodity submitted to the laws of the market (Marx 2013). Therefore, there is a contrast between the working class and the means of production’s owners, once there is a conflict between classes when it comes to values and objectives. A panorama of incredibility and lack of openness, hence, is created, stimulating the standardization not only of the work that was concretely done, but also of the social relationships maintained in the working environment. The latter, in this way, tends to be considered something beyond the true life, the one enjoyed when the working hours are over, which blocks creativity and innovation and delegitimizes the concept of happiness in the workplace. This research intends to infer how the relations between innovation and creativity affect corporate happiness management. Further, seeks to identify in the so-called innovative and creative professions the drive of this vocational sense in the new Entertainment Engineering research area (Kamel 2006, 2012; Vogel 2011; Wolf 2003) and which of it can be expanded to other areas of knowledge.",12
