The technical and conceptual issues raised in the extensions of the Schmeidler/Mas-Colell frameworks to the incomplete information or differential games raise few technical issues.Footnote 1 For example, in large games with incomplete information, exact laws of large numbers (ELLN) for a continuum of random variables are typically used (e.g., see Feldman and Gilles 1985; Judd 1985 for an early discussion of this technical issue, as well as Alós-Ferrer 1998).Footnote 2 Alternatively, Balder and Rustichini (1994) and Kim and Yannelis (1997) consider games with differential information, but still the conditions for the existence of equilibria are quite distinct from the finite number of players case. In such games with differential information, only a single state of the game is drawn, but it is observed by every player with respect to a private sub \(\sigma \)-field that can differ across agents and, hence, characterizes the private information structure in the game. In such games, the mapping between realizations of this single state and the distribution of information is taken as a primitive of the game. The particular choice of approach to large games with information frictions somewhat depends on the economic problem at hand. For example, the former class of games involving the private signals has been proven useful to study economic problems, where agents face random taste or productivity shocks that are payoff relevant. Differential information games have proven appropriate, when studying economic problems such as common value auctions, tournaments, riot games, or beauty contests, where in essence, there is single true state of the world, but that state is idiosyncratically perceived by different players. A second (and arguably equally) important strand of the literature in game theory that has found numerous applications in economics over the last two decades concerns games with strategic complementarities (henceforth GSC). In a GSC, the question of the existence and characterization of pure strategy Nash equilibrium does not hinge on conditions relating to convexity and upper hemi-continuity of best reply maps, but rather on an appropriate notion of increasing best responses in a well-defined set-theoretic sense, where actions take place in a complete lattice of strategies. In such a situation, the powerful fixed point theorems of Tarski (1955) and its generalizations (e.g., Veinott 1992) can be brought to bear on the existence question. Moreover, in parameterized versions of these games, one can seek natural sufficient conditions for the existence of monotone equilibrium comparative statics.Footnote 3 One additional interesting question that concerns GSC is what are the sufficient conditions for computable equilibrium comparative statics (i.e., when qualitative and computable comparisons of equilibriaFootnote 4 are possible in a GSC). Let us stress that an important limitation of the existing literature on GSC is that the research has been focused on games with a finite number of players [e.g., see the works of Topkis (1979), Vives (1990), and Milgrom and Roberts (1990)]. In this paper, we provide a unified set of results concerning the existence, comparison, and computation of Bayesian Nash equilibria in a broad class of large games with differential information in the spirit of Balder and Rustichini (1994) and Kim and Yannelis (1997).Footnote 5 As we focus on the subclass of large games with differential information that also possess strategic complementarities, we extend the existing literature on GSC with a finite number of players (e.g., Athey 2002, 2001 or Reny 2011; Vives and Zandt 2007) to a settings with a continuum of players. In addition, unlike much of the existing literature (including most of the existing literature we have just mentioned), we are also able to obtain many of our results in the space of strategies which are not monotone with respect to the signal (rather, best responses are only pointwise increasing with respect to strategies of other players as in Vives 1990 and Van Zandt 2010).Footnote 6 In the end, this paper is a direct extension of the approach taken in Balbus et al. (2013) where the authors study large GSC with complete information, but to extend the results in this latter paper, many new constructions are required.Footnote 7
 We start by studying distributional equilibrium.Footnote 8 For this situation, we propose an appropriate notion of Bayesian Nash equilibrium and verify the existence of such equilibria in our class of games. What is important about our approach to the existence question is the fact that in general, we cannot use standard arguments found in the literature on GSC. Similarly, for related arguments per equilibrium comparative statics, as equilibria in our games do not exist in complete lattices, new tools are needed. To deal with these technical issues when proving the existence of distributional Bayesian Nash equilibrium, we develop a new application of the powerful fixed point machinery for chain complete partially ordered sets found in the seminal work of Markowsky (1976). An important aspect of taking this new approach is that we are able to obtain our existence results under different assumptions than those found in the extensive current literature, where authors typically pursue sufficient conditions related to those studied in Mas-Colell (1984) adapted to large games with differential information to apply an appropriate topological fixed point theorem. Next, after proving the existence, we turn to the question of equilibrium comparative statics in the parameters of the class of games. In these results, we not only prove the existence of monotone equilibrium comparative statics on the space of games, but we give sufficient conditions for these equilibrium comparisons to be computable. We are unaware of any results in the existing literature on large differential games where equilibrium comparisons are computable. We then turn to the equilibrium in the sense of Schmeidler (1973) and, in particular, the question of existence and characterization of Bayesian Nash–Schmeidler equilibrium in our class of large games. Here, what is very interesting is that in general, the existence constructions per distributional equilibria based upon 1976’s theorem no longer apply; rather, to obtain even existence, in addition to having the best reply maps induce monotone fixed point operators, we must also check additional continuity properties of our operators in relevant order topologies. To obtain such results per order continuity of fixed point operators built from the best reply maps, we must first develop applications of order-theoretic maximum theorems.Footnote 9 This allows us to develop a new and novel application of the Tarski–Kantorovich fixed point theorem to the question of existence and computation of equilibrium. In particular, to characterize the set of Bayesian Nash–Schmeidler equilibrium, we actually prove a new theorem in the paper that verifies the existence of a countable chain complete partially ordered set of Bayesian Nash–Schmeider equilibria in our large games. Using this construction, we are also able to develop explicit methods for the computation of Nash–Schmeidler equilibria. It is worth mentioning that none of these characterizations of either distributional equilibria or Bayesian Nash/Schmeidler equilibria can be obtained, in general, using the existing topological approaches found in the literature. As before, we are also able to prove theorems on computable monotone comparative statics relative to ordered perturbations of the deep parameters of the space of primitives of a game. Under either definition of equilibrium in our large games, although the assumptions imposed for GSC are restrictive, they do allow us to obtain new results for large games with differential information not found in the existing literature. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce some important mathematical definitions we need in the remainder of the paper. In Sect. 3, we prove the existence of distributional Bayesian Nash equilibrium, characterize the equilibrium set, and provide results on equilibrium comparative statics. In Sect. 4, we then prove similar results for Bayesian Nash–Schmeidler equilibrium. Finally, we provide some economic applications of our results in Sect. 5. To keep the paper self-contained, auxiliary results in order-theoretic fixed point theory, as well as proofs that are not included in the main body of the paper, are placed in the “Appendix”.",10

Indeed, Nash equilibria in either pure or mixed strategies have been described explicitly only for a range of lower values of the decisiveness parameter (Pérez-Castrillo and Verdier 1992; Nti 1999), and for the limit case of the all-pay auction (Hillman and Samet 1987; Hillman and Riley 1989; Baye et al. 1996), but not so for intermediate values. As has been widely acknowledged, this lack of a game-theoretic prediction is undesirable, in particular because the resulting constraints on the decisiveness parameter do not have a proper economic motivation.Footnote 1
 For the case of intermediate values of the decisiveness parameter (“\(2<R<\infty \)”), in which a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium does not exist, Baye et al. (1994) proved the existence of a symmetric mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium with complete rent dissipation, and subsequently approximated the limit distribution by calculating equilibria of rent-seeking games with finite strategy spaces. Building on those results, Alcade and Dahm (2010) showed that many contests of intermediate decisiveness allow a mixed-strategy equilibrium that shares important statistics with the equilibrium of the corresponding all-pay auction.Footnote 2 However, a more structural understanding of the limit distribution remained elusive. For example, it was not known whether the limit distribution is continuous as in the case of the all-pay auction, or a finite collection of mass points as in Che and Gale’s (2000) analysis of difference-form contests, or something completely different. Moreover, numerical calculations based on contests with finite strategy spaces have tended to offer only rather low-resolution images of the limit distribution.Footnote 3
 The present paper addresses these issues by deriving new structural properties of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria in the rent-seeking game. Specifically, it is shown that any symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium in the Tullock contest of intermediate decisiveness entails countably infinitely many mass points. Moreover, all probability weight is concentrated on these mass points. Finally, the mass points form a discrete set in the strategy space and accumulate only at the zero bid, which itself is played with probability zero.Footnote 4
 These findings are potentially important because they imply that the equilibrium prediction for intermediate values of the decisiveness parameter differs structurally (even though not necessarily statistically) from the tractable cases that have been studied more frequently in the literature. For illustration, consider the equilibrium payoff function in a two-player contest, i.e., the expected payoff of a contestant as a function of her own expenditure, assuming that the other contestant adheres to the equilibrium strategy (see Fig. 1). For various intermediate values of \(R\), it can be seen that there are many local strict maxima that all lead to the same expected payoff of zero. It turns out that infinitely many of these local maxima receive positive mass in the equilibrium distribution. Thus, contrasting both the pure-strategy equilibrium in the lottery contest and the continuous mixed-strategy equilibrium in the all-pay auction, the equilibrium bid distribution for intermediate values of the decisiveness parameter has a non-convex support.Footnote 5
 Equilibrium payoff functions in the two-player Tullock contest The main tools for proving the results of this paper are taken from the realm of complex analysis. It is shown that the equilibrium payoff function allows a complex-analytic extension to an open connected subset of the complex numbers \(\mathbb {C} =\{x+\sqrt{-1}y:x,y\in \mathbb {R} \}\) that encompasses the real interval \((0,\infty )\).Footnote 6 But any non-constant function that is analytic over an open connected subset of the complex numbers has a discrete set of zeros. Since all expenditure levels in the support of a mixed equilibrium strategy necessarily yield the same expected payoff, this implies that all positive bids used in an equilibrium strategy must be isolated points of the support, which is the key ingredient of the equilibrium analysis.Footnote 7
 The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The necessary material from complex analysis is reviewed in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, the discreteness result is stated and proved. The equilibrium characterization can be found in Sect. 4. Section 5 offers numerical illustrations. Concluding remarks are collected in Sect. 6. An Appendix describes the numerical approach that has been used to calculate examples of bid distributions.",42

Some studies were even interested in the challenges of studying the conditions of a long healthy life, for a long life will often go hand in hand with a decline in health (Kirkwood 2008). This consensus crumbles when it comes to the link between health and productivity or health and economic growth. This relationship has been the subject of heated debate since the publication of the study by Acemoglu and Johnson (2007), where the authors casted serious doubts on the fact that better health would lead to faster growth per capita. Acemoglu and Johnson (2007) underlined that empirical studies that showed a sizable positive effect of health on individual productivity have not resolved the question of whether health differences are the cause of observed large differences in income since these studies do not incorporate general equilibrium effects. The most important general equilibrium effect comes from diminishing returns of work per effective unit. This is, for example, the case when physical capital is supplied inelastically. Indeed, in the presence of diminishing returns, estimations based on microdata overestimate the benefits of aggregated productivity due to improved health, especially when improving health comes with increased population. Acemoglu and Johnson (2007) showed that the increase in life expectancy associated with the increase in population may have a negative effect on income per capita for the working age population. This result is confirmed in particular for countries that have experienced high life expectancy, leading to a kind of puzzle. Following the study of Acemoglu and Johnson (2007), other authors such as Ashraf et al. (2008) raised the same question.Footnote 1 These authors used a simulation-based model that incorporates both micro- and macrocomponents and takes into account the direct effect of health on worker productivity. Contrary to the popular belief, they found a very moderate effect of improving health on income per capita. Ashraf et al. (2008) concluded that the rationale for health policies should then rely on humanitarian reasons rather than economic ones. The specific econometric questions underlying the debate are very well explained in Strittmater and Sunde (2013).Footnote 2
 This paper develops a theoretical framework to contribute to the debate by elaborating in depth on the structure of preferences. How would improving health status affect consumption, wage income and productivity? Depending on the answer, the impact on growth could be sizeable or small. This study aims at providing a theoretical answer to this question by showing that the adopted preferences do matter. To the best of our knowledge, the existing literature has not yet investigated the role of preferences in this regard. Indeed, from the AIDS empirical literature (e.g., Bloom and Mahal 1997a, b; Cuddington and Hancok 1994), we know that consumption and health are interconnected, but we cannot make conclusions about the net effect of health investment.Footnote 3 Indeed, it seems analytically difficult to slice on the net effect of a high health deterioration rate and low health productivity on health investment as not all diseases have the same effects. From a theoretical perspective, in the Grossman’s (1972) standard model, health is considered as capital stock that increases with investment. Agents’ preferences are separable in health and ordinary consumption. As a result, the returns from these two goods are independent. However, evidences stressed the fact that ordinary consumption is also crucial for health. Moreover, one of the main economic implications of health shock is a probable and significant distortion in savings behavior. Chakraborty (2004) considered the problem of public investment in health within the framework of overlapping generation models. The author showed that in poor countries where life expectancy is low, individuals are more likely to discount the future and thus are less inclined to save. Cuddington and Hancok (1994) also stated that health expenditure induces a decrease in savings at the expense of capital accumulation. However, this is questionable due to the fact that health expenditure is harmful to consumption. Therefore, there is an overriding issue as to how to deal with savings in the context of health depreciation. Our study contributes to the literature in several aspects. Firstly, we adopt a more general setup by considering both separable and non-separable preferences (additive, multiplicative and a convex combination of the two) in consumption and health, meaning in the latter case consumption is also crucial for health. Second, we investigate the effects of health status on the subsequent life cycle, in particular on productivity, wage income and consumption in a general equilibrium setting. In order to have a better picture of the life cycle aspect of the issue, we also include a final good sector where productivity depends on the health stock. Thirdly, we characterize the analytical solutions of the optimization problem to study the equilibrium dynamics. We find that the picture is quite sophisticated, depending on the assumed preferences. For simplification, we consider in a first step, lifetime of individuals as infinite. However, this facet of our approach is closely related to the framework of Grossman (1972) and Ehrlich and Chuma (1990) that health capital is still a determinant of lifetime utility. Relying on this setting, we connect three factors: health production, health investment and health costs. We show that the elasticities of these three variables determine jointly how health affects labor and hence productivity. The framework allows us to relate the evolution of wage rate with respect to health status, the transmission channel between wage rate and health being labor productivity. It also enables us to study longevity as well as the opportunity cost of health investment. The additive and multiplicative nature of preferences should be related to exogeneity versus endogeneity of health in marginal changes of welfare with respect to consumption. Relying on Grossman (1972), several empirical studies (Grossman and Benham 1974; Lee 1982; Haveman et al. 1994; Cai 2009) showed that taking into account the endogeneity of health significantly changes the results.Footnote 4 These studies estimated the simultaneous effects of health and wages in a structural framework, but the findings remain mixed. While Grossman and Benham (1974) and Haveman et al. (1994) found that taking into account the endogeneity of health increases the estimated effect of health on wages, Lee (1982) showed that controlling for endogeneity reduces this effect. The study of Cai (2009) supports the results of Grossman and Benham (1974) and Haveman et al. (1994) showing that the exogeneity of health leads to an underestimation of the effect thereof on wages. Therefore, the structure of preferences is a key factor in modeling the effects of health on wages. In our study, additive preferences imply exogeneity of health in marginal changes of welfare relative to consumption, whereas multiplicative preferences imply endogeneity of it. Exogeneity means that the change in welfare following that of consumption is independent of the level of health. When preferences are additively separable, the existence of equilibrium and the stability of the dynamic system require that the ratio of the elasticities of the cost of health and health investment is greater than the elasticity of the production function of health. The stock of health can have either positive or negative effects on the wage rate. This finding provides further clarification on the relationship between reservation wages and health. To our knowledge, few studies established this link (Gordon and Blinder 1980; Brown et al. 2009). Most studies have focused on how reservation wages influence the length of employment (Lancaster and Chesher 1983; Blackaby et al. 2007). However, there are reasons to believe that health is a determinant of reservation wages. Indeed, unhealthy people are entitled to higher reservation wages due to the disutility of labor that stems from their health status. We show that if the reservation wage is less than the market wage, the effect of health on wages is positive. If the reservation wage is higher than the market wage, the effect of health on wages becomes negative. This finding provides a general theoretical support to the empirical evidence of Gordon and Blinder (1980). Indeed, as these authors, we obtain that health has a positive effect on the reservation wage. However, while the results of Gordon and Blinder (1980) suggest that the effect of health on the market wage is negative, we theoretically show that this effect can be positive or negative depending on whether the reservation wage is less or higher than the market wage. When the preferences are multiplicative, the condition reverses—the ratio of the elasticities of the cost of health and health investment should be lower than the elasticity of the production function of health. Moreover, the effect of health stock on wage rate is always positive. In the case of convex combination of additive and multiplicative preferences, the equilibrium dynamic of the stock of health and investment in health is obtained as a function of time for which we observe an exponential decay. However, the solution of the dynamic system is not analytically tractable. The structure of preferences determines the shape and existence of longevity with respect to the elasticity of substitution of health. Lastly, we establish the conditions for comparing the opportunity cost of health under preference structures. In this paper, we abstract away from the pure literature on infectious diseases and their modes of transmission (see e.g., Boucekkine and Laffargue 2010; Goenka and Liu 2012; Goenka et al. 2014). It would have been interesting to incorporate this issue in our dynamic setting to assess the impact of health on variables such as capital accumulation, consumption and wages. Here, we do not make any specific assumptions on the nature of diseases (infectious or not) as well as on their transmission process. Incorporating these mechanisms in our model will pose additional difficulties that we leave for future research while focusing on the equally difficult issue of preference structure. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the general framework including optimality conditions. In Sect. 3, we study the model with separable additive preferences, where that health and consumption enter additively into the utility function. Section 4 is devoted to the model with a multiplicative non-separable preferences which allows for an interaction between health and consumption. Section 5 considers a framework with a convex combination of the additive and the multiplicative preferences. The penultimate Sect. 6 studies the opportunity costs of investment in health and derives some policy implications. The last section concludes the study. Proofs of propositions are relegated to the “Appendix.”",2

As a consequence of Flesch et al. (2010) and Purves and Sudderth (2011), these games admit a subgame-perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium, \(\epsilon \)-SPE for brevity, for every \(\epsilon >0\), provided that every player’s payoff function is bounded and continuous on the whole set of plays. Here, continuity is meant with respect to the product topology on the set of plays, with the set of actions given its discrete topology. The question naturally arises what happens in games in which continuity of the payoffs is not satisfied everywhere, but only on a subset of plays. More precisely, on which subsets of plays discontinuity can be allowed without loosing that an \(\epsilon \)-SPE exists for every \(\epsilon >0\). We show that discontinuities can be allowed on a sigma-discrete set of plays, i.e., on a countable union of discrete sets. In the special case, when the action space is countable, a set of plays is sigma-discrete if and only if it is countable. Our main findings are as follows: If the set of discontinuities is sigma-discrete, then an \(\epsilon \)-SPE exists for every \(\epsilon >0\). Given a set of plays that is not sigma-discrete, there exists a game in which the payoff functions are continuous outside of the given set, and the game admits no subgame-perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium for small \(\epsilon > 0\). This is achieved by embedding a game given in Flesch et al. (2014), which has no \(\epsilon \)-SPE for small \(\epsilon >0\). The structure of the paper is follows. In Sect. 2, we define the model. Then, in Sect. 3, we present the main results and discuss the main ideas of the proof. Sections 4 and 5 contain the proofs, and Sect. 6 provides some concluding remarks.",7

Introducing credit can therefore have significant welfare effects (Karlan and Zinman 2011; Banerjee et al. 2015; Angelucci et al. 2015), but quantifying these effects requires a better understanding of the poor’s preferences and behavior (Harrison 2011). Most analyses of intertemporal choice in a context of imperfect credit markets assume that consumption levels determine well-being and that it is optimal to smooth consumption. Violations of consumption smoothing are often explained by reference-dependent behavioral life-cycle models (Shefrin and Thaler 1988), including features of Kahneman and Tversky (1979)’s prospect theory. That is, gains and losses relative to a reference point determine well-being; losses are more painful than gains are pleasant (“loss aversion”); and marginal utility is decreasing in the size of a loss, i.e., utility from losses is convex (“diminishing sensitivity”).Footnote 1
 To date, reference-dependent models for wealth and intertemporal choice have largely abstracted from liquidity constraints. It is hence unclear how reference dependence affects savings for the poor, who often do not have access to credit, and how credit impacts their well-being if they indeed do have reference-dependent preferences. This paper fills this gap by introducing a liquidity constraint in existing models for reference-dependent preferences, and I find that reference dependence can have qualitatively different effects depending on whether consumers face liquidity constraints. Compared to the reference-independent optimum, reference dependence reduces savings among those who can borrow, but can increase savings when credit is unavailable. This poses a challenge to applying existing reference-dependent models for wealth and intertemporal choice in low-income settings. I demonstrate this result using three distinct models that differ in how consumers form their reference points (see Table 1). The first is a standard model for prospect theory in which gains and losses compared to an exogenous reference point determine well-being. In this model, a person compares actual and reference consumption levels, and the reference level can be interpreted in various ways, for instance as a predetermined expectation, a habit, status quo, recent ownership, or consumption level of a social reference group. Although the model is intuitive, it offers the discretion to select any reference point explaining the empirical fact in question. This comes at the cost of many degrees of freedom (Barberis 2013). The second and third models build on Kőszegi and Rabin (2006, 2009), who postulate that endogenous beliefs held prior to consumption shape the reference point and that updating these beliefs—comparing actual and planned utility in the framework adopted here—influences well-being. By loss aversion, bad news is more painful than good news is pleasant, and by diminishing sensitivity, it is better to receive bad news in one go rather than in bits. A growing literature (e.g., Abeler et al. 2011; Crawford and Meng 2011; Ericson and Fuster 2011) supports these assumptions. Moreover, the model can explain several anomalies in the literature on information preferences and intertemporal choice, in particular why people increase consumption immediately in response to good income news but delay cuts following bad news about their wealth or income (Kőszegi and Rabin 2009). These models have not been analyzed for consumers with limited access to credit. To assess how missing credit markets and reference dependence interact, I introduce liquidity constraints in each of these models. I consider a setting in which the sole savings motive for reference-independent people is to smooth consumption, meaning that reference-independent consumers save when present income is higher than future income, and either borrow (if unconstrained) or live hand-to-mouth (if liquidity-constrained) when present income is lower.Footnote 2 My main finding is that reference-dependent savings are often higher in the face of liquidity constraints, even though unconstrained savings are unambiguously lower than the reference-independent optimum. Depending on the model used, this asymmetry is driven by either an ex-post effect of liquidity constraints on feasible savings levels or an ex-ante effect of liquidity constraints on expected consumption. As such, liquidity constraints shape the reference point and indirectly affect behavior. Ex post, when income is below the reference point in both early and future periods, reference-dependent consumers prefer to borrow and avoid early losses, reducing optimal savings compared to the reference-independent optimum, but this is not viable in the presence of a binding liquidity constraint. By diminishing sensitivity, i.e., convex loss utility, their second-best option is to take the full loss immediately and save to eliminate future losses, increasing optimal savings. Instead of receiving bad news regarding both present and future consumption, the consumer cuts present consumption and receives bad news in one go. Expectations regarding future consumption hence turn into an aspiration to save and maintain future consumption at the planned level. This ex-post mechanism is observed independent of whether the reference point is exogenous or endogenous, as long as diminishing sensitivity is satisfied. Ex ante, in the model with endogenous reference points, the mere anticipation of a binding liquidity constraint will affect expected consumption and hence the expectations-based reference point. When income is lower in early periods than in future periods, liquidity-constrained people cannot smooth perfectly. They expect higher consumption in future periods, increasing their reference level and thus the marginal utility from future consumption. As a result, when income in early periods turns out not to be too bad, a loss-averse consumer may prefer to save even if reference-independent models predict hand-to-mouth consumption. This aspirations-based savings motive can be observed even when diminishing sensitivity is not satisfied. This paper contributes by highlighting two novel savings motives from interacting reference dependence and liquidity constraints. The literatures on intertemporal choice in imperfect credit markets and reference dependence have been fairly separated. The finding that liquidity constraints alter how reference dependence influences behavior is relevant for empirical studies aiming to identify such preferences outside the laboratory (see Camerer 2004; Barberis 2013 for reviews). So far, these studies have not considered how missing credit markets may confound estimates of loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity. I show that for people without access to credit markets, reference dependence can affect savings qualitatively different from what we would expect on the basis of existing models. Moreover, if consumers act in line with the framework presented here, introducing credit will have different behavioral effects and welfare implications than previously assumed. The paper is organized as follows. The next section analyzes the model with exogenous reference points. Section 3 introduces a liquidity constraint into Kőszegi and Rabin (2009), a model with endogenous reference points, loss aversion, and diminishing sensitivity, and examines how savings respond to unanticipated income shocks. Using a similar framework but without diminishing sensitivity, Sect. 4 studies savings for loss-averse consumers who know that income is stochastic when forming their beliefs. Section 5 discusses limitations and economic implications of the models I presented. Section 6 concludes.",6

Hammond,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Following a literature that extends from Arrow (1951) to Hammond (2011) and beyond, the equilibrium allocations that result from a perfectly competitive spot market system have efficiency and welfare properties that are fairly well understood. So are sufficient conditions for Walrasian equilibrium in such a system to exist. In fact, given any fixed status quo allocation, such a system, when combined with a suitable “pre-distributive” policy for distributing any potential gains, can produce an equilibrium allocation that is Pareto superior to the status quo. That is, except in the uninteresting special case when the status quo is already Pareto efficient. Yet ever since Walras’s own writings concerning his concepts of the auctioneer and tâtonnement, economists have been vexed by the problem of designing some kind of mechanism or process to ensure that Walrasian equilibrium in a spot market system could actually be attained. Originally the question that was asked is whether a tâtonnement process for adjusting prices in response to excess demand could converge to a Walrasian equilibrium. Except in special cases such as when all commodities are “gross substitutes”, the conclusions were generally rather unsatisfactory—see, for example, the survey by Hahn (1993). Even the tâtonnement process itself required each economic agent to report the appropriate value of its excess demand function truthfully; there was no discussion of any strategic considerations. In the standard definition of a non-cooperative game, each player’s feasible set of strategies is independent of the other players’ strategy choices. By contrast, Debreu (1952) introduced the notion of a “generalized game” where, by definition, each player’s feasible set of strategies may depend on the other players’ strategy choices. In their classic paper on existence of Walrasian equilibrium, Arrow and Debreu (1954) constructed an “abstract economy” as a generalized game which confronts the agents in an economy, who choose their own net trade vectors, with an auctioneer who chooses a price vector. Moreover, the economic agents are limited to choosing respective net trade vectors that satisfy their budget constraint, which is determined by the auctioneer’s choice of price vector. This generalized game was never intended to be a fully specified model of how any market system, realistic or artificial, could actually function. Instead, it merely served as a device allowing Debreu’s (1952) existence theorem to be applied. This existence theorem relies on arguments that probably owe more to Glicksberg’s (1952) method of proving existence of Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, when the set of pure strategies is convex, than to Nash’s (1950) own proof that a mixed strategy equilibrium exists when there is a finite set of pure strategies. One obvious issue in using the Arrow–Debreu abstract economy is its essential reliance on Nash equilibrium as the solution concept. In particular, each trader must anticipate the auctioneer’s choice of price vector simply in order to be sure of satisfying the budget constraint. Following the discussion by Polak (1999) of equilibrium in general games, restrictive epistemic conditions are required in order to ensure that the players can reach a pure strategy Nash equilibrium corresponding to a Walrasian equilibrium. Indeed, a robust market system should be able to handle traders who know little, and care even less, about one another’s preferences, endowments, and trading strategies. Formally, following Myerson (1982), one can consider a mechanism where a completely informed principal suggests a Nash equilibrium of the generalized game, which is then a Walrasian equilibrium of the economy. Nevertheless, the latter part of this paper will move toward what seems the more relevant case where, in the spirit of Harsanyi (1967–1968), the principal guides the agents to a particular Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a game with incomplete information. Let me quote from footnote 1 of Shapley and Shubik (1977), where they discuss the market game that Arrow and Debreu (1954) use to prove existence of Walrasian equilibrium:Footnote 1
 But as a descriptive model [t]his game shares the defect of the Walras exchange model of being ill defined, or unrealistically defined, away from equilibrium. Indeed, if only one agent departs from equilibrium, he is presumed to be able to buy and sell at the stated prices, announced by an added fictive player whose objective is to minimize excess demand. But there is no explanation of how the excess demand thereby created is to be satisfied—unless it is out of the bottomless warehouses of the fictive player. In mentioning “warehouses”, as well as in introducing their well known model with trading posts, Shapley and Shubik (1977) implicitly suggest a possible remedy for this serious deficiency in the Arrow–Debreu market game.Footnote 2 This is to allow the Walrasian auctioneer to combine three functions: the traditional Walrasian auctioneer, who chooses a price vector; a coordinator who, like Myerson’s (1982) principal, recommends—even mandates—both demand and supply vectors for each economic agent subject to the incentive constraints that these vectors must be what the agents themselves would be willing to choose given the chosen price vector; a warehouse manager, who manages a system that takes in all the agents’ offered supplies up to their mandated levels, and then allocates whatever total supplies have been made available in order to meet agents’ demands as far as possible. The key idea is to allow supplies to be collected before attempting to meet any demands. In order to do this, one has to consider a game in two stages, as will be done in Sect. 4. 
Vickrey (1961) proposes a second-price auction for a simple market in which one committed seller plans to sell one indivisible item to one of several competing buyers. The model anticipates Harsanyi’s (1967–1968) work on adapting Nash’s theory of non-cooperative strategic games to accommodate incomplete information. Wilson (1985) and others have been able to use Vickrey’s ideas in developing a theory of “double auctions” for a single market that confronts several competing potential sellers, each with one unit of a homogenous commodity they might sell, with several competing potential buyers, each able to buy at most one of those units. Ideas building on Vickrey’s and Harsanyi’s theories have also been widely applied to the design of auction markets for a wide range of products. These include licences in many countries to use parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in order to transmit information, as well as “Certificates of Entitlement” for owning a car in Singapore. To the author’s knowledge, however, nobody has yet faced up to the task of designing a game of incomplete information whose outcomes can reasonably be expected to generate a Pareto efficient allocation in a general multimarket system with many traders. This is especially true when, as in the work by Postlewaite (1979) and by Hurwicz et al. (1995), there is incomplete information regarding traders’ endowments, and traders can consume whatever they conceal. Indeed, it was assumed in Hammond (1979), as well as in later work surveyed in Hammond (2011, Sections 14–15), that agents would restrict themselves to reporting types for which the allocation mechanism specified a net trade that was feasible given the true endowment vector. The only sanction facing somebody who violated this constraint was that, if misreporting their type led to a supply contract being broken, they would be required to keep reporting a different type until the feasibility constraint was satisfied and a supply contract was reached that could be honoured. Even this sanction was left entirely implicit. For an alternative in a two-period setting, where Walrasian equilibrium may be unattainable, see Hammond (1992). In the case of financial markets, the need for some radical system re-design seems entirely evident given events that led to the recent “Great Recession” in most Western economies. At this stage, however, it would seem highly premature to suggest how to reform financial markets. For now, the much less ambitious task of designing a general spot market system that can implement Walrasian allocations seems challenging enough. After reviewing a few key approaches to the issues mentioned above, the main purpose of the paper is to propose a demand revelation mechanism with warehousing that attempts to meet the suggested requirements. Section 2 introduces the basic definitions, notation, and assumptions for a class of pure exchange economies. Thereafter, Sect. 3 presents a significant variation of the generalized game that Arrow and Debreu (1954) used to define their abstract economy. In particular, before the traders are required to announce their demands, they are informed of the price vector chosen by the auctioneer or market organizer. Then each trader’s strategy becomes, rather than the simple demand vector it was in Arrow and Debreu’s generalized game, an entire demand function of the price that the rules of the game require always to satisfy the budget constraint. This extension to functions makes the traders’ strategy sets independent of the auctioneer’s choice of any one particular price vector. Hence, this variation produces a game rather than a generalized game. So far there have been no explicit incentives for traders to fulfil their supply contracts. Following the key idea of Shapley and Shubik (1977), Sect. 4 considers the implications of requiring all supplies to be collected in a system of warehouses or trading posts, before being released to meet traders’ demands as far as possible. Traders can be deterred from default by excluding all those who break their contracts from any access to warehoused supplies. Next, Sect. 5 turns attention to the case when the market organizer is incompletely informed of both traders’ preferences and their endowments. In this setting, it is well known that there is a strategyproof allocation mechanism guaranteeing Pareto efficient outcomes only if either allocations close to the dictatorial or oligarchic extremes are selected, or else there is an infinite population of traders. Contrast, for example, the results of Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983), Serizawa (2002) and Serizawa and Weymark (2003) with those of Hammond (1979) and Guesnerie (1998). Accordingly, Sect. 5 introduces the notion of a statistical continuum economy. Earlier work, including Hart et al. (1974), considers just the distribution of traders’ characteristics as well as their net demand vectors. Here, by contrast, a joint distribution over traders’ labels as well as their characteristics, net demand vectors, etc. is considered. This relaxes some obvious symmetry conditions. Then, building on previous ideas in Hammond (1979), Sect. 6 constructs a strategyproof demand revelation mechanism that implements Walrasian equilibrium. This works, however, only for the case when traders ultimately limit themselves to revealing demands which guarantee that they can honour their supply contracts. This leaves open the problem of providing more effective incentives to dissuade traders from revealing net demand correspondences which create the possibility that they may be asked to supply more of some goods than their true endowments. To overcome this problem, Sect. 7 follows Sect. 4 in combining warehouses with a two-stage market system. Each stage uses a demand revelation mechanism like that in Sect. 6. In Sect. 8, an extensive form game in twenty-two steps is formally defined. It involves infinitely many traders and one market organizer or principal who also acts as recording clerk, statistician, auctioneer, market equilibrator, and warehouse manager. The game implements Walrasian equilibrium when backward induction is used to eliminate dominated strategies recursively in relevant continuation subgames of incomplete information, as well as in the game as a whole.Footnote 3 In this sense, even when traders’ endowments as well as their preferences are unobservable, appropriate incentives are created for individuals to reveal their true Walrasian demand correspondences and also to deliver whatever supplies are required to reach Walrasian equilibrium. The main results, along with their limitations, are reviewed in the concluding Sect. 9, which also contains some ideas for future research concerning extensions beyond spot markets in a pure exchange economy. Appendix 1 sets out some useful selected results concerning probability measures on Polish spaces—i.e. complete and separable metric spaces. Appendix 2 shows how the space of suitably regular closed graph demand correspondences can be given a metric that makes it a Polish space. Finally, Appendix 3 offers a proof that a market clearing equilibrium price exists in our setting where a countably infinite set of traders with random labels is required to submit demand correspondences satisfying the regularity conditions imposed earlier.",5

Yet, in contrast with the predictions of economic theory of democracy (Downs 1957) that the democratic process will eventually reflect the preferences of the majority, rich voters’ preferences for less redistribution seem to be better represented. As many observers note (e.g., Bonica et al. 2013), while the majority of voters has become poorer (in relative terms) one does not observe majority’s preferences over taxation and redistribution being met by politicians (Fig. 1).Footnote 1 But how is it possible that democratic politics end up in such representation gaps? Since politicians compete for votes why is it not the case that they converge to promising the level of redistribution that the majority of voters prefers? 
a Fractile income shares in the US: 1968–2010. b Effective tax rates and top quintile income share in the US: 1968–2010 Standard models of redistributive politics (Meltzer and Richard 1981; Cox and McCubbins 1986; Alesina and Rodrik 1994; Persson and Tabellini 2001; Roemer 2005; Benhabib and Przeworski 2006) cannot explain the empirical puzzle described above as they predict median-preferred equilibrium levels of redistribution: as the median becomes poorer, redistribution is predicted to increase. In all those models, the relative size of poor versus rich voters drives the result as politicians will always pander to the relatively larger group—we call this the group-size effect. Models of special interest politics, on the other hand, consider that parties use redistribution in order to “woo those [poor] voters who are relatively more responsive to generous transfers” (Dixit and Londregan 1996). We call this the income effect. Thus both groups of models predict that the equilibrium redistribution level will reflect the preferences of poor voters. In the opposite direction, models assuming that rich voters are more involved in politics or finance candidates’ campaigns (e.g., Campante 2011) may indeed explain part of the phenomenon, but they cannot fully account for the sharp decline in redistribution (taxation) that is observed since the income share of most of the engaged voters is decreasing as well.Footnote 2
 In this study, we provide an alternative explanation to this paradox by the means of a two-dimensional electoral competition model with differentiated candidates:Footnote 3 voters are characterized by income and a fixed non-economic characteristic (which can be thought of as ethnic, religious or cultural identity) and two candidates with also fixed non-economic characteristics strategically choose redistribution schemes in order to maximize their expected vote shares. In the main part of the paper, we focus on a case in which candidates have symmetric redistribution technologies. In specific, we consider that each candidate proposes a Meltzer and Richard (1981) balanced-budget redistribution scheme and we prove existence of a unique Nash equilibrium—conditional on candidates being sufficiently differentiated in non-economic characteristics—which is characterized by policy convergence.Footnote 4 We then focus on understanding how different elements of the model affect this unique equilibrium tax rate. In our equilibrium, both described effects (the group-size effect and the income effect) are present but a third—and potentially dominant over the other two—factor appears: the within-group homogeneity effect. Consider a simple example in which voters of two income groups (poor and rich) have preferences over a unidimensional non-economic issue: for example, the darkness of the skin of the candidate.Footnote 5 If poor voters are many but divided in this dimension (say half prefer darker skins to paler ones and half prefer paler skins to darker), if rich voters are few but homogeneous and moderate in this dimension and one candidate is very dark while the other candidate is very pale, then the following force appears: the dark candidate knows that by offering a redistribution scheme slightly less generous than the pale candidate makes all rich voters vote for her (since rich voters do not have strong preferences about skin color) at the cost of losing the votes of very few poor voters (since poor voters have very strong feelings about the color, a marginal difference between the proposed redistribution schemes is not enough to make them switch their votes). This within-group homogeneity effect drives the equilibrium level of redistribution closer to the preferences of the more homogeneous group—in this example the rich voters’ group—despite the fact that poor voters constitute a majority. We are particularly interested in studying the interaction between the three effects. We initially show that when candidates’ fixed non-economic characteristics are identical, then the group-size effect is dominant: consistent with previous literature (e.g., Meltzer and Richard 1981) candidates pander to the interests of the majority. This implies that redistribution will be high (low) when the majority of the society is poor (rich). We further show that when candidates are sufficiently differentiated in the non-economic dimension and when the degree of within-group homogeneity in the non-economic dimension is identical across income groups, a representation gap appears in favor of the poor voters: independently of the size of the group of poor voters, candidates promise a large level of redistribution. In this case, the income effect is dominant. But more strikingly, we find that the direction of the representation gap can be quickly reversed in favor of the rich group when poor voters become more heterogeneous in the non-economic dimension. That is, by maintaining the assumption of sufficient candidate differentiation, we show that even if poor voters are only slightly more heterogeneous than the rich ones in the non-economic dimension, the equilibrium redistribution scheme will better reflect the interests of the rich. Candidates, in general, are found to pander to the interests of the most homogenous group, as the relative ratio of the densities of the swing voters of the two income groups on the non-economic dimension is found to be more relevant in determining equilibrium redistribution than the ratio of the sizes of these groups. Hence the within-group homogeneity effect is much stronger than the other two and presents itself as a possible explanation for the paradox that we described in the beginning. After analyzing the interplay between the three effects, we consider a generalization of the model to a wide range of redistribution schemes, including asymmetric ones. That is, we consider a general framework in which candidates are not only differentiated in terms of their non-economic characteristics but also in terms of their redistribution technologies. Consider, for example, the case in which candidates have different abilities to provide different public goods that are more beneficial to the poor or the rich, or the case in which one of the candidates can credibly promise to increase voters’ welfare through outside funding.Footnote 6 We show that, for a quite general class of such asymmetries in redistribution technologies, a (possibly) divergent equilibrium—with features similar to the ones in the main part of the paper—is guaranteed to exist when candidates’ non-economic characteristics are sufficiently different. In particular, we are able to prove that the within-group homogeneity effect is robust to candidates being characterized by distinct redistribution technologies: as the poor become more divided in non-economic characteristics compared to the rich, the tax rates proposed in equilibrium by both candidates become lower. This finding unambiguously strengthens the empirical relevance of the analysis as it establishes that the described effect is not an artifact of considering symmetric redistribution technologies. Even though this paper merely aims to make a theoretical argument, real-world observations seem to back existence of this within-group homogeneity effect. In the USA, for example, the degree of polarization and heterogeneity in a series of non-economic matters (e.g., ethnicity, religion, culture and social ideology) has been documented to have risen—both at the political elite level, especially across parties and candidates in Congress (Poole and Rosenthal 1984, 1985, 2000; McCarty et al. 2006) and also among voters (Abramowitz and Saunders 2008; Harbridge and Malhotra 2011; Krasa and Polborn 2014b), especially among the poorer ones.Footnote 7 In turn, this has further shifted the axis of political competition from class to identity. It is exactly this interplay between increased candidate differentiation and greater within-poor heterogeneity that incentivizes parties to pander to the relatively more homogenous rich voters—in the absence of any of those two elements our model predicts that redistribution should have been higher. Moreover our theoretical findings can speak to the literature of ethnic politics by supplementing recent empirical findings (Alesina et al. 1999, 2001; Alesina and Glaeser 2004) which suggest that there is more redistribution in ethnically (or culturally) more homogenous societies despite the fact that in the latter inequality—and the number of poor voters—might be smaller. Thus our findings offer a new insight that future empirical research can explore in greater detail: it appears that relative ethnic homogeneity within income groups is potentially a more relevant determinant of redistribution than the overall (aggregate) level of ethnic homogeneity in a society. In terms of modeling assumptions, there are two papers which are very close to ours. The first one is Lindbeck and Weibull (1987). In the standard text-book redistribution problem in which two candidates are free to propose any balanced-budget redistribution scheme—even ones that upset the income ordering of citizens—no equilibria exist: for each redistribution scheme, there is another one which is preferred by a majority. In the framework of this problem, Lindbeck and Weibull (1987) make the following seminal observation: if voters care not only about the redistribution scheme but also about other characteristics of candidates and if candidates are sufficiently uncertain about how each voter evaluates their other characteristics, then a convergent equilibrium may exist. The equilibrium existence conditions that they provide are very stringent and the equilibrium redistribution scheme is such that the less politically biased income group receives transfers from all other income groups. That is, not only could it be the case that there is redistribution in favor of the rich—something which is at odds with bare-eye empirical observations—but it could further be that the total redistribution in favor of the rich, in a case in which rich are the less biased group, exceeds the total redistribution in favor of the poor in a case in which the poor are the less biased group. Thereafter no clear inference may be drawn from these results regarding the relationship between voters’ preferences on non-economic issues and total equilibrium redistribution. The second paper whose formal setup is very close to ours is a recent one by Krasa and Polborn (2014a). In their paper, they consider that candidates, who are differentiated in social ideology, strategically decide a flat tax rate in order to provide a public good. Their analysis is of predominant importance for our work as it was the first one that demonstrated that economic policy does not only depend on the distribution of income but also on the distribution of social preferences. Its aim was more to establish the existence of this effect between social preferences and economic outcomes, rather than to investigate the degree to which this effect creates the described representation gap. There are a number of other papers which also explore the link between voter diversity and redistribution. Roemer (1998), for example, by analyzing a model with two policy-motivated candidates who strategically decide both a level of taxation and a social policy points to the intuitive idea that when the social issue is significantly more important for the voters than the economic issue, candidates policy platforms will converge to the ideal policy of the median of the social issue dimension. To obtain these results though, he introduces and applies a non-conventional equilibrium concept since such two-dimensional models rarely admit a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies. Moreover Austen-Smith and Wallerstein (2006), Lizzeri and Persico (2001, 2004), Levy (2004), Fernández and Levy (2008) and Huber and Ting (2013) also explore how diversity among the voters affects the size of government and the type of redistribution. But in all these papers, preference diversity among voters is considered to be of economic nature (some prefer general interest policies while others prefer specialized transfers) and not in relation to some non-economic issue as in this paper or as in Krasa and Polborn (2014a). In what follows we first present the formal model and the results considering symmetric redistribution technologies. Then we provide a generalization of the model and we show that our results are robust to introducing possibly asymmetric redistribution technologies and efficiency costs of taxation. Finally, we comment on the implications of our results on issues of applied interest.",13

More specifically, incentive compatibility constraints limit the set of feasible allocations that can be attained (see, e.g., Dréze et al. 2008). How are these restrictions relaxed as more information becomes common knowledge? And what is the minimum additional information required for achieving first-best efficiency? These are some of the questions that have emerged in the attempt to better understand the effects of information aggregation on efficiency. Indeed, some early papers by McAfee (1992), Armstrong (1999) and Casella (2002) already point toward this direction. In this paper, we claim that if the number of agents with the same type is known for all types in a population (in other words, the realized frequency of types is known), then it is possible, under general conditions, to implement first-best allocations as a unique equilibrium. More precisely, we consider an economy with asymmetric information, where each agent has private information about his type. We also assume that: (i) the realized frequency of types is common knowledge, (ii) preferences satisfy the single-crossing property, and (iii) the social choice rule satisfies anonymity. Given these conditions, we show that it is possible to construct a mechanism which has a unique equilibrium, where all agents reveal their type truthfully and they receive a first-best allocation. The result is interesting because we examine an asymmetric information problem which is situated in between the problem of Maskin (1999) (in which all agents know the state of the world but the mechanism designer does not know it) and the classic adverse selection (in which each agent knows only his own type and the mechanism designer knows the ex ante distribution of types). The intuition behind the result is that, if the realized frequency of types is known, then one can aggregate the messages that all agents are sending out and uncover any misreport(s), even if the identity of the liar is not known. That is, appropriately designed punishments for lying can induce agents to reveal their information truthfully. We talk about appropriately designed punishments, because one of the features of our mechanism is that punishments must not be too harsh. If the punishment when a lie is detected is too severe, then some agents may deliberately lie about their type in order to force other agents to also do so. The lies cancel out at the aggregate level and the former agents “steal” the allocations of the latter, who are forced to lie under the fear of the extreme punishments. This can lead to coordination failures and multiplicity of equilibria. Therefore, uniqueness of the equilibrium requires a careful construction of the off-the-equilibrium-path allocations when lies are detected. We show that such punishments exist when the indifference curves satisfy the single-crossing property. Furthermore, our mechanism can be useful in addressing real-world problems when agents’ individual characteristics (types) are privately known, but the central authorities have good knowledge of the relevant aggregate numbers. For example, a government may know the aggregate output (income) and the productivity in each sector but not the productivity of each individual agent. In such a case, the government can employ our mechanism and taxes/subsidies to redistribute income without any losses in terms of efficiency. Another example is the identification of the amount of air pollution by each factory and the imposition of the corresponding penalty without direct inspection. For this result, our mechanism requires knowledge of the aggregate air pollution and the aggregate number of the machines used along with the machine specifications determining the emission of air pollutants. The most closely related paper to ours is Piketty (1993) which also assumes that the realized distribution of types is common knowledge. Piketty considers the classical taxation problem of Mirrlees (1971) and proposes a mechanism which allows the government to implement any first-best efficient allocation. Our model differs from Piketty in several respects: (i) Piketty considers only two private goods, while we allow for any finite number of goods (some of which could be public). (ii) We consider multidimensional asymmetric information instead of unidimensional. (iii) We allow for a more general feasibility set. 
Jackson and Sonnnenschein (2007) consider an economy where agents play multiple copies of the same game at the same time and their types are independently distributed across games. They allow for mechanisms, which “budget” the number of times that an agent claims to be of a certain type. If the number of parallel games becomes very large, then all the Bayes-Nash equilibria of these mechanisms converge to first-best allocations. Our model is different from theirs, because we do not require multiple games to be played at the same time, but we impose a stronger assumption on what is common knowledge. 
Sun and Yannelis (2007a, (2008) show how incentive compatibility constraints can be overcome and first-best achieved in economies with private information and atomless agents. This efficiency result requires that the agents’ private signals be conditionally independent (given the true state of nature) and utility functions and endowments be type independent. Also, this result does not hold for economies with asymmetric information and a fixed finite number of agents. 
McLean and Postlewaite (2002, (2004) consider efficient mechanisms in economies with interdependent values. The state of the world is unknown to all agents, but each individual receives a noisy private signal about the state. They show that when signals are sufficiently correlated with the state of the world and each agent has small informational size (in the sense that his signal does not contain additional information about the state of the world when the signals of all the other agents are taken into account), then their mechanism implements allocations arbitrarily close to first-best allocations. However, in the model of McLean and Postlewaite, when private signals are perfectly correlated, all agents learn not only their own type but also the type of all other agents. That is, in the limit, the framework of McLean and Postlewaite is one of complete information. In contrast, in our setting agents know, at most, the realized frequency of types.Footnote 1
 VCG mechanisms (Vickrey 1961; Clarke 1971; Groves 1973) are often reference points in terms of results on efficiency. With respect to these mechanisms, our paper is more general as they assume quasi-linear preferences, while we allow for quasi-concave utility functions. Moreover, these papers show that the respective mechanisms that they examine produce truth-telling equilibria, but they do not examine whether other equilibria, non-truth-telling, exist. In contrast, we consider this possibility and show that the truth-telling equilibrium of our mechanism is unique. Our paper is also related to the auctions literature with interdependent types. In this context, Crémer and McLean (1985) and Perry and Reny (2002, (2005) show the existence of efficient auctions when types are interdependent. Crémer and McLean, however, require quasi-linear preferences, while we do not. Perry and Reny are closer to our result since they also assume that the single-crossing property holds. Nonetheless, our main focus is the uniqueness of the equilibrium, an issue which, as with the VCG literature, is not studied in these papers. 
Rustichini et al. (1994) show that the inefficiency of trade between buyers and sellers of a good, who are privately informed about their preferences, rapidly decreases with the number of agents involved in the two sides of the market and in the limit it reaches zero. Effectively, the paper examines the issue of convergence to the competitive equilibrium as the number of agents increases. However, their model is limited to private values problems and hence it can be seen as a special case of our formulation. Following this direction of research, subsequent papers have examined the existence and efficiency of equilibria in economies with asymmetric information when: (i) there is a continuum of agents (Sun and Yannelis 2007b), (ii) there are infinitely many commodities (Podczeck and Yannelis 2008), (iii) there is an infinite number of agents and aggregate uncertainty (Qiao et al. 2016), (iv) there is a mix of “small” and “large” agents (Pesce 2010), and (v) there are more private goods than states of nature (Correia-da-Silva and Hervés-Beloso 2014). As in Rustichini et al. (1994), these papers restrict their focus to satisfying incentive compatibility constraints, while we are interested in full implementation. More recently, the papers by Mezzetti (2004) and Ausubel (2004, (2006) examine the issues of efficient implementation under interdependent valuations and independently distributed types. However, they also assume that agents’ preferences are quasi-linear with respect to the transfers they receive, whereas in our model utility may not be transferable. Moreover, the mechanisms proposed in these papers may generate multiple equilibria (in most of which truth-telling is violated), while we are interested in a mechanism which has a unique truth-telling equilibrium. Finally, several recent papers examine efficient mechanism design in dynamic settings. The most notable papers in this category are the papers by Battaglini (2005), Athey and Segal (2007), Gershkov and Moldovanu (2009), Bergemann and Välimäki (2010), Pavan et al. (2014), Athey and Segal (2013) and Escobar and Toikka (2013). Our paper differs significantly from these papers. We assume that types are drawn only once and the realized distribution of types becomes common knowledge subsequently, while they assume that agents’ type evolves over time according to a stochastic process which is common knowledge. On the other hand, we also use a multistage mechanism in order to induce truthful reporting. As a result, even though agents’ private information does not change in the various stages, their incentive to report truthfully changes according to the information they learn from the previous stages, similarly to the dynamic mechanism design literature.",3

One was initiated by Bulow and Rogoff (1989), who focused on incentives for default; here we take our cue from Diamond (1965), who argued that debt can restore optimality when, as in economies of overlapping generations, the market fails to guarantee it. Alternatively, long-lived assets suffice to restore optimality under certainty or compete markets in elementary securities, and debt becomes unnecessary, if not unsustainable, because of transversality. And Demange (2002) argued that this is also the case even with uninsurable risks in an incomplete asset market. Evidently, then, it is constrained optimality that is at stake. Our argument is that constrained optimality applies only in the case of two-period life spans and one, aggregate, commodity at each date: in economies with a richer commodity or demographic structure constrained optimality may fail and debt can implement Pareto improvements in welfare. More precisely, long-lived assets, land or “Lucas-trees”, restore optimality in economies that extend over an infinite time-horizon. Wilson (1981) developed the argument for economies under certainty, and Santos and Woodford (1997) extended the argument to economies under uncertainty as long as the asset market is complete. The possible failure of optimality has been studied extensively and is well understood. It derives from the failure of aggregate valuation or, equivalently, an aggregate budget constraint that obtains when the real rate of interest falls short of the rate of growth of output. Samuelson (1958) and Diamond (1965) first argued that aggregate debt or, equivalently, pay-as-you-go social security, may implement optimal allocations, low interest rates notwithstanding. Cass (1972) gave a condition, weaker than aggregate valuation, that is necessary and sufficient for a price path to support a Pareto optimal allocation. In the presence of uninsurable risks, the optimality properties of competitive allocations are problematic even in finite economies. Not only do competitive allocations typically fail to be optimal, which is not surprising or even relevant, but, typically, they fail to be even constrained optimal: competitive markets fail to make optimal use of the restricted reallocations of risks that fundamentals allow. Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1986) showed that, typically, reallocations of the existing assets implement Pareto improvements; Carvajal and Polemarchakis (2011) extended the argument to economies with (purely) idiosyncratic risks. Importantly, constrained suboptimality occurs with multiple commodities or periods of economic activity, and it derives from the variation in relative prices that competitive markets fail to internalize. 
Demange (2002) demonstrated an important and surprising result: in an economy of overlapping generations with life-spans of two periods and one, aggregate commodity at each period, long lived assets traded subject to a ban on short sales restore the constrained optimality of competitive allocations in the presence of uninsurable risks: there is no intervention that respects both the prevailing restrictions on risk sharing and the ban on short sales and implements a Pareto improvement. Here, we give a series of examples that demonstrate the dependance of constrained optimality on the restriction to life-spans of two periods and a single commodity. With multiple commodities or multiple periods in the economic life-time of generations, constrained suboptimality may arise. 
Lucas and Stokey (1983) and Angeletos (2002) considered optimal fiscal policy under uncertainty, while Diamond and Geanakoplos (2003) and Dutta et al.

Whereas the deterministic version of this model with inelastic labor supply has the property that all solutions converge monotonically to a unique interior steady state, this is not necessarily the case when labor supply is elastic and time is modeled as a discrete variable. De Hek (1998) provides both an example in which there exist multiple interior steady states and an example in which the optimal solution displays periodic oscillations. He concludes his paper by posing the question of “whether this model with leisure-dependent utility is able to generate more complex dynamics, in particular, chaos” (De Hek 1998, p. 270). Kamihigashi (2015) addresses the multiplicity of steady states in a more systematic way and proves that the model can have any finite number of steady states or even a continuum of steady states. The purpose of the present paper is to conduct a similar systematic analysis of period-2 cycles and to provide an affirmative answer to the question by De Hek (1998) regarding more complicated dynamics. To this end, we first extend the results from De Hek (1998) by proving that, for any time-preference factor between 0 and 1, there exist a production function and an instantaneous utility function—both satisfying standard monotonicity and convexity assumptions—such that the resulting model admits a locally asymptotically stable optimal solution which is periodic with period 2. Furthermore, we construct a robust example of an economy for which there exists an optimal solution that has period 3. The existence of a solution with period 3 implies the existence of periodic solutions of all periods (see Sarkovskii 1964) as well as the occurrence of topological chaos (see Li and Yorke 1975). The one-sector growth model with elastic labor supply forms the backbone of many modern dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models including real-business-cycle models and new Keynesian models. The standard approach to analyzing these models involves as its first step the specification of production functions and utility functions in parametric form. There are only a few classes of parametric families of functions that are used in quantitative macroeconomic research. In these specifications, it is typically the case that the utility function is additively separable with respect to consumption and leisure or that both the production function and the utility function are smooth with nonnegative cross-partial derivatives. We show that neither cycles nor chaos can be optimal under these assumptions. Moreover, the emergence of period-3 cycles requires unrealistically strong time preference as shown by Sorger (1994), Mitra (1996), and Nishimura and Yano (1996). Finally, we also point out that according to Hartl (1987) non-monotonic dynamics such as cycles and chaos are ruled out in the continuous-time version of the model. The parametric families of production and utility functions mentioned in the previous paragraph form only a small subset of the set of those functions which satisfy the standard monotonicity and convexity assumptions on technology and preferences. Nevertheless, intuitive reasoning in the economics profession is highly influenced by models which use these parametric specifications. It is therefore of interest to find out which mechanisms are responsible for the periodic or even chaotic optimal solutions and which are therefore ruled out by the typical parametric specifications. De Hek (1998) links the occurrence of multiple steady states and cycles to the substitutability or complementarity, respectively, of consumption and leisure. Kamihigashi (2015), on the other hand, argues that normality of leisure is what rules out multiple steady states. The results and examples of the present paper support an intuitive explanation by income effects as in Kamihigashi (2015) rather than by substitution effects as in De Hek (1998). In particular, we believe that a strong and positive income effect on consumption combined with inferiority of leisure is the most plausible explanation of the non-monotonicity of optimal solutions. The model studied in the present paper coincides with that analyzed by Kamihigashi (2015) but differs slightly from that used by De Hek (1998).Footnote 1 More specifically, we assume that output in period t is produced from investment made in period \(t-1\) and labor supplied in period t, whereas De Hek (1998) assumes that both factor inputs for period-t production are determined in period \(t-1\). We have chosen the present setting because we consider it to be more popular in macroeconomics than the one employed in De Hek (1998). It has to be emphasized, however, that for every result or example presented in this paper one can derive a corresponding result or example, respectively, using the timing assumption from De Hek (1998). In particular, deterministic chaos can also occur in the setting studied in De Hek (1998). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model and Sect. 3 presents and discusses the results and their implications. All proofs are given in “Appendix.”",9

Price discrimination is prevalent, but sellers often employ just a small number of product types, despite our casual and statistical observations that suggest significant heterogeneity among buyers’ willingness to pay. The lack of sufficient product variety has been commonly attributed to the existence of some fixed costs of launching products of different qualities (e.g., Dixit and Stiglitz 1977; Spence 1980). In many instances, however, these costs tend to be small or immaterial, thereby making it difficult to justify the observed patterns of firm strategy by resorting to such costs alone. Motivated by these observations, this paper proposes a theory of price discrimination that incorporates a now well-established bias from rational decision making, namely consumer loss aversion (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Specifically, we introduce Kőszegi and Rabin (2006) expectation model of reference-dependent preferences into a standard screening model á la Mussa and Rosen (1978).Footnote 1 In our setup, a monopolist seller offers a menu of bundles before a buyer privately observes his willingness to pay and decides whether to make a purchase. As in Kőszegi and Rabin (2006), henceforth referred to as KR, the buyer anticipates his future consumption choice for each possible contingency and experiences “gain–loss utility” with reference to his own past expectation of contingent consumption, in addition to standard “consumption/intrinsic utility.” Furthermore, the expectation must be correct; that is, it must be consistent with the buyer’s optimal consumption choice in each realization of uncertainty. This requirement of rational expectation, or personal equilibrium (PE), implies that the menu must satisfy incentive compatibility and (ex post) participation constraints that account for reference-dependent preferences and loss aversion.Footnote 2
 In addition to the large existing literature documenting empirical support for loss aversion in a variety of economic situations, a slew of recent studies point to the specific role played by expectations in the formation of reference points (e.g., Mas 2006; Abeler et al. 2011; Card and Dahl 2011; Crawford and Meng 2011; Ericson and Fuster 2011; Gill and Prowse 2012; Sprenger 2015). The price discrimination setting offers a natural ground to explore the expectation-based approach to reference point formation, because its essential ingredient is the uncertainty of consumer demand. We usually know products that are available before discovering the specific conditions that determine our preferences. Consider, for example, a sports fan whose willingness to pay for the sports TV package is influenced by the performance of his favorite team during pre-season. This consumer may form an expectation that he would purchase the premium package if and only if the team ends up having a promising pre-season. But, once the regular season starts, he compares the expected purchase to what he could have consumed. We show that loss aversion indeed serves to limit the benefits of price discrimination and can even result in the optimality of a full pooling menu in a situation where buyers with standard preferences would be separated via a menu with strictly increasing quality-price schedule. Moreover, the expectation-based approach brings into play an additional determinant of optimal contractual form: It depends on an interplay between the extent of consumer loss aversion and the shape of the distribution of consumer’s willingness to pay. In particular, our results suggest that given a (sufficient) level of loss aversion, the firm is more likely to shy away from screening in markets with large population of consumers with low willingness to pay. Our main message is most clearly conveyed in the case of binary consumer types, where the effect of loss aversion manifests itself in two ways. First, when each consumer compares the alternative of non-participation to the bundle of his choice ex post, he experiences a loss on quality and a gain in money. Thus, as the consumer becomes more loss averse, he becomes willing to pay more for a given quality, which implies that the seller can profitably increase the quality for the type whose participation constraint is binding (i.e., the low willingness-to-pay type). Second, for the consumer who acquires an information rent (i.e., the high willingness-to-pay type), deviation to lower quality-price bundle leads to another channel of gain–loss comparisons across the two utility dimensions. In this case, however, the comparison is weighted by the ex ante likelihood of the alternative event. Given loss aversion, the deviation incentive would be greater when the low willingness-to-pay type, and thus a lower price, was anticipated with a larger probability. The combination of the above two effects generates the following: When the likelihood of low willingness-to-pay consumer is sufficiently large and the degree of loss aversion lies in an intermediate range, the seller’s optimal strategy is to offer the same bundle to both types.Footnote 3 In the case of a continuum of consumer types, focusing on the case in which full separation is optimal under standard preferences, we establish conditions under which partial or even full pooling is optimal among menus with monotone quality and price. In our model, multiple personal equilibria may arise from a menu. Our treatment above follows the standard mechanism design approach by assuming that the firm can select the PE and hence focusing on truthful self-selection. An alternative approach suggested by KR is to assume that it is the consumer who is capable of choosing his favorite PE, or the preferred personal equilibrium (PPE). We derive the optimal menu under the concept of PPE and binary consumer types, and show that a pooling menu continues to be optimal under a wide range of parameter values. To our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial analysis of PPE in a model of adverse selection to date. Our paper contributes to the growing literature on firm behavior under boundedly rational agents (see the surveys of Ellison 2006; Spiegler 2011; Kőszegi 2014). Among this literature, monopolist’s screening problems with loss averse consumers have recently been studied independently by Herweg and Mierendorff (2013), Orhun (2009), and Carbajal and Ely (2016). 
Herweg and Mierendorff (2013) consider a seller who chooses from two-part tariffs for a loss averse consumer with uncertain demand and demonstrate the optimality of flat tariff. They model the consumer also in the frame of KR, but with gain–loss arising only from the money dimension, and characterize optimal contract when the consumer can commit to ex ante participation. Our analysis differs in several aspects. First, our setup allows for both ex post and ex ante participation. Second, we consider a general class of menus under gain–loss utilities that arise from both money and quality dimensions and derive the precise channel via which consumer loss aversion generates bunching over quality as well as price. Moreover, our treatment of gain–loss utility gives rise to non-trivial PPE analysis. In Orhun (2009) and Carbajal and Ely (2016), the seller offers a menu to a consumer who already knows his type and admits an exogenously given reference point that is type-dependent. These authors also demonstrate the possibility of optimal pooling. However, their utility models do not involve gain–loss comparisons across multiple types; moreover, the issue of optimal menus that are PE (PPE) is not explored. The main concern of Carbajal and Ely (2016) is to explain how the shape of optimal contract depends on the reference point. Loss aversion has been fruitfully incorporated in other contexts of firm behavior. Heidhues and Kőszegi (2014), Spiegler (2012), and Rosato (2013) consider monopoly pricing with complete information. In these models, the monopolist can optimally commit to a random pricing strategy. In contrast, we explore the role of loss aversion in a model with demand uncertainty and menu contracts. The consumer’s expectations concern his future demand, not the price realization. Courty and Nasiry (2015) derive the uniformity of optimal price irrespective of product quality in a monopoly model with consumer loss aversion and random utility shocks. They do not however address the issue of screening as we do here. Also using the KR model, Heidhues and Kőszegi (2008) explain why firms with differentiated products and heterogeneous costs may end up charging a uniform price. The competition model of differentiated products is also explored by Karle and Peitz (2013) and Zhou (2011). De Meza and Webb (2007) and Herweg et al. (2010) study the role of loss aversion in agency problems. In auctions, loss averse bidders are introduced by Lange and Ratan (2010) and Eisenhuth (2010), and Grillo (2013) considers a cheap talk game in which the receiver is loss averse. Finally, our paper complements other approaches aimed at understanding the implications of biased consumers for monopolist behavior. Time-inconsistent preferences or self-control problems have been explored in the context of contract design by DellaVigna and Malmendier (2004), Eliaz and Spiegler (2006), Esteban et al. (2007) and Heidhues and Kőszegi (2010); Eliaz and Spiegler (2008) and Grubb (2009) investigate the role of overconfident consumers. Jeleva and Villeneuve (2004) show that pooling menu could be optimal in an insurance model with adverse selection if the consumer has imprecise belief about the underlying risk. Here, optimal pooling arises if the likelihood of low risk consumer is sufficiently large; however, this parameter also affects the corresponding insurance coverage, while in our optimal pooling menu the product quality depends on the degree of loss aversion and not on the distribution of willingness to pay. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out a price discrimination setup with KR’s reference-dependent preferences for the binary-type case. In Sect. 3, we characterize the optimal menu in our model by adopting truthful personal equilibrium as the solution concept. The optimal menu under preferred personal equilibrium is characterized in Sect. 4. We discuss some alternative models of reference points, and their consequences, in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes. All proofs are relegated to the “Appendix” unless mentioned otherwise. We also present the details of some omitted analyses in a Supplementary Material.",14

Tyson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper studies the question of when observed preferences over opportunity sets (“menus”) can be rationalized by underlying preferences over the alternatives they contain (“meals”). In the simplest environment, with finitely many options and a weak preference asserted by the decision maker between each pair of subsets of the universal menu, conditions for rationalizability were given by Kreps (1979, pp. 565–566) as a benchmark for his axiomatization of “preference for flexibility.” Yet despite a large subsequent literature that incorporates into menu preferences various other tastes and influences on behavior, the rationalizability question remains unanswered in the general case.Footnote 1
 We shall generalize the environment in Kreps (1979) along both dimensions mentioned in the previous paragraph. Firstly, any nonempty universal set of alternatives will be permitted, whether finite or (countably or uncountably) infinite. This will allow our framework to accommodate the many economic contexts in which finiteness is not a natural assumption, such as choice among consumption bundles, production plans, lotteries, and asset allocations.Footnote 2 Secondly, the domain of menus over which preferences are asserted will be permitted to be any nonempty subset of the set of conceivable choice problems. This will make our findings applicable to arbitrary datasets, including those that arise from observational data or laboratory experiments; or from structured settings where all menus are, for example, budget or production sets. At the heart of the rationalizability question is the need to translate meal preferences into menu preferences and vice versa. On the one hand, any meal-preference relation induces a menu-preference relation via a simple rule (see Definition 1): One menu is weakly preferred to another if each meal on the second menu is weakly inferior to some meal on the first menu. This relationship—which formalizes the concept of a rationalization—expresses the intuition that a menu is as good as the best meal it contains. Moving in the opposite direction is trivial in full-domain environments, where meal preferences coincide with the observed preferences over singleton menus. But in our general framework, singleton menus need not be included in the domain, and therefore a more reliable notion of revealed meal preference is required. We propose the following conception (see Definition 3), which in a sense reverses the rule in the previous paragraph: One meal is weakly preferred to another if each menu containing the first meal is weakly superior to some menu containing the second meal. This revealed relation captures the intuition that a meal is as bad as the worst menu containing it, and will be used to replicate the observed menu preferences in proving our results. In the finite, full-domain environment, Kreps (1979) characterizes the class of menu preferences rationalizable by complete and transitive meal preferences. The first of his two axioms, which we label Menu Order, states simply that the observed menu preferences are themselves complete and transitive. This is a straightforward consequence of the ordering properties imposed on the rationalizing meal-preference relation, and the argument does not depend on finiteness or the full-domain assumption (see Corollary 1). Hence, we inherit Menu Order from Kreps as a necessary condition. The second axiom used by Kreps (1979, p. 566), which we label Kreps Consistency, states that the more preferred of any two menus is indifferent to their union. This condition is clearly unsuitable for our framework, in which the domain of the menu-preference relation need not be closed under union. We therefore replace Kreps Consistency with a new and somewhat stronger axiom, Cover Dominance, which is appropriate for the general case.Footnote 3
 The Cover Dominance axiom. The menus \(A,B_{1},B_{2},D \subset X\) are in the domain of the menu-preference relation \(\succsim \), with \(D \subset B_{1} \cup B_{2}\). If \(A \mathrel {\succ }B_{1}\) and \(A \mathrel {\succ }B_{2}\), then Cover Dominance requires that \(A \mathrel {\succ }D\) To understand the content of Cover Dominance, consider the situation in Fig. 1. Here \(\succsim \) is the weak menu-preference relation (with associated strict relation \(\mathrel {\succ }\) and indifference relation \(\mathrel {\sim }\)), X is the universal set of alternatives, and the menus \(A,B_{1},B_{2},D \subset X\) are in the domain of \(\succsim \). If both \(A \mathrel {\succ }B_{1}\) and \(A \mathrel {\succ }B_{2}\) and if \(\succsim \) is rationalizable by meal preferences, then each meal in \(B_{1} \cup B_{2}\) should be strictly inferior to a meal in A. If also \(D \subset B_{1} \cup B_{2}\), then each meal in D (the “covered” menu) should likewise be strictly inferior to a meal in A. This leads us to anticipate that \(A \mathrel {\succ }D\), which is the conclusion mandated by Cover Dominance.Footnote 4
 Our main result (Theorem 1) thus characterizes rationalizability by means of the Menu Order and Cover Dominance conditions. In proving sufficiency of this axiom system, we also establish two of its implications that are of interest in their own right. One condition, Implicit Optima, states that each menu contains an alternative whose presence on any other menu guarantees that the second menu is no worse than the first. In terms of the rationalization, this means that even on infinite menus there can be found a greatest option with respect to the meal-preference relation. The second implied condition, Weak Cover Dominance, replaces strict with weak preference in both the hypotheses and the conclusion of Cover Dominance. This alternate version of the cover dominance property plays a role in the proof of sufficiency, as well as in linking our axiom system to that of Kreps (1979). For a concrete illustration of our framework and characterization result, let \(X = \mathfrak {R}^{2}_{+}\) and imagine a consumer with endowment \(\langle 1,1 \rangle \) who may face a variety of different relative prices. Imagine further that the consumer asserts preferences over the four price vectors \(\langle 1,1 \rangle , \langle 1,2 \rangle , \langle 2,1 \rangle \), and \(\langle 1,4 \rangle \); with respective budget sets \(B_{1}, B_{1/2}, B_{2}\), and \(B_{1/4}\). This situation is depicted in Fig. 2, where the points \(x^{1} , x^{2} , \ldots , x^{7}\) represent arbitrary consumption bundles in different regions of X. An example of preferences over the budget sets \(B_{1}, B_{1/2}, B_{2}\), and \(B_{1/4}\). The order \(B_{1/2} \mathrel {\succ }B_{2} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1/4}\) violates Cover Dominance and thus is not rationalizable. In contrast, the order \(B_{1/4} \mathrel {\succ }B_{2} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1/2}\) satisfies Cover Dominance and thus is rationalizable Suppose first that \(B_{1/2} \mathrel {\succ }B_{2} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1/4}\). Since \(B_{1/2} \subset B_{1} \cup B_{1/4}\) and both \(B_{2} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1}\) and \(B_{2} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1/4}\), Cover Dominance requires that \(B_{2} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1/2}\). But this contradicts the observed preference \(B_{1/2} \mathrel {\succ }B_{2}\), so Cover Dominance fails in this case and we can conclude that \(\succsim \) is not rationalizable by complete and transitive meal preferences. Now, suppose instead that \(B_{1/4} \mathrel {\succ }B_{2} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1/2}\). Since \(B_{1} \subset B_{2} \cup B_{1/2}\) and both \(B_{1/4} \mathrel {\succ }B_{2}\) and \(B_{1/4} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1/2}\), Cover Dominance implies \(B_{1/4} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1}\). This agrees with the observed preferences, and it is straightforward to verify that no other violations of Cover Dominance can be found in the dataset. Of course Menu Order also holds, and thus \(\succsim \) can be rationalized in this case. Note that, according to the preferences in the previous paragraph, each of the menus containing \(x^{5}\) (namely, \(B_{1}\) and \(B_{2}\)) is strictly superior to some menu containing \(x^{4}\) (namely, \(B_{1/2}\)). Evaluating each meal by the worst menu containing it, our revealed preference relation therefore considers \(x^{5}\) strictly superior to \(x^{4}\). Similarly, our relation considers \(x^{7}\) strictly superior to \(x^{5}\); \(x^{6}\) strictly superior to \(x^{7}\); and \(x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3}\), and \(x^{4}\) indifferent to each other since they are all members of the lowest ranked menu (\(B_{1/2}\)). The meal preferences that rationalize a given menu-preference relation will not in general be unique.Footnote 5 Indeed, writing a generic consumption bundle in the present context as \(z = \langle z_{1},z_{2} \rangle \), the preferences \(B_{1/4} \mathrel {\succ }B_{2} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1} \mathrel {\succ }B_{1/2}\) can be rationalized by the two distinct meal-preference relations represented by the utility functions \(u(z) = 19 z_{1} + 30 z_{2}\) and \(v(z) = \max \{ 10 z_{1} z_{2}^{3} , z_{1}^{4} z_{2} \}\). Neither coincides with our revealed meal-preference relation, which in this case has just four indifference classes (corresponding to the four menus in the dataset). Concretely, the alternatives \({\tilde{x}}^{1} = \langle 0.2,1.0 \rangle \) and \({\tilde{x}}^{4} = \langle 2.0,0.1 \rangle \) are ranked as indifferent by our revealed relation, while the two utility functions yield opposing strict preferences computed as \(u({\tilde{x}}^{1}) = 33.8 < 41.0 = u({\tilde{x}}^{4})\) and \(v({\tilde{x}}^{1}) = 2.0 > 1.6 = v({\tilde{x}}^{4})\). This example makes clear that deducing the decision maker’s true meal preferences from arbitrary menu-preference data will not typically be possible; and doing so is not our purpose in this paper. We wish, rather, to find concise and transparent conditions that characterize rationalizability without the help of domain assumptions and thus allow us to test this hypothesis under more realistic circumstances. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes how menu preferences are induced by meal preferences and how meal preferences are revealed by menu preferences, and introduces the Menu Order axiom. Section 3 proceeds to develop the Cover Dominance axiom and to state and outline the proof of our main result. Section 4 discusses rationalizability by incomplete meal preferences, shows how Kreps’s original characterization can be derived as a corollary of our result, and demonstrates how the theory of rationalizable menu preferences parallels the theory of rationalizable choice functions. Proofs are in the “Appendix”.",2

Saak,David A. Hennessy,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper is concerned with the incentives of public health agencies to truthfully report and efficiently control outbreaks of communicable diseases. When an outbreak of an infectious disease is suspected, a local health agency may notify a state or federal agency and request additional resources to investigate and, if necessary, contain it. However, due to capacity constraints, state and federal health agencies may not be able to grant all such requests which may give an incentive to local agencies to request help strategically. Disease outbreaks are episodic by nature. Spasmodically intense demand for services do not create market failures, per se. However when the services in question are intended to inform on externalities to others, then the need to ration can add to the externality management problem. Public health services are acutely aware of the technical problems that arise from rationing for the diagnostic laboratories and other resources allocated to investigate possible disease outbreaks (Metzler et al. 2010; Gates 2015; Schäferhoff et al. 2015). Technology transfer, standards setting, training subventions and efficient resource sharing have been parts of public policy for many years. In the USA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has facilitated a partnership of shared federal, state and international diagnostic human health laboratories, the Laboratory Response Network, since 1999. A similar entity, the Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, is coordinated by the US Food and Drug Administration. The World Health Organization has a Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network in place and is responsible for strengthening capacity in certain countries, though the 2015 Ebola outbreak and other recent events have revealed a consensus view that these resources are far from adequate (Gates 2015). Many countries also have contingent contracts and other plans in place to have available appropriately trained personnel in the event of a demand surge. Our concern is not with the level of resources available, but with how these limited resources are used. This paper’s contributions to the literature are to identify and study strategic motives for reporting communicable diseases in the presence of rationed tests, and to explain implications for disease prevention and control.Footnote 1 Our case is that in which a small number (two) of local health agencies (henceforth referred to as agents) in adjacent localities compete for the limited detection/diagnostic capacity (an investigation team or laboratory space). The disease spreads in two stages. In the first stage, initial outbreaks may or may not occur in each locality. In the second stage, the disease (if any) spreads within and across localities unless measures are taken to contain the outbreak. Each agent privately observes an imperfect signal of the initial disease prevalence in her locality. For example, symptoms of an outbreak may include an increase in the number or severity of cases of human or animal illness, or results of preliminary, inconclusive food or water tests for pathogen contamination. Then the agents can use this information to request a confirmatory, conclusive investigation and testing, but the request may not be granted if demand is high for the services of the shared investigative unit (at most one of the agents can be tested). The initial information in addition to information arising from their investigation request’s outcome (that is, the allocation of the test) and the results of an investigation itself (if any) can be used to infer the overall disease prevalence and the likelihood of subsequent spread across localities. Upon learning and inferring from all available information, the agent can take a costly action such as implementing a vaccination program, quarantine of susceptible population, restrictions on travel or animal movement, cleaning and disinfecting contaminated areas, or hiring additional medical personnel. For that agent, taking this action would cure (that is, the locality would become disease-free) a disease already present in the agent’s locality and would protect against contracting a disease not initially present in the locality. Furthermore, in taking the action the agent would generate a positive externality because this agent (the agent’s locality) would pose lower risk for others.Footnote 2 We are interested in understanding the agents’ joint decisions to request an investigation and exert disease control efforts. We show that even though in equilibrium the agents take too few precautions, they can either under-request or over-request additional investigations/testing, thus creating inefficiencies in the choice of public health system efforts to both assess and control the disease. An important finding is that, all else equal, the agents report suspicions less often if the cost of disease control increases. This happens because the agents respond to a greater cost of disease control by controlling the disease less often which in turn increases the risk of disease transmission from an agent who is uncertain about the disease prevalence in her locality. To reduce this risk of disease transmission, each agent is more willing to give up the testing capacity as doing so increases the probability that the other agent will exert the appropriate disease control effort. Our analysis of this sequential game is based on the solution concept of perfect Bayesian equilibrium and proceeds by first solving for the information-conditioned beliefs and disease control choices (in Sect. 3) and then using them to infer demands for confirmatory testing (Proposition 1). Confirmatory testing has two effects on overall disease control efforts. On the one hand, better informed agents are more likely to control the disease if necessary (the information effect). On the other hand, testing decreases the equilibrium disease control efforts by those who remain untested (the externality effect). While the information effect of testing is completely determined by the initial private information about the disease incidence, the externality effect is greater when demand for testing increases because agents, who are crowded out of testing, exercise less care in controlling the disease. Both the information and externality effects are taken into account in the first stage of the game when demand for external testing is determined. Although in equilibrium the reports of suspicions are positively correlated with symptoms, symptoms can be over-reported or under-reported depending on the relative strengths of the information and externality effects, that is, concerns with (a) learning about the health status in one’s locality in order to apply treatment if initially infected and avoid unnecessary expenditures if initially disease-free and (b) the disease transmission risk from the locality that requested a test but could not be tested due to the capacity constraint. However, a simple tax or subsidy for getting tested (such a scheme can take the form of state/federal assistance to local health agencies or fees for the use of state/federal investigative unit) can provide the incentives to report symptoms/suspicions truthfully and maximize the social benefits of rigorous testing as long as the private and social benefits of testing are not too misaligned. Classical analysis of epidemic outbreaks has largely modeled dynamical systems of populations, see Daley and Gani (1999). These systems have provided limited roles for behavioral responses on the part of the public health system, firms, and the subject population. Much is missing, as indicated by recent scrutiny of incentives for supply and demand in vaccine markets. Bauch et al. (2003) and others have sought to better understand stubborn resistance to public vaccination programs. They have focused on a divergence between small private incentives to vaccinate in the presence of a small cost when many others have already vaccinated and the potentially much larger public incentives to ensure herd immunity from vaccination. Ward (2014) shows empirically that certain vulnerable sub-populations benefit from high influenza vaccination rates in the community at large. Given the potential impact of disease outbreak and spread, it is not surprising that the economics of managing the spread of an infectious disease has also received attention. An example is Klepac et al. (2011), who study prevention, vaccination and treatment choices during the onset or course of an epidemic. Another is Klepac et al. (2012), who consider the optimal mix of vaccination and palliative care taking into account the budget constraint. Nguyen and Carlson (2016) also use a SIR (susceptible–infected–recovered) model to simulate the allocation of scarce vaccine in the event of an epidemic in the presence of time delays and interacting populations.Footnote 3 Our work is distinct in that it studies communication and learning about the extent of a potential outbreak before any efforts to control the disease are taken. Our paper presents novel results about the inefficiencies that may arise in disease management in adjacent areas when there is uncertainty about the initial disease prevalence and limited capacity to test for the presence of an infection. To carry out the analysis, our model considers just two times points (at the first time point, infection can be introduced from outside of the region, and at the second time point, the infection can spread across the region from one area to another unless the appropriate disease control measures are taken). Although, compared to the analysis based on the spatial /transboundary SIR models, our model says relatively little about how the disease prevalence evolves over time, the analysis sheds novel light on the potential problems in early detection. A sub-discipline at the interface between epidemiology and the behavioral sciences has emerged to address the bounds that human actions have placed on epidemiological tools for policy analysis and for supporting field work in particular disease management campaigns, see Funk et al. (2010). Perhaps the most prominent approach to integrating behavior into such models has been the endogenization of social distancing, namely allowing agents to adapt social interaction behavior to the presence and extent of a disease and also allowing policy makers to seek to engineer such adaptation, as in Fenichel et al. (2011) and Perrings et al. (2014). Funk et al. (2015) outline a variety of other behavioral responses that warrant attention. One of these, outlined in their Challenge 4, asks for more research on how diagnosis and reporting behavior change during the course of a disease event.Footnote 4 Such voluntary action and information issues comprise the essence of our concern, but where we also emphasize scarcity of resources available to address the disease. The role of test choice, absent a capacity constraint, has arisen elsewhere in the literature. For example, Shavell (1994) has considered when producers choose to undergo a third party test on product quality and then on whether to make test results publicly available. One finding is that requiring all who test and find a product defect to make their test results public may undermine demand for testing. Philipson and Posner (1995) have made this point in the context of testing for infectious diseases. Kremer (1996) shows conceptually that responses to infectious disease test information are likely to be heterogeneous in regard to preventive behavior, and may be a wash upon aggregation while Boozer and Philipson (2000) hold that responses will be largest among those who are most surprised by the results. As far as we are aware, no work has considered strategic dimensions to test availability and demand for testing which may signal to others that the disease prevalence is greater than expected as well as that care will be taken to control the disease.Footnote 5
 Our paper also contributes to a large literature on cheap talk with multiple senders that builds on Crawford and Sobel (1982). The models in Gilligan and Krehbiel (1989), Epstein (1998), and Krishna and Morgan (2001) make different assumptions about the configurations of the senders’ preferences relative to one another and the receiver (decision-maker), but the state space is one-dimensional and senders have perfect information about the realized state. Similar to our case, in the settings in Wolinsky (2002) and McGee and Yang (2013) experts have partial, non-overlapping, and complementary information. These papers show that partial communication among experts may elicit the greatest amount of information, and that the senders’ information transmissions exhibit strategic complementarity. Here we allow for imperfect signals about the states of the world and for two-way communication whereas our agents report and receive information about disease incidence. The problem considered here is not just one of cheap talk as the report made by an agent (location) gets a response from the central testing agency which rations testing and influences the agents’ subsequent choices. In models of multi-dimensional cheap talk with two perfectly informed senders and a receiver who makes two decisions, Battaglini (2002) and Ambrus and Takahashi (2008) show that equilibrium communication can fully reveal private information. In contrast, we find that communication may or may not be truthful when senders have non-overlapping, imperfect information. In Austen-Smith (1993) and Morgan and Stocken (2008) experts observe conditionally independent signals regarding the state of the world, which gives rise to an information congestion effect whereas transmission of information by one agent reduces the sensitivity of the receiver’s decision to the report of another agent, and thus reduces the incentives to transmit information. In our setting, agents strategically manipulate not only the policy outcome (test allocation) but also each other’s actions (disease control efforts). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present a simple two-stage model of spread of a controllable infectious disease between two localities in the presence of imperfect information about the disease incidence and limited diagnostic testing. In Sects. 3 and 4, we characterize equilibrium disease control efforts and demand for testing. In Sect. 5, we consider the optimal subsidy/tax scheme. Section 6 extends the model to accommodate more than two agents/localities. Section 7 concludes.",4

Rohde,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Most decisions we take today involve an uncertain outcome at some point in the future. This is not only true for investments and savings, but also for daily decisions about, for instance, what to eat and whether or not to go to the gym. Empirical evidence shows that many decisions are time inconsistent in the sense that the mere passage of time makes people change their plans (Frederick et al. 2002). Such time inconsistencies can cause under-investment and unhealthy lifestyles, which impose large costs on society. A good understanding of the drivers of these time inconsistencies can help to provide solutions to overcome them and to reduce the associated costs. The literature on intertemporal choice has mostly abstracted from uncertainty in order to focus exclusively on pure time preference (for a survey see Frederick et al. 2002). However, as the future is inherently uncertain, it is also important to examine how pure time preference and risk attitudes interact (Bommier 2006; Takanori and Goto 2009; Epper et al. 2011; Epper and Fehr-Duda 2015a, b; Andreoni and Sprenger 2012, 2015; Cheung 2015; Miao and Zhong 2015). This paper proposes a model of intertemporal choice which contributes to the literature in two ways. First, unlike many existing models of intertemporal choice, our model allows for an interaction between pure time preference and risk attitude. This is in line with empirical evidence on the non-separability of time and risk (Keren and Roelofsma 1995; Abdellaoui et al. 2011; Baucells and Heukamp 2012) and with construal-level theory in psychology (Trope and Liberman 2010) according to which both risk and time induce psychological distance that influences decision making. The second contribution is that we separate two effects the delay of an outcome can have on its evaluation. A delay requires the decision maker to project himself to the future and to imagine how much he will appreciate the outcome once he receives it. This projection may, but need not, be accurate. For instance, people tend to suffer from projection bias when predicting future utility (Loewenstein et al. 2003). Additionally, the delay of the outcome makes its receipt psychologically more distant, and therefore less salient, than immediate outcomes. This paper considers preferences over single outcomes to be received with a particular probability at a particular point in time. It, therefore, adds an uncertainty dimension to the framework of Fishburn and Rubinstein (1982). Our weighted temporal utility model evaluates such outcomes by multiplying the time-dependent utility of the outcome with a weight, which depends on the psychological distance induced by the probability and the time at which the outcome is received. Keren and Roelofsma (1995), Abdellaoui et al. (2011), and Baucells and Heukamp (2012) provided empirical evidence for the interaction of the probability and timing of an outcome. To capture this, our model of psychological distance does not require probability and time to be additively separable. Moreover, the magnitude effect, which shows that larger outcomes are discounted at a lower rate than smaller outcomes, suggests that an outcome and its timing may also not be additively separable (Frederick et al. 2002). Thus, in line with the empirical evidence, our model allows for interactions between probabilities and time on the one hand and between outcomes and time on the other hand, while outcomes and probabilities are assumed to be additively separable for every given point in time. For single outcomes, our model accommodates rank-dependent utility, prospect theory, exponential discounting, and hyperbolic discounting as special cases. The first part of this paper provides a characterization of the WTU model. In the second part, we consider the WTU model in a dynamic setting. We will show how properties of the weighting and utility function are related to time-inconsistent behavior. In a dynamic setting, one has to distinguish between consumption time, decision time, and temporal distance between consumption and decision time. Time discounting is typically interpreted as depending on consumption and decision time through temporal distance only. In line with this standard approach to time discounting and with the interpretation of psychological distance, we let the weighting function depend on probability and temporal distance only. The utility function, however, can depend on time in various ways. We let utility depend on consumption time only, on temporal distance only, or on decision time only. People who perfectly project themselves to the future and correctly expect their future utilities to change over time will have utilities that depend on consumption time only. People whose projections of the future improve as time passes can be modeled by utility functions that depend on temporal distance as well. The literature on intertemporal choice has focused almost exclusively on one potential driver of time inconsistencies: non-stationarity. Stationarity holds if a preference between outcomes to be received at different points in time is unaffected by a common additional delay of all outcomes. Deviations from stationarity are often thought to be driven by pure time preference, being the way people weight future points in time, irrespective of the outcomes received at these points in time. Accordingly, hyperbolic discounting models were proposed to accommodate non-stationary behavior (Loewenstein and Prelec 1992; Harvey 1986, 1995; Mazur 1987; Phelps and Pollak 1968). These models can be given a psychological foundation by construal-level theory (Trope and Liberman 2010) and the nonlinear manner in which humans perceive temporal distance (Zauberman et al. 2009). To the extent that these nonlinear perceptions of time are considered irrational, we can view deviations from stationarity caused by pure time preference as irrational. While deviations from stationarity are a potential cause of time inconsistencies, Halevy (2015) provided empirical evidence that non-stationary behavior neither implies nor is implied by time inconsistency. In his study, only two-thirds of the subjects who exhibit time consistency also exhibit stationarity and half of the subjects whose choices are time inconsistent exhibit stationarity. These findings show that deviations from stationarity are not the sole drivers of time-inconsistent behavior and they cast doubt on the extent to which such deviations are irrational. In our model, deviations from stationarity are not only caused by pure time preference and nonlinear perception of time (Takahashi et al. 2008), but also by the time dependence of the utility of an outcome. Such time dependence naturally arises whenever the decision maker evaluates an outcome according to the extra utility it generates on top of some baseline consumption (cf. Noor 2009; Gerber and Rohde 2010). If the decision maker expects his baseline consumption to change over time, then the utility of an outcome depends on its timing irrespective of pure time preference. This dependency, which can induce non-stationarity, can be viewed as foresight of future utility and, therefore, is not irrational as long as it is perfect foresight. We will show that the dependence of the utility of an outcome on its timing and the resulting non-stationarities need not result in time inconsistencies. Depending on whether utility depends on consumption time only, temporal distance only, or decision time only, time consistencies are driven by properties of the weighting function only or by properties of the utility function as well. As the timing of an outcome influences both its utility and the weight given to the probability that it will be received, measuring the weighting and utility functions of the weighted temporal utility model may seem difficult at first sight. We will show how this can be accomplished in a nonparametric way. This nonparametric approach does not require any assumption about the shape of the utility and weighting functions. In particular, it does not require an assumption of linear utility, which is often used in the literature. The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the weighted temporal utility (WTU) model and provides an axiomatization. Section 3 discusses the relation between WTU and other models of intertemporal choice. In Sect. 4, we show that the WTU model is consistent with empirical regularities. Section 5 presents a dynamic version of WTU and provides conditions for stationarity, time consistency, and time invariance. Section 6 shows how the weighting and utility function of WTU can be measured. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes.",4

We propose an approach that puts more emphasis on procedural fairness, and we offer a utilitarian result that does not use the independence assumption. Harsanyi analyzed a society that needs to choose among alternate social policies, each of which is a probability distribution over a given set of social actions, where the latter associate outcomes with the society’s members. Every social lottery \(\ell \) induces a lottery \(\ell _{i}\) on individual i. Individual i’s preferences \(\succcurlyeq _{i}\) are known, and different individuals may possess distinct preferences. To help determine the optimal social policy, Harsanyi suggested that every individual is endowed with social preferences. Individuals may develop these preferences by adopting the role of an impartial observer, thus disregarding their true identities and acting behind “a veil of ignorance”. Therefore, the impartial observer can form her social preferences by imagining that she faces not only a lottery \(\ell \) over social actions, but also a lottery \(\gamma \) over identities. Elements of \(\gamma \) can be interpreted as weights associated by the impartial observer with the different individuals. Then, the optimal social policy is determined by restricting attention to the equiprobable lottery \(\gamma ^{e}=\left( \frac{1}{n},\ldots ,\frac{1}{n}\right) \). Harsanyi argued strongly for “Bayesian rationality”. That is, he assumed that (among the other Bayesian postulates) all individuals satisfy the independenceassumption of the expected utility theory, both at their personal and social preference layers. Harsanyi claimed that this “sound” axiom, together with the so-called  acceptance principle (that an impartial observer fully adopts individual i’s preferences if she imagines becoming that individual for sure), would force the impartial observer to be a (weighted) utilitarian. More formally, over all extended lotteries \((\gamma ,\ell )\) in which the identity and the action lotteries are independently distributed, the impartial observer’s preferences admit the following representation: where \(\gamma _{i}\) is the probability of assuming person i’s identity and \(U_{i}(\ell _{i})\,{:=}\, \sum _{x}u_{i}(x)\ell _{i}(x)\) is person i’s von Neumann–Morgenstern expected utility. Like Harsanyi, most authors who derived modifications of the utilitarianism result within the impartial observer framework always assumed the independence axiom [see the works of Weymark (1991), Karni (1998) and Grant et al. (2010); henceforth, GKPS)].Footnote 1 Notable exceptions within the related social aggregation framework are Blackorby et al. (2004) and Mongin and Pivato (2015).Footnote 2 Interestingly, Harsanyi’s entire emphasis on Bayesian rationality was based on an individual-centered approach. Firstly, he assumed that rational individuals must satisfy the independence assumption and secondly, he claimed that society, by its need to be at least as rational as its members, must also satisfy independence (Harsanyi 1975). We disagree with Harsanyi on this. Instead we argue that when societal decision problems are at stake, postulates must not be drawn from individualistic behavior. Rather, they should be based on societal norms. Hence, when social preferences are formed, issues like societal fairness and equity should explicitly be the guiding principles. In this work we focus on procedural fairness. This principle was first advocated by Diamond (1967) and was strongly supported by Sen (e.g., 1977). Its essence can be illustrated by the following example, which is an adoption of Diamond’s example from the social aggregation framework to the impartial observer one. Consider a society that needs to decide on how to allocate an indivisible good between two individuals, 1 and 2, and let action \(a^{i}\) denote allocating it to individual i. Suppose, as Diamond did, that \(u_{i}(a^{i})=1\) for both i and \(u_{i}(a^{j})=0\) for \(i\ne j\) (that is, both individuals like the good, receive a utility of one unit from having it and zero otherwise). As was noted above assume that, when making a choice, the impartial observer considers the equiprobable identity lottery \( \gamma ^{e}=\left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right) \) (that is, she gives equal weights to the two individuals). Also assume that she evaluates all four outcomes in full agreement with the two individuals and adopts their utilities. The example can be described by the following matrix where individuals 1 and 2 correspond to the rows, actions \(a^{1}\) and \( a^{2}\) correspond to the columns and the entries represent the impartial observer’s utilities. The impartial observer has two policies at hand: Policy (1), which allocates the good to individual 1 (this policy is equivalent to choosing action \(a^{1}\) and facing the first column of the table) and Policy (2), which allocates the good to one of the individuals, depending on the outcome of a toss of a fair coin (this policy is equivalent to the action lottery \(\frac{1}{2}a^{1}+\frac{1}{2}a^{2}\)). The value of Policy (1) for Harsanyi’s utilitarian observer is \(\frac{1}{2}\times 1+\frac{ 1}{2}\times 0=\frac{1}{2}\), as is the value of Policy (2): \(\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2}\times 1+\frac{1}{2}\times 0\right) +\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{1}{2}\times 0+\frac{1}{2}\times 1\right) =\frac{1}{2}\). Hence, the impartial observer is indifferent between the two policies.Footnote 3 However, Diamond and Sen argued that Policy (2) provides both individuals with a “fair shake” and hence the impartial observer might prefer it.Footnote 4 This notion of procedural fairness is expressed in our work by the notion of (weak) convexity over action lotteries: if, given the identity equiprobable lottery \(\gamma ^{e}\), the observer is indifferent between two action lotteries \(\ell \) and \( \ell ^{\prime }\) (while two individuals disagree on their ranking) then their mixtures cannot be worse than them.Footnote 5 Working in a framework in which the basic building blocks are two different types of lotteries, those over identities and those over actions, raises a natural question: should these types be treated similarly? Harsanyi, by construction, implicitly assumed that they should. Furthermore, in his own response to Diamond’s concern about fairness, Harsanyi (1975) argued that even if randomizations were of value for promoting fairness (which he doubted), any explicit randomization is superfluous since “the great lottery of (pre-)life” may be viewed as having already given each child an equal chance of being each individual. That is, it does not matter whether a good is allocated by a (possibly imaginary) lottery over identities or by a (real) lottery over actions. Put it differently, Harsanyi argued that we need to be indifferent between “accidents of birth” (identity lotteries) and real “life chances” (action lotteries). On this issue we agree with Harsanyi and just make this assumption explicit. We call it source indifference. Despite its innocuous appearance, the conjunction of this assumption with procedural fairness turns out to be rather forceful. More precisely, the main result of this work shows that (assuming impartiality) convexity, source indifference and a stronger notion of acceptance are necessary, and sufficient, for utilitarianism. Since the independence axiom is not assumed here, this result is novel and quite unexpected. Paraphrasing Sen’s quote, we believe that one could hardly find an axiomatic justification of utilitarianism that starts off at a place that is more distant from the ultimate destination than ours. Lastly, our result carries an ‘impossibility flavor’: if societies are required to exhibit strict inclination toward procedural fairness, then source indifference cannot hold. Therefore, to accommodate views of authors like Diamond and Sen, the impartial observer must display preference for action lotteries over identity ones. We elaborate on this in the concluding section. This work is organized as follows: Sect. 2 sets up the framework, Sect. 3 presents the assumptions, Sect. 4 states and explains the utilitarian result, and Sect. 5 concludes. Finally, proofs are given in Sect. 6.",1

67.0,3.0,Economic Theory,07 September 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00199-017-1075-7,A qualitative theory of large games with strategic complementarities,April 2019,Łukasz Balbus,Paweł Dziewulski,Łukasz Woźny,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Beginning with the seminal work of Schmeidler (1973) and Mas-Colell (1984), there has been a great deal of work in the economic literature focusing on games with a continuum of players.Footnote 1 In a separate, yet related set of papers, researchers have turned their attention to the question of the existence of equilibrium comparative statics in large games with strategic complementarities (henceforth LGSC) between player actions or “traits” [e.g., see Guesnerie and Jara-Moroni (2011) or Acemoglu and Jensen (2010, 2013)]. The latter strand of work focused primarily on non-atomic, aggregative games, in which payoffs of individual players were affected by an aggregate of actions of other players in the game (or a vector of aggregates). In such games, the questions of equilibrium existence, its computation, and equilibrium comparative statics could be simplified to a great extent.Footnote 2 As we show in this paper, there are classes of large games with a continuum of players in which the payoff of an individual agent depends inherently on the entire distribution of actions and characteristics of other players. Such games cannot be analyzed using the “aggregative games” toolkit. In particular, none of these results in the existing literature that provide positive answers for existence, computation, or comparative statics of equilibria can be applied to such distributional games. Finally, the importance of studying large non-aggregative games with “traits” or diverse personal characteristics has been highlighted, among others, by the recent papers of Khan et al. (2013a, b). In these papers, the authors stress the cardinality of traits as a key factor not only to verify conditions of equilibrium existence, but also to use large games in the study of actual economic problems. In this paper, we ask a number of questions. First, can the methods used to verify the existence of equilibrium in games with strategic complementarities (with a finite number of players; henceforth GSC) be extended to a general class of games with a continuum of players? If this is possible, can one develop conditions for equilibrium comparative statics results and what will be their nature? Finally, can we develop a theory of computable equilibrium comparative statics for these games? We begin our analysis in Sect. 2, where we provide new sufficient conditions under which there exists a distributional equilibrium of a LGSC with complete information. In addition, we provide a sharp order-theoretic characterization of the set of equilibria. This characterization plays a central role in developing results on equilibrium comparative statics, as well as when providing an explicit iterative method for computing extremal equilibria. Specifically, by applying constructive results from the literature on order continuous operators, we are able to relax some key continuity conditions on payoffs which are typically required for equilibrium existence in the existing literature that seek to apply standard topological arguments (e.g., continuity in weak topologies). Moreover, this approach provides constructive methods for computing the extremal equilibria by their successive approximation starting from the extremal elements of the space of all feasible distributions of player actions and “traits”. To our knowledge, there are no similar results in the existing literature on computation of extremal equilibria in LGSC. This result proves to be central in identifying sufficient conditions for the existence of computable equilibrium comparative statics with respect to parameters of a game. The central point this paper makes is, although the tools used for a study of equilibrium in GSC and LGSC are similar in a very broad methodological sense, the particulars of the methods are significantly different. This dissimilarity arises due to the inherent infinite-dimensional structure of large games. In the framework we develop, joint strategies of players as well as equilibria are defined in terms of probability distributions. Since, in general, sets of probability distributions are not lattices, the methods applied in the analysis for GSC do not apply when seeking to construct and characterize equilibria for LGSC. For example, even though it is possible to provide conditions under which the set of distributional equilibria has greatest and least element, the set of distributional equilibria is, in general, not a complete lattice.Footnote 3 Rather, at most, we are able to show that whenever the best responses of players are functions, the set of distributional equilibria is a chain complete partially ordered set (but not necessarily a complete lattice).Footnote 4 Additionally, the measurability issues induced by the infinite-dimensional specification of LGSC create significant impediments in determining the existence of an equilibrium of the game, let alone characterizing the natures of equilibrium monotone comparative statics. An alternative approach to the measurability issue was recently proposed by Yang and Qi (2013). In this paper, the authors restrict attention to equilibria in strategies that are monotone with respect to traits/characteristics. Their key assumption that the set of traits/characteristics is a chain allows them to apply the results from the existing literature on monotone games.Footnote 5 In general, such specialization is not needed. Rather, we show in this paper for our general specification of a LGSC one does not need to impose significant restrictions on the set of equilibrium strategies, nor the class of games under consideration (aside from measurability). Importantly, in this paper, we also distinguish the need for sufficient complementarities for the existence of a monotone operator on the space of distributional strategies, as opposed to requiring this existence argument be associated with monotone best responses (in names/traits). We show, for a constructive theory of LSGC, we only need a monotone operator; not monotone equilibria. In fact, in Sect. 3 we apply our methods to economic problems in which strategies of players are non-monotone with respect to players characteristics. As a result, both the techniques used and the results obtained in our paper differ in many important dimensions from the environments studied in Yang and Qi (2013) and Bilancini and Boncinelli (2016). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we provide our main results on the existence of distributional equilibrium, as well as our results on computable equilibrium comparative statics. We also discuss the relationship between our results, and those in the existing literature. In Sect. 3, we show how our results can be applied to Akerlof’s social distance model, large optimal stopping games, keeping up with the Joneses, as well as a general class of linear non-atomic supermodular games. Finally, in the “Appendix”, we introduce the requisite mathematical terminology used in the paper, as well as some important auxiliary results.",9

A common approach is to require efficiency in the Pareto sense. However, as noted by several authors (Koopmans 1960; Diamond 1965; Basu and Mitra 2003; Fleurbaey and Michel 2003; Banerjee 2006; Zame 2007; Hara et al. 2008; Crespo et al. 2009; Dubey and Mitra 2011, 2015), a fundamental problem with this approach is that the Pareto axiom is generally inconsistent with equity as formalized by anonymity.Footnote 1 This will be discussed in more detail later in the introduction. To circumvent the problem we propose weaker versions of some well-known Pareto axioms. For any utility streams x and y, our criteria roughly speaking require this: If a utility stream x dominates another utility stream y and if the (lower asymptotic) density of the set of coordinates in favor of x is strictly positive, then x is socially preferred to y. A crucial ingredient in our formalization of efficiency is the notion of asymptotic density (or natural density), which is a notion designed to measure how large certain subsets of the natural numbers are. It formalizes the intuition that the set of even numbers is larger than the set of multiples of three, even though there is a one to one correspondence between them (both are countable). Heuristically, if we let the set of natural numbers have measure one, the even numbers should have measure \(\frac{1}{2}\), since “half” of the members of \(\mathbf {N}\) are even, and similarly the set of multiples of three should be assigned measure \(\frac{1}{3}\). Part of our motivation is that existing notions of efficiency, as formalized by various Pareto principles, are economically either too strict or too weak. Crespo et al. (2009) argue that the strong Pareto axiom is too strict since the welfare of a society should not be influenced by the utility of a single generation. In consequence they introduce the infinite Pareto principle.Footnote 2 But even infinite Pareto seems too strict economically since, intuitively, the welfare of a society should not be affected by the utilities of certain “small” subsets of generations. To see this, suppose that any generation n with \(n=10^k\) receive an increase in their utility. According to infinite Pareto the new stream of utilities should be ranked above the old stream. However, the distance between any consecutive pair of generations receiving a strict increase in utility goes to infinity as k increases. Hence, it is not clear that the new stream of utilities should be ranked strictly above the old stream. The weak Pareto axiom takes the issues mentioned in the previous paragraph into account and demands that if every generation is strictly better off then society should be strictly better off. Hence, it is insensitive to an increase in the utilities of a “small” subset of generations. However, this axiom seems too weak economically. Suppose for example that every second generation, \(n=2k\) for \(k \in \mathbf {N}\), receives an increase in their utility and every other generations’ utility remains the same. Then, it seems intuitively clear that the former stream should be ranked above the latter; however, the weak Pareto axiom does not necessarily see the difference. As a suggested remedy to the issues mentioned above, we propose a criterion that we call asymptotic Pareto. It is intermediate in strength between infinite Pareto and weak Pareto. Roughly speaking, it requires the following: If every generation receives a higher utility, and if every generation in a set of strictly positive lower asymptotic density receives a strict increase in utility, then society is better off. In addition, we propose a weak version of asymptotic Pareto. Consider utility streams \(x = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, \ldots )\) and \(y = (1, 0.99, 1, 0.999, 1, 0.9999, 1, \ldots )\). According asymptotic Pareto x is socially preferred to y. But since, for any given threshold, there are at most a finite number of generations receiving an increase above the threshold it is not clear that x should be ranked above y. Weak asymptotic Pareto takes this into account by ranking a stream of utilities above another stream only if a subset of generations with positive lower asymptotic density receive an increase exceeding some fixed threshold \(\varepsilon > 0\). Due to its intuitive interpretation, asymptotic density has gained considerable interest as a tool in the theory of social welfare aggregation. Notable are the papers by Lauwers (1998), Lauwers (2011) and Fey (2004, 2005). Fey (2004) characterizes majority rules with infinitely many voters, and uses asymptotic density to measure the size of large societies. In his characterization, Fey (2004) uses a criterion called density positive responsiveness, which requires ties to be broken if a set of voters with positive asymptotic density change their preference. The criterion that we propose is also sensitive to societies of positive asymptotic density. Lauwers (1998) considers an equity principle based on asymptotic density, bounded anonymity. He restricts attention to linear social welfare functions and discusses the compatibility of bounded anonymity with efficiency. One implication of his work is that, although strong Pareto is generally incompatible with bounded anonymity, a weak form of the Pareto axiom is not. We discuss the relation between our and his results further below. The conflict between equity and efficiency is well known in the literature on intertemporal welfare economics (Koopmans 1960; Diamond 1965; Basu and Mitra 2003). It has been noted that equity, as formalized by anonymity, generally is inconsistent with the Pareto principle. Basu and Mitra (2003) show that there is no social welfare function with these properties. Even if one restricts attention to social welfare orders, anonymity and Pareto, implies the existence of a non-Ramsey set, and is thus a non-constructive object (Lauwers 2010). The literature has found several ways around the problems posed above. For instance, one could agree to drop the completeness axiom and several interesting relations emerge satisfying Pareto and anonymity. See for instance (Basu and Mitra 2007; Bossert et al. 2007; Zuber and Asheim 2012) and references therein. Alternatively one could consider other versions of equity and efficiency as in Basu and Mitra (2007), Dubey and Mitra (2011, 2015) and Alcantud (2012, 2013). Our proposed solution is to consider weakened versions of the Pareto axiom. As a robustness check of our efficiency axioms and as a main goal of the paper, we investigate the “degree of conflict” between the proposed efficiency principles and various notions of equity. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part of the paper, we characterize one period utility domains Y admitting a social welfare function satisfying asymptotic Pareto and finite anonymity. Thus, we identify the exact limitations imposed by our axioms on the domain of a prospective social welfare function. The results are analogous to the results obtained in Dubey and Mitra (2011) and Dubey and Mitra (2015). In the second part of the paper, we then proceed to derive limitations imposed on Y by a social binary relation satisfying asymptotic Pareto and bounded anonymity. We do not impose any explicit transitivity/completeness requirements on welfare relations considered in this part of the paper. To see why it may be of economic interest to consider bounded anonymity, in addition to finite anonymity, note that finite anonymity only requires every single generation to count the same in social evaluation. However, it does not necessarily require sets of generations with “equal size” to count the same. Consider for example utility streams \(x=(1,0,1,0,1,\ldots )\) and \(y=(0,1,0,1,0,\ldots )\). A strict preference between x and y is consistent with finite anonymity. But intuitively it could be argued that these two sequences should be regarded as equally important, since in both cases “half of the generations” receive a utility of one. Bounded anonymity demands a social welfare order to be left invariant by permutations switching subsets of equally large lower asymptotic density. Thus bounded anonymity implies that society regards x and y as equally important. Since every function is a binary relation, one would expect the conditions on Y derived in the second part of the paper to be more permissive than the corresponding conditions obtained in the first part of the paper. The answer to this question depends on whether we impose finite or bounded anonymity as an axiom on welfare aggregators. By theorem 2 in Svensson (1980), there is a social welfare relation satisfying finite anonymity and (asymptotic) Pareto on arbitrary domains \(Y \subseteq [0,1]\). However, by assuming bounded anonymity, it turns out that the domains Y admitting a binary relation satisfying bounded anonymity and asymptotic Pareto exactly coincides with domains Y admitting a social welfare function satisfying finite anonymity and asymptotic Pareto. A corollary to the results discussed above is that there is a social welfare function satisfying bounded anonymity and asymptotic Pareto if and only if there is a binary relation with these properties. This result is in quite sharp contrast to previous results in the literature. For example, Dubey and Mitra (2011) derive characterizing conditions on Y such that Y admits a social welfare function satisfying weak Pareto and finite anonymity. However, for all subsets Y that fail to admit such a function there is a social welfare relation with the desired properties (theorem 2 in Svensson 1980). The paper is organized as follows. Preliminaries are in Sect. 2. The model and efficiency axioms are introduced and discussed in Sect. 3. Section 4, the first part of the paper, is devoted to the discussion of the consistency between asymptotic Pareto and anonymity. The second part of the paper, Sect. 5 then discusses the consistency of bounded anonymity with our proposed efficiency principles. We conclude in Sect. 6.",8

In this paper, I introduce a new mechanism which describes a form of information leakage in financial markets that can generate herd and contrarian behavior, phenomena that I group under the label of path-dependent behavior (PDB).Footnote 1 Like event uncertainty, this mechanism exploits the asymmetry of information between traders and the marker maker setting the price. Unlike event uncertainty, it does not require a shock in the value of the asset. Changing the nature of the informational asymmetry has important implications in terms of tractability,Footnote 2 allowing the model to link beliefs and price formation throughout time to information quality and market structure. The proposed mechanism is related to the role of word-of-mouth communication and networks in transmitting information about stocks among investors. In his book Irrational Exuberance, Shiller (2015) notes that “word-of-mouth transmission of ideas appears to be an important contribution to day-to-day or hour-to-hour stock market fluctuations” (p. 155). In the same spirit, Hong et al. (2005) study the holdings and trades of mutual fund managers working in the same city to test the hypothesis that they exchange ideas by word-of-mouth. They find that this prediction is strongly confirmed by the data at the level of both holdings and trades of thousands of securities.Footnote 3 I think of the interaction of traders—whether acting as brokers or as dealers—on trading floors (physical and virtual) as forming an information network. I model the exchange/leakage of information about an asset by assigning each trader a type and by assuming that traders on the same information network can observe each other’s types. I assume two types: type I traders are always informed and receive a signal about the (unknown) value of the asset; type II traders are informed with some known probability and uninformed otherwise. If uninformed, traders buy and sell with equal probability. I model the trading activity following Glosten and Milgrom (1985). Each period, a trader is selected randomly to trade one unit of the asset with a competitive, risk neutral and uninformed market maker. The market maker does not belong to the network governing the flow of information about the asset. He posts a bid and an ask price at which he buys and sells without knowing the type or the information of his trading counterpart. Information is leaked because, through the observation of types, traders gain a better assessment of whether the market activity is more or less revealing of the value of the asset.Footnote 4 Herding occurs after a long enough sequence of type I buys which causes traders to update their beliefs as if they had full information about the signal realizations. In other words, information leaks from the long sequence of type I buys. At the same time, the market maker has to consider the eventuality that the trades he observes are generated by noise. This causes price rigidity to the point where traders find it advantageous to buy regardless of their signal. On the other hand, contrarianism is the consequence of type II trading activity. The probability of noise conditional on observing a type II trader is higher than the overall fraction of noise traders. This causes the price to overreact to type II trading activity and causes traders to ignore their private information to go against the market. As mentioned, AZ appeal to event uncertainty to generate herd behavior. Under event uncertainty, a shock may cause the asset value to change. Traders receive a signal informing them both about the occurrence of the shock and about the likelihood of each possible new value, whereas the market maker can only learn about the shock by observing their trading behavior. AZ conduct comparative statics with respect to information quality for a given trading history. Due to the recursive nature of their model, their analysis is limited to obtaining results “one step at a time.” They find that, holding beliefs fixed at each point in time, herding occurs for values of the signal precision below some threshold. In contrast, using the new mechanism in my model, I can link the quality of information and market structure to price and belief formation over time, and to the likelihood of different trading histories. This allows me to formally prove that, for any trading history, there exists a threshold for the quality of private information above which PDB occurs with positive probability.Footnote 5 Moreover, I find that, after some critical time period in the trading history, there exists a threshold for the quality of private information above which the probability of PDB is higher the higher the quality of the traders’ information.Footnote 6 Early on, the trading history does not have much weight (i.e., does not contain much information), and an increase in the quality of private information makes it more difficult for the traders to disregard their private signal to follow or go against the crowd. For a long enough trading history and for a high enough information quality, the weight of history increases relatively more than the information contained in the private signal, the higher the precision of the latter. This increases the probability of PDB. PDB makes the price more volatileFootnote 7; however, it does not lead to extreme price behavior such as booms and crashes. No extreme price behavior is generated by traders’ communication, even if the marker maker is not aware of information leaking, as long as he knows the quality of private information and the overall level of noise trading. In fact, during a PDB episode, traders are aware that the trading activity is completely uninformative. This gives the market maker the ability to catch up on the information that is available to the traders through their interaction. Overall, price informativeness is improved as more information is available to the traders, triggering herding in the direction of the true state of the world, which, on average, suppresses the opinion of traders receiving incorrect signals.Footnote 8 In fact, in the limit, for any initial beliefs, PDB occurs almost surely in the form of herd behavior in the direction of the correct state of the world, while the likelihood of contrarianism converges to zero.Footnote 9 This is because contrarianism requires a low rate of information leakage, but when the rate of information leakage is low, the price is too sticky, which hinders contrarianism. In general, for any level of information leakage, the market structure outlined above is characterized by a high degree of price stickiness which helps herding but hinders contrarianism. Studying the limit (for \(t\rightarrow \infty \)) behavior of a market with information leakage, I find that an increase in the quality of information results in a monotonic increase in order imbalance.Footnote 10 In this case, market participants will not be confused between poorly and well informed markets, as long as they are aware that the market structure allows for herding. In contrast, when a market analyst misjudges the market structure by either overestimating or underestimating the leakage of information in the market, he will always underestimate or overestimate the quality of private information, respectively.Footnote 11 Specifically, an analyst underestimating the information leakage attributes too much of the order imbalance to the quality of the private information rather than to the fact that this is leaking. In particular, when an analyst is completely unaware of information leakage, the overestimation of the signal precision is non-monotonic in the quality of information.Footnote 12 There are three factors contributing to this result. First, at low levels, increasing the signal precision increases the speed of buildup of the difference in beliefs between the traders and the market maker, triggering herding. Second, at low levels, increasing the signal precision makes the time of recovery from herding longer, as the informational content of the last non-herding trade is larger. The latter constitutes the informational gap that the market maker needs to eliminate in order to catch up with the traders and to recover normal trading. At low levels of the signal precision, both factors increase the distortion in inference about information quality. Third, as the signal quality increases, the probability of receiving an incorrect signal decreases. Since herding goes, on average, in the direction of the true state of the word, the less likely the realization of an incorrect signal, the less likely herding is to alter trading activity. For a sufficiently high level of the signal precision, this third effect takes over and the distortion in the inference about information quality starts decreasing. Despite the mild impact of PDB on the price, traders can spend a large amount of time herding. In particular, when all information available is leaked, the signal precision is very high, and the level of noise trading is neither too high nor too low, the market is expected to herd 50% of the time.Footnote 13 Clearly, both the facts that the quality of information is high and that it is made perfectly available to all traders exacerbate the asymmetry of information between the traders and the market maker. Too much noise trading would not generate enough information to be leaked causing the price to be sticky, whereas low levels of noise trading allow the marker maker to keep up with the information in trading activity. Modeling the market maker as an agent completely cut out of the information network needs some further discussion. The market maker can be interpreted as an arbitrary price fixing mechanism, such as a Walrasian auctioneer, or as a traditional liquidity provider. The market maker is not completely uninformed. But, because he is not directly interacting with traders second by second, in the middle of the fray, he can find himself relatively uninformed compared to speculators and brokers. Speculators or brokers have the opportunity, the ability and the incentive to share information with one another. As a result, information can leak and spread among informed traders for a variety of reasons, some voluntary and some involuntary, leaving the market maker at an informational disadvantage. For instance, once a trade is executed there is more to gain than to lose in letting others know that “some known bank” or “a significant market participant” has just placed its bets one way or another. In fact, traders want others to do the same in order to move the market in a favorable direction (MacKenzie 2008a; Van Bommel 2003). Another reason to voluntarily share information lies in the reciprocity of traders’ relationships with one another. Information about the latest transactions and mood witnessed on the local trading floor is repaid by granting favorable prices and volunteering further information. These links of reciprocity facilitate the flow of information and allow traders to track the market “as it is made” (Knorr Cetina and Bruegger 2002). Belonging to a business network enables a trader to gain an information edge and to profit from it before others. Moreover, sharing information is a major part of what clients expect from their brokers. While they would not explicitly reveal the identity of market actors, “there is a grey area where euphemisms can be used [such as] ‘the usual German’ has just done something” (MacKenzie 2008b). Information can leak involuntarily when a broker who is not member of an exchange, or who does not have access to a trading venue, needs to pass on his order to another broker for execution. Before the order hits the market, many parties might get sight or hear rumors of it. For instance, where trading floors are still physical places, traders overhear conversations around them. Sociologists conducting field studies on trading floors witness a well-known phenomenon called the “broker’s ear.” MacKenzie (2008b) reports the following statement by a trader: “When you’re on the desk you’re expected to hear everyone else’s conversations as well, because they are all relevant to you, and if you are on the phone speaking to someone about what’s going on in the market there could be a hot piece of information coming in with one of your colleagues that you would want to tell your clients, so you’ve got to be able to hear it coming in as you’re speaking to the person.” The information channels outlined so far might also offer a way to understand how the market maker in AZ can be completely unaware of an informational event (e.g., new management, a merger), even though enough traders to generate herding receive this information from contacts, before any private announcement has been made. In support of this, Schindler (2007) reports, based on his 2003 survey of traders in stocks, bonds, FX and commodity markets, that about 70% of traders answered that when they overhear rumors, or have other first-hand information, they spread them to a few priority people in the hope that later they will reciprocate and do the same. This way, traders build information networks that evolve in such a way that for a while those in a network know more than others in the market. This pattern has been confirmed by about 80% of the traders surveyed. With regard to older floor-based trading, Baker (1984) studies network patterns and formation within crowds in markets for stock options. The larger the crowd, the more the limitations to communication due to noise and physical separation. To overcome this, traders organize themselves in multiple cliques. Market makers cannot necessarily monitor the behavior in all the cliques. Baker (1984) reports the detrimental effects of large crowds to communication as described by a veteran market maker: “In really large crowds [\(\cdots \)] it’s noisy; you can’t hear. It happens when the stock is changing. Some people trade, and they tell others, and then lots of people are coming over. There are some aberrations sometimes.” Finally, assuming that the market maker does not belong to any information network might be considered as a modeling artifice to understand the subset of traders who will herd. Only traders who think they are more informed than the market maker will herd. In contrast, traders who occupy a marginal position within an information network would rationally take the price as a more accurate valuation of the asset than their own. Hence, such traders would behave as in a Glosten–Milgrom market and always follow their signal. In this sense, the model does not exclude the possibility that the market maker is more informed than some traders. Only the traders who are more connected would engage in PDB. These are the traders I am interested in. Other mechanisms have been exploited to generate herd and contrarian behavior in financial markets. Notably, Park and Sabourian (2011) generalize event uncertainty by pointing out that any U-shaped signal with positive or negative bias—i.e., a signal moving probability mass from moderate to extreme states with a bias toward positive or negative states, respectively, is necessary and almost sufficient to generate herd behavior. Hence, it is the shape of the signal and not the multiple layers of uncertainty that is responsible for herding. Their paper also shows that herding is possible, if not even simpler to characterize, when signals have the monotone likelihood property. In Chari and Kehoe (2004), endogenous timing in the trading decision brings the usual trade-off between investing and waiting to invest. Once this trade-off is resolved, future information will never be revealed and all traders hurry to decide independently of it. In Lee (1998) information remains trapped because of transaction costs, which makes it unprofitable for traders to act on their private signal. While information is trapped, only traders with good news buy the asset, increasing its price. Once a trader with sufficiently high-quality information sells, all the negative information finally reaches the market making the price collapse. In Dasgupta and Prat (2008) and Dasgupta and Prat (2006) portfolio managers ignore their private information to follow the crowd because of career concerns. Good portfolio managers receive correlated signals; thus, they prefer to ignore their private information as investors are more likely to believe that a manager is good but unlucky when he fails along with others, rather than when he fails alone. Finally, Bose et al. (2008) model the interaction between an exogenous sequence of informed buyers and a monopolist seller who sets the price in order to learn from the buyers’ decisions. As in the literature mentioned so far, prices adjust to reflect the information revealed from past trades. But in addition, the monopolist sets prices so as to control the learning process. Initially, the seller charges high separating prices to allow the buyers to learn, while he eventually induces a purchase cascade by setting a pooling price.",

68.0,3.0,Economic Theory,17 July 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00199-018-1138-4,Asymmetric gain–loss reference dependence and attitudes toward uncertainty,October 2019,Juan Sebastián Lleras,Evan Piermont,Richard Svoboda,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In many circumstances, a decision maker (DM) may evaluate an uncertain prospect not only in absolute terms but also in relative relation to some reference point. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) first introduced the notion of reference dependence, in the seminal Prospect theory, to explain experimental violations of expected utility. Within Prospect theory, deviations from the reference point are weighted by a gain–loss value function, which has the feature, referred to as loss aversion, that losses have more negative value than equal sized gains have positive value. A different resolution for empirical deviations from expected utility proposes models of multiple priors, in particular MaxMin Expected Utility (MMEU). MMEU, axiomatized by Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) as an explanation of the Ellsberg Paradox,Footnote 1 considers a DM who holds a family of beliefs regarding the likelihood of events. She evaluates uncertain prospects by the minimum expected utility consistent with any of her beliefs. As such, a MMEU DM displays uncertainty aversion (or, ambiguity aversion), the feature that she prefers to minimize her exposure to uncertainty. At a purely intuitive level, there seems to be a connection between loss aversion and uncertainty aversion; both behaviors characterize some form of pessimism in comparison with a subjective expected utility (SEU) maximizer. A loss averse DM places more weight on the utility of “bad” events but leaves the probabilities undistorted, whereas an uncertainty averse DM places more weight on the probability of “bad” events but leaves the utilities undistorted. We show in this paper that this connection is more than superficial; there exists a formal connection between reference dependence and attitude toward uncertainty. In particular, we axiomatize a simple class of reference-dependent preferences, called asymmetric gain–loss (AGL) preferences, which can be equivalently represented by a MMEU functional. Within our framework, loss aversion and uncertainty aversion produce identical choice data. In addition to formalizing the connection between reference dependence and ambiguity aversion, AGL preferences provide a simple model of endogenous reference dependence. Our object of choice is a state-contingent contract, or act, which is an assignment of consumption (in utility terms) to each state of the world. AGL preferences evaluate an act according to two components: consumption utility and gain–loss utility. The expected consumption utility of an act is as in the standard SEU model, where the decision maker holds a subjective belief, \(\mu \), over the state space. Her expected consumption utility of an act \(f: S \rightarrow {{\mathbb {R}}}\) is where S is the state space and \(s\in S\) is a generic state. The AGL DM takes this assessment of acts both as the reference point by which gains and losses are measured, and as the baseline level of utility on which gains and losses act as distortions. The main result of this paper is the behavioral characterization of asymmetric gain–loss preferences, which are preferences that can be represented by the functional The first term is the DM’s subjective expected utility without any reference considerations, and the second is the gain–loss utility. The gain–loss term captures the reference effects. When \(\lambda < 0\), the DM is loss averse and receives a utility penalty when the realized utility falls short of her expectation. This utility penalty is linearly scaled by \(\lambda \). In our representation results, all the elements are identified from choice behavior: \(\mu \) and \(\lambda \) are identified uniquely.Footnote 2 There are two alternative views on the formation of endogenous reference points. In the first, the DM forms a reference point before making a choice, based on the set of options that she faces.Footnote 3 As such, her beliefs about her own actions will affect the reference point, leading these papers to generally require an equilibrium condition to account for the mutual relationship between reference points and choices. In the second, the DM’s chosen action completely determines the reference point. Thus, each element of a choice set is associated with its own reference point.Footnote 4 AGL preferences fall into this second category. In particular, the AGL representation is closely related to the notion of choice acclimating personal equilibrium defined by Kőszegi and Rabin (2007), excepting that there the domain of uncertainty is objective risk. A main contribution of our paper is that, by considering the case where probabilities are subjective, we show how it is possible to simultaneously identify both the reference attitude and the beliefs of the DM. It is worth noting that when the reference point is defined using equilibrium conditions, as in Kőzsegi and Rabin (2006), the joint identification of beliefs and reference effects is generally not possible. The feedback loop between choices and the reference point can lead to intransitivity of the revealed preference, as shown in Gul and Pesendorfer (2006). Because of this identification problem, and the intrinsic complexity surrounding equilibrium conditions, the latter notion or reference point determination has proved more suitable for applications. Indeed, many applications use AGL preferences: Lange and Ratan (2010) explore how reference dependence can increase the optimal bid in sealed bid auctions (to be more in line with empirical evidence); Herweg et al. (2010) show that loss aversion can explain prevalence of binary incentive schemes (i.e., bonuses) in moral hazard environments; Abeler et al. (2011) show that, in an effort provision experiment, expectations-based reference dependence best explains their data; Karle and Peitz (2014) consider the competition of differentiated firms when buyers exhibit loss aversion. Each of the above-mentioned papers assumed a kinked, piecewise linear gain/loss function and assumed the reference point was the expected consumption utility—exactly the characterization given here. Our work provides the foundational restrictions for such consumer behavior, and shows that beliefs regarding uncertainty and reference effects can be jointly identified. We employ the following numerical example to explain the intuition behind the representation, and show how asymmetric gain–loss preferences can explain different types of behavior regarding uncertainty. Consider the environment of a seller selling a single good to a buyer who makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer. The value to the seller is \(\hat{v}\) which the buyer believes takes the values \(\{5,3,2\}\), with probability .2, .3, and .5, respectively. The buyer has an independent private value for the object given by \(v = 10\). The buyer will submit her offer, b, and the seller will accept or reject the offer. The seller will accept any offer which (weakly) exceeds her value. The buyer’s utility associated with the bid b is given by It is obvious that the optimal bid will always be in \(\{5,3,2\}\). If the buyer is a risk neutral expected utility maximizer, her optimal bid solves The optimal bid is \(b^{RN} = 3\), which has an expected utility of 5.6 before the bid is placed. Now suppose that the buyer has gain–loss preferences: in addition to the expected value she wants to avoid losses, so she subtracts any expected losses from the expected consumption utility to determine the valuation (this corresponds to the parametrization \(\lambda = -1\)). A loss for her is any outcome where her ex-post utility is worse than the expected value; therefore, outcomes in which she does not obtain the item are considered losses. Her expected AGL utility, taking into account her gain–loss preferences, of making the bid \(b = 3\) is given by: which is equal to 4.48. The optimal AGL bid, however, is \(b^{AGL} = 5\), which provides a constant utility, and hence an AGL utility of 5. When the buyer in this simple take-it-or-leave-it example takes into consideration expected gains and losses in addition to the standard expected utility, she is better off increasing her bid. Intuitively, she sacrifices her payoff in good outcomes (where she obtains the item) in order to decrease the chance of bad outcomes (not obtaining the item). While her payoff is smaller contingent on obtaining the good, the outcome is favorable more often and she increases her ex-ante utility. A similar behavior could be captured by a buyer who was averse to ambiguity. To see this, assume that the buyer, instead of having AGL preferences, has MMEU preferences. Further, the buyer believes that the distribution of the seller’s valuation is contained in the following set of distributions over \(\{5,3,2\}\): As such, the buyer chooses a bid according to: It is straightforward to check that the optimal bid is \(b^{MMEU} = 5\). Therefore, a AGL bidder with \(\mu = [.2, .3,.5]\) and \(\lambda =-1\) and a MMEU bidder with multiple priors given by C will make the same optimal bid. While at first glance this connection may seem contrived, in fact, the AGL and MMEU DMs choose identically not only in this bidding game but in all decision problems—they have identical preferences.Footnote 5 We show in Sect. 3 that AGL behavior can always be equivalently described by a MMEU decision maker. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an axiomatic characterization of the preferences, discusses the concept of the alignment of acts, which is instrumental for the endogenous determination of a reference point, and formally defines the utility representation. Section 3 explores the link between gain–loss and ambiguity attitudes. Section 4 puts forth comparative statics results. Section 5 contains a literature review.

Prominent answers throughout history include the hereditary laws of monarchies and the general elections of republics—but what if the monarchs are celibate, and what if the institution teaches students who are not allowed to vote? This is the case for the (Roman) Catholic Church,Footnote 2 an institution boasting a membership today of over one billion. Its highest office is the papacy, the office of the pope,Footnote 3 whose absolute authority among Catholics is founded on the dogma that he is the successor of Saint Peter.Footnote 4 In recent decades, there has been a flurry of changes to the laws governing this succession, and our objective is to identify the underlying concerns in order to offer a proposal to the Catholic Church through axiomatic analysis. The current practice is for the pope to be elected at a seclusive meeting of the cardinals known as a (papal) conclave. While conclaves have been standard for over seven centuries,Footnote 5 modern conclave law is defined by documents written in the last twenty-five years.Footnote 6 According to today’s laws, the voters are the (cardinal) electors—cardinals who are not yet eighty when the papacy becomes vacant—and they are isolated from the rest of the world for the duration of the election. Great measures are taken to keep them secluded when voting at the Sistine Chapel, when lodged at the Domus Sancta Marthae, and when traveling between the two. The election consists of a series of scrutinies, where each elector anonymously submits a ballot nominating one person. If someone receives at least two-thirds of the nominations and gives his assent, then he is the new pope, while if there is no such person, the ballots are burned with damp straw to create black smoke and another scrutiny is scheduled. After either thirty-three or thirty-four failed scrutinies (depending on whether or not the election begins on the afternoon of the first day),Footnote 7 the two who received the most nominations in this final scrutinyFootnote 8 become finalists. Thereafter, at each deadlock scrutiny (our term), these finalists do not vote and the other electors may only nominate one of them, and this continues until a finalist receives at least two-thirds of the nominations and accepts the papacy. Recent popes have attended to a number of facets of conclave law, including who can vote,Footnote 9 alternative election methods,Footnote 10 whether a secular ruler can veto a candidate,Footnote 11 the structure of scrutiny,Footnote 12 and how to handle deadlock.Footnote 13 Despite some vacillation on these topics, there has been an unambiguous trend toward a series of scrutinies with a special election method for deadlock. We therefore restrict attention to such conclave formats, separately addressing (i) the structure of scrutiny, and (ii) how deadlock should be handled. In forming our proposal, we pursue an approach that is subtly different from the standard one for axiomatic analysis of institutions: we do not address the normative question of which principles our institution should hold, but rather the positive question of which principles it does hold. This distinction merits emphasis because addressing the normative question has been essential to many recent applications of mechanism design to specific institutions—from the advocacy of efficiency in response to unnecessary deaths due to untraded donor kidneys (Roth et al. 2004), to the advocacy of strategy-proofness in response to the gaming of children’s futures in school choice (Balinski and Sönmez 1999; Abdulkadirolu and Sönmez 1999, 2003), to the advocacy of respecting improvements in response to the deliberate exam-failing of military cadets seeking their top branches (Sönmez 2013; Sönmez and Switzer 2013). But in each of these cases economists began by observing a feature of the status quo that could be uncontroversially described as perverse, and that is not the case here—due to the seclusion of the conclave, all that we can observe is the outcome, and we do not claim that the modern conclave selects popes poorly. We simply observe a lack of conviction in the modern conclave suggested by recent changes, and we seek not to propose new principles for the Catholic Church but rather to help the church on the basis of its own principles.Footnote 14 In Sect. 2, using decrees of ecumenical councils, conclave law, church ceremonies, and other historical writings, we argue that a guiding principle for conclave design is that electors should be protected from the temptation to defy God: despite being the living men best-trained to let God speak through them, the electors are but men, and therefore sinners, and therefore imperfect instruments through which God may communicate. Specifically, an elector is called to nominate the person he believes God would have him nominate, and the Holy Spirit may reveal this person to him, yet the elector may face temptation to sin by instead nominating another. The conclave’s defining feature, its absolute seclusion, serves to protect electors from outside influences, but this does not provide protection from one’s peers or from one’s self. We argue that these additional protections were provided by the scrutiny of 1621–1945 (Pope Gregory XV 1621, 1622), but since then electors have been unprotected from the temptation of personal ambition due to a simplification of the ballot layout (Pope Pius XII 1945). In Sect. 3, we analyze scrutiny by adapting a recent model (Holzman and Moulin 2013) to allow the possibility of declaring the election inconclusive with black smoke. Protection from peers and self are then translated into axioms: Voters in elections across the world are protected from the bribes and threats of peers through the use of anonymous ballots (Holzman and Moulin 2013), and scrutiny should be no different. Personal ambition for the papal tiara might tempt an elector to vote not as he believes God would have him, but to instead vote in hopes of crowning himself. This concern is greatly mitigated if the scrutiny is impartial—that is, if whether or not a given elector wins is determined solely by the votes of his peers (de Clippel et al. 2008; Holzman and Moulin 2013). To define our focal class of scrutinies, let n denote the number of electors. A supermajority scrutiny is specified by a number greater than \(\frac{1}{2}n\) but no greater than n called its threshold; if somebody receives at least this many votes, he is elected; otherwise, there is black smoke. Both the modern scrutiny and the scrutiny of 1621–1945 are supermajority scrutinies with threshold \(\frac{2}{3}n\); the difference is that the former allows self-nomination while the latter does not. We first analyze the modern format, and our findings are disappointing. Not only does the modern scrutiny violate impartiality, but so long as self-nomination is allowed, the only scrutinies which satisfy both impartiality and anonymous ballots are constant; moreover, if anonymous ballots is replaced with the requirement that the electors are treated symmetrically as candidates, then only the constant black smoke scrutiny remains (Theorem 1). Our conclusion is that the current scrutiny is deficient and that moreover a simple adjustment to the processing of ballots will not suffice to repair it: the format must be changed. We then analyze the format where self-nomination is prohibited—which was used for over three centuries—and here our findings are much more encouraging. Using additional axioms capturing that messages should be interpreted as nominations, that consensus should be respected, and that electors should be treated symmetrically, we provide three tight characterizations of supermajority scrutinies (Theorem 2). We therefore not only endorse the format of 1621–1945, but also endorse the particular scrutiny used during that period. In Sect. 4, we focus on deadlock. After providing several criticisms of the current practice, we use the principles we have identified, previous results in the literature (Holzman and Moulin 2013; Mackenzie 2015), and a passage from the Bible to argue that randomization merits consideration.

Our emphasis is on the question of existence of subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibria.Footnote 1 The references below testify to the increasing attention that the concept has been receiving in the recent game-theoretic literature. In addition to the challenging existence issue, the paper reaches out to a large area of research on topics such as minority games, time-inconsistent preferences, and intergenerational games. The contribution of the paper is twofold. The first contribution is to introduce a class of so-called frequency-based minority games. These are games where a player benefits from choosing an action that is less popular among the players. Minority games have been used to model a variety of different phenomena ranging from congestion, downloading in P2P networks, market entry, to speculative behavior in financial markets. For an extensive list of related works, we refer to Renault et al. (2007) and Renault et al. (2008). Unlike much of the work on minority games that focuses on the setup with simultaneous moves, here we consider sequential games of perfect information. In more detail, we consider perfect information games where each player becomes active exactly once in the course of the game and has a choice between two actions. One is a risky action: It gives a high payoff if a minority of the players use it and a low payoff otherwise. The other is a safe action: Taking this action leads to an intermediate payoff for sure, irrespective of what the other players do. In minority games, payoffs depend on the set of players who take the action that the minority of the players choose. The subtlety of the construction lies in the exact meaning of the expression “a minority of the players.” We allow for several specifications, the most characteristic of which invokes the frequency of the appearance of the risky action in the population. If too many players choose the safe action or the risky action, then choosing the risky action or the safe action, respectively, provides a higher payoff. Our main result on frequency-based minority games in Sect. 3 states that these games admit no subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibria for small positive \(\epsilon \). The crucial tension arises from the fact that each player needs to predict the behavior of the future players. If, in the course of the game, it becomes likely that the majority of the future players will take the risky action, then the active player has an incentive to take the safe action with a large probability. But then, the probability for the majority of players to play risky is small. Closely related to our work are two known counterexamples to existence of subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium. One is a stopping game played by a sequence of players considered in Flesch, Kuipers, Mashiah-Yaakovi, Schoenmakers, Solan, and Vrieze (2010, page 753). The example shows that games of the type studied in this paper need not have subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibria in pure strategies. The other example is given in Flesch et al. (2014). This being a two-player game, it falls outside of the class of games studied here. All deviations in the current paper are automatically one-shot, since each player acts only once in the course of the game. In contrast, in Flesch et al. (2014) deviations can be more complex and may involve changes by a player at infinitely many periods of time. Moreover, while the counterexample in the present paper admits an interpretation as an intergenerational game, the same cannot be said of the game in Flesch et al. (2014). Indeed, the agent form of the game in Flesch et al. (2014), that is, the game obtained by splitting each player into infinitely many “selves,” each self acting at most once, does have a subgame perfect 0-equilibrium in pure strategies.Footnote 2 There are also important differences on a purely technical level. This paper relies on coupling. Coupling is used to compare any given strategy profile of the players to one particular stationary strategy profile whereby each player takes the risky action with a fixed positive probability. The main technique in Flesch et al. (2014) is Lévy’s zero–one law. The intuition behind the nonexistence of subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium is that in order for player 2 to punish player 1, player 2 must, with a small but positive probability, repeatedly take a “bad” action. However, Lévy’s zero–one law then forces player 2 to take the bad action in deep subgames with probability close to one. Such behavior is incompatible with payoff maximization by player 2. The second contribution of this paper is to provide several sufficient conditions for the existence of subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium. Many of these conditions have appeared previously in the literature in various contexts. We now discuss each condition in turn. [I] Games with qualitative objectives (also called Boolean objectives): These are games where each player’s payoff function takes only two values, 0 or 1. This class is motivated by a vast literature in computer science on qualitative games. The inventory of qualitative objectives considered in the computer science literature includes reachability, safety, Büchi, parity, and Müller objectives. For the precise definitions of these objectives, we refer to the reviews by Chatterjee and Henzinger (2012) and Bruyère (2017). We show that games with qualitative objectives admit subgame perfect 0-equilibria in pure strategies. The proof is based on the iterative procedure in Flesch et al. (2010). [II] Games with upper semicontinuous payoffs. We show that games of this class admit a subgame perfect 0-equilibrium in pure strategies. This result complements the findings of Purves and Sudderth (2011), who consider games with finitely many players. A more general result, albeit with a more complicated proof, has been recently obtained by Flesch and Predtetchinski (2017). [III] Games continuous outside a countable set. These are games in which the payoffs are continuous when restricted to a sufficiently large part of the domain. This somewhat technical condition is related to the work of Flesch and Predtetchinski (2016b). We show that this class of games admits a subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium for every positive value of \(\epsilon \). The result generalizes the corresponding result of Cingiz et al. (2016). [IV] Games played by a finite number of teams. A team is a group of players with identical payoff functions. In this class of games, the set of players can be partitioned into finitely many teams. The idea of teams consisting of individual players has attracted considerable attention (see, e.g., von Stengel and Koller 1997; Solan 2000; Gossner and Tomala 2007; von Stengel and Zamir 2010; Gossner and Hörner 2010). We show that games of this class admit a subgame perfect 0-equilibrium in pure strategies. Games where each player acts only once arise naturally in economics. One example is decision making with time-inconsistent preferences, as modeled by a sequence of multiple selves (Strotz 1956; Pollak 1968; Peleg and Yaari 1973). A special case of this is hyperbolic discounting (Phelps and Pollak 1968; Laibson 1994, 1997; Jaśkiewicz and Nowak 2014). Another example relates to intergenerational games, where a player in the infinite sequence of players represents a generation (Phelps and Pollak 1968; Balbus et al. 2015). In a similar vein, Asheim (2010) considers a model with an infinite stream of generations to analyze intergenerational social welfare. A class of continuous games played by a sequence of players is studied, for example, in Hellwig et al. (1990). Callander and Hörner (2009) study social learning using games played by a sequence of players. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we provide the general model and formal definitions. In Sect. 3, we introduce frequency-based minority games and state our main result: Nonexistence of subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium. In Sect. 4, we give several sufficient conditions for the existence of subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium. Proofs are collected in “Appendix.”",3

Of some value, however, is typically also the assurance that a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists and is unique. In particular, the existence of a unique equilibrium may be useful for reasons such as analytical convenience, predictive power, comparative statics, and global stability. This paper offers general conditions sufficient for the existence and uniqueness of pure-strategy and mixed-strategy Nash equilibria in incomplete-information contests over arbitrary finite state spaces. In the class of contests considered, players may possess private information about the primitives of the conflict, i.e., about the contest technology, valuations, cost functions, and budget constraints. Our assumptions directly generalize the conditions formulated by Szidarovszky and Okuguchi (1997). Thus, we deal with contests of the logit form, for which Tullock’s (1980) rent-seeking game is an important example. Regarding existence, we show that a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists in a large class of incomplete-information contests, provided that no player ever deems it possible being the only one with a positive budget in a state where the technology of success is discontinuous. This result is obtained through the consideration of a sequence of contests with smaller and smaller minimum bids. Indeed, under the assumptions that will be imposed, any discontinuity at the origin does not matter, essentially because small positive bids in a contest of the logit form create very strong incentives to overbid. Our conditions for existence can be further relaxed in certain circumstances, e.g., when the slope of the state-dependent impact function is infinite at the zero bid level, or when the contest is symmetric. However, we also present an example of a contest with incomplete information that does not satisfy our assumptions and that does not admit any equilibrium (even though all posterior beliefs assign positive probability to the possibility that the respective opponent has a positive budget).Footnote 2 Regarding uniqueness, our contribution has four main elements. First, we extend Rosen’s (1965) notion of “diagonal strict concavity” to a class of n-player logit contests. The extension is needed because, even in a standard Tullock contest, payoff functions are neither continuous nor strictly concave (at the boundary).Footnote 3 Second, we show that, under standard assumptions, any n-player logit contest satisfies the sufficient conditions of Goodman (1980) in the interior of the set of strategy profiles.Footnote 4 Third, we identify a simple assumption on the information structure that ensures that the uniqueness proof goes through. Thereby, we can deal not only with independent private valuations, correlated private values, and pure common values, but also with examples of interdependent valuations. Finally, we show that the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium remains unique in the larger set of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria. Several papers have stressed the role of budget constraints for the outcome of contests.Footnote 5 Our framework accounts for this possibility by allowing for type-dependent budget constraints. This creates a variety of modeling choices. For example, under the assumption of convex and strictly increasing cost functions, a budget may be so generous that it never binds. At the opposite extreme, any type with a zero budget will be effectively excluded from being active in the contest. This latter possibility may then be used, for example, to deal with the case with population uncertainty. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The related literature is discussed in Sect. 2. Section 3 introduces the setup and notation. Existence is dealt with in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 discusses uniqueness. Section 6 considers symmetric contests. Applications are provided in Sect. 7. Section 8 concludes. All proofs have been relegated to an Appendix.",14

These are short-term instruments traded on rather risk-intolerant markets. Motivated by this, the academic literature has explored the role of such contracts as instruments for banks to coinsure short-term liquidity risks (e.g., Allen and Gale 2000; Castiglionesi et al. 2014). While the importance of such coinsurance as a driver for interbank transactions is widely accepted, this notion cannot be easily reconciled with three other stylized facts about interbank markets, especially in Europe. First, the size of banks’ interbank assets and liabilities is substantially larger than their average deposit and credit fluctuations (Bluhm et al. 2016). Second, although the flows among banks are predominantly short-term transactions, a substantial part of the stock of interbank claims is long term (European Central Bank 2015). Third, the average net position of many participants in the interbank market is substantially different from zero and persistent (Roengpitya et al. 2017). These observations suggest that there is a need for a theory of interbank markets which complements the established theory of interbank deposits or repos.Footnote 1 Such theory should also take into account that interbank transactions are to a large extent conducted bilaterally over the counter (Craig and von Peter 2014) and that interbank lenders tend to be better capitalized and have better credit ratings than interbank borrowers (Angelini et al. 2011). We shall argue in this paper that there are economic environments where profit-maximizing banks have an incentive to engage in interbank transactions that capture these features. In these environments, a bank can lend funds to another bank that may default at a later date. As long as the correlation of the two banks’ earnings is not equal to one, assuming such counterparty risk can help the interbank lender to better diversify its overall exposure to insolvency risk. If insolvency creates losses, a reduction in risk will reduce the cost of external, nonbank funding sources, hence easing the external funding constraint of the interbank lender and allowing for an expansion of credit supply. Such diversification may be costly, though. To fully reap the potential diversification benefits, an interbank lender may have to lend more funds than the borrower wants to raise. In this case, the lender will have to offer a discounted interbank lending rate, i.e., the borrower’s expected repayment will fall short of the lender’s cost of raising the additional funds used to make the interbank loan. As a result, interbank loans come at an expected loss to the lender, making diversification costly. The benefits of diversification (in terms of improved access to external finance from nonbank investors) and its cost (in terms of expected losses from granting loans to another bank) are determined jointly in equilibrium as an interbank lender decides how much to lend to another bank. With a focus on the capacity of the banking sector to borrow from nonbank investors, the present paper contributes to three related branches in the literature. The first concerns the role of interbank markets for banks’ credit supply to nonbank borrowers. In models where interbank markets facilitate the coinsurance of short-term liquidity risks, a fixed amount of liquid assets held in the banking sector is reallocated on interbank markets.Footnote 2 Accordingly, dysfunctional interbank markets result in liquidity hoarding and idle lending capacities, as loanable funds no longer flow to the most profitable lending opportunities, both within and across banks (Freixas and Holthausen 2005; Gertler and Kiyotaki 2010; Acharya and Skeie 2011; Diamond and Rajan 2011).Footnote 3 In our paper, the scope for banks to diversify risks shrinks if interbank markets become dysfunctional. As a consequence, an interbank lender’s financial constraint tightens which impairs its ability to grant loans to nonbanks. The interbank borrower may also curtail lending as it has to resort to nonbank investors who may provide funds either at higher costs or not at all. A second strand of the literature studies the terms of interbank transactions, in particular how they depend on risk (Furfine 2001; King 2008) and other borrower-specific characteristics (Craig and von Peter 2014; Vollmer and Wiese 2014). Our model suggests that the characteristics of the interbank lender are also key for the terms of interbank transactions, in a way consistent with recent evidence (Angelini et al. 2011; Affinito 2012). For example, an interbank lender with fewer internal funds faces a tighter funding constraint. Hence, the lender has to gain more from diversification and would want to grant a larger loan. However, for the interbank borrower to accept the larger loan, the interest rate has to be smaller. Finally, our paper is also related to a body of research on interbank linkages and financial stability, with a particular focus on probabilities of joint bank failures. The literature has identified contagion as one possible reason for joint failures. Since Allen and Gale (2000), it has been argued that incomplete interbank networks are more susceptible to contagion than complete networks because the former do not allow for as much coinsurance of risks (see also Afonso and Lagos 2015; Craig and von Peter 2014; Craig et al. 2015).Footnote 4 An alternative explanation of joint bank failures refers to systemic risk-shifting incentives according to which banks may gain from holding similar portfolios (Acharya and Yorulmazer 2008; Acharya 2009). We show that although diversification is generally beneficial for a financially constrained interbank lender, it may be better for the bank to make itself vulnerable to the failure of a counterparty holding not identical but similar assets. Diversification benefits will be smaller, but so will be the costs of diversification. This shows that banks do not necessarily seek a perfectly diversified exposure on interbank markets and that incentives for banks to hold somewhat similar assets exist beyond systemic risk-shifting. The remainder of the paper has the following structure. In Sect. 2, we provide an overview of the environment in which banks benefit from diversification via interbank exposures. Having thus motivated our assumptions, we present in detail the formal model setup in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we characterize the equilibrium and its implication for credit supply. In Sect. 5, we extend the model to study the role of diversification and associated stability issues. In Sect. 6, we discuss some empirical implications of the model. Section 7 concludes.",3

Páscoa,Abdelkrim Seghir,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The modern general equilibrium literature on default evolved mainly from two seminal contributions, the Dubey et al. (2005) paper on utility penalties and the Geanakoplos and Zame (1997) work on non-recourse borrowing. In an infinite horizon setup, non-recourse loans have the appealing feature of being incompatible with Ponzi schemes, at least for time- and state-separable preferences, as shown by Araujo et al. (2002). Non-recourse is the rule for mortgages in thirteen states in the USA, but in all the other states and in many countries mortgages are treated as recourse loans. Other types of secured loans tend to be recourse: Collateralized borrowing for the purchase of equipment usually requires a default insurance, while in the case of credit for the purchase of securities default triggers personal bankruptcy. Recourse means that the defaulter’s personal estate can be seized by the creditors, either entirely or in proportion to the outstanding debts that were not covered by the value of the collateral at the time the default occurred. There may be other types of default penalties, such as reputational effects, difficulties in applying for credit in the future or even criminal consequences, that we can also see as a form of recourse that ends up affecting the defaulter’s welfare. Utility penalties, introduced by Shubik and Wilson (1977) and more recently modeled by Dubey et al. (2005) in a GE framework, attempt to capture in utility terms the impact of all forms of recourse. In the presence of utility penalties, collateral may not avoid a Ponzi game. In fact, the penalties may induce agents to repay above the minimum of the promised payment and the collateral value. Then, non-arbitrage cannot rule out that, at the borrowing date, the secured loan would have a negative haircut (the collateral cost would be lower than the loan). The resulting cash flow in an open end setting would give rise to a Ponzi scheme. This is actually what happens when the promise is traded in the examples by Páscoa and Seghir (2009) for utility penalties that make the maximal default prohibitive. However, the argument that also ruled out no-trade outcomes in Páscoa and Seghir (2009) was not correct and, as was pointed out by Martins-da-Rocha and Vailakis (2012a), a no-trade equilibrium could be found by setting the delivery rate at the minimal level, even though such expectation about the delivery rate is not consistent with the harsh penalty. Once the equilibrium is refined, along the lines of the refinement in Dubey et al. (2005), nonexistence of equilibrium prevails. Our first contribution is to observe that the absence of pecuniary Ponzi schemes is not enough for existence of equilibrium. The net gain that the borrower can have at the borrowing moment consists of the loan net of collateral costs plus the utility from consumption of the collateral. Such direct utility effect may allow for an infinite horizon improvement strategy even when collateral costs outweigh the loan (as our Example 1 illustrates). Under non-recourse, the whole current benefit had to be non-positive, by non-arbitrage, as at the immediate next nodes new collateral values net of effective repayment were always nonnegative. In our second contribution, we find an upper bound on utility penalty coefficients that make the collateral cost never fall below the promise price and existence of equilibrium is, therefore, guaranteed, under these moderate penalties, provided that the collateral does not give any utility (say it is a durable commodity with no utility yields, as in Fostel and Geanakoplos (2008), a productive asset or a share in it, as in Kubler and Schmedders (2003), or any real security in positive net supply that cannot be short-sold, as in Fostel and Geanakoplos 2015). Actually, the recourse feature that a utility penalty tries to capture is often observed in collateralized borrowing for the purchase of equipment or securities. Our third contribution allows for harsher penalties and for utility yields from the consumption of the collateral. Moderate penalties are a strong condition as it makes agents give maximal default (as in the model where utility penalties were absent). However, equilibrium is compatible with partial default or no default, as illustrated in Example 2, where the sum, across next nodes, of the marginal penalty effects is dominated by the sum of the marginal income effects. The problem is that this dominance depends on relative prices and there might be no room to choose relative spot prices if these are already pinned down by market clearing. There is, nevertheless, an important case where there are degrees of freedom in market clearing prices. It is the case where the promise is nominal, but the collateral is a real asset. This case is relevant for mortgages, which should be regarded as loans whose promised repayments are not adjusted by commodity price indices, and also for credit for the purchase of shares. In finite-horizon economies, there is indeterminacy in equilibrium with respect to the inflation rates. Now, high inflation rates across all the next nodes devalue the promised payments but not the collateral and, therefore, reduce the real value of default on which the penalty is applied. Our Example 3 illustrates such equilibria with nominal promises. Example 2 and our two existence results do not collide with the result by Ferreira and Torres-Martinez (2010) on impossibility of recourse. Their result depends on collateral costs being lower than the deflated value of recourse (the repayment in excess of the minimal one) at the next nodes. It is interesting to note that such a condition had to be introduced to make recourse impossible. In Example 2, collateral coefficients do not satisfy such inequality and the haircut is zero (rather than negative as in Ferreira and Torres-Martinez 2010), which does not allow for a Ponzi scheme (or generalized version of it, since the collateral does not yield utility in this example). In Theorem 2, borrowers’ repayment is always the minimal one, while in Theorem 3 it might not be, but the promise is nominal and the result by Ferreira and Torres-Martinez (2010) does not apply. One may wonder how do our existence results stand in the face of the possibility that trivial no-trade equilibria might be found. Dubey et al. (2005) showed that for unsecured promises subject to utility penalties on default, a trivial equilibrium always exists by setting promises prices, delivery rates and financial trades equal to zero. Martins-da-Rocha and Vailakis (2012a) found a no-trade incomplete markets equilibrium in an example with secured promises by setting the delivery rate at the minimal level. When the horizon is finite or markets are complete, such no-trade equilibria are trivially found but in infinite horizon incomplete markets that is not always the case, as we illustrate in a companion paper (Páscoa and Seghir 2019). There we also propose a refinement of equilibrium, which is milder than the straightforward extension to secured loans of the one in Dubey et al. (2005). Even so, the no-trade outcome in Martins-da-Rocha and Vailakis (2012a) still fails to meet this refinement but there exist refined versions for the equilibria we found in the main results of the current paper. The next section presents the model. Section 3 addresses individual optimality. Section 4 presents the existence results. Proofs are presented in the Appendix.",1

The existing literature clearly shows that this standard utility assumption is restrictive in numerous economic situations.Footnote 1 To name just few limitations, first in the standard case, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) is equal to the inverse of the risk aversion coefficient. As a result, the standard utility formulation cannot explain many important puzzles in the literature (e.g., the equity premium puzzle postulated by Mehra and Prescott (1985) in the literature on asset pricing). Additionally, there is strong evidence that some decision makers prefer to know the realization of uncertainty as quickly as possible, while others prefer to know the realization of uncertainty at a later date. Again, this situation cannot be captured within the standard utility framework [see Kreps and Porteus (1978), Chew and Epstein (1989) as well as Klibanoff and Ozdenoren (2007)]. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the standard utility formulation is incompatible with confirmed important “paradoxes” in the experimental economics literature (e.g., the Allais paradox and the Ellsberg paradox). Principle of optimality in dynamic programming together with the Bellman equation assure overall utility from today onward which can be expressed as a linear transformation of today’s temporal utility and the overall utility from future periods. In the standard discounted utility model, Koopmans (1960) formulated the set of axioms on the  aggregator that connected the today’s temporal utility with the utility from future (continuation) periods. Similar class of recursive utilities provide Asheim et al. (2012) by proposing another axioms of sustainable recursive preferences. The set of deterministic recursive utilities, defined as such, included the standard discounted utility model as a special case. The ideas by Koopmans (1960) were extended by Kreps and Porteus (1978) to models with uncertainty with the finite time horizon and by Epstein and Zin (1989) to models with the infinite time horizon, in each case defining recursive utilities on a set of lotteries. Whereas Kreps and Porteus (1978) and Klibanoff and Ozdenoren (2007) parametrized a utility from future periods by means of the expected value, Epstein and Zin (1989) used the most general concept of Conditional Certainty Equivalent (henceforth, CCE for short). A large body of the literature has already established extensions of the standard discounted utility model toward nonadditive aggregators under both deterministic and stochastic settings. Deterministic utility functions based on Koopmans equations can be found in numerous papers in the literature, including works by Boyd-III (2006), Bich et al. (2018), Duran (2000), Le-Van and Vailakis (2005), Martins-da-Rocha and Vailakis (2010), Jaśkiewicz et al. (2014), among others, while the utility function based on Epstein and Zin (1989) equations can be found in the work of Weil (1993), Skiadas (2015), Bäuerle and Jaskiewicz (2018), Marinacci and Montrucchio (2010), Ozaki and Streufert (1996), and Bloise and Vailakis (2018). There are three fundamental questions associated with the specification of a recursive utility. First, whether the (recursive utility) function exists and is unique? Second, whether the optimal value is a fixed point of the corresponding Bellman operator and third, whether the optimal value function is a global attractor, i.e., whether a sequence of iterations defined on the Bellman operator uniformly converges to the recursive utility function regardless of the starting point? In this paper, we consider all three aforementioned questions using a nonlinear aggregator and a sub-homogeneous CCE. Clearly, apart from deterministic models, the standard expected utility operator is homogenous, and a lot of quasilinear models [as in Chew (1983), for example] are sub-homogenous. Moreover, a measure of risk sensitivity postulated in Weil (1993) is a special case in our formulation of CCE. Finally, it bears mentioning that the sub-homogeneity here encompasses a large class of aggregators including Kreps and Porteus (1978), Klibanoff and Ozdenoren (2007) as well as most of “Thompson aggregators” used by Marinacci and Montrucchio (2010). From a technical perspective, we reduce the question of finding a recursive utility to finding a fixed point of an appropriately defined nonlinear operator. To the study of the set of fixed points of this operator, we apply a key theorem in Guo et al. (2004) on the cone of nonnegative functions. This theorem gives sufficient conditions for the existence and the uniqueness of fixed points, as well as provides the results on the global convergence of iterations.Footnote 2 This approach is new in the literature. For example, some authors (e.g., Ozaki and Streufert 1996) use Knaster–Tarski Theorem (see Tarski 1955). In Jaśkiewicz et al. (2014), the authors use Matkowski Theorem (see Matkowski 1975). Becker and Rincón-Zapatero (2016) and Bloise and Vailakis (2018) used the geometric fixed point theorem by Krasnoselski and Zabreiko (1984). Indirect methods via iterations on extreme selections have been proposed in Le-Van and Vailakis (2005). The approach proposed in this paper is different. Finally, in this paper, we provide specific examples where neither Banach Fixed Point Theorem, nor its extension in Matkowski’s Theorem (Matkowski 1975), can be applied. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 contains preliminary information on cones, as well as a statement of Guo–Cho–Zhu Theorem. Section 3 contains a description of the model and the fundamental assumptions. The main results are included in Sects. 4 and 5. In Sect. 4, the existence, the uniqueness, and the global convergence results are proven. In Sect. 5, by means of Bellman equations, we obtain similar results for the optimal value of the recursive utility formulation. The proofs of all Lemmas and Propositions can be found in “Appendix”.",6

70.0,3.0,Economic Theory,22 August 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00199-019-01224-5,A case of evolutionarily stable attainable equilibrium in the laboratory,October 2020,Christoph Kuzmics,Daniel Rodenburger,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate, by means of a case study, how careful theory can be helpful in analyzing the data of laboratory experiments of (strategic) human interaction. For this case study, we chose an experiment performed by Forsythe et al. (1993). The authors’ aim was to perform an exploratory analysis of how opinion polls impact voting behavior in an election and to experimentally assess Duverger’s “law,” see Duverger (1954), that in any majority-rule election only two parties receive votes. They did not perform a full theoretical analysis of the game that the subjects played in the experiment. This experiment is close to perfect for our undertaking for the following reasons. First, it has a very clean and elegant design, which we explain in detail in Sect. 2. Second, it is a somewhat complicated game with a stage game that involves 14 players of three different types. Thus, the game has a large set of possible strategy profiles. This means that the game could possibly have (and indeed does have) a large number of Nash equilibria. Yet, the game has certain symmetries that pose subtle, but important restrictions on the set of feasible strategy profiles and thus on the set of feasible (or attainable) Nash equilibria in the sense of Alos-Ferrer and Kuzmics (2013).Footnote 1 Third, the game is played recurrently. This means players are repeatedly randomly chosen and matched up from a bigger pool of players to engage in this 14-player stage game. This implies that if a Nash equilibrium establishes itself over time, or if subjects play the same equilibrium throughout, this equilibrium should be evolutionarily stable as in the sense of Maynard Smith and Price (1973) and Maynard Smith (1982).Footnote 2 Fourth, in one of the two treatments, the game has two stages and even though the second stage game by itself has many equilibria with symmetries posing subtle restrictions this game can be said to have an “obvious” way to play or focal point in the spirit of Schelling (1960) and formally as in Alos-Ferrer and Kuzmics (2013). Nevertheless, while all these properties of the game make it somewhat hard to analyze for the analyst, the game it seems to us is not that difficult to (learn to) play for the actual subjects.
 The laboratory experiment of Forsythe et al. (1993) has two treatments, a simpler one [denoted CPSS in Forsythe et al. (1993)], in which subjects only play a voting game, and a more complex one [denoted CPSSP in Forsythe et al. (1993)], in which subjects first play an opinion poll game with publicly observed outcome before they play a voting game. What we then find in our theory-driven analysis of these two treatments is this. We can calibrate the subjects’ payoff function with a parameter of risk aversion in such a way that the unique evolutionarily stable attainable equilibrium of the simpler game provides a perfect fit to the observed frequency of play. Furthermore, and this is the main result, taking this so-calibrated risk aversion parameter as given, the null hypothesis of play being given by an evolutionarily stable attainable equilibrium with focal voting stage behavior in the more complex game cannot be rejected at the 5% level of significance.Footnote 3 We believe the main contribution of this paper to be the illustration, by means of an interesting case study, how careful theory can help with the understanding and analysis of experiments in which subjects play somewhat complicated games. The paper, arguably, also makes a contribution to the political science content of Forsythe et al. (1993) in completing the theory that in fact provides the same insights as the experiment (by virtue of providing almost exactly correct predictions for the experiment). Why would we possibly expect equilibrium behavior in the experiments of Forsythe et al. (1993)? Bernheim (1984) and Pearce (1984) have shown that the rationality of players, in fact even common knowledge of rationality, is not sufficient for Nash equilibrium play, except in very special cases. One sufficient condition for equilibrium play, provided by Aumann and Brandenburger (1995), is that players have “mutual knowledge of the payoff functions and of rationality, and common knowledge of the conjectures,” where conjectures are meant to be “conjectures, on the part of other players, as to what a player will do.”Footnote 4 The question then is this: Under what conditions do players obtain common knowledge of conjectures and would we expect this in our case? One idea is that the game is simple enough for players to identify a focal point, see Schelling (1960), i.e., an “obvious” way to play the game. If it is both obvious and then also played, a necessary condition for such a focal point would be that it is a Nash equilibrium. Another idea is that this common knowledge of conjectures derives from the presence of a book that is commonly known to have been read, understood, and that its recommendations are followed by all players. Such a book could be, among others, a religious text, a book of etiquette, or a comprehensive attempt at such a book such as Harsanyi and Selten (1988).Footnote 5 A necessary condition for such a book to fulfill this role would be for it to describe Nash equilibrium behavior, and a unique one at that. In a similar spirit, it is feasible that a meta-norm, using the language of Alos-Ferrer and Kuzmics (2013)—meaning a norm not specific to the particular game that is played (and not necessarily in a book), exists that is commonly used as a guiding principle to identify a focal point, especially when multiple equilibria exist. This could, for instance, be “play a Pareto-optimal (or risk-dominant) Nash equilibrium if one exists” but would have to be much more refined and complex if it were to be successful in all games. To understand this, consider, for instance, a simple coordination game with two options A and B, where coordination on A gives both players a payoff of 1, coordination on B both players a payoff of 2, and mis-coordination both a payoff of zero. Despite the multiplicity of equilibria in this game, subjects presumably have no problem coordinating on the “focal” payoff- and risk-dominant action B.Footnote 6 Interestingly Gunnthorsdottir et al. (2010a, b), who study somewhat more complicated games than this simple two players two actions game, also find that subjects are able to identify and play the unique Pareto-dominant (not risk-dominant) Nash equilibrium in their games.Footnote 7 Finally, one can derive conditions for Nash equilibrium play if the game played is played recurrently, i.e., played often with always changing other players.Footnote 8 This is the subject of evolutionary game theory. For textbook treatments, see, e.g., Weibull (1995), Hofbauer and Sigmund (1998), and Sandholm (2010).Footnote 9 Its origins go back to at least Brown (1951) and Robinson (1951) and is already present in the “mass action” interpretation of equilibrium in (Nash 1950, page 21). One of the key findings of this literature, sometimes referred to as the “folk theorem” of evolutionary game theory, see, e.g., Nachbar (1990), is that if a “reasonable” evolutionary process converges to a point, then this point must be a Nash equilibrium. As our game of interest here is played recurrently, albeit only 24 times, concerns of evolutionary stability of play strike us as potentially relevant for our analysis. Whether 24 “repetitions” is sufficient for this is an empirical question which we address in this paper. Moreover if a “reasonable” evolutionary process converges to a point, then this point should be evolutionarily stable; in that, it should be robust to the introduction of a small likelihood of arbitrary behavior. This idea has been formalized in the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) by Maynard Smith and Price (1973) and Maynard Smith (1982). There are many connections between convergence points of dynamic processes such as the replicator dynamic of Taylor and Jonker (1978) and ESS. See, e.g., textbooks of Weibull (1995), and Sandholm (2010) for these. One of the interesting conclusions of this literature is that (certain) mixed equilibria in coordination games (or generally in many games with multiple equilibria) are not evolutionarily stable. This is despite the fact these equilibria typically constitute a singleton strategically stable set in the sense of Kohlberg and Mertens (1986), and are therefore typically trembling-hand perfect (Selten 1975) and proper (Myerson 1978).Footnote 10 Evolutionary stable strategies agree with strategic stability and other refinements; in that, they cannot be weakly dominated.Footnote 11 As the theoretical sufficient conditions for Nash equilibrium are never perfectly satisfied in practice, ultimately the question is an empirical one. There is evidence that playing a game only once is not typically sufficient to guarantee equilibrium play. For instance, Wright and Leyton-Brown (2017), performing a meta-analysis of many games, show that Nash equilibrium is overall not a good prediction in games played only once.Footnote 12 There is evidence that playing a game sufficiently often (recurrently with different other players) does lead to equilibrium play. For instance, VanHuyck et al. (1990) show that subjects often fail to play any Nash equilibrium in one-shot coordination games, while Cooper et al. (1990) find evidence of Nash equilibrium play in recurrent coordination games. Similarly, O’Neill (1987) finds evidence against laboratory subjects playing minmax (i.e., Nash equilibrium) strategies in zero-sum games, while Walker and Wooders (2001) find mixed evidence that professional tennis players use minmax strategies in their service game, Hsu et al. (2007) find evidence that professional tennis players use minmax strategies, and Palacios-Huerta (2003) finds strong evidence that professional soccer players (and goalkeepers) use minmax strategies when taking (or defending) penalty kicks. Professionals have played these games often, while laboratory subjects not (or not often enough). Binmore et al. (2001) find that after and only after sufficient practice with the game do laboratory subjects play minmax strategies in a set of zero-sum games.Footnote 13 Also in public good provision games initial play is never an equilibrium (under material self-interested preferences), but eventual play after repetitions often is. See, e.g., Andreoni (1988) and the control group in Fehr and Gächter (2000). See also Duffy and Hopkins (2005) for learning in market entry games. There is also a more specific literature that aims to test evolutionary game theory in the laboratory and in the field. One could argue that Cooper et al. (1990) is an early example of that. This literature is surveyed in Friedman and Sinervo (2016). For instance, Oprea et al. (2011) study the evolution in single-population and two-population hawk–dove games and find support for evolutionarily stable play (which is very different in the two different cases). Our paper does in fact have similarities to a two-player hawk–dove game. Recently, people have been interested in testing evolutionary game theory in those cases where it predicts cycles instead of convergence to equilibrium. See, for instance, Sinervo and Lively (1996) who find that certain types of lizards display cyclical behavior, and Hoffman et al. (2015), Cason et al. (2010, 2013) for experiments with human subjects and some evidence of cycling. We are not aware of too many papers on the issue of whether only certain strategically or evolutionarily stable equilibria are played in laboratory experiments.Footnote 14 Laboratory experiments suffer a bit from the problem of the experimenter’s lack of complete control over the subjects’ utility or payoffs. See, e.g., Weibull (2004) for a discussion of this issue. For instance, observed play in ultimatum games, perhaps started by Güth et al. (1982) and recently surveyed in Cooper and Kagel (2016), could be evidence against subgame perfection, but could also be evidence against self-centered preferences. Indeed, the literature mostly interpreted this as evidence of other-regarding preferences.Footnote 15 There is a sizeable literature on laboratory experiments in political economy. The results in this literature, on the whole, mostly support the theoretical equilibrium predictions of various models on voter turnout, the Condorcet jury theorem, and the swing voter’s curse. See, e.g., Guarnaschelli et al. (2000), Aragones and Palfrey (2004), Levine and Palfrey (2007), and Bhattacharya et al. (2014). Palfrey (2009) provides a survey of this literature and finds that “[a]ll the experiments find significant evidence of strategic voting and, with a few exceptions, find support for the equilibrium predictions of the theories.”Footnote 16 What we add to this literature is that we provide an(other) instance of laboratory play that is extremely close to equilibrium theory for a rather complicated game with multiple equilibria. We show that despite these complications and strategic uncertainty, the subjects are able to coordinate their play very effectively on one of the evolutionarily stable attainable equilibria of this game. We also point out the role risk aversion (or some other reasonable and slight transformation of the utility function) could play in explaining laboratory experiments more closely.Footnote 17 Risk aversion has been used to explain behavior in experiments in a variety of studies. For instance, Goeree and Holt (2004), Goeree et al. (2003), and Fudenberg and Liang (2018) find that risk aversion improves the explanatory power of equilibrium behavior in matrix games, while Cox and Oaxaca (1996), Chen and Plott (1998), Goeree et al. (2002), and Campo et al. (2011) find that risk aversion is helpful in explaining behavior in auctions. Deck et al. (2008) and Friedman et al. (2014) have shown, however, that estimated risk-aversion parameters are often individual and even situation specific.Footnote 18 In fact, we favor another interpretation of the necessary concavification of the utility of money to explain the data here close to perfectly as stemming from the subjects’ heightened concern for coordination beyond pure monetary incentives.",2
70.0,3.0,Economic Theory,28 August 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00199-019-01225-4,Expected utility theory with probability grids and preference formation,October 2020,Mamoru Kaneko,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"We reconsider EU theory from the viewpoints of bounded rationality and preference formation. We restrict permissible probabilities to decimal (\( \ell \)-ary, in general) fractions up to a given cognitive bound \(\rho ;\) if \(\rho \) is a natural number k, the set of permissible probabilities is given as \(\varPi _{\rho }=\varPi _{k}=\{\frac{0}{10^{k}},\frac{1}{10^{k}},\ldots , \frac{10^{k}}{10^{k}}\}\). The decision maker makes preference comparisons step by step using probabilities with small k to those with larger \( k^{\prime }\) to obtain accurate comparisons. The derived preference relation is incomplete in general, but the EU hypothesis holds for some lotteries and it would hold more when there is no cognitive bound, i.e., \(\rho =\infty \) and \(\varPi _{\infty }=\cup _{k<\infty }\varPi _{k}\). However, our main concern is the case of finite and small \(\rho \). Since the theory involves various entangled aspects, we first disentangle them. The concepts of probability grids and cognitive bounds are introduced based on the idea of “bounded rationality.” The idea can be interpreted in many ways such as bounded logical inference, bounded perception ability, though Simon’s (1956) original concept meant a relaxation of utility maximization. The mathematical components involved in EU theory are classified into two types; object components used by the decision maker and meta-components used by the outside analyst and possibly by the decision maker himself. The former are primary targets in EU theory, and the latter such as highly complex rational as well as irrational probabilities are added for analytic convenience. A free use of the latter leads to a critique that the theory presumes “super rationality” (Simon 1983). As a significance level for statistical hypothesis testing is typically \(5\%\) or \(1\%\), probability values \(\frac{t}{10^{2}} (t=0,\ldots ,10^{2})\) are already quite accurate for ordinary people. However, the classical EU theory starts with the full real number theory and makes no separation between the viewpoints of the decision maker and the outside analyst for available probabilities. This appears to be a problem of degree, but it would be meaningful if they are separated in some manner. The concepts of probability grids and a cognitive bound \(\rho \) make this separation. 
Turing (1937) in his attempt to define computable numbers faced a similar situation: “...The differences from our point of view between the single and compound symbols is that the compound symbols, if they are too lengthy, cannot be observed at one glace. This is in accordance with experience. We cannot tell at a glance whether \(\underline{0.}9999999999999999\) and \(\underline{0.}999999999999999\) (the underlined parts by the author) are the same (1937, p. 250).”Footnote 1 In contrast, it is easy for us to distinguish between 0.999 and 0.99. Turing’s theory tried to abstract calculation in the human mind, but a built machine has no such problem since it reads each primitive symbol one by one. This is, so far, due to the difference in human and machine cognition. A cognitive bound \(\rho \) is a bound on such distinguishability and also on how deep the decision maker cares about those probabilities. The set of probability grids up to depth k is given as \(\varPi _{k}=\{\frac{0 }{10^{k}},\frac{1}{10^{k}},\ldots ,\frac{10^{k}}{10^{k}}\}\). The decision maker thinks about his preferences with \(\varPi _{k}\) from a small k to a larger k up to bound \( \rho ;\) for example, when \(\rho =2\), \(\varPi _{0}\), \(\varPi _{1}\), and \(\varPi _{2}\) are only allowed. This is a constructive approach from the viewpoint of the decision maker in the sense that he finds/forms his own preferences.Footnote 2\(^{,}\)Footnote 3 We turn our attention to the development of our constructive EU theory. Construction needs a basis; we take a hint from Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944), Section 3.3.2, p.17. They mentioned a separation of their argument into the following two steps, though this was not reflected in their mathematical development:  measurements of utilities from pure alternatives in terms of probabilities; extensions of these measurements to lotteries involving more risks.  These steps differ in their natures: Step B is to measure a “satisfaction”, “desire”, etc. from a pure alternative, while Step E is to extend the measured satisfactions given by Step B to lotteries including more risks. An important difference is that Step B is to find the subjective preferences hidden in the mind of the decision maker, while Step E is to extend logically the preferences found in Step B to lotteries with more risks. Step B with the benchmark scale We develop our theory based on the above two steps and also take two approaches in terms of preferences and numerical utilities; each approach consists of Steps B and E. In this introduction, we focus mainly on the former theory, and we give a brief explanation of the latter.Footnote 4 We assume two pure alternatives \({\overline{y}}\) and \({\underline{y}}\), called the upper and lower benchmarks;  these together with the probability grids \(\varPi _{k}\) form the benchmark scale \(B_{k}({\overline{y}}; {\underline{y}})\) in layer k. In Step B, pure alternatives are measured by this scale. Preferences are constructed in shallow to deeper layers, where preferences are incomplete in the beginning, except for benchmark lotteries as measurement units, and in deeper layers, more precise preferences may be found. In Fig. 1, the benchmark scale for layer k is depicted as the right broken line with dots; x is measured exactly by the scale, y need a more precise scale within \(\rho \). However, z is not done within \(\rho \). Two different roles of probability grids appear for evaluation of a lottery: probability grids used for measurement of a pure alternative in Step B; probability coefficients to pure alternatives. By these, relevant cognitive depths of lotteries become more complex, especially with a finite cognitive bound; this leads to incomparabilities in preferences and a violation of the EU hypothesis. This is central in our development and is closely related to the issue of “bounded rationality”. Let us illustrate (i) and (ii) via an example, which is a lottery for choice in the Allais paradox in Sect. 8. Consider one example with the upper and lower benchmarks \({\overline{y}}\), \({\underline{y}}\), and the third pure alternative y with strict preferences \({\overline{y}}\succ y\succ {\underline{y}}\). In Step B, the decision maker looks for a probability \(\lambda \) so that y is indifferent to a lottery \([{\overline{y}},\lambda ; {\underline{y}}]=\lambda {\overline{y}}*(1-\lambda ){\underline{y}}\) with probability \(\lambda \) for \({\overline{y}}\) and \(1-\lambda \) for \({\underline{y}} ;\) this indifference is denoted by Suppose that this \(\lambda \) is uniquely determined as \(\lambda =\lambda _{y}=\frac{83}{10^{2}}\in \varPi _{2}\). Here, exact measurement of y is successful in layer 2, where Step B is enough here. We have the other source of cognitive depths as mentioned in (ii). Consider lottery \(d=\tfrac{25}{10^{2}}y*\tfrac{75}{10^{2}}{\underline{y}}\), which includes the third pure alternative y. The independence condition of the classical EU theory dictates that because of (1), \([{\overline{y}}, \frac{83}{10^{2}};{\underline{y}}]\) is substituted for y in d, and d is reduced to: where \(\frac{2075}{10^{4}}=\frac{25}{10^{2}}\times \frac{75}{10^{2}}\) and \(\frac{7925}{10^{4}}=1-\frac{2075}{10^{4}}\). Thus, y is evaluated as being indifferent to \([{\overline{y}},\frac{83}{10^{2}};{\underline{y}}]\) in Step B, but y also has a probability coefficient \(\frac{25}{10^{2}} \) in d, which is taken into account in Step E. These steps lead to probability \(\frac{2075}{10^{4}}\), which is much more precise than either of \(\tfrac{83}{10^{2}}\) and \(\tfrac{25}{10^{2}}\). As indicated in (i) and (ii), lottery \(d=\tfrac{25}{10^{2}}y*\tfrac{75}{ 10^{2}}{\underline{y}}\) has two types of cognitive depths; one is simply a probability coefficient \(\frac{25}{10^{2}}\) and the other is \(\lambda _{y}= \tfrac{83}{10^{2}}\) from (1). Although d itself is expressed as a lottery of depth 2, the total depths including these two are 4, which is beyond the cognitive bound \(\rho =2\). One point is that the resulting probability may become more precise from lotteries of a relatively small bound, and the other is that this is intimately related to the EU hypothesis. When \(\rho \) is small, the EU hypothesis does not hold typically, while it would hold more as \(\rho \) is getting larger. The preference formation by Steps B and E is formulated as a form of mathematical induction; Step B is the inductive base and Step E is the inductive step. Step B is spread out to layers of various depths, i.e., the induction base is spread, too. These steps are described in Table 1: the relation \(\unrhd _{k}\) for layer k of row B expresses preferences measured in Step B . In layer k, \(\succsim _{k}\) is derived from \(\unrhd _{k}\) and \( \succsim _{k-1};\) the former is a part of the inductive base and the latter is the inductive step. This is a weak form of “independence condition.” As stated earlier, we provide another approach in terms of a 2-dimensional vector-valued utility functions \(\langle \varvec{\upsilon }_{k}\rangle _{k<\rho +1}=\langle [{\overline{\upsilon }}_{k},{\underline{\upsilon }} _{k}]\rangle _{k<\rho +1}\) and \(\langle {\varvec{u}}_{k}\rangle _{k<\rho +1}=\langle [{\overline{u}}_{k},{\underline{u}}_{k}]\rangle _{k<\rho +1}\) with Fishburn’s (1970) interval order \(\ge _{I}\). In each of Steps B and E, this approach is entirely equivalent to the preference approach, as depicted in Table 2. This may be interpreted as what Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944), p.29, indicated. The approaches in terms of preferences and utilities enable us to view Steps B and E in different ways as well as they serve different analytic tools for studies of incomparabilities/comparabilities involved. Our theory enjoys a weak form of the expected utility hypothesis. This will be discussed in Sect. 6. In the case of \(\rho =\infty \), restricting our attention to the set of measurable pure alternatives, Sect. 7 shows that our theory exhibits a form of the classical EU theory. We provide a further extension of \(\succsim _{\infty }\) to have the full form of the classical EU theory; this extension involves some unavoidable non-constructive step, which may be interpreted as the criticism of “super rationality” by Simon (1983). A remark is on the relationship between k and \(\rho \) exhibiting a layer and a cognitive bound. The former is a variable in our theory, and the latter is a parameter of the theory. We talk about the sequences \(\langle \succsim _{k}\rangle _{k<\rho +1}\) and \(\langle {\varvec{u}}_{k}\rangle _{k<\rho +1} \) describing the process of preference/utility formation, layer to layer, up to \(\rho \). Nevertheless, the final target preferences and utilities are \(\succsim _{\rho }\) and \({\varvec{u}}_{\rho }\). In the context of the quotation from Turing (1937), within the layers up to \(\rho \), the decision maker can distinguish each probability as a single symbol, but beyond \(\rho \), he would have a difficulty; here, it is assumed that he does not think about his decision problem beyond \(\rho \). When \(\rho =\infty \), he can treat any grid probability as a single entity. This remark leads to the view that our theory is a generalization of the classical EU theory, which is discussed in Sect. 7. In Sect. 8, we apply our theory to the Allais paradox, specifically to an experimental result from Kahneman and Tversky (1979). We show that the paradoxical results remains when the cognitive bound \(\rho \ge 3\). However, when \(\rho =2\), the resultant preference relation \( \succsim _{\rho }\) is compatible with their experimental result, where incomparabilities play crucial roles in explaining them. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the concept of probability grids and other basic concepts. Section 3 formulates Step B in terms of preferences and utilities and states their equivalence. Section 4 discusses Step E in terms of preferences, and Sect. 5 does it in terms of utilities. Section 6 discusses the measurable/non-measurable lotteries and shows that the expected utility hypothesis holds for the measurable lotteries. Section 7 discusses the connection from our theory to the classical EU theory. In Sect. 8, we exemplify our theory with an experimental result in Kahneman and Tversky (1979). Section 9 concludes this paper with comments on further possible studies. Proofs of all the results in each section are given in a separate subsection; only proof of Lemma 2.1 is given in “Appendix.”",1

When markets are complete and the number of firms is large, the assumption of price-taking behavior is well-founded: Gabszewicz and Vial (1972) start with a small number of firms and enlarge the economy by means of replication. Even though firms are Cournot competitors, their market power vanishes as they grow large in number and small in size relative to the economy. The limit of Cournot competition is a Walrasian equilibrium. The purpose of the present paper is to relax the assumption of complete markets. The setting is otherwise equivalent: It combines a Walrasian consumer side with producers who compete in a Cournot oligopoly, hence the name Cournot–Walras equilibrium. Although the modification seems small, the nature of the equilibrium set changes entirely. This challenges the positive foundations of price-taking behavior. The model of production is simple: Each firm consists of a production technology, an entrepreneur who makes the decisions, and a group of capitalists who provide outside finance. Following the tradition of general equilibrium, the model is closed and capitalists are consumers driven by their own preferences. For simplicity, there are only two dates and a single good that represents income today and in each future state of the world. Production is financed today by issuing assets in the financial market. Each asset is a claim to a share of the future output. Consumers invest in assets because their portfolios determine their state-contingent future income. A model of this kind is introduced by Carvajal et al. (2012), who choose to make the following two assumptions: First, all agents have quasilinear utility functions. Second, entrepreneurs consume only at the present date. Even though these assumptions are restrictive, they have the merit of rendering the model tractable, with a clear division of roles into consumers and producers, as in the archetypical model of Cournot (1838).Footnote 1 Producers choose their asset payoffs strategically. Since they are entrepreneurs who only care about present income, profit maximization is their natural objective. Quasilinear utility guarantees a single-valued mapping from choices to market prices. The asset payoffs determine not only how income transfers are priced, but also which income transfers are possible in the first place. Ever since Hart (1975) made a broad audience aware of the issue, it is widely understood that demand and prices exhibit discontinuities when the dimension of the income transfer space changes. Discontinuous prices result in discontinuous profits, and discontinuous payoff functions of profit-maximizing producers result in a discontinuous game. So far, little is known about the equilibrium set in such models—neither about its qualitative properties, nor about conditions on the primitives of the model (i.e., preferences, endowments, technologies) that guarantee its nonemptiness. The focus of the present paper is on qualitative properties. The properties of interest are the number of equilibria, the types of assets issued, economic welfare, and the limits of competition as the number of producers grows large. A classical result due to Dierker (1972) and Harsanyi (1973) is that Walrasian exchange economies as well as mixed extensions of finite games have an odd number of equilibria, provided that certain regularity conditions are fulfilled. It is known that discontinuities violate these conditions, and there is indeed no reason to presume that the number of Cournot–Walras equilibria with incomplete markets is odd. One may be tempted to believe that if the number is not odd, then it should be even, but such intuition is wrong. In the presence of discontinuities, the number of equilibria does not become even; it becomes very large: When markets are endogenously incomplete, there is a continuum of Cournot–Walras equilibria. The more incomplete a market becomes, the larger the set of equilibria grows. Denote by \(r\) the number of nonredundant assets, and by \(|\varvec{\varOmega }|\) the number of states; then, \(|\varvec{\varOmega }|-r\) measures the degree of market incompleteness. Conditional on the existence of at least one equilibrium with \(r\) nonredundant assets and a suitable regularity condition, the following results are derived:  There is a real indeterminacy of dimension \(r(|\varvec{\varOmega }|-r)\) (Theorem 1). Only if markets are endogenously complete, i.e., \(|\varvec{\varOmega }|=r\), Cournot–Walras equilibria are determinate. In all other cases, there is a real indeterminacy in addition to the usual financial indeterminacy that arises in the presence of redundant assets. It includes a continuum of equilibria with different asset spans and different allocations. This result is obtained in a two-date finance economy with real assets. It is therefore in contrast to real indeterminacy found in other settings, such as economies with nominal assets, as in Balasko and Cass (1989), Geanakoplos and Mas-Colell (1989), Werner (1990) and Nagata (1998), or economies with future spot markets, as in Mas-Colell (1991). Since income transfers are restricted to the asset span, a natural question is whether Cournot competition precludes certain types of income transfers. The answer is negative:  The set of equilibrium asset spans is open in the space of all \(r\)-dimensional asset spans (Corollary 2). This result is interpreted as follows: If there is one equilibrium with an \(r\)-dimensional asset span, then any nearby asset span (in the space of all \(r\)-spans) occurs endogenously at another equilibrium. Therefore, a large number of asset structures may arise from Cournot competition. The quasilinear setting lends itself to welfare comparisons of different equilibria. Given the large multiplicity of asset spans and allocations, it is no surprise that different equilibria are not equally desirable from a normative viewpoint:  Every open subset of the equilibrium set contains two equilibria that can be welfare-ranked (Proposition 1). This leaves room for normative theory: It is possible to design welfare-oriented objectives for firms that are consistent with the self-interest of their owners. The attainable welfare standard is lower than constrained efficiency, but it cannot be raised any further: As Zierhut (2017) shows, constrained efficient production plans would generically be rejected by majority vote of the owners of the firm. Finally, it is shown that in a world with incomplete markets, the limit behavior of Cournot–Walras equilibrium is different from its complete-market counterpart. The classical result that Walras equilibria are the unique limit points of Cournot competition as economies grow large is no longer true under endogenous asset structure choice:  The limit economy, as the number of producers goes to infinity, may have a continuum of incomplete-market equilibria that can be welfare-ranked. Even though these results reveal several notable properties, they certainly do not constitute an exhaustive analysis of general equilibrium with imperfect competition. Any economic model is a compromise between generality and tractability, and setting the focus on one aspect is synonymous with neglecting others. However, several of these neglected aspects are studied elsewhere. The most important one is existence of equilibrium, which is addressed in the growing literature on pure-strategy Nash equilibria in discontinuous games, albeit so far limited to conditions on derived objects (i.e., demand, best replies).Footnote 2 Conditions on the primitives of the model are formulated in existence theorems for Cournot–Walras equilibrium with complete markets, such as in Shirai (2010). However, these results are not applicable in the present setting with an endogenous asset span. Other neglected aspects include market entry and strategic takeovers of firms. A model with free entry is studied by Novshek and Sonnenschein (1978, 1983) in a setting with complete markets. In the models of Milne and Ritzberger (2002) and Demichelis and Ritzberger (2011), production technologies are owned by corporations and large investors acquire shares strategically. Another strand of the literature deals with complications that occur when the assumptions of the present model are relaxed. For example, the mapping from production plans to prices need not be single-valued outside the quasilinear setting. Then, as shown by Dierker and Grodal (1986), existence may fail even in the mixed extension. Moreover, equilibrium in pure strategies can only be defined with respect to a price selection. For discussions of this topic, the reader is referred to Roberts (1980) and Allen (1994). If there are multiple goods per state, the profit functions of producers depend on the chosen price normalization rule. In an example by Böhm (1994), any allocation can be attained at a Cournot–Walras equilibrium under some normalization rule. Moreover, if a firm has multiple owners who consume multiple goods, there may be disagreement about the optimal production plan, and profit maximization is no longer a well-founded objective of the firm. Dierker and Grodal (1999) and Bejan (2008) attempt to resolve these issues by proposing different objectives of the firm that depend only on relative prices. Nevertheless, as long as the objective function depends on prices, demand, or the utility of consumers, discontinuities arise when the asset structure is endogenous. Therefore, even in a much more general setting one can expect indeterminacy results similar to Theorem 1, but also considerable side effects. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 explains the intuition by means of a simple example. Section 4 quantifies the degree of indeterminacy. Section 5 shows that different equilibria can be welfare-ranked and discusses the normative implications. Section 6 replicates the economy and studies the limit points of Cournot competition in an example. Section 7 concludes.",4

Norman,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The “generalized second-price auction” (GSP) is a popular mechanism for the sale of advertising slots, or “sponsored links”, on internet search engines. Advertisers can bid on possible search keywords, for each of which there is such a “sponsored search” or “position” auction, taking place in continuous time. Higher positions are more valuable, in the sense that they generate more clicks, and the GSP allocates these positions in order of bid size, but with each advertiser’s payment determined by the next highest bid. Notwithstanding the complexity of this repeated game of incomplete information, much of the existing literature has argued that it is well modelled as a one-shot game of complete information. Whilst there exist many equilibria of even this one-shot game, much work has focused on Varian’s (2007) “symmetric Nash equilibria”, which are Nash equilibria in which bidders do not wish to deviate to win a higher position even if they only have to pay their current bid. Edelman et al. (2007) justify symmetric equilibria with their “locally envy-free” requirement—that a bidder will raise her bid to induce a higher payment for the bidder in the position above her, but only up to the point at which she would not regret her bid if that opponent were then to undercut her slightly. Börgers et al. (2013) “regard this argument as not entirely compelling because it is not clear that the relevant case for bidders to consider is the case that other bidders lower their bids” in this way. Moreover, it is not clear why a bidder should raise her bid to harm her opponent when there is no such motivation captured in her payoffs. Unless, that is, the advertisers’ bids are evolutionarily stable (Maynard Smith and Price 1973; Schaffer 1988).Footnote 1 Roughly speaking, an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is a strategy that, if adopted by most players, cannot be outperformed—and hence invaded—by a small number of players using a “mutant” strategy. This concept was originally defined for infinite populations, where it refines Nash equilibrium, but was generalized to allow finitely many players by Schaffer (1988). In the infinite-population case, each game involves an arbitrarily small fraction of the population, which is an unrealistic assumption for sponsored search auctions. Indeed, implicit in the one-shot complete-information modelling of these games is the assumption that a fixed set of advertisers participate in each auction, in which case the whole population takes part in each game. Schaffer’s analysis allows for this “playing the field” (Maynard Smith 1982) scenario, an important implication of which is that stable behaviour may be “spiteful” (Hamilton 1971): an ESS player acts not only to increase her payoff as usual, but also to decrease the payoffs of her opponents. This spite motivation, coupled with the robustness of ESS to small mutations, is key to my finding here that evolutionarily stable equilibrium bids in the “playing the field” GSP are locally envy-free (if the set of possible bids is not too coarse). The potential role for spite in explaining bidding behaviour in auctions predates the literature on sponsored search: It has been offered as an explanation for the experimental regularity of overbidding in second-price auctions (Morgan et al. 2003), where there is evidence that bidders overbid more often when they are likely to lose and set the winner’s price (Andreoni et al. 2007; Cooper and Fang 2008; Nishimura 2011). However, to my knowledge, evolutionary stability offers the first justification of such behaviour with standard preferences. In the infinite-population setting, ESS implies Nash equilibrium but need not exist in general. In the finite-population case, evolutionary stability may even diverge from Nash play (Ania 2008; Hehenkamp et al. 2010). However, I establish the existence of equilibrium ESS in the “playing the field” GSP for one position, and also for two positions as the number of bidders becomes large (which I argue extends to more than two positions).Footnote 2 Whilst evolutionary stability can thus provide a foundation for locally envy-free equilibria, there remain many such equilibria, including one with the same prices as the truthful equilibrium of the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) mechanism. This outcome has been a popular equilibrium selection, but its incomplete-information basis in Edelman et al. (2007) has been criticized for its arbitrary use of ascending bids (Börgers et al. 2013, p. 175, Che, Choi, and Kim 2007, p. 25). Cary et al. (2014) seek to justify the VCG outcome via a particular adaptive process, but their “balanced bidding” condition has been criticized by Che, Choi, and Kim (ibid.): “Since the same indifference condition is used to define the lower bound of symmetric Nash equilibria, and since the lower bound coincides with VCG, it is not surprising that the resulting dynamics converge to the VCG outcome”. The same authors offer experimental evidence against the VCG outcome. More traditional equilibrium refinements have been explored by Milgrom and Mollner (2018a), who find that whilst properness (Myerson 1978) and strategic stability (Kohlberg and Mertens 1986) are too weak to imply locally envy-free equilibrium in the GSP, it is implied by their pure “test-set equilibrium” refinement, and test-set equilibrium is equivalent to a modification of van Damme’s (1984) quasi-perfect equilibrium in a high-stakes version of a finite game. However, pure test-set equilibrium does not imply the VCG outcome, which furthermore does not survive Hashimoto’s (2013) “noise bidder” refinement, where a nonstrategic random bidder takes part in the auction with low probability. Here, I find similarly that evolutionary stability offers no support for the VCG outcome; I show by example that the VCG outcome need not be evolutionarily stable. Milgrom and Mollner (2018b), meanwhile, define an “extended proper equilibrium”—which is essentially a symmetric proper equilibrium of the symmetrized game employed by Selten (1980) and in my analysis below—and show that it too implies locally envy-free equilibrium in the GSP. In their paper and here, the symmetrizing of trembles/mutations across players is important for the result, and the relation between extended proper equilibrium and evolutionary stability would be an interesting topic for further study. Evolutionary stability is a very natural refinement for sponsored search auctions. There are two elements to the one-shot complete-information simplification popular in the literature: first, that bidders’ values are commonly known, because advertisers who “originally have private information about their types, gradually learn the values of others, and can adjust their bids repeatedly” (Edelman et al. 2007, p. 249); and second, that their payoffs are myopic, in the sense that their bids in any given auction are motivated by the immediate outcome of that auction rather than all future outcomes. It is well known that players can improve on myopic stage-game actions in repeated games, but Edelman, Ostrovsky, and Schwartz argue that they may not be able to do so in sponsored search auctions, due to the complexity of the requisite strategy implementation in a frequently repeated game: “ bidding software must first be authorized by the search engines, and search engines are unlikely to permit strategies that would allow advertisers to collude and substantially reduce revenues”.Footnote 3 Given myopic behaviour, the common learning of bidders’ valuations in an environment with frequent bidding is well founded theoretically (Jordan 1991) and experimentally (Che et al. 2017), and indeed, some platforms allow direct observation of competitor bids . Hence, the focus on Nash equilibria of one-shot sponsored search auctions appears valid, but the refinement possibilities offered by their repeated occurrence remain unexplored; for the framework of a game played repeatedly by myopic players is precisely that of evolutionary game theory, and the concept appropriate when the players are often the same advertisers is finite-population ESS. Edelman et al. (2007, p. 249) themselves ask “if the vector of bids stabilizes, at what bids can it stabilize?” This is a question of evolutionary game theory. In justifying their locally envy-free refinement, they ask “what are the simple strategies that an advertiser can use to increase his payoff, beyond simple best responses to the other players’ bids?” This is a question of which mutants can successfully invade an otherwise stable vector of bids. Finally, they “view a locally envy-free equilibrium as a prediction regarding a rest point at which the vector of bids stabilizes” (ibid., p. 250). Evolutionary stability provides a basis for this view.",3

However, people may to some extent also be driven by deontological motivations, such as a wish to “do the right thing” in the given situation. Such a participant in a public goods game may, for example, contribute the amount that would maximize the group’s welfare if everybody would do likewise, in line with Immanuel Kant’s (1785) categorical imperative, to “act only on the maxim that you would at the same time will to be a universal law.” In standard public goods games such partly morally motivated individuals may be behaviorally indistinguishable from altruists, individuals who are pure consequentialists but who attach a positive value to other’s well-being. However, in other interactions, a Kantian moralist may behave quite differently from an altruist. Take a \(2\times 2\) coordination game, where both players obtain payoff 1 if both use their first pure strategy, 2 if both use their second pure strategy, and otherwise zero. An altruist who expects the opponent to play the first pure strategy will do likewise. By contrast, a Kantian moralist may instead use the second pure strategy. This will result in material payoff zero to both, but the moralist may obtain psychological utility from behaving in a way he/she wishes all would in such interactions. If two stern moralists would play the coordination game, they would do just fine. However, in some games moralists of intermediate degree, known by both, may not even have a Nash equilibrium, and this may also be the case when player’s degree of morality is their private information. We here explore exactly these questions, more precisely whether symmetric Nash equilibria exist in symmetric and finite games played by partly morally motivated players. As a formal representation of such players we use the Homo moralis preferences that Alger and Weibull (2013) showed are evolutionarily stable in populations under assortative random matching.Footnote 1 We establish the existence of symmetric Nash equilibria for certain game classes, when played by such players, and we also give examples of simple games with no such equilibria. Theorem 1 and Proposition 6 together establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of symmetric Nash equilibrium between partly morally motivated players under incomplete information about others’ degree of morality.",1

It reveals how the outcome of economic activity responds to changes in exogenous variables, and generates testable predictions from economic theory. Yet, it hinges on two preconditions: differentiability and robustness of equilibria. An equilibrium is considered robust if it does not disappear nor multiply after a small change in parameters. In exchange economies neither of the two preconditions is too demanding: In a noted article, Debreu (1970) parameterized economies by endowments and showed that equilibria are generically robust, locally unique, and finite in number.Footnote 1 As a consequence, each equilibrium changes continuously and determinately when parameters are varied, and these changes can be linearly approximated by first-order differentials. The present paper asks whether these results can be extended to production economies in which producers compete in a differentiated product oligopoly. The parameters of a production economy are the characteristics of its population: Each consumer is represented by an endowment vector and a utility function; each producer is represented by a production set and a profit function. While market demand is differentiable under typical assumptions on consumer characteristics, there are no natural assumptions on producer characteristics that guarantee differentiable best replies. The crux of the problem is that the optimal strategy of each producer depends on the shape of the market demand function. As shown by Sonnenschein (1973), Mantel (1974), and Debreu (1974), consumers may generate market demand of almost any functional form—homogeneity and Walras’ law are the only restrictions. Profit of producer \(k\) as a function of his production scale \(\tau ^k\) for different scales of other producers \(\tau ^{{\lnot k}}\) (left panel). The flat segment results in a set-valued best-reply correspondence \(\tau ^{k*}\) (right panel) The consequences are studied in the framework of Cournot–Walras equilibrium, originally introduced by Gabszewicz and Vial (1972). The focus is on two-date finance economies: There is a single input good today, production takes time, and the quantity of future output is uncertain and depends on the state of the world. All producers sell a claim to their output as an asset in the financial market. Assets are differentiated products since the state-dependent output varies across producers. Consumers behave as price-takers, producers choose quantities strategically, and prices are determined by market clearing.Footnote 2 Typical assumptions on consumer characteristics are too weak to rule out set-valued or discontinuous best replies: Set-valued best replies occur when producer payoff functions have flat segments. This case is illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 1. Three sections are shown, each one for a different production level of the other producers. The resulting best-reply correspondence of the producer is depicted in the right panel. At level \(a\), there is a unique profit maximum and the best-reply correspondence is locally differentiable. However, as the other producers increase their output toward level \(b\) and beyond, the profit maximum degenerates and the best-reply correspondence is no longer single-valued. If \(b\) were an equilibrium strategy, differentiability would fail at the equilibrium. Profit of producer \(k\) as a function of his production scale \(\tau ^k\) for different scales of other producers \(\tau ^{{\lnot k}}\) (left panel). At \(b\) there are two maxima and the best-reply correspondence \(\tau ^{k*}\) is discontinuous (right panel) The problem in the preceding example is the lack of strict quasiconcavity. The emphasis is on strict: all sections are quasiconcave and even approach a concave function beyond level \(c\), but at the same time the flat segment grows larger and larger. This problem shall be contrasted with an example that puts the emphasis on quasi: Even if all critical points are nondegenerate, lack of quasiconcavity may entail sections with multiple peaks. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2. At a low output level of other producers, such as level \(a\) there is a unique maximum at the right peak. At a high output level of other producers, such as level \(c\), the left peak is the higher one. By continuity, there must be an intermediate level, say \(b\), at which the left peak surpasses the right one. At this level, there are two global maxima and the resulting best-reply correspondence exhibits a discontinuity. If \(b\) were an equilibrium strategy, robustness would fail at the equilibrium. The earliest discussion of this issue goes back to Roberts and Sonnenschein (1977), who stress the implications for the existence of equilibrium in pure strategies. By means of two examples the authors demonstrate that the model lacks an equilibrium for certain parameter ranges.Footnote 3 Sufficient conditions for equilibrium existence are the subject of more recent research: Shirai (2010) shows that if preferences can be aggregated in the form of a representative consumer with a well-behaved, additively separable utility function, equilibria exist generally. Another promising source of existence conditions is the recent literature on non-quasiconcave and discontinuous games, which is surveyed by Reny (2016). The present paper concentrates on regularity: An equilibrium is regular if it is differentiable and robust. If this were not the case, the model would only have limited predictive power. The following results are obtained:  For an open, dense set of economies all equilibria are regular (Theorem 1). Each economy has a finite number of isolated equilibria (Corollary 3). Contrary to Debreu (1970), who takes \(C^1\) demand functions as the primitive objects, utility functions are used to represent the preferences of consumers. It is known that generic regularity of exchange economies can be obtained for \(C^2\) utility functions that have well-behaved derivatives up to the second order and satisfy a boundary condition. The assumptions necessary to obtain generic regularity in production economies are only slightly stronger: Utility functions must be of class \(C^3\) but restrictions on third-order derivatives are not necessary. Debreu’s original regularity result has motivated a large number of more or less substantial extensions in exchange economies. The closest one is that of Smale (1974a), who chooses to parameterize economies by utility functions instead of endowments. Utility functions are also used in the parameterization of Dierker (1975), who permits a continuum of consumers. Several variations of the economic environment have been considered: Incomplete markets are covered by Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1986). Restrictions on portfolios and consumption are considered by Cass et al. (2001) and Bonnisseau and del Mercato (2008), respectively. Economies with a public good are the subject of Villanacci and Zenginobuz (2005). Nonstandard preferences are the focus of Bonnisseau (2003), who considers consumers without ordered preferences, Biheng and Bonnisseau (2015), who consider ambiguity-averse consumers, and Bonnisseau and del Mercato (2010), who consider consumption externalities. As regards production economies, most previous results are based on narrow concepts of production. In Fuchs (1974), producers are represented by supply functions, which rules out natural cases such as constant returns to scale technologies. In Fuchs (1977), the setting is generalized to supply correspondences, but the assumptions are still too strong to permit constant returns to scale. By contrast, Mas-Colell (1975) and Kehoe (1980) focus exclusively on technologies with constant returns and the special case of linear activity models, respectively. An extension by Kehoe (1982) permits primary and intermediate goods. First hints of generic regularity with more general production sets are given in Smale (1974b). The necessary arguments for a rigorous proof in general economies with price-taking firms are for the first time presented in Geanakoplos et al. (1990), and proofs of this kind are now part of textbook treatments such as Chapter 9 in Villanacci et al. (2002). A notable recent contribution is the regularity result of del Mercato and Platino (2017) for production economies with externalities. Conceptually, their equilibrium concept is different from Cournot–Walras equilibrium: All producers are price-takers and do not mind the shape of market demand. Therefore, set-valued or discontinuous best replies, which are the focus of the present paper, do not occur. However, the two models share one technical aspect: The decision problems of all producers are interdependent, and the solution concept is Nash equilibrium in pure strategies. In this case, perturbations of consumers’ endowments, as in Debreu (1970), are not sufficient to restore regularity. To overcome this difficulty, the authors put more structure on producers and introduce perturbations of the supply side of the economy. This additional structure is optional: The present paper shows that regularity can be obtained in two ways. One way is indeed to perturb producers through their cost functions. The other way is to perturb consumers through their utility functions. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the model, its assumptions, and the concept of regular production economy. In Sect. 3, the main results are derived and discussed. In Sects. 4 and 5, these results are extended to economies with quasilinear utility and unbounded endowments. Section 6 concludes.",1

Asheim,Tapan Mitra,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Hartwick’s rule for sustainability prescribes reinvesting resource rents, thus keeping the value of net investments equal to zero. Originating from Hartwick’s original article (Hartwick 1977), a series of papers (among others, Dixit et al. 1980; Withagen and Asheim 1998; Mitra 2002; Asheim et al. 2003; Buchholz et al. 2005; Mitra et al. 2013) have contributed to our understanding of the connection between Hartwick’s rule and a sustainable development with constant well-being. These contributions show how Hartwick’s rule for sustainability corresponds to paths which keep well-being constant (are egalitarian) and where well-being cannot be increased for some subinterval of time without being decreased at some other subinterval (are efficient). This correspondence can be stated through the following two results: Hartwick’s result If along an efficient path Hartwick’s rule is followed forever, then an egalitarian path is implemented. The converse of Hartwick’s result If an efficient and egalitarian path is implemented, then Hartwick’s rule is followed forever. 
Asheim (2013) presents an overview of how these results obtain in three different classes of technologies: (1) the one-sector growth model, (2) the model of capital accumulation and resource depletion used by Hartwick, and (3) a general model with multiple capital goods. Now, these results are established under assumptions that are rather strict: The economy is assumed to have constant technology and constant population. Furthermore, the economy is assumed to implement an efficient path in continuous time. There are ways to relax each of these assumptions and still obtain some variant of Hartwick’s result and its converse. For example, if there is exogenous technological progress in the sense of a time-dependent technology, we may restore these results by including time as an additional stock. In this paper, we focus on how to relax the assumption that time is continuous. In reality, accounting for the value of net investments will take place at discrete points in time. Furthermore, Fleurbaey (2015, p. 35) suggests that the concept of sustainable development be analyzed in discrete time “because discrete time makes it possible to obtain a clear distinction between what the current period does and what the next periods can do given the capital stocks they inherit”. Thus, it is of interest to investigate to what extent the relationship between Hartwick’s rule and a sustainable development with constant well-being survives in a discrete-time setting. This question was already raised by Dasgupta and Mitra (1983) in a discrete-time version of the model of capital accumulation and resource depletion used by Hartwick. The results were discouraging in the sense that Hartwick’s rule is not exactly followed along an efficient and egalitarian path, even if technology and population are constant and rather strong assumptions are imposed on the production function. This paper shows how the converse of Hartwick’s result obtains in the model of capital accumulation and resource depletion under weaker assumptions than those imposed by Dasgupta and Mitra (1983). In particular, we impose only regular neoclassical assumption on how net production is a function of the capital and resource use, while relaxing a requirement that resource use has a non-vanishing functional share of output as resource use approaches zero. And even though the competitive prices along such an efficient and egalitarian path do not provide the precise price ratio for which the value of net investments is zero, we show that such prices at the discrete points in time yield a narrow interval for the price ratio that gives zero value of net investments when going from one point in time to the next. The proof of this result is based on the following observation made by Malinvaud (1953) in discrete time and developed in the context of efficient and egalitarian paths in continuous time by Mitra (2002): Vectors of initial stocks that are sufficient to maintain well-being at or above a given level c form a convex set S(c). Furthermore, there is a relative price between capital and resource at which the vector of initial stocks that leads to an efficient and egalitarian path with well-being kept constant at c minimizes the cost of stocks evaluated over all vectors in S(c). Finally, by applying a suggestion made by Dasgupta and Mitra (1983, Section 7), we show that this relative price is exactly the ratio of gross capital productivity to productivity of resource use, which is the competitive price ratio that compares the value of stock changes in the context of Hartwick’s rule. Note that this last step is non-trivial and essential, as Hartwick’s rule is defined in terms of competitive prices, not in terms of the “maximin” prices that support the set S(c) and which can be derived from the partial derivatives of the maximin value function. The fact that the competitive value of stock is minimized is sufficient to establish that the competitive valuation of net investments between time period t and time period \(t+1\) is nonnegative when valued at the (higher) early price ratio at t and non-positive when valued at the (lower) late price ratio at \(t+1\). Hence, there exists an intermediate price ratio of capital augmentation to resource use, between the one at \(t+1\) and the one at t, that leads to zero value of net investments. Thus, by redefining Hartwick’s rule to require zero value of net investments at some valuation rule intermediate between early and late pricing, we show that Hartwick’s rule is followed in all time periods along an efficient and egalitarian path. Compared to Dasgupta and Mitra (1983), we make the timing of prices more transparent, allowing us to introduce the terms “early” and “late” pricing and setting the stage for redefining Hartwick’s rule in a manner appropriate for discrete time. Moreover, by weakening the assumptions on the production function, we establish a significantly stronger result. With their additional assumption, namely that resource use has a non-vanishing functional share of output as resource use approaches zero, Dasgupta and Mitra (1983, Theorem 1) show that if it is feasible to keep consumption bounded away from zero starting with given initial stocks of capital and resource, then these stocks can also give rise to an efficient and egalitarian path. Hence, this assumption means that the maximin problem of maximizing the infimum of consumption leads to an efficient and egalitarian path whenever the infimum is positive. Note that such a result cannot be established in the one-sector model of capital accumulation if there is a finite Golden Rule capital stock, since there exists no efficient and egalitarian solution to the maximin problem for initial stocks exceeding the Golden Rule size. Mitra et al. (2013, Theorem 2) indicate that the present model, which includes resource depletion, has similar properties: If initial stocks of capital and resource are too large, there might not exist any efficient and egalitarian path, even though these stocks are sufficient to keep consumption bounded away from zero. While the analysis of Dasgupta and Mitra (1983) is not applicable under such circumstances, we show that the converse of Hartwick’s result holds for any initial stocks that leads to an efficient and egalitarian solution to the maximin problem; this corresponds to the analogous result in the one-sector model. We start out in Sect. 2 by presenting the assumptions that we impose on the model of capital accumulation and resource depletion. We define properties for paths in this model, derive preliminary results on the competitive price support of interior paths (with positive capital and resource use in each time period), and adapt the definition of Hartwick’s rule to the discrete-time setting. We then proceed in Sect. 3 to prove that the converse of Hartwick’s result holds even in discrete time, as well as suggesting how this result can be generalized beyond the model of capital accumulation and resource depletion. In the concluding Sect. 4, we show how our redefinition of Hartwick’s rule follows naturally if we view discrete time as providing information at discrete points in time of an underlying continuous-time process. This perspective allows us to relate our adaptation of Hartwick’s rule to discrete time to the continuous-time version of the converse of Hartwick’s result. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced when attempting to establish Hartwick’s rule as a prescriptive rule in a discrete-time setting. In particular, we pose the question whether Hartwick’s result can be demonstrated in discrete time, so that a policy of zero value of net investments can be used to steer the economy along an efficient and egalitarian path. All proofs—except the demonstration of our main result—are contained in the “Appendix”.",3

This paper uses minimal sets of criteria to measure how concisely preferences can be represented and how efficiently an agent can make decisions. I will argue that criteria provide a better measure of concision than the economics test of checking whether a preference has a utility representation. The paper will also reconcile a disagreement between psychology and utility theory regarding the permissibility of indifference in preference analysis, generalize Debreu’s characterization of utility-representable preferences, and offer simple proofs of extension theorems for transitive orders. Criteria can in principle be arbitrary complete and transitive binary relations on the domain of alternatives, but it turns out that the simplest variety, the binary criteria that partition alternatives into two equivalence classes, is best suited to this paper’s agenda. Any preference \(\succsim \) can be represented as the lexicographic ordering of some well-ordered set of binary criteria, and there is consequently a minimal set that represents \(\succsim \). The ordinal number of criteria in this minimal set, which I will call the intrinsic length of \( \succsim \), gauges how difficult \(\succsim \) is to represent and the decision-making burden of using binary criteria to make \(\succsim \)-optimal choices. When the intrinsic length of \(\succsim \) is less than the number of indifference classes in \(\succsim \), a length-cardinality gap is present and \(\succsim \) can then be represented concisely. Some preferences—for example, preferences with a finite number of indifference classes and utility-representable preferences with a continuum of indifference classes—are declared concise by this test, while others are hard to represent. Length-cardinality gaps offer an alternative to the long tradition in economics of regarding the existence of a utility representation as the mark of concision. The two approaches sometimes generate the same conclusions, but where they differ the length-cardinality gap discriminates more precisely. For example, an existence-of-a-utility test has to judge all preferences with countably many indifference classes as equally concise, while a length-cardinality test does not. When an agent uses a sequence of binary criteria to make decisions, a length-cardinality gap means that the agent can make decisions rapidly and that the number of criterion orderings the agent has to make will be small relative to the number of preference orderings that the sequence generates. For example, to generate a finite number of indifference classes n and thus \(\left( {\begin{array}{c}n\\ 2\end{array}}\right) =\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) orderings of indifference classes, only \(\left\lceil \log _{2}n\right\rceil \) criteria and criterion judgments are needed.Footnote 1 Intrinsic length sheds light on Chipman’s (1960) lexicographic utility theory, where a preference is represented by an ordered set of utility functions and the first utility to discriminate between two alternatives determines which is preferred.Footnote 2 Chipman was prompted by Debreu’s demonstration in 1954 that so-called lexicographic preferences—where an agent chooses between bundles x and y according to the first coordinate where x and y differ—do not have utility representations. Chipman showed that these preferences and indeed all preferences have a lexicographic utility representation. In Chipman’s theory, Debreuvian lexicographic preferences turn out to have a concise representation since they require only finitely many utility functions. But this conclusion is threatened by Chipman’s use of utility functions as a measuring stick: is concision possible only because utility functions can represent uncountably many indifference classes? Well-ordered sets of binary criteria eliminate this difficulty. They also vindicate Chipman’s position: Debreuvian lexicographic preferences show a sizable length-cardinality gap and qualify as concise. An agent may seek criteria that pick out a single choice from any finite set of options rather than a set of acceptable alternatives. In psychological models of sequences of binary criteria, this absence of indifference is upheld as an advantage over classical utility maximization (Tversky 1972).Footnote 3 To formalize the decisiveness of binary criteria, I show that they can lead to preferences that strictly order every pair of bundles in \( {\mathbb {R}} ^{n}\): the indifferences criticized by behavioral psychology are absent. An agent moreover needs to proceed through only finitely many criteria to order a pair of bundles. Despite the absence of indifference, the preferences to which these sets of binary criteria lead have utility representations. Thus there is no inherent conflict between the psychological and utility points of view: decisiveness is consistent with utility maximization and economic rationality. Since the utilities that arise discriminate between every pair of bundles, they define one-to-one mappings (injections) of \( {\mathbb {R}} ^{n}\) into \( {\mathbb {R}} \) and in fact generalize the injections defined by Cantor, the discoverer of the first such mappings. This class of utility functions can represent ‘fractal’ preferences where the pattern of indifference classes when they are grouped together coarsely matches their pattern when grouped together finely (Mandler 2020c). Well-ordered criteria also advance the mathematics of decision theory. By viewing each binary criterion as a binary digit and allowing the number of digits to be more than countable, we can generalize the classical representation result, due to Birkhoff (1948) and Debreu (1954), that a utility representation exists for a preference \(\succsim \) if and only if \(\succsim \) has a countable order-dense subset. Finally criteria can provide very simple proofs that transitive orders can be extended to linear orders. 
Evren and Ok (2011) and Kochov (2007), and earlier Ok (2002) and Mandler (2006), provide a non-lexicographic theory of representation in which unordered families of utility functions can represent incomplete preferences. The present theory lacks that advantage. Instead the goal will be to find minimal well-ordered families of binary relations or criteria that represent preferences when the criteria are ordered lexicographically. This approach delivers a gain in concision since lexicographic representations can use fewer criteria (of a given discriminatory capacity) than unordered representations require. The well-orderings play two roles: they ensure that when some criterion in a set discriminates between a pair of alternatives there is a first criterion that does so, and they make comparisons of concision possible by determining which of two sets of criteria is shorter. Ordinal numbers—the canonical well-ordered sets—are therefore essential. To maintain accessibility, I segregate the abstract applications of ordinals to the last two sections of the paper.",5

That is, each state is controlled by one of the players and it is the controlling player of a state who decides what the next state will be. We do not consider chance moves in our model and the number of states is finite. The players receive a (possibly negative) reward upon termination of the game. Termination is decided by the controlling player of the active state, who always has this option instead of moving to another state. The rewards to the players depend on the state where the game is terminated. Infinite play is a possibility in these games, as no player is forced to terminate the game (unless the structure of the game leaves him no other option). Infinite play is associated with a zero reward for all players. Our games belong to the more general class of dynamic games with perfect information, which have numerous applications in economic theory, computer science, and other disciplines. One of the main goals in the literature has always been to identify conditions that guarantee the existence of a subgame perfect equilibrium, or at least of a subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium for every positive error term \(\varepsilon \). For our class of games, we prove the existence of a subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium, for every \(\varepsilon >0\). Our existence result extends several earlier results, where further restrictions were imposed on either the transition structure or the reward structure of the game. A subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium, for every \(\varepsilon >0\), was previously established in games with only nonnegative rewards (Flesch et al. 2010a), in free transition games (Kuipers et al. 2013), and in games where each player only controls one state (Kuipers et al. 2016). In the literature, we can also find sufficient conditions for other classes of games, such as in the classical papers by Fudenberg and Levine (1983) and Harris (1985), and more recently, in the papers by Solan and Vieille (2003), Flesch et al. (2010b), Purves and Sudderth (2011), Brihaye et al. (2013), Roux and Pauly (2014), Flesch and Predtetchinski (2016), Roux (2016), Mashiah-Yaakovi (2014), Cingiz et al. (2019) and Flesch et al. (2019). We further refer to the recent book by Alós-Ferrer and Ritzberger (2016), and the surveys by Jaśkiewicz and Nowak (2016) and Bruyère (2017). In most economic models, payoffs are bounded and discounted, and this automatically guarantees continuity at infinity, a condition defined by Fudenberg and Levine (1983). For the topological meaning of continuity at infinity, we refer to Alós-Ferrer and Ritzberger (2016, 2017). Even though in our model payoffs are not discounted, our results have an implication for the discounted case. Indeed, the joint strategies that we construct are not only subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibria in the undiscounted game, but also in the discounted game, provided that the discount factor is sufficiently close to 1 [cf. the notion of uniform \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium, e.g., the survey by Jaśkiewicz and Nowak (2016)]. The strategy profile is thus independent of the discount factor, provided it is large enough, so the knowledge of the exact discount factor is not required. The undiscounted game on its own is also interesting in the context of negotiations or delegation problems, when there is no specific deadline given for an agreement. An example of this can be found in the paper by Bloch (1996), where the negotiation process for coalition formation is modeled as a positive recursive game. A positive recursive model is limited to situations where any agreement is always better than no agreement, for all players. The generalization to recursive games that are not necessarily positive removes this limitation and allows for models, where some players may wish to sabotage certain outcomes. The relevance of our paper, we think, mostly lies in the fact that we obtain insight in the structure of equilibria in perfect information games with deterministic transitions. Let us briefly discuss this. In general, one can distinguish two essentially different reasons why an error term may be needed for equilibrium play in a dynamic game. It could be that, in subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium play, every action that is played with positive probability gives the player a reward that is very close or equal to his initially expected reward. Let us say that this is an error term of the first type. It could also be that, in subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium play, a player must place a very small probability on an action that will lead to a substantially lower reward than initially expected. Let us say that this is an error term of the second type. For a game in our class, if an error term \(\varepsilon \) is required, it is always of the second type, and the suboptimal action that is played with small probability invariably serves as a threat to one of the other players to make him follow the plan (Fig. 1).
 The following game was introduced in Solan and Vieille (2003). There are two players, player 1 and player 2, and two states, \(s_1\) and \(s_2\). Player 1 controls state \(s_1\) and player 2 controls state \(s_2\). In state \(s_1\), player 1 has two actions: he can nominate state \(s_2\), or terminate the game with reward \(-1\) for himself and reward 2 for player 2. In state \(s_2\), player 2 has two actions: he can nominate state \(s_1\), or terminate the game with reward \(-2\) for player 1 and reward 1 for himself. If no player ever terminates the game, then the reward is 0 for each player. This game can be represented as follows: Game where player 2 can threaten player 1 with termination of the game Player 1 prefers that the game will never terminate, as he would then obtain reward 0, whereas he will obtain a negative reward, either \(-1\) or \(-2\), upon termination. Player 2 is interested in termination of the game. He can always force termination at state \(s_2\) with reward 1 for himself, but he prefers that player 1 will terminate at state \(s_1\), in which case he will obtain reward 2. Notice that, if the game terminates, then player 1 also prefers termination at state \(s_1\) instead of \(s_2\). As Solan and Vieille (2003) show, this game has the following two important properties: There is no subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium in pure strategies for small \(\varepsilon >0\), and there is no subgame perfect 0-equilibrium, not even in randomized strategies. Nevertheless, they show that the following stationary strategies constitute a subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium for \(\varepsilon \in (0,1)\): player 1 in state \(s_1\) terminates with probability 1 (regardless the history), whereas player 2 in state \(s_2\) nominates state \(s_1\) with probability \(1-\varepsilon \) and terminates with probability \(\varepsilon \) (regardless the history). Let us briefly argue that this strategy profile is indeed a subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium. It is easy to see that player 2 cannot improve his reward by more than \(\varepsilon \), as his expected reward, when starting in state \(s_2\), is \((1-\varepsilon )\cdot 2+\varepsilon \cdot 1=2-\varepsilon \). Player 1 cannot improve his reward at all. Indeed, player 2’s strategy prescribes to always terminate with the same positive probability whenever the play is in state \(s_2\), so player 2’s strategy makes sure that one of the players will eventually terminate. Intuitively, termination by player 2 with probability \(\varepsilon \) can be seen as a threat against player 1, which retaliates any deviations by player 1. Note that the error term \(\varepsilon \) is of the second type. We remark that all subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibria in this game have this feature: player 2 threatens player 1 with termination at \(s_2\). \(\square \) It was shown by Flesch et al. (2010a), who studied perfect information games with positive recursive rewards and with chance moves, that, for their game model, a subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium exists for every \(\varepsilon > 0\). Here, the error term \(\varepsilon \) is always of the first type and arises as the consequence of chance moves in the model. Indeed, they showed that, in the absence of chance moves, a subgame perfect equilibrium in pure strategies exists. When chance moves are eliminated from the model studied by Flesch et al. (2010a), we obtain a special case of the model we study here, with nonnegative rewards. Thus, the error term \(\varepsilon \) is not needed when the rewards in our model are nonnegative. One can get some intuitive understanding for this by realizing that, when the rewards are all nonnegative, all players have an interest in termination of the game. By contrast, in the presence of negative rewards, some players may want to obstruct termination of the game when they foresee termination with a negative reward for them. This is when a threat, executed with small probability, is necessary to keep such players in check. Another interesting feature is that subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium play for a game in our class is mostly deterministic: At most once after each deviation will there be a stage where a small probability is placed on a threat action. In order to play such a strategy, a player needs to have two pieces of data in memory: (i) the most recent deviation from equilibrium play (if there was indeed a deviation) and (ii) whether a lottery took place after the most recent deviation to decide on the execution of a threat action, and if so, the outcome of the lottery. The following instructive game shows that, in order to obtain a subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium, it may be necessary to make detours in the game, such that the same state must be visited twice, first on the way to reach a player who can execute a threat action, then to reach the player who should terminate the game (Fig. 2). Detours in a subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium This game is played by three players and has three states. The controlling player, the state, the possible actions of the controlling player and the rewards upon termination are represented similarly to Example 1. The rewards for players 1 and 2 in states \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) are exactly as in Example 1, i.e., \(-1\) and 2 in state \(s_1\) and \(-2\) and 1 in state \(s_2\). Player 3 can be seen as an additional player, who is not interested in terminating himself, as it gives him the worst possible reward \(-1\). One can verify that, for \(\varepsilon \in (0,1)\), this game has the following subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium that is very similar to the one in Example 1. Player 1 in state \(s_1\) terminates with probability 1 (regardless the history). Player 2 in state \(s_2\) nominates state \(s_3\) with probability \(1-\varepsilon \) and terminates with probability \(\varepsilon \) (regardless the history). Player 3’s strategy is not stationary: if state \(s_3\) is reached from state \(s_1\) then player 3 nominates state \(s_2\) with probability 1, whereas if state \(s_3\) is reached from state \(s_2\) then player 3 nominates state \(s_1\) with probability 1. In this strategy profile, if player 1 deviates by nominating state \(s_3\), then instead of moving back to state \(s_1\) directly, a detour is made via player 2, because player 2 is the only player who has a threat action against player 1. One can verify that such a detour, at least with a positive probability, is necessary to obtain a subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium. This underlines the difficulty to construct subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibria in our class of games. We remark that, in more complex games, a threat is sometimes not immediate termination by a player with small probability, but rather a complete sequence of actions that a player can start with small probability. \(\square \) Interestingly, our analysis shows that just one computational effort suffices to find a subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium for every \(\varepsilon > 0\). The only difference between these equilibria is the probability with which a threat action should be executed. Examples 1 and 2 indicate how this works. The analysis in this paper suggests that it is unlikely that such a computation can be done efficiently: A naive implementation of the procedure we propose in this paper obviously requires super-exponential time. This is in contrast with the situation of nonnegative rewards, for which Flesch et al. (2010a) proved that a subgame perfect equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time. Although the exact computation of a subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equlibrium likely becomes intractable already for moderately sized problems, our results are probably useful for finding a good quality of solutions. As an illustration, let us see what happens if we introduce a discount factor \(\beta \in (0,1)\) in the model to simplify the analysis. It follows from a result by Fink (1964) and Takahashi (1964) that the discounted model has a subgame perfect equilibrium in stationary strategies. For Example 1, we then have precisely one stationary equilibrium, which is also subgame perfect, and where both players should terminate the game with probability \(\frac{1-\beta ^2}{\beta (2-\beta )}\) when they are active. This means that the game will terminate with probability 1, and when \(\beta \) is close to 1, both states have a probability of approximately \(\frac{1}{2}\) of termination. This totally ignores the fact that, given termination of the game, both players have an interest in termination at state 1. Readers who are only interested in the construction of a subgame perfect \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium for a game in our class and why it is indeed an equilibrium, can limit themselves to reading the first four sections of this paper. We formally introduce our model in Sect. 2, we introduce terminology and strategic concepts in Sect. 3, and we give a proof of our main result Sect. 4. The proof in Sect. 4 makes use of a fixed point theorem, which we prove in Sect. 5.",1

71.0,3.0,Economic Theory,26 July 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00199-019-01219-2,On the optimality of monetary trading,April 2021,Guilherme Carmona,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Throughout time the means of exchange have changed considerably. Many commodities have been used as media of exchange, including chocolate, shells, butter, salt, and, of course, paper. Recent technological developments led to a substantial increase in cash substitutes like electronic payments and credit cards in most developed countries (e.g. Humphrey et al. 1996). Despite all the technological developments in payment systems, the nature of exchange in developed economies is strikingly similar to what it has been before—each person has a balance, which rises when he gives up goods, and falls when he acquires goods. The trading mechanism is, in an informational sense, still a monetary one: All that has changed is that the balance, which was once physical, has become virtual.
 This persistence of monetary exchange is puzzling. Given the advances in record-keeping and communication technology, it now seems feasible to design a trading mechanism which conditions trading behavior in information that monetary exchange ignores. By taking into account that information, such a trading mechanism has the potential to be more efficient than a monetary one. In fact, Kandori (1992) and Kocherlakota and Wallace (1998) explicitly design a non-monetary trading mechanism which is more efficient than a monetary trading mechanism whenever the record-keeping technology is sufficiently developed.Footnote 1 Why do not real-world trading systems exploit these efficiency gains? Why do we observe monetary trading and not some other trading arrangement? In this paper, we provide an answer to these questions in a random-matching, absence-of-double-coincidence-of-wants setting analogous to that of Kiyotaki and Wright (1989) and Kocherlakota and Wallace (1998). Our view is that monetary trading would not have persisted if there is a more efficient trading mechanism; the contribution of this paper is to identify, in the setting on which most recent monetary models are built, an economically meaningful constraint on trading mechanisms that renders monetary trading as the most efficient trading mechanism among those that satisfy it. In short: Individuals in single-coincidence matches choose whether or not to trade depending on the history of past behavior. Each individual’s history of past behavior is summarized in a binary state variable (i.e. there is memory) which is updated by an agent—the center.Footnote 2 This is a costly activity; hence, the center needs to be incentivized, and this leads to the constraint on trading mechanisms that will imply our optimality result for monetary trading. Thus, no wonder why we observe monetary trading: It is the best that can realistically—with an incentive-feasible memory—be achieved. Our optimality result significantly differs from that of Kocherlakota and Wallace (1998). In the latter, monetary trading is optimal only when there is no other record-keeping device other than fiat money (i.e. a portable object). In contrast, in our optimality result, incentive-feasible memory is available and, as in Kocherlakota (1998), monetary trading is just one particular way of using memory. Despite the wealth of alternatives, monetary trading turns out to be almost the only way of using it (in the sense that any non-autarkic equilibrium is, on the aggregate, observationally equivalent to monetary trading) and, more importantly, the best way of using it. We now elaborate on the above short but vague answer to our questions. Each individual’s allocation is a function of his and other individuals’ past trading behavior, and each individual has access to information on other individuals’ past trading behavior. However, this information is not perfect. As a metaphor for the difficulties individuals often experiment in processing and coordinating on information about others’ past behavior (e.g. Camera et al. 2013), there is a center (e.g. an agent not involved in trading) who summarizes individuals’ past trading behavior in a binary variable and updates this variable.Footnote 3 We then impose that the center faces costs to update this variable. Costs to update individuals’ past trading information can arise for several reasons.Footnote 4 In general, it takes time and effort to do it; it may require setting up a communication device to collect information and a software to process it. In the latter case, time and effort may be required to write down the computer code and for the employees of the center to learn it. For these reasons, we assume that the center faces costs, both variable (e.g. dependent on the frequency by which changes need to be made) and fixed (e.g. setup costs) and that trading arrangements with more changes cost more.Footnote 5 A trading arrangement consists of an updating rule together with a form of individual trading behavior (a behavior rule). Monetary trading is a particular trading arrangement. But is it the best trading arrangement? Here best in the sense of maximizing, within a relatively broad class of trading arrangements,Footnote 6 a long-run (i.e. steady state) social welfare criterion in a decentralized way, namely, such that both the center and the individuals are happy to follow its rules. Incentives for the center are provided via payments from individuals that are conditional on whether or not individuals’ past trading information is updated as specified by a given trading arrangement. The presence of costs that differ across trading arrangements means that not all trading arrangements are necessarily incentive-feasible for the center because the center may be able to obtain the same payment while saving on costs. In fact, we show that any non-autarkic equilibrium is, in terms of aggregate quantities, observationally equivalent to monetary trading.Footnote 7 A sharper result is obtained when we focus on optimal equilibrium. We specify the optimum problem in such a way that the updating costs are, together with the average well-being of the individual traders, considered in the social welfare ranking.Footnote 8 Similarly to what has been described above, the presence of costs that differ across trading arrangements means that not all equilibrium trading arrangements are necessarily optimal because it may be possible to obtain the same average well-being of the individual traders while saving on costs. Indeed, we show that, provided that there exists a non-autarkic equilibrium ranked above autarky, monetary trading is the unique optimum equilibrium.Footnote 9 In conclusion, monetary trading is, in the sense of the above result, the optimal trading arrangement. To the extent that the setting we consider is useful as a foundation of monetary economics, this optimality of monetary trading helps to rationalize the monetary nature of real-world trade. We emphasize that what is crucial in our definition of monetary trading is a specific form of updating individuals’ information and a specific form of individual trading behavior. In particular, the way this information is recorded (e.g. whether it uses a specific object or whether it is done electronically) is immaterial: According to our result, monetary trading is the optimal equilibrium independently of how individuals’ past behavior is recorded. Thus, monetary trading persisted while the means of exchange changed. Moreover, monetary trading will continue to persist as long as costs to updating individuals’ past trading information remain in the form we have specified. An important implication of adding the center to the model for our optimality result is that, in any equilibrium, there are no changes to the record of each individual’s information off-the-equilibrium path. The addition of the center to the model can, therefore, be seen as a way of justifying this property: Changes to individuals’ information off-the-equilibrium path are never observed; hence, the center can discard them and save on fixed costs while obtaining the same payment.Footnote 10 As Rubinstein (1986) puts it, “social institutions, various types of organizations, and human abilities degenerate or are readily discarded if they are not used regularly”. One implication of the property that, in any equilibrium, there are no changes to the record of each individual’s information off-the-equilibrium path is that the non-monetary trading arrangement of Kandori (1992) and Kocherlakota and Wallace (1998) is not an equilibrium. Indeed, these are gift-giving, grim-trigger trading arrangements whose efficient outcome relies on the treat of autarky for anyone who fails to produce, i.e. on a transition off-the-equilibrium path.Footnote 11 Grim-trigger trading arrangements, and strategies more generally, are very prominent and make sense (i.e. are an equilibrium) in several settings, namely when individuals do not face difficulties in updating other individuals’ past trading information, e.g. among married couples or people in village economies.Footnote 12 They do not in the present setting in light of the above arguments.Footnote 13 Our results are consistent with some experimental evidence. Bigoni et al. (2014), Camera and Casari (2014) and Duffy and Puzzello (2014) observed that the most efficient outcome in their experiments occurred when subjects used monetary trading. In addition, in the benchmark treatment in Bigoni et al. (2014) and Camera and Casari (2014), there is evidence (see the discussion following Result 5 in the former paper and Result 4 in the latter) that subjects in some treatments tried to use a gift-giving, grim-trigger trading arrangement but were reluctant to update or, at least, act on information on other individuals’ past behavior when off-the-equilibrium path. While there is evidence that some producers chose not to produce after observing no production by some other subject, this did not occur frequently enough; in fact, those subjects who were frequent defectors (i.e. those who produced in less than \(20\%\) of the matches where they were the producer) were the ones who received the highest payoff (see Figure 4 in Bigoni et al. 2014; Figure 3 in Camera and Casari 2014). Thus, as in our result, difficulties in updating other individuals’ past trading information (leading, specifically, to “little” updating of information off-the-equilibrium path) seemed to justify the observed optimality of monetary trading in those experiments. There may be other (possibly milder or more appealing) conditions leading to an optimality result for monetary trading and also more complicated settings where monetary trading will not be optimal under reasonable conditions. Determining the exact scope of the optimality of monetary trading is beyond the goal of this paper; instead, the goal of this paper is simply to provide an economically meaningful optimality result for monetary trading in the classic framework of Kiyotaki and Wright (1989) that goes significantly beyond that of Kocherlakota and Wallace (1998). Kocherlakota and Wallace’s (1998) optimality result for monetary trading assumes that there is no information on other individuals’ past trading behavior (i.e. no memory) other than what is transmitted by a portable object (fiat money). In contrast, we have an imperfect but still sufficiently rich memory that allow us, in particular, to dispense with the presence of a portable object. There is no special role given to fiat money so that, in our monetary trading arrangement, an individual’s money balance is simply a label or a status level. As a result, Kocherlakota and Wallace’s (1998) no-commitment condition, requiring no change to an individual’s balance when he chooses not to produce, and which is key to their optimality result, is not imposed. Instead, our optimality result relies on the properties we impose on updating costs, namely, that less changes to individuals’ past trading information imply lower costs and that lower costs imply higher social welfare. To see our main result in perspective, note first that Kiyotaki and Wright (1989) specified a setting where monetary trading is an equilibrium. In their setting, monetary trading uses commodity money or fiat money, the latter then implying that individuals are willing to accept an intrinsically worthless object in exchange for valuable goods. Kocherlakota (1998) then showed that the important feature of money in monetary trading is to serve as a record-keeping device, i.e. memory. In this line of thought, Kocherlakota and Wallace (1998) then showed that monetary trading is optimal when individuals have no access to records of past behavior other than what is provided by fiat money. Our main result now shows that for monetary trading to be optimal, memory does not need to be nonexistent: If memory is incentive-feasible and designed optimally to reduce costs, then monetary trading is the optimal trading arrangement. Kocherlakota’s (1998) money-is-memory result leads researchers to look for essentiality results for monetary trading, i.e. for settings where some (optimal) allocations can be supported with money but not with memory (see Huggett and Krasa 1996; Araujo et al. 2012 for a recent result). This paper offers a different response to Kocherlakota’s (1998) result by presenting a setting where the incentive-feasible form of memory we consider is, at least for optimal equilibrium allocations, equivalent to money. In this sense, incentive-feasible memory is money and, in such setting, there is no reason why people should not use money. There are some qualifications for our loosely stated results, their details being presented in what follows. Section 2 presents the model, including the notion of monetary trading and the specific details regarding the center. Our main results appear in Sect. 3. Section 4 discusses some of our assumptions, and Sect. 5 presents additional concluding remarks and a discussion of more recent developments in the literature. The proofs of our results are in Appendix.",

The main difficulty is that choice is inherently stochastic, implying that preferences are not directly revealed. Structural modeling attempts to control for noise in the choice process, using explicit models of stochastic choice, and has a wide range of applications in empirical and behavioral analyses (for a “primer,” see Wilcox 2008). In order to apply models of stochastic choice, however, researchers need to specify the formal link between choice propensities and observables, as demonstrated by Axiom 4 in McFadden’s (1974) seminal characterization of conditional logit. This suggests that models of stochastic choice cannot be applied without making functional-form assumptions that are not directly testable (see, e.g., Keane 2010a; Nevo and Whinston 2010). The present paper seeks to contribute to this discussion by demonstrating that specific models of stochastic choice, several widely used logit models with linear links between propensities and observables, have axiomatic foundations in invariance assumptions and therefore do not require functional-form assumptions. These invariance assumptions involve solely observable attributes of options and are directly testable. Extensions to nonlinear link functions that are additively separable in observables (such as CES utilities) are equally possible. Formally, I consider a decision maker (DM) choosing from a finite set of options. Each option is characterized by an observable attribute vector (say, payoffs in different states of the world, or prices, quantities and qualities of products), and each option is chosen with positive probability. Within this framework, and given an essentialness condition requiring that DM is not indifferent with respect to any of the attributes, IIA and two simple invariance assumptions, clarifying when choice responds to changes in attributes and when not, uniquely characterize the conditional logit model of McFadden (1974). On the one hand, “\(\pi \)-invariance” requires choice to be invariant to translation of the attribute vector, and on the other, “\(\pi \)-relevance” requires that choice responds “uniformly” to attribute changes other than translation (comprising “presentation independence” and “context independence,” in a sense to be made precise). Empirical evidence seems to suggest that observed choice exhibits also a form of scaling invariance, however. After strengthening \(\pi \)-invariance and weakening \(\pi \)-relevance correspondingly, I obtain a multi-attribute generalization of the contextual utility model of Wilcox (2011). Four points appear to be worth noting about these results. (1) All invariance assumptions solely involve choice probabilities and option attributes, which both are considered observable in applied work (for a foundation, see Gul et al. 2014) and thus directly testable. Applied work may therefore first test, for a given dataset, if the choice postulates underlying logit are satisfied, or if the postulates are satisfied after a transformation of attributes suggested by McFadden (1974), and only then apply logit if adequate. (2) The widely used conditional logit model, which assumes a linear utility function linking attributes and log-propensities of choice, is provided with a foundation void of the functional-form assumptions it has been criticized for (for discussion, see Keane 2010b; Rust 2010; Blundell 2010; Heckman and Urzua 2010). (3) For any given choice profile satisfying the invariance assumptions, the utility function linking attributes and log-propensities of choice is shown to be unique up to linear transformation, which is a novel uniqueness result that may be helpful in applications. (4) Observed behavior tends to exhibit a form of invariance to rescaling attributes that conditional logit does not accommodate, suggesting that alternate models such as the generalized form of contextual utility may indeed be more adequate in applied work. To provide some context for the results, the general family of logit models is known to be characterized by positivity and IIA in the sense that choice probabilities then take the logit form for an unknown, potentially nonlinear utility function linking attributes and log-propensities of choice. My results provide testable conditions for this utility function to be uniquely linear in attributes or in pre-specified transformations thereof, as postulated by McFadden in his definition of conditional logit. The main condition is translation invariance, and interestingly, linear logit models are already known to predict choice probabilities that are invariant to translation of option attributes (or, utilities in some work). This paper’s contribution is therefore the result that translation invariance is sufficient if complemented by a condition clarifying when attribute changes are relevant, and the sufficiency finally removes the necessity to make functional-form assumptions. The need for the additional condition arises, because translation invariance yields a functional equation and its solution includes non-trivial integration constants. These integration constants resemble prior probabilities as observed in the generalized logit model of Matejka and McKay (2015) and may be interpreted to represent presentation effects in choice (i.e., effects due to ordering and positioning of options). In order to formally represent and capture such presentation effects, I extend the standard framework of stochastic choice by explicitly distinguishing “contexts” of decisions, i.e., different mappings between options and attributes. This generalized framework, in turn, is the main difference to existing analyses of stochastic choice when options have multiple attributes, such as Gul et al. (2014), and allows us to establish the necessity and sufficiency of simple invariance assumptions in characterizing logit models with specific (here, linear) utility functions.",2

Efficient production is achieved when firms maximize profits, and efficient distribution is achieved when consumers trade. Even an omnipotent planner cannot achieve a Pareto improvement. This result is strong but limited to complete markets: Time and uncertainty must be spanned by an exogenous set of financial assets. However, financial assets are endogenous in nature as they are created by institutions, such as firms and financial intermediaries. If markets are incomplete, or at least potentially so, efficient spanning becomes a precondition for efficient distribution. The present paper argues that financial intermediaries are the right agents to pursue efficient spanning. Many problems in the previous literature on incomplete markets are due to the inability of firms to provide the right span, or to align spanning with productive efficiency. We show how these problems can be overcome if the responsibility for spanning is delegated from firms to an intermediary. The intermediary can enlarge the asset span by providing additional assets. However, such financial innovation is not guaranteed to be socially desirable. There may be adverse welfare effects, and these can be particularly strong in economies with multiple future dates or commodities: Elul (1995) and Cass and Citanna (1998) show that enlarging the asset span may have any welfare effect, including a Pareto deterioration. The focus of the present paper is on two-date finance economies. In such economies the problem exists in a weaker form: Financial innovation cannot harm all consumers simultaneously, but its price effects may still make some consumers worse off. The positive aspect is that the set of assets whose introduction leads to a Pareto improvement is sizable. Therefore, an intermediary can always improve welfare by providing the right assets. This task would be trivial if the intermediary was very powerful. For example, if the intermediary could offer a complete set of contingent claims, we would be back in the Arrow and Debreu (1954) setting. We do not permit such ample contracts, but restrict the intermediary to one customized contract per consumer. This restriction places an upper bound on the dimension of the span. The fundamental problem of production in incomplete markets is that consumers disagree about the valuation of production plans outside the asset span. Except for lower-dimensional production sets that are fully contained in the asset span, which is a special case studied by Ekern and Wilson (1974) and Radner (1974), this generates conflicts between shareholders about the objective of the firm. Even though our intermediary is too weak for spanning in the Ekern–Wilson–Radner sense, its services are sufficient for alleviating conflicts of interest between shareholders. We demonstrate this point in an introductory example with two consumers and two firms. Even though the example is simple, it is not clear what objective either firm should pursue if there is no intermediary. We consider two traditional objectives, but in either case the resulting equilibrium concept exhibits undesirable behavior. The first objective is derived by Grossman and Hart (1979) from a criterion of unanimity with side payments among initial shareholders. This derivation is based on the assumption of competitive price perceptions, originally formulated by Gevers (1974) and Leland (1977): Each consumer believes that his personal valuation of a production plan agrees with its market value in the resulting equilibrium. The foundation of this assumption is questioned by Dierker and Dierker (2012), who present an example in which competitive price perceptions are everywhere incorrect. Our example seems to be much better suited for this criterion because competitive price perceptions are everywhere correct. Nevertheless, no Grossman–Hart equilibrium exists because the objective function of the firm exhibits a discontinuity when two firms choose identical production plans. Contrary to a similar problem in exchange economies discussed by Hart (1975), the nonexistence of Grossman–Hart equilibrium is robust to perturbations of consumer characteristics. At least the problem is not robust to perturbations of production technologies, which Magill and Quinzii (1991) prove with formal rigor. The second objective is derived by Drèze (1974) from the first-order conditions for constrained efficiency. However, the first-order conditions are necessary but not sufficient, owing to nonconvexity of the constrained feasible set. This leads to problems: Dierker et al (2002) present an example with a unique but constrained inefficient Drèze equilibrium. To attain constrained efficiency in their example, an equilibrium with transfers is required. In our example the problem is more pronounced: By construction, any constrained optimum must satisfy both distributional efficiency and productive efficiency. However, firms cannot attain both simultaneously because the asset span collapses at all production-efficient plans. The unique Drèze equilibrium is Pareto dominated by market outcomes for nearby production plans. The source of this problem is explained by Zierhut (2019): There is a discontinuity in the feasible correspondence of the constrained planner. As a consequence, the Pareto problem of the planner has no solution and the set of constrained efficient allocations is empty. In contrast to these difficulties, the present paper provides a positive result: All these problems disappear once the intermediary is introduced. The intermediary offers only contracts that are unanimously approved by its stakeholders. This idea is not entirely new: A criterion of unanimity with side payments is successfully used by Bejan (2020) for deriving an objective for a firm that may create new assets. The case of an intermediary who creates new assets is studied by Hara (2011), who highlights an important link between unanimity and welfare: If the intermediary proposes a sequence of span-enlarging contracts, and consumers must unanimously approve each proposal, then only Pareto improving financial innovation takes place. In either case, consumers must correctly anticipate the price effects of financial innovation, which is a demanding assumption. Our approach is different. We view unanimity as a cooperative solution concept. It can be explained by means of a thought experiment: Suppose consumers have the right to form coalitions, who can open their own members-only intermediary. Side payments at the present date can be used to reach agreement within a coalition. All these transactions take place after the market has closed and therefore no anticipations or perceptions of prices are necessary. Unanimity is reached if all consumers find it optimal to forgo their right. This solution concept is consistent with price-taking behavior and justifies that one single intermediary serves the entire economy. Since this criterion is not based on a benevolent planner but on market outcomes in incomplete markets, there is no a priori reason to believe that it meets any efficiency standard. In fact, previous results are negative: In an incomplete market setting without intermediary, Zierhut (2017) shows that constrained efficiency and unanimity are generically incompatible. The present paper shows that the intermediary makes a difference:  In the presence of an intermediary, constrained efficiency, Pareto efficiency and unanimity are equivalent (Theorem 1). This equivalence holds trivially when markets are complete but seems surprising when markets are incomplete. This result can be explained as follows: Even if markets were complete, all net transfers would be limited to a lower dimensional subspace. The dimension of this subspace is smaller than the number of consumers. It can therefore be spanned by the intermediary with only one contract per consumer. Since transfers outside this space are never demanded, such a span is sufficient for an efficient distribution, and marginal rates of substitution are equalized across consumers. As a consequence, all conflicts about the objective of the firm disappear and profit maximization with respect to any linear combination of marginal rates leads to efficient production. The resulting equilibria are Arrow–Debreu equivalent in spite of incomplete markets, and they exist generally:  Every economy has an equilibrium (Corollary 1). This result is unusually strong for an incomplete market economy without short sale constraints. With insufficient spanning, existence is at best a generic property because the budget correspondence is discontinuous when firms choose redundant production plans. However, these discontinuities are patched up by the spanning service of the intermediary. All these equilibria are Pareto efficient—hence, the first welfare theorem holds. This raises hopes that market completeness can be dropped as a condition in the second welfare theorem as well. This would complement recent findings of Koutsougeras and Ziros (2015), who are able to drop the condition of price-taking behavior: Pareto efficient allocations can be decentralized in a strategic market game, but in addition to lump-sum transfers, a regulator must impose a tax policy on bids and offers. However, market completeness turns out to be crucial:  The second welfare theorem fails: Some Pareto efficient allocations cannot be decentralized as an equilibrium with transfers when markets are incomplete. The problem can be summarized as follows: When markets are incomplete, Pareto efficient allocations are still price-supportable, but the set of feasible lump-sum transfers is not convex: For some wealth distributions, there exist Pareto optima but no equilibrium with transfers. This is contrary to the effect of nonconvex production sets documented by Guesnerie (1975): For some wealth distributions, there exist marginal cost pricing equilibria but no Pareto optimum. Both cases have in common that price-supportability is not sufficient for the desired result. The same limitations apply to the findings of Pan (1995), who shows that constrained efficient allocations are price-supportable. To conclude: The spanning service of an intermediary eliminates discontinuities but does not iron out nonconvexities. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the model and introduces our concept of intermediated financial market equilibrium. Section 3 explains the role of the intermediary in a simple example and shows how it eliminates the conflict between constrained efficiency and unanimity. Section 4 generalizes this result and derives the objective of the intermediary. Section 5 discusses the welfare theorems in incomplete markets and demonstrates the failure of the second theorem. Section 6 concludes.",1

Jean-Jacques Herings,Arkadi Predtetchinski,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Games with almost perfect information play a prominent role in the theory of dynamic games. In these games, at each stage, the players simultaneously choose actions, knowing the actions chosen at all previous stages. The payoff of each player is determined by the sequence of actions that have been chosen during the entire game. The notion of subgame perfect equilibrium and the weaker notion of subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium, where \(\epsilon >0\) is an error term, are two main solution concepts in these games. We continue the discussion of these games under the assumptions that the number of players is finite and the payoffs are bounded. A major body of the literature on games with almost perfect information examines the existence of subgame perfect equilibrium while assuming some kind of continuity of the payoff functions and compactness of the action spaces. Fudenberg and Levine (1983) showed that if the payoff functions are continuous and the action spaces are finite, then there exists a subgame perfect equilibrium. With infinite but compact action spaces, the existence question becomes very subtle, see, for instance, Harris et al. (1995), Mertens and Parthasarathy (2003), or Maitra and Sudderth (2007). For a detailed overview, we refer the reader to the recent survey by Jaśkiewicz and Nowak (2016). In this paper, we continue the investigation of the existence of subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibria in games with almost perfect information. We assume that the set of available actions is finite. The sequence of actions chosen in the game is referred to as a play. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a new condition, called individual upper semicontinuity, on the payoff functions. Individual upper semicontinuity is reminiscent of upper semicontinuity, but it uses a new notion of convergence on the set of plays for each player separately. Consider a player i. We say that a sequence of plays \((p_m)_{m\in \mathbb {N}}\) is i-convergent to a play p if (1) the length of the common history between the play \(p_m\) and p tends to infinity, and (2) for large \(m\in \mathbb {N}\), either \(p_m=p\) or the first deviation from p to \(p_m\) involves only player i. This notion of convergence of plays is stronger than the conventional notion, which would only require property (1). That is, each i-convergent sequence of plays is also convergent in the conventional sense, but not vice versa. Based on the notion of i-convergence, we say that the payoff function of player i is i-upper semicontinuous if for each sequence of plays \((p_m)_{m\in \mathbb {N}}\) that is i-convergent to a play p, player i weakly prefers the payoff along p compared to the payoff along \(p_m\) for large m. If player i’s payoff function is upper semicontinuous in the conventional sense, then it is also i-upper semicontinuous, but not vice versa. We analyze the topological properties of i-convergence and the properties of i-upper semicontinuous payoff functions in detail. Secondly, we show that if each player i’s payoff function is i-upper semicontinuous, then the game admits a subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium for every \(\epsilon >0\). Moreover, these strategy profiles are eventually pure, meaning that in each subgame randomization is only used at finitely many stages with probability 1. The proof of our existence result is constructive. The key idea is that if each player i’s payoff function is i-upper semicontinuous, then each play eventually reaches a history after which no player has an incentive to deviate from this play. This enables us to essentially cut the time horizon of the game at some finite stages and to apply backward induction on the earlier stages. This existence result generalizes the result of Purves and Sudderth (2011), who study perfect information games with upper semicontinuous payoff functions, in two directions. We reduce the topological restrictions on the payoff functions of the players, and we allow the players to move simultaneously.Footnote 1 Using the new concept of i-convergence, we can weaken the topological structure on the game while still maintaining sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of a subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium. In normal form games with totally ordered compact strategy spaces, Prokopovych and Yannelis (2017) show that it is possible to ensure the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium, while significantly relaxing the requirements relating to the upper semicontinuity and single crossing properties of the payoff functions. Alós-Ferrer and Ritzberger (2017) study the problem of finding minimal topological conditions needed to guarantee the existence of a subgame perfect equilibrium in an extensive form game with continuous payoff functions. Games with perfect information are an important special case of games with almost perfect information. Conditions related to semicontinuity of the payoff functions play an important role in several results for perfect information games. Not only do perfect information games where every player has an upper semicontinuous payoff function admit a subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium for every \(\epsilon >0\) (Purves and Sudderth 2011), so do perfect information games where every player has a lower semicontinuous payoff function as proven in Flesch et al. (2010). Moreover, these results were extended and unified in Flesch and Predtetchinski (2016). Questions related to semicontinuity are also studied in Le Roux and Pauly (2016) and Bruyère et al. (2017). A counterexample by Flesch et al. (2014) shows that perfect information games with finite action sets and Borel measurable payoff functions do not always have subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibria. This further illustrates the importance of topological properties of payoff functions in equilibrium analysis. For an overview on subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibria in perfect information games, we refer to Jaśkiewicz and Nowak (2016) and Bruyère (2017). We remark that it follows from a result of Secchi and Sudderth (2001) that if the players have upper semicontinuous payoff functions in a stochastic game with a countable state space, then the game admits a Nash \(\epsilon \)-equilibrium for every \(\epsilon >0\). The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Sect. 2, we describe the model and introduce the notions of i-convergence for plays and i-upper semicontinuity for payoff functions of player i. In Sect. 3, we present four illustrating examples. In Sect. 4, we prove the above-mentioned existence result for subgame perfect \(\epsilon \)-equilibria. In Sect. 5, we study the topology induced by i-convergence in detail. Finally, in Sect. 6, we provide some concluding remarks.",2

In that auction, two bidders simultaneously place bids on three identical objects. Moreover, the value of winning at most one object is zero, whereas the value of winning at least two objects is positive. For the first-price chopstick auction, Szentes and Rosenthal constructed a doubly symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium, henceforth referred to as the Szentes–Rosenthal equilibrium (SRE), in which bidders randomize according to a uniform distribution over the surface of a tetrahedron. The structure of the SRE is intriguing, in particular because it features a two-dimensional equilibrium support enclosing a three-dimensional best-response set. As Szentes and Rosenthal (2003b) noted, however, their solution has two drawbacks. First, the equilibrium strategy is surprisingly complicated. Second, given that the best-response set has a higher dimension than the equilibrium support, it seems unlikely that the SRE would be the result of a process that is aligned with some kind of better- or best-response dynamics. The present paper documents the existence of a new type of equilibrium for the chopstick auction. In the sequel, this equilibrium will be referred to as the self-similar equilibrium (SSE). To construct the SSE, we consider a variant of the chopstick auction, using an approach due to Sion and Wolfe (1957).Footnote 2 In that variant, the decision-making process of each bidder is stretched out over infinitely many stages. Moreover, at each stage, a choice is made between merely two alternatives for each object (hold vs. raise). Below, we will interpret, in an admittedly generous way, the resulting multistage game as a dynamic auction.Footnote 3 The equilibrium bid distribution of the SSE will then be characterized as the measure-theoretic image of a simple stationary strategy in the dynamic auction, where the stationarity property in the dynamic auction translates into a self-similarity property in the simultaneous game. 
Related literature “Fractal” solutions to noncooperative games of the Blotto type have been identified by Gross and Wagner (1950) and Kvasov (2007). However, neither of these papers considered the case of the chopstick auction.Footnote 4 Gross (1954) has constructed an example of a zero-sum game on the square with rational payoff functions and the Cantor distribution as the unique equilibrium.Footnote 5 Related is also the recent paper by Topolyan (2014). She uses the binary expansion of a uniformly distributed random bid to construct a continuum of equilibria in an all-pay team contest with additive contributions. Ok (2004) proved a fixed-point theorem for correspondences and applied it to rationalizability as well as to self-similar sets. The remainder of the present paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the set-up. In Sect. 3, the dynamic variant of the chopstick auction is introduced, and the SSE constructed. A proof of the equilibrium property is provided in Sect. 4.
