145,1,Review of World Economics,04 April 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0006-5,Exchange rates in the modern floating era: what do we really know?,April 2009,Kenneth Rogoff,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"One of the most stunning empirical puzzles in international macroeconomics is the incredible difficulty economists have in explaining exchange rate movements in the modern floating era. As Richard Meese and I first showed in a series of papers in the 1980s (Meese and Rogoff 1983a, b, 1988), macroeconomic fundamentals are curiously incapable of explaining major currency exchange rate fluctuations much less predicting them. Remarkably, this result has held up for two and a half decades despite hundreds of published academic studies. The problem is not simply one of explaining currency rates against the dollar, but applies to cross-currency rates for any two countries with relatively low inflation rates, relatively open capital markets, and where policymakers do not narrowly target the exchange rate. Indeed, if anything, the puzzle has broadened over the years to include more countries and exchange rates. At one time, emerging markets and developing countries had significantly higher inflation rates than did developed countries. The inflation gaps were typically so large that over sufficiently long periods they were reasonably reliable predictors of the direction of change of the exchange rate, if not necessarily the magnitude. (High-inflation currencies tend to depreciate, that is, become less valuable, as their purchasing power diminishes.) Today, with so many countries having achieved relatively low inflation rates, exchange rates for some emerging market currencies have become almost as difficult to explain as the major currency exchange rates. The familiar example of the US dollar exchange rate against the euro is emblematic of the problems. The euro began life at $1.18 in January of 1999, reached a low of $.83 in February 2002, and then reached a high of $1.60 in July 2008. Very recently, the euro has fallen somewhat despite the fact that the United States has been experiencing what appears to be its worst financial crisis since World War II. Although the two regions have had somewhat different economic cycles over the euro era, per capita income growth has by and large been fairly similar (1.7% for the euro area, versus 1.5% for the United States), while both regions have had low and stable inflation.",16
145,1,Review of World Economics,18 March 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0003-8,The effect of globalization on union bargaining and price-cost margins of firms,April 2009,Filip Abraham,Jozef Konings,Stijn Vanormelingen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In recent years, Europe has witnessed an accelerated process of economic integration: Within the European Union (EU) market barriers were removed, the euro was introduced in twelve member states and ten new member states joined the EU in 2004. On a global level, the EU is confronted with the rapid development of several Asian countries, the membership of China in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the emergence of China and India as new world powers. This trend towards market integration and globalization opens up European economies to international trade and foreign competition. According to Eurostat figures total trade in the EU as a percentage of GDP has gone up substantially compared to 1992 and especially so between the EU and the rest of the world. At the same time, the regional pattern of trade has been shifting. In 1992 only 4% of total extra-EU imports came from China. By 2003 the Chinese market share had increased to 10%. Likewise, the share of the new member states of Central and Eastern Europe (CEEC) in extra EU-15 imports attained 16% in 2003. Such figures imply that trade flows from low wage regions have gained substantial ground in a relatively short period of time. In recent years, many papers have been written on the role globalization has had on wage and employment outcomes. Most papers, however, find only limited effects of international trade on wages but larger effects on employment, especially for European labor markets. This is most likely due to the more rigid nature of wages and wage setting institutions in Europe.Footnote 1 This wage setting process typically depends on factors such as the monetary policy regime, the integration of product markets, the existence of collective agreements and the bargaining power of unions and employers. Globalization affects these factors through various channels. As Rodrik (1997) points out, globalization weakens the bargaining position of trade unions as it increases the substitutability of employees. Furthermore, globalization is likely to put downward pressure on price-cost margins, which limits the scope of rent sharing with trade unions. Such interactions between product and labor markets are emphasized in various macro models that show how more competitive pricing in the product market has beneficial effects, such as lower unemployment rates, on labor market outcomes (e.g., Blanchard and Giavazzi 2003). This paper adds to this literature in various ways. First, we simultaneously estimate price-cost margins and union bargaining power. Most papers study imperfections in product and labor markets separately.Footnote 2 However, ignoring labor market imperfections when measuring competitiveness in the product market, leads to product market power being underestimated. We follow a production function approach as in Hall (1988) and extended by Crépon et al. (2007) to estimate price-cost margins and bargaining power. We apply the Olley and Pakes (1996) method to deal with the endogeneity of productivity shocks. Second, we analyze how price setting and bargaining power is affected by globalization, for which we use several measures including import penetration, outsourcing and foreign direct investment. Third, we use Belgium firm level data in our analysis. This has a number of advantages. Belgium is characterized by strong labor unions and rigid product markets. It therefore provides an interesting benchmark to test how international integration affects a small regulated economy in the core of the EU. Moreover the firm level data available are unusually rich. Our data set includes all firms between 1996 and 2004 that have to submit by Belgian law full or abbreviated company accounts. In light of the recent insights of Melitz (2003) and others on the role of firm heterogeneity in international trade it seems natural to use micro data to model the effects of international competition. Finally, Belgium is characterized by a substantial increase in its volume of trade. The value of trade in Belgium has increased with almost 70% during the last decade, while the value of output rose only with 40%. As a consequence most manufacturing sectors experienced a rising import penetration between 1997 and 2004. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we develop a stylized theoretical framework that captures the effects of international competition on price-cost margins and labor market outcomes. Sect. 3 introduces the model that we seek to estimate and discusses the estimation strategy. Sect. 4 discusses the results and Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",61

Trade theories disagree about the way trade specialization evolves with per capita income; indeed, along with models suggesting that countries’ specialization should increase over the development path (Krugman 1987), there are models indicating that countries’ economic development is associated with a low degree of specialization (Stockey 1988), and more general frameworks (Peretto 2003) showing that both cases could happen, creating international market integration. Nor do empirical works help to clarify alternative trade-based explanations of the link between specialization and economic development. In fact, the available evidence on this issue provides different answers depending on the data set, on the measure of specialization, and on the methodological approach employed. The empirical literature on specialization patterns analyses changes in countries’ overall degree of specialization using both absolute and relative measures of specialization (e.g. Gini, Herfindahl, and Balassa indices). Such measures are inherently static, therefore, in order to analyse issues related to changes in countries’ overall degree of specialization, the evolution of these distribution indices over time has to be analysed. As data sources rarely go back to the pre-1970s period, it may be difficult to get robust evidence on long run patterns of specialization given the relatively short time span available. To date, there have not been many proponents of empirical solutions to this question: Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2003), Imbs and Wacziarg (2003), and Koren and Tenreyro (2007) are the few exceptions. The Imbs and Wacziarg (2003) research is the most relevant to this analysis, as this paper investigates the link between overall specialization and growth analysing the relationship between a meaningful synthetic indicator of overall specialization and the level of per capita income. In this paper sectoral diversification evolving along the development path is investigated inside a semiparametric framework using detailed manufacturing trade export data (2- and 4-digit SITC) over the period 1985–2001. The preference for nonparametric techniques in recent empirical papers reflects the fact that nonparametric methods allow empirical researchers to explore the issues related to the shape and the statistical significance of the relationship between specialization and income without making any explicit or implicit assumptions about that relationship. With a sample covering a time span of 17 years, the possibility of drawing any long-run conclusions about the relationship between specialization and the level of development relies on considering all per capita income–specialization pairs as the values of a hypothetical country at different stages of development. A crucial point in analysing the relationship between specialization patterns and economic development is the role of country-specific effects, as countries may differ significantly in aspects such as size, geography, and institutional and political features; as a consequence, a fixed effects estimator in the context of generalized additive models (GAM) is used to account for these differences. Moreover, to check robustness, the sensitivity of the main result is tested against (i) alternative measures of export specialization, (ii) different levels of disaggregation within manufacturing exports, and (iii) different smoothing parameters of the nonparametric term associated with per capita income. After controlling for cross-country heterogeneity, there is robust evidence that countries monotonically diversify with the level of development. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing empirical literature; Sect. 3 presents the data set, the various measures of specialization, and the empirical methodology employed; Sect. 4 provides the empirical evidence on specialization dynamics and, finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",52

145,1,Review of World Economics,11 March 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0002-9,Inward FDI and demand for skills in manufacturing firms in Sweden,April 2009,Roger Bandick,Pär Hansson,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The employment share of skilled labor, i.e., employees with a post-secondary education, has grown continuously in Sweden over the last few decades. The increasing skill share in the 1990s might be explained by a larger supply of skilled labor owing to a heavy expansion of higher education in Sweden. Yet it seems that factors on the demand side have dominated since at the same time we observe rising relative wages of skilled labor.Footnote 1 In particular, two factors on the demand side have been emphasized in the literature, namely skilled-biased technological change and increased import competition from low-wage countries, and numerous studies on different countries have tried to quantify the importance of these factors.Footnote 2
 Another conceivable channel through which the increased internationalization may affect the relative demand for skills is foreign direct investment (FDI). Swedish headquartered multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been significant employers in Swedish manufacturing for a long period of time. Hansson (2005) examines the impact of their localization behavior (outward FDI) on relative labor demand in their Swedish parents.Footnote 3 He finds increased employment in affiliates in low-wage countries to be positively related to skill upgrading in the Swedish parents. This indicates that within Swedish MNEs, less-skilled activities are transferred to low-wage countries. Changes in employment in affiliates in other high-wage countries are, on the other hand, unrelated to parent skill upgrading. However, increased inward FDI to Sweden is a characteristic feature of the 1990s, resulting in rapidly growing foreign ownership.Footnote 4 Does more inward FDI explain the increased relative demand for skilled labor in Sweden in the 1990s? The theory of MNEs assumes that MNEs possess firm-specific assets, such as technological assets, that give them an advantage relative to indigenous firms. This is necessary to compensate for the disadvantages they face in foreign countries and thus, to be able to establish themselves abroad (Dunning 1977). It is often believed that MNEs are important conveyers of technology internationally since one motive for FDI is to profit from utilizing firm-specific technology intensive assets in many countries. By transferring technology abroad, MNEs will affect technological change in their host countries. Consequently, if inward FDI has an impact on technological change, and if it is skill-biased, increased foreign ownership might have a positive influence on host country relative demand for skilled labor. Parallel trends in Sweden in the 1990s between rising shares of skilled labor, a growing wage differential between skilled and less-skilled labor, and increased inward FDI suggest that the larger presence of foreign affiliates is possibly an explanation for skill upgrading and rising inequality. Another motive for FDI is technology sourcing. Technological capabilities of indigenous firms give rise to country-specific advantages, which attract foreign firms. If technology sourcing causes FDI, a reasonable assumption is that the acquired domestic firms keep the same skill mix after takeover, which means that the relative demand for skills is unaffected by inward FDI. The increased foreign ownership has aroused some anxiety in the Swedish public debate. Jonung (2002) asserts that acquisitions of Swedish MNEs by foreign firms, where the headquarters move abroad, entail less employment of skilled labor in Sweden. He argues that when the headquarters leave, other functions using qualified employees will also disappear. Activities such as research and development (R&D) and advanced production will gradually be removed from Sweden. Increased inward FDI is then negatively related to skill upgrading. Lower relative demand for skilled labor in the presence of more foreign-owned firms is also consistent with the recent MNE models where foreign affiliates are less skill-intensive than their parents. The reason is that skill-intensive activities, such as headquarter service and R&D, are assumed to be located in the parent country. However, in these models, the implications of greater MNE activities on skill upgrading and wage inequality are ambiguous (Markusen and Venables 1997). Evidently, it may be argued that inward FDI has various, and sometimes opposite, effects on relative demand for skilled labor, which highlight the need for empirical work. The purpose of the paper is to examine the impact of growing inward FDI and rising foreign-affiliate presence on skill upgrading and increased wage inequality in Swedish manufacturing from 1993 to 2002. The paper is related to, Feenstra and Hanson (1997), Blonigen and Slaughter (2001) and Taylor and Driffield (2005) and we contrast our findings to theirs.Footnote 5 Likewise, as in all these studies, we follow the approach by Berman et al. (1994) and estimate a relative labor demand function controlling for technological change. Unlike these studies, we have access to firm-level data, which is advantageous, since the channels discussed above, through which inward FDI may affect relative demand for skills, should mainly appear at the firm level. Feenstra and Hanson (1997) and Blonigen and Slaughter (2001) are studies at the industry level that capture such direct effects at the firm level, as well as indirect effects through technology and wage spillovers from foreign-owned firms to indigenous firms within the same industry. Moreover, Taylor and Driffield (2005) provide an industry-level analysis, but they entirely focus on the indirect effects of the presence of foreign-owned firms on domestic firms. An improvement as compared to the previous literature estimating changes in relative demand for skilled labor is that we are able to more appropriately take changes in relative wages between skilled and less-skilled labor into account. Access to a new, large data set on individual wages makes it possible to generate relative wages at the industry level over the period studied. To preview our result, there seem to be no grounds for the concerns that foreign-owned firms move out skill-intensive activities from Sweden. If anything, the relative demand for skilled labor appears to increase in non-MNEs that become foreign-owned. In addition, we find that the larger presence of foreign MNEs in an industry has a positive effect on the relative demand for skilled labor in Swedish MNEs within the same industry, while it has no effect on non-MNEs. Moreover, the elasticity of substitution between skilled and less-skilled labor is lower in MNEs than in non-MNEs. Domestic firms taken over by foreign firms are not randomly acquired, rather their characteristics differ systematically from non-acquired firms. If these characteristics also influence post-acquisition relative demand and are not controlled for, biased estimates of the effects of foreign ownership on relative demand for skills will arise. One method for dealing with likely endogenity problems is to combine propensity score matching with difference-in-difference estimation.Footnote 6 Therefore, as a complement to our standard labor demand analysis we also apply such an approach, and when it comes to the post-acquisition relative labor demand effects we arrive at similar results. Recently, two studies have been published that use panel data at the disaggregated level to examine the impact of foreign ownership on the relative employment of skilled labor. Almeida (2007) carries out an analysis on Portuguese firms during the 1990s and she finds no significant changes in the average education in the workforce following foreign acquisitions. Huttunen (2007) investigates Finnish manufacturing establishments 1988–2001 and her results are mixed. While a regression model using the whole data shows that foreign acquisitions have no effect on the share of highly educated workers in the plant’s employment, matching and regression analysis on the matched sample indicates that there is a small decrease in the share of highly educated workers after acquisitions. The outline of the paper is the following. In Sect. 2.1, we present our data and how foreign ownership and skill intensities in MNEs (Swedish and foreign-owned) and non-MNEs have developed over the period studied. Among Swedish social scientists there have been discussions about whether the growing employment of skilled labor is due to factors on the supply or the demand side. In Sect. 2.2, we contribute to that debate by showing some new estimates on the trend in relative wages between skilled and less-skilled labor in Swedish manufacturing from 1993 to 2002, which we then plot against the employment share of skilled labor. From this analysis we conclude that factors on the demand side dominate, and in Sect. 3, we examine the effects of increased foreign ownership on relative demand for skills in Swedish manufacturing. In Sect. 3.1 we set out a framework for studying relative labor demand. Section 3.2 presents some empirical results from analyzing the impact of foreign ownership on relative demand for skilled labor. Section 3.3 contains a brief overview of propensity score matching and difference-in-difference estimation, and in Sect. 3.4, we report difference-in-difference matching results on post-acquisition effects on the relative demand for skills. Section 4 summarizes and concludes.",14

The products were obtained from virtually all over the world, with official statistics listing 236 supplying countries and territories. Since most products were imported from more than one supplier, there were, in total, 206,727 product-country pairs (or “varieties”). Interestingly, this number has been relatively stable over time; for other years, numbers of similar magnitude are observed. For instance, there were 202,604 trade pairs in 2003 (with imports of 9,976 products from 236 countries) and 200,706 trade pairs in 2005 (with imports of 9,697 products from 239 countries). In combination with other evidence on the (short-run) persistence in international trade (e.g., the empirical success of the gravity model of trade, the role of networks in trade), the small variation in the total number of product-level trade relationships may be just another indication that trade patterns are relatively stable over time.Footnote 1
 Contrary to this belief, however, Besedeš and Prusa (2006a, b) have recently argued in a series of papers that trade relationships are often very short-lived. Examining the duration of U.S. imports, they find that the U.S. pattern of foreign sourcing is surprisingly dynamic; the median duration of importing a product from a foreign supplier in their sample is just 1 year. As a result, the stability of aggregate trade patterns may mask considerable turnover at the product level, with a large fraction of suppliers entering and exiting the market each year. Data for German import trade generally confirm Besedeš and Prusa’s (2006a) findings. Of the 206,727 product-country pairs in 2004, 49,621 pairs (about 24%) were non-existent a year earlier, while 49,928 pairs (about 24%) died in the following year; a subset of 27,824 pair-wise trade relationships (about 13%) was observed in 2004 (i.e., in 1 year) only. However, there is also considerable heterogeneity across products and countries. Most notably, some products were repeatedly imported from a particular country over a relatively long period of time; about one-tenth of all trade relationships in 2004 have been in existence for at least a decade. This paper examines the duration of trade relationships in more detail. In particular, I aim to identify relationship-specific characteristics that help to explain the observed differences in the duration of trade. Besedeš and Prusa (2006b) find, based on a matching model, that survival rates are higher for differentiated products than for homogeneous products; they also show that duration increases with initial trade size. In this paper, I take a much broader view. In particular, I ask: Do country characteristics, such as proximity or common language, matter for survival? Are there any product characteristics, such as product sophistication, that affect the duration of trade? And to what extent do market characteristics play a role, such as market entry of a foreign competitor? To analyze these questions, I examine a new data set of German import trade from 1995 to 2005. The data set comprises trade values and quantities at the 8-digit Combined Nomenclature (CN) level which is the most detailed product classification to designate goods and merchandise in European Union (EU) trade statistics; the CN-8 level contains about 13,000 product codes. Based on this data, I use various techniques, including a Cox hazard model, to explore the survival time of importing a product from a particular country. I find that the duration of a trade relationship is indeed strongly and significantly associated with characteristics of the supplier country, specific features of the imported product, as well as the structure of the (import) market. Specifically, I find that country pair-specific features that are typically identified to increase bilateral trade in gravity models are also beneficial for the duration of trade. Further, trade relationships tend to last longer for differentiated products and for products with a low elasticity of substitution. Finally, large transaction values as well as German exports of a particular product (i.e., two-way trade) increase the probability of survival. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 is the main part of the paper, presenting the empirical results. Section 5 provides a short conclusion.",103

Mathä,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Much of the recent empirical evidence on the law of one price (LOP) and why it fails to hold is based on micro price studies. A very popular data set has proven to be the data set collected by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU),Footnote 1 which assembles individual prices in different major cities in the world for their worldwide cost of living index (Crucini and Shintani 2008; Rogers 2007; Parsley and Wei 2003). A large extent of the covered prices in the EIU survey consists of supermarket prices. Yet another very popular product has proved to be the McDonald’s Big Mac, which has for example been studied by Cumby (1996), Pakko and Pollard (1996), Lutz (2001) and Parsley and Wei (2007, 2008). Both data sets share one common feature in that they refer to frequently bought and low priced consumer goods. For low priced consumer goods one potential reason why the law of one price fails to hold may be linked to pricing at pricing points in different currencies. Prices set in different currencies are likely to differ as psychological or fractional pricing points differ in different currencies. In the case of a common currency, these pricing points are theoretically identical. Hence, we would a priori expect to observe more identical prices. This may particularly be the case if the cost and demand conditions are not too dissimilar in the compared locations, and if arbitrage is not impeded. Using individual supermarket prices Friberg and Mathä (2004) show that observing identical prices is indeed linked to such issues. The probability is larger if prices are both psychological and set in a common currency. However, no effect is found for the size of price deviations from the law of one price. This issue has hitherto not received much attention, and I believe that it merits further enquiry. Firstly, consumer prices are very frequently set such that they appear attractive; they are set at pricing thresholds or pricing points. Secondly, a large share of prices collected by national statistical institutes consists of low priced consumer products. Thirdly, rounding effects have recently also been found to be important during the euro cash changeover. Prices of small price items, and in particular restaurant and catering services, were allegedly raised by relatively large percentage points (e.g. Hobijn et al. 2006). In this respect, this paper addresses to what extent pricing at psychological and fractional pricing points in a common currency increases the probability of observing identical prices and decreases the size of deviations from the law of one price. In addition, does the probability of observing different prices and their size of deviation depend on transaction costs? For that purpose, I will use individual McDonald’s prices in four different countries that I collected around the euro cash changeover period. Prices of McDonald’s products may serve as a good case in point, as the products in their final (ready to consume form) are essentially non-tradable. Moreover, they can be characterised as low priced and highly standardised consumer products with a quasi-identical production technology (see also Parsley and Wei (2007)). Section 2 discusses the data source. Section 3 presents some descriptive statistics on price developments during the euro cash changeover period. Section 4 presents the empirical implementation and analysis, while Section 5 concludes.",1
145,2,Review of World Economics,22 April 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0010-9,On trade creation and regional trade agreements: does depth matter?,July 2009,Vincent Vicard,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"At the end of 2005, 158 regional trade agreements (RTAs) were in force worldwide, which makes preferential trade liberalization a prominent feature of the international trading system today. The scope and coverage of these agreements nevertheless greatly differ from one to the other, in terms of trade flows, membership as well as population involved. The canonical taxonomy of RTAs, initially introduced by Balassa (1961), considers regionalism as a gradual process towards economic union, through free trade area, customs union (CU) and common market (CM). The implicit assumption behind is that more integrated arrangements provide for deeper trade integration, because each additional step of regional integration would reduce further intra-regional trade costs.Footnote 1 However, from a theoretical point of view, the “form/depth” of regional integration is not systematically related to the level of trade costs. If preferential arrangements (PAs) can be considered as free trade areas whose scope and coverage are less complete, a CU or a CM cannot be simply understood as further steps of economic integration. Devices of integration solely differ according to the form of trade integration: while entering a CU involves to give up sovereignty on trade policy to implement a common external tariff, free trade agreements (FTAs) allow member countries to keep the ability to set their tariffs vis-à-vis other partners, thanks to the use of rules of origin. Both nevertheless allow for broad preferential regimes, using different instruments of trade policy.Footnote 2 The degree of trade integration is thus likely to vary according to RTAs, but not necessarily in relation with their form or the depth of political integration they entail. This paper investigates empirically whether the form/depth of RTAs determines the extent of trade creation among members. Empirical evidence of any larger effect of deeper RTAs on the volume of regional trade is missing. Few papers even distinguish between different categories of RTAs. Two exceptions are Ghosh and Yamarik (2004b) and Kandogan (2008), who find puzzling results concerning the effect of economic integration on intra-regional trade: coefficients on CU and CM membership dummies are found to be negative and significant in several specifications. However, it is worth noting that they do not control for multilateral resistance terms and, more importantly, for self-selection into RTAs. Indeed, papers on the determinants of RTAs suggest a “market for regionalism” view of regional trade integration, where countries choose their partners (Baier and Bergstrand 2004b) and the form of the RTA (Vicard 2008) according to economic and political determinants. Ex post estimations of the effect of RTAs on trade are thus likely to suffer from a selection bias, because pairs of countries which have more to gain from regional integration (or more to loose from no-agreement) are more likely to create a RTA and to choose the appropriate form of regional integration. In this paper, I estimate a theoretically motivated gravity equation, in which the definition of RTAs is refined by introducing a distinction between different categories of RTAs according to their form/depth. Self-selection is specifically accounted for by using panel data with country-pair and country-and-time fixed effects or differenced panel with country-and-time fixed effects. Three important conclusions emerge from empirical results. First, unobservable heterogeneity affects differently the estimates of the treatment effect of different kinds of RTAs, i.e. different country pairs choose to create different kinds of RTAs. Second, the analysis conducted in this paper confirms that all RTAs providing trade preferences to their members have a significant positive effect on bilateral trade. Third, this average treatment effect does nevertheless not differ statistically according to the depth/form of integration. Once self-selection into agreements is controlled for, creating a free trade area, a CU or a CM has the same effect on intra-regional trade. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the extent of preferential trade in the world. Section 3 specifies a theoretically grounded gravity equation with panel data. Results are presented in Sect. 4 and some robustness analysis in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.",48

In his comprehensive survey, Baldwin finds that the effect is likely to lie “somewhere between 5 and 15%, with 9% being the best estimate” (Baldwin 2006: 1). This paper considers whether small countries gained relatively more from the introduction of the euro. Our hypothesis is based on two assumptions: (i) The size of the domestic market is an important determinant of competitiveness. (ii) The introduction of the euro has lead to a reduction in trade costs. In that case it may be argued that the euro has increased the size of the market that euro area countries can reach with relative ease. This increase is more significant for small countries, whose domestic market is small. As a consequence, the increase in competitiveness is relatively larger for small countries, which are thus favoured by the euro. A theoretical model, formalising this argument, is derived by Casella (1996), who considers the distribution of the gains from enlarging a trade block among its member states in a new-trade theory model with increasing returns and monopolistic competition. As we argue more in detail below, the implications of this model do also apply to the introduction of a single currency. Moreover, the introduction of the euro offers a particularly valuable source for testing for a small country bonus with respect to the gains in trade from a market expansion. First, the sample of euro area countries is relatively large and there are considerable differences in country size. Second, the ‘market expansion’ through the euro was sizeable. Third, the ‘market expansion’ is not only larger for small countries in relative terms (as required theoretically) but also in absolute terms. Fourth, there is high quality data available for trade of the euro area countries, both at the aggregate and disaggregated level. We use a panel data approach, considering a relative gravity equation where the dependent variable is the ratio of the large to the small country’s exports to other euro area countries over the period 1994–2005. The model is estimated using both aggregate trade and disaggregated trade data at the SITC1, SITC2, and SITC3 level. Overall, our results are supportive to the theoretical predictions by Casella (1996). At the industry level, in a majority of the SITC groups considered, we find that small countries gained more on average. This is confirmed if we aggregate the industry-specific results and also if we estimate the model for aggregate exports. On average over all models, we find that the euro has led to an improvement of the small euro area countries’ export performance by some 3–9%. Moreover, there is also evidence that the relative gains of the small countries are larger, the larger the size difference to the large country. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the theoretical background and sets up the empirical model. Section 3 presents the estimation results. Section 4 summarises the results and concludes.",3

Tai,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The link between migration and trade has been well established by recent literature. An immigrant can act as an intermediary for information, preferences and networks. These trade-impacting migration mechanismsFootnote 1 are generally presented to explain empirical findings. Yet the mechanisms themselves have not yet been identified empirically. This paper addresses the question of how migration affects trade and sheds some light on the mechanisms of preferences and costs. It is an empirical assessment underpinned by a model of firm heterogeneity in a multisector economy developed by Chaney (2008). The impact of migration can be studied in greater detail by considering the role of market structure with sector asymmetry throughout and each sector’s level of product variety differentiation. Preferences and cost effects are then analyzed. The literature endeavors to identify these mechanisms by treating a country’s exports and imports differently. Basically, it is posited that the network effect impacts on both exports and imports by lowering costs, and that the preference effect has an impact solely on imports due to immigrant consumption. This would imply that migration has a greater effect on imports. However, Sect. 2 shows that Gould (1994) and Girma and Yu (2002) find migration has a greater effect on exports while Head and Ries (1998) and Wagner et al. (2002) find that migration has a greater impact on imports. Whereas the first set of papers studies a small sample made up largely of rich trade partners, the second set considers all the partners. This could suggest that, when the entire spectrum of traded products is considered, migration has a greater impact on imports. The main contribution of this paper is to consider market characteristics by level of product differentiation. In the monopolistic competition framework adopted, the market can reflect all sorts of situations from monopoly to perfect competition with trade barrier effects differentiated. Any estimation of the migration effect is distorted if these differences are overlooked. For instance, take a country that exports highly differentiated products and imports homogeneous ones. Let us say this country exports watches and imports cocoa. So if immigration impacts more on imports than exports, the direct conclusion of a stronger effect of immigrants’ preferences in the host country could be inaccurate. Maybe, in this case, the impact on imports is greater solely because they are structurally made up of products more likely to be affected by migration. My findings show that the product composition explains the different immigration effects. Another contribution is the use of the migratory mirror flow, i.e. data on Swiss abroad. This kind of data is not readily available, but provides a definitive verification of migration effects. For example, consider a migration effect on Swiss imports introduced by foreigners in Switzerland. The corresponding effect should be found for Swiss people abroad on Swiss exports. In other words, if we assume that immigrants always raise preferences for the home country, Swiss emigrants should increase Switzerland’s exports more than its imports. It is common practice to study migration and trade focusing on just one country to prevent measurement errors. Although the data used are reliable (bearing in mind that each country counts immigrants in its own way), two distortions are created. First, the composition of exports and imports can be different. Rich countries specialize in the production of more highly differentiated goods, so their exports are more concentrated in differentiated products than their imports. Conversely, the countries studied in the literature are those that attract migration because of their high level of development. This is the second distortion, since the opposite flow of nationals abroad is overlooked. For example, the studies consider solely immigrants in the United States or the United Kingdom but not the opposite flow of American and British people abroad. These two distortions converge to create a bias in the comparison of the impact of migration on exports (of differentiated products) with the impact of immigrants on imports (of homogeneous products). My findings show that market structure has to be considered before any comparison can be made. This paper focuses on Switzerland, using data from France to make some checks on endogeneity. Switzerland, to my knowledge, has never been studied for this kind of research. This is quite surprising given the high proportion of foreigners and its geographical position in the heart of Europe. Trade–migration effects have been studied for the United States (Gould 1994; Dunlevy and Hutchinson 1999), Canada (Head and Ries 1998; Wagner et al. 2002), and the United Kingdom (Girma and Yu 2002). Switzerland has a smaller surface area and greater population density than the United States and Canada (30 inhab/km2 for the United States, 3 inhab/km2 for Canada and 177 inhab/km2 for SwitzerlandFootnote 2), so one would expect to find more social interaction in the country boosting the business network and cultural transmission. An immigrant in Geneva is more likely to interact with another in Zurich than an immigrant in New York with another in Texas. These proportional distances are roughly equivalent for the two countries relatively speaking given their sizes, but correspond in absolute terms to about 290 and 2,290 km, respectively. However, like Switzerland, the United Kingdom also has a high population density. Yet the greater mobility of European Union nationalsFootnote 3 could well distort migration statistics on EU nationals in the United Kingdom. This is not the case for Switzerland thus far (and definitely not in the period studied from 1995 to 2000). The repercussions of migration have become an issue with the steady increase in migration in recent decades. In Switzerland, the number of foreigners has been on the rise since the Second World War, despite a slight adjustment following the 1973 oil crisis. Switzerland wanted to attract immigrants in the early years following WWII, the situation changed after the 1960s when the country started to adopt more restrictive immigration policies.Footnote 4 Despite migration barriers, the foreign population has grown more sharply than the Swiss population to the astonishing level of 20% of the country’s population in recent years. New immigrants accounted for 62% of the net population increase from 1980 to 2000. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 looks at the relevant empirical literature. Section 3 presents the theoretical model and specification and Sect. 4 details the data. Section 5 reports on the findings and Sect. 6 presents the conclusion.",15
145,2,Review of World Economics,20 June 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0014-5,Trade policy and specialization in developing countries,July 2009,Christian Volpe Martincus,Antoni Estevadeordal,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Trade barriers have been declining around the world over the last five decades. Countries reduced their tariffs unilaterally as well as concertedly in the framework of regional integration agreements. As a result, trade flows among economies have substantially grown. They have increased by a factor of 89 between 1953 and 2003. According the economic theory, either due to comparative advantage or agglomeration economies, this should have had a significant impact on the countries’ specialization patterns. Has the existing empirical evidence confirmed this theoretical prediction? Several studies present descriptive evidence on the evolution of specialization indicators over periods of declining trade barriers.Footnote 1 This evidence mostly concerns developed countries. However, to our knowledge, there is no direct robust econometric evidence on the effect of trade policy on the overall degree of developing countries’ specialization. This paper aims at filling this gap in the literature. Specialization is worth being studied because it affects the level of welfare, the speed of economic growth, and the degree of macroeconomic convergence across economies.Footnote 2
 We focus on ten Latin American countries which are members of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) over the period 1985–1998. These countries are natural case studies. The reason is twofold. First, in the last two decades, they implemented broad and comprehensive trade liberalization programs starting from relatively high tariff protection levels. More specifically, these countries pursued unilateral plans and also engaged in regional integration initiatives. Thus, this set of nations provides a constellation of trade reforms, which is rich enough to assess their repercussions. Second, some of these economies exhibit substantial changes in their specialization degrees over the aforementioned period. On average, production specialization seems to be increasing and manufacturing structures seem to be becoming increasingly different. We can therefore analyze to what extent general and preferential trade liberalizations have contributed to shape the evolving specialization patterns in the region. We estimate measures of overall specialization from sectoral value added to describe the countries’ specialization level, both absolute and relative, and we also compute average most favored nation (MFN) and preferential tariffs, which allow us to explicitly characterize the countries’ trade policies. Our econometric results suggest that reducing own MFN tariffs is associated with increasing production specialization. Furthermore, we find that bilateral preferential trade liberalization and differences in the degree of unilateral openness have resulted in increased dissimilarities in manufacturing production structures across countries. These results are robust to the specialization measure being used, the correction for groupwise heteroscedasticity, cross-sectional correlation, serial correlation and endogeneity biases, and the inclusion of indicators to account for the real exchange misalignment prevailing in the region during the period under examination. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data set. Section 3 derives the estimation equation and addresses relevant econometric issues. Section 4 outlines some basic stylized facts about the trade policy reforms introduced in Latin American countries since the mid-1980s. Section 5 presents some descriptive evidence on the patterns of manufacturing production specialization and their evolution over the sample period and reports our main findings. Section 6 concludes.",7

Under Doha, agricultural negotiations are organized under three pillars—market access, domestic support and export subsidies—with the first pillar being the most sensitive. The expectations of developing country farmers are high since cutting tariffs could result in a surge in agricultural exports to developed markets and boost prices on world markets. African exporters have thus initially pushed hard for further commitments from developed countries on tariffs, considering this to be a prerequisite for industrial liberalization. However, the interests of developing countries in the debate on agricultural market access liberalization are difficult to identify, as the producers exporting from these countries already benefit from preferential access to developed markets. Almost all agricultural products from developing countries are entitled to enter Triad markets (Japan, United States (USA), European Union (EU)) under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), while Least Developed Countries (LDCs) already enjoy quasi-duty free access to European and Canadian agricultural markets on all but a limited number of products.Footnote 1 In this regard, African exporters are particularly favored by the trade policies of developed country governments. Not only do they benefit from non-discriminatory preferential schemes put in place in favor of developing countries and LDCs,Footnote 2 but they also enjoy discriminatory schemes such as the African Growth Opportunity ActFootnote 3 and the Yaoundé/Lomé/Cotonou conventionsFootnote 4 proposed respectively by the USA and the EU. As a result of multilateral tariff cuts, the difference between Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariffs and preferential protections will decrease, leading to an erosion in preferential margins. On tariff lines where final MFN tariffs could become inferior to initial preferential tariffs, African countries will enjoy an improvement in market access conditions to the Quad markets (Japan, EU, USA and Canada). However, in all casesFootnote 5 they will suffer from increased competition from other countries on the agricultural markets of developed countries. Therefore, their interests in the market access negotiations seem rather uncertain. On the one hand, the general dynamic brought about by trade liberalization could prove favorable, with a general improvement in agricultural prices and new consumer habits on Quad markets. On the other hand, agricultural liberalization is likely to erode their privileges and reinforce competition from farmers from the rest of the world. The objective of this article is to estimate the cost of preferences erosion resulting from the main proposals in the World Trade Organization (WTO) agricultural negotiations and to determine whether other effects of tariffs reductions, such as terms of trade effects, could outweigh this cost. It also attempts to determine the conditions under which the global effects of agricultural liberalization could be positive for African economies, despite the reduction in preferential margins, and to enumerate the potential convergences and divergences between the interests of African countries and other developing economies in these negotiations. It underscores that the current value of preferential schemes is neither negligible nor large, representing limited welfare gain and less than 1% of Africa’s agricultural exports. However, and that is a contribution of this paper, preferences effectively improve the terms of trade of African countries and contribute to the diversification of African economies. In Sect. 2, a brief review of the literature is conducted on the estimations of the effects of agricultural liberalization for developing economies, with a particular focus on African countries and the issue of preference erosion. Section 3 describes the model and methodology used, and the various scenarios tested.

A common finding is that the wage differential is partly explained by differences in other characteristics which are themselves correlated with foreign ownership. For example, foreign-owned plants tend to be larger and operate in sectors of the economy which are inherently more productive. It is therefore important to control for plant size and sector when comparing the wages and productivity of foreign- and domestic-owned plants. Since these characteristics are often observable in plant-level data, controlling for these differences is straightforward in a regression framework. Foreign and domestic plants might also differ in their unobservable characteristics. In particular, plants which are taken into foreign ownership might already be outperforming plants which are not taken over. With repeated observations at the plant level, it is possible to remove the influence of any time-invariant difference between plants which become foreign-owned and those which remain domestic by using difference-in-differences (DiD) or fixed effects (FE) techniques. However, it is difficult with plant-level data to control for time-varying differences in the quality of the workforce, which may explain some of the apparent foreign-ownership wage differential. More recently, the availability of linked employer–employee data (hereafter LEED) has allowed analysis at the worker-level which includes both plant- and worker-level controls. In this paper we present the first estimates of the foreign-ownership wage effect in Germany using LEED. Our estimation methods allow us to investigate a number of other important issues in this literature. First, we can examine whether the wage gain from ownership status is lost when workers move from foreign-owned to domestic plants. The standard estimation techniques used in the literature generally impose an equal and opposite effect on wages of movement into and out of foreign-owned plants. But if wage gains are the result of, for example, human capital accumulation, we would expect that the wage gains of joining a foreign-owned plant would not be lost on leaving that plant.
Footnote 1
 Second, we can investigate whether there are any distributional consequences of ownership status. For example, foreign-owned plants may implement a steeper wage-tenure profile, or they may change relative rewards to different skill groups. Third, we can directly estimate whether movers and stayers experience equal benefits from foreign ownership. Finally, data from the former East Germany provides an interesting test-bed, because we observe plants acquired by both West German and foreign firms. This allows us to see whether the (presumed) technological advantage of overseas firms applies within as well as between countries. For example, it has been argued that foreign-owned firms face a higher fixed entry cost, and so only relatively high productivity foreign-owned firms will enter the overseas market. We find evidence of large selection effects both in terms of worker and plant unobserved components of wages: plants which get taken over by foreign firms have higher wages before they are taken over. The selection effect is larger for plants in East Germany. Once the selection effect is taken into account, the genuine takeover effect is small and in some cases insignificantly different from zero in East Germany. The takeover effect is actually slightly larger in West Germany. The paper is structured as follows. We summarise previous estimates of the wage effect in Sect. 2, and we present a framework for measuring wage effects in Sect.3 which explores the different empirical issues which may arise. Section 4 briefly describes the data we use, and our estimates are presented in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes.",24

The theoretical trade literature provides conflicting predictions on the impact of trade reform on productivity. On the one hand, trade openness might increase productivity through the disciplining effect of imports or by increasing variety of available inputs, or by serving as a channel for technology diffusion. On the other hand, trade openness might reduce productivity by diminishing incentives of domestic producers to invest in superior technologies when faced with reduced market shares (Rodrik 1988, 1991). Empirical evidence on the impact of trade policy reforms on productivity growth is also mixed. Cross-country studies of Edwards (1993) and Ben-David (1993), which report beneficial impacts of trade openness, have been criticized on methodological grounds by Rodríguez and Rodrik (2000) and Rodrik (1999). In general, cross-country studies are criticized because of the difficulty of controlling institutional and country-specific factors across countries, as well as on the grounds that the important question is what would have happened had the country not adopted the policy changes (Srinivasan and Bhagwati 2001). Kehoe and Kehoe (1994) use an applied general equilibrium model and find that the impact of Nafta on the United States and Canada is negligible, while the impact on productivity growth in Mexico is significantly positive. Results from studies that use industry level data are also mixed. Tybout et al. (1991) find no evidence of an overall productivity improvement in Chile after its trade liberalization, and Tybout and Westbrook (1995) report weak evidence linking trade liberalization to productivity in Mexico. On the other hand, Harrison (1994) find positive impact of trade reform in Ivory Cost, and Ferreira and Rossi (2003) report a large positive impact in Brazil. While the importance of working with plant level data sets due to a high degree of plant heterogeneity in industries have been pointed out in several earlier studies (Olley and Pakes 1996; Roberts and Tybout 1996; Aw et al. 2001), recent increased access to plant level data sets (spanning a sufficiently long period of time in countries that have dramatically liberalized their trade regimes) have resulted in a large number of additional studies (see Tybout 2003 for a review). Evidence in this literature mostly suggests increased productivity gains during increased trade openness.Footnote 1 There is less agreement on the specific causes of productivity gains partly due to difficulties in delineating several mechanisms that may be operating simultaneously. There is evidence suggesting that these gains result from disciplining effect of imports, especially in import-competing sectors, and intra plant improvements (for recent examples see Pavcnik 2002; Muendler 2004; Hay 2001).Footnote 2 There is also evidence suggesting that participation in international activities leads to intra plant productivity improvements (Clerides et al. 1998; Aw et al. 2001; Kraay et al. 2006).Footnote 3
 We contribute to this literature by providing evidence on the productivity response to trade barrier reductions for Turkish manufacturing plants. We analyze plant level data for 23 3-digit SIC industries spanning the period of 1983–1996, which is a period of significant changes in trade policy. We calculate plant level total factor productivity (TFP) implementing the estimation method developed by Olley and Pakes (1996), which uses investment as the proxy to address the potential simultaneity bias in production function estimations. We then analyze TFP obtained from production function estimations. An inspection of productivity evolution over time suggests that during periods of most rapid decline in protection rates productivity gains are largest. We also find that productivity gains in import-competing sectors during these periods are higher than in other sectors. A decomposition of industry level productivity gains also suggests important differences across sectors by trade orientation. Though reallocation of market shares to more productive plants are important in both export-oriented and import-competing sectors, within plant productivity improvements are significant only in export-oriented sectors. Finally, we investigate effects of changes in protection rates (tariff and non-tariff) on plant level productivities using regressions that control for endogeneity of protection rates. In doing so, an important hypothesis of our paper is the heterogeneity of plant level responses to trade barrier reductions. Specifically, in addition to our measure of protection rate we use its interaction with beginning of the period plant size, and the plant size measure on its own. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide a brief history of the Turkish trade regime since 1980 and describe the plant level data set we use in our analysis. In Sect. 3 a brief presentation of Olley–Pakes method is presented. In Sect. 4 patterns in sector level TFP estimates are described. Section 5 contains the results of plant level TFP analysis. Section 6 provides conclusions.",8
145,2,Review of World Economics,27 June 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0017-2,Can the HOSS framework help shed light on the simultaneous growth of inequality and informalization in developing countries?,July 2009,Arslan Razmi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Data from a number of developing countries indicate a trend towards informalization of the labor force.
Footnote 1 Given the increasing integration of these countries into world markets, this is somewhat of a puzzle. Adding to the “mystery,” and concurrent with the rise of global integration, is an increase in income inequality in many developing countries, both in terms of a rising gap between the wages of skilled and unskilled workers (the “wage–wage” gap or skill premium), and between capital and labor incomes (the “rental–wage” gap).
Footnote 2 While these outcomes in capital- and skilled-labor abundant countries are consistent with the predictions of standard trade theory, symmetrical outcomes in skill- and capital-scarce developing countries are not. On a related note, a growing body of literature has begun to recognize the role that the weakening of unions and the relaxation of labor laws has played in determining distributional outcomes, making it important to formally incorporate institutional considerations in trade models. Moreover, while the growing income inequality observed in many countries has received significant attention in the trade literature, most studies have focused on divergence between skilled and unskilled wages in industrialized countries.
Footnote 3 One important finding—that points to technical change as a major culprit—has been that most of the increased inequality has arisen from resource shifts within rather than between industries, implying that trade-related Stolper–Samuelson effects have been less important. Another limitation of all but a handful of studies has been the neglect of the special nature of the informal sector in developing country labor markets.
Footnote 4 This sector can be broadly defined as the less regulated part of the economy in which minimum wage laws and labor regulations are either completely absent or weakly implemented. Since developing countries generally lack effective employment insurance schemes, few can afford to remain unemployed. Absorption by this sector of labor displaced from the more regulated sectors is likely, therefore, to be a major factor underlying the simultaneous increase in inequality and informalization, as well as the relatively jobless patterns of growth observed recently in many developing countries.
Footnote 5 The emergence in recent years of multinational production-sharing arrangements has significantly re-shaped the nature of the informal sector, large parts of which produce traded goods for international markets, either directly or via transnational corporations (TNCs) sourcing through “buyer-driven” supply chains, and searching the globe for flexible low cost labor.
Footnote 6 In many countries, a large share of the workforce in key vertically specialized export industries including textiles, garments, and electronics works in export processing zones (EPZs) or even from their homes under informal employment arrangements.
Footnote 7 Governments have typically encouraged the development of high import-intensity EPZs or similar special areas operating vertically specialized production processes, by providing firms sweeping incentives such as reduced tariffs, suppression of trade union activity, and freedom from the detailed regulations that govern formal sector labor markets. In light of the preceding observations, this paper illustrates why two distinguishing features of the current period of integration become important for explaining distributional changes in the presence of a large informal sector: (i) the growth of vertical specialization in the form of internationally diversified production networks, and (ii) a concerted effort by many countries to contract the public sector in order to achieve macroeconomic stability as well as microeconomic efficiency. Our main contribution is to demonstrate that the presence of an unskilled labor-intensive informal sector that absorbs labor released from the formal sector means that, under reasonable assumptions, simple modifications to the Heckscher–Ohlin–Stolper–Samuelson (HOSS) framework can be used to link (i) and (ii) to the parallel growth of income inequality and informalization witnessed recently in many developing countries. Moreover, unlike most existing analysis, we focus on both wage–wage and rental–wage gaps. Looking ahead, we develop two plausible scenarios to reconcile the following developments observed in many developing countries in recent years:
 greater integration into international trade and production networks, contraction of employment in the public sector and relatively timid overall employment creation in the formal sector, 
simultaneous growth in wage–wage and rental–wage gaps, and increasing informalization of the labor force. The canonical form of the HOSS model takes commodity prices as internationally given. Changes in factor prices are then determined by commodity price changes. Our models, on the other hand, assume internationally determined prices for the traded good and internally determined prices for the non-traded and public sector goods. Following Marjit (2003), we turn the spotlight on domestic structures within developing economies. Assuming the presence of sectors that are even more labor-intensive than those producing traded goods, we demonstrate that a simultaneous increase in wage–wage and rental–wage inequality along with informalization may result from:  Labor retrenchment in the public sector. The reduction of tariffs on intermediate inputs into a globally integrated export sector. The intuition behind (1) and (2) can be stated succinctly. Consider first the former. Contraction of public sector employment releases labor, which gets re-employed in the relatively labor-intensive private informal sector, expanding it at the expense of the private formal sector (the “Rybczynski effect”). Increased availability of labor in the private sector, however, also raises the rental–wage ratio, which has the effect of expanding the less labor-intensive formal sector via factor substitution (the “Heckscher–Ohlin effect”). The net effect is increasing wage–wage and rental–wage inequality and, if the Rybczynski effect dominates, informalization. Next consider (2) within a framework that includes traded and non-traded goods. The latter are produced in the informal sector while the former are produced in both the formal and informal sectors, with the traded informal sector assuming the form of an import-intensive export sector (or EPZ) embedded in international production networks. The direct effect of a reduction in tariffs on intermediates imported into the EPZ is to raise both returns to capital in the EPZ and informal sector wages. The resulting contraction of the formal traded sector puts downward pressure on demand for non-traded goods, and hence on informal wages. The overall impact is likely to be informalization, and, given sufficiently strong backward linkages between the formal and non-traded sectors, rising wage–wage and rental–wage inequality. Table 1 defines the symbols employed in this paper. The next two sections develop the theoretical frameworks and relevant policy experiments. Section 4 concludes.",3
145,3,Review of World Economics,13 September 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0028-z,"Trade, imitative ability and intellectual property rights",October 2009,Rod Falvey,Neil Foster,David Greenaway,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), a product of the Uruguay Round (1986–1994) of trade negotiations, reflects a growing trend of linking trade policy and intellectual property rights (IPRs) regimes. The stated aims of TRIPS, which sets minimum standards of IPR protection to be provided by each World Trade Organisation (WTO) member, include encouraging both innovation and international technology diffusion. The argument relating IPR protection to innovation is clear. IPR protection provides innovators with the legally enforceable power to prevent others from using an intellectual creation or to set the terms on which it can be used. In the absence of such protection new technology or knowledge is likely to be copied or imitated, thus lowering the potential profits of the innovator and reducing the incentive for individuals to undertake innovative activities. To the extent that innovation encourages economic growth, as suggested by many endogenous growth models, we would also expect stronger IPR protection to impact positively upon economic growth. Empirical evidence supporting a relationship between IPRs and innovation has been found by Kanwar and Evenson (2003); other evidence supports the existence of a positive relationship between IPRs and economic growth (Gould and Gruben 1996; Falvey et al. 2004, 2006a). The relationship between IPR protection and international technology diffusion on the other hand is less straightforward. Technology may be diffused across borders through a variety of formal and informal channels, including international patenting, trade in goods, foreign direct investment (FDI), technology licensing, the (temporary and permanent) migration of skilled workers and product imitation. In addition to stronger IPR protection possibly affecting these potential channels in opposing ways, often the relationship between IPR protection and a single channel is not unambiguous, depending upon the level of development of the receiving country and whether it is able to carry out significant technical innovation or imitate existing technology. Several empirical studies have considered the relationship between IPR protection and a particular channel of diffusion. Maskus and Penubarti (1995) and Smith (1999) for example consider the relationship between IPRs and trade, while Smarzynska (2004) and Eaton and Kortum (1996) consider the importance of IPR protection for FDI and patenting respectively. Others (for example, Maskus 1998; Smith 2001; Nicholson 2007) consider the impact of IPR protection on multiple channels of diffusion simultaneously. The outcomes of these studies are mixed, though stronger evidence is found for the importance of IPR protection for trade and patenting than for FDI.Footnote 1
 A now large empirical literature supports the role of international trade in transferring technology both among developed countries (for example, Coe and Helpman 1995) and from developed to developing countries (for example, Coe et al. 1997). While issues remain to be resolved (Keller 2004) the evidence concerning trade as a channel of technology diffusion is perhaps the most consistent of all of the potential channels. In this paper we concentrate on the importance of IPR protection for international trade. Specifically, we examine the importance of IPR protection for manufacturing exports from the G5 countries, in which the bulk of world innovative activity [as measured by research and development (R&D) expenditure] is conducted, to a sample of 69 developed and developing countries. To do this we estimate a gravity equation using panel data grouped into six 5-year averages over the period 1970–1999. Results are reported for both Total Manufacturing trade and nine-two-digit ISIC industries. In addition to estimating a linear relationship between IPR protection and trade, we examine whether this relationship depends upon the level of development, imitative ability and market size of the importing country using threshold regression techniques which allow us to estimate both the number of regimes and their position. Two opposing effects of stronger IPRs on a country’s imports have been identified in the literature. Imports may expand with the curtailment of domestic imitation, but may contract if exporters choose to exercise their increased market power. The empirical literature to date has found evidence of both effects, depending on the imitative ability of the importing country. Our results confirm the prevalence of market expansion effects. We also find some evidence of market power effects, but these are scattered and much less prevalent than previously thought. Our investigation also highlights the importance of one industry (Fabricated Metal Products) in determining the link between strengthened IPRs and aggregate imports from these countries. The other industries behave in different ways, implying that stronger IPRs will affect both the volume and composition of these imports, although no clear link with industry R&D intensity is evident. The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 summarises the theory and evidence linking IPR protection to international trade. Section 3 describes our empirical approach, while Sect. 4 discusses the data. Section 5 describes the results and Sect. 6 summarises our results and offers some conclusions.",28

Empirical researchFootnote 1 points out that VIIT is the dominant type of total IIT. A common feature of the above mentioned investigations is the analysis of trade between a given reference country and a set of partners. The empirical results are not unambiguous with regard to the relationship between differences in factor endowments between trade partners on the one side and the two types of IIT on the other. It is possible that the estimated relationships depend on the reference country. Therefore, it is relevant to examine the bilateral trade among all partners within a set of partners. Such an analysis has not yet been conducted in the international literature. We conduct an econometric analysis of European VIIT in manufactured goods from 1996 to 2005. The countries are the EU-15 countries and four East European countries: Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic. The choice of countries is determined by two considerations: (1) the availability of data for both trade flows and explanatory variables and (2) the countries should operate on a common market so that problems of trade barriers etc. can be left out of consideration. We also analyze the implications of geographical proximity. This determinant captures such factors as similarities in language and culture and thereby similarity of consumer patterns. Finally, we investigate the role of income distribution overlap between countries and the effect of production size. In Sect. 2, theoretical foundations and empirical applications are discussed.

Bénétrix,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The rapid increase in gross stocks of foreign assets and liabilities has revived interest in the dynamics of the external account. In particular, there is a growing concern for the impact of capital gains on the value of foreign asset and liability positions, which has been named the valuation channel of the external adjustment. This growth in gross stocks, documented by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2001), together with the evidence on return differentials reported by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2001, 2007a), Tille (2008), Hung and Mascaro (2004) and Gourinchas and Rey (2007a), suggests that the valuation channel plays an important role in the external adjustment process. For instance, well-timed capital gains may make it unnecessary for a persistent debtor to run trade balance surpluses. Moreover, cross-border net capital gains can generate large wealth redistributions. When the external adjustment is abrupt, the literature has focused on the study of current account reversals and sudden stops (Milesi-Ferretti and Razin 1998, 2000; Edwards 2004; Calvo et al. 2004). However, it is silent on the large movements in the external position that are driven by large valuation gains or losses, rather than by large swings in capital flows. As a result of the breakthrough made by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2001, 2007a), it is possible to analyze sharp external adjustments from the valuation channel perspective. Since this database measures gross stocks of foreign assets and liabilities, the relative role of the rates of capital gain in both sides of the balance sheet as well as across different portfolio categories can be studied. Moreover, Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2001, 2007a) provide enough information to evaluate how the increase in gross stocks of foreign assets and liabilities affects these adjustments. This paper makes a step in this direction. In particular, we evaluate how the upsurge in gross international financial integration (IFI) has contributed to abrupt adjustments via the valuation channel. The methodology is analogous to the one used in the current account reversal literature. That is, we conduct an event study where a large valuation shock is defined as the year in which the valuation channel goes beyond a threshold. Using a sample of 38 countries, we derive the valuation channel from the accounting framework used in Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007b) and identify 59 large valuation shocks between 1994 and 2004. This finding raises the following questions: Are large valuations the result of sizeable gross stocks? What is the relative role of the debt, direct investment or portfolio equity? Are large valuations persistent? Does a different pattern emerge for developing and advanced countries? To answer these questions, we calculate the relative role of sizeable net external positions and gross stocks (gross IFI) in these large valuation shocks. We do this for the total international portfolio and for the debt, direct investment and portfolio equity subcomponents. Finally, we study the dynamics of the valuation channel and main related macroeconomic and asset price variables in the neighborhood of two types of large valuation episodes. We find that the level of IFI matters for large valuation episodes in advanced economies, since large gross stocks magnify the impact of return differentials. These countries typically do not have large net positions. Rather, gross stocks of foreign assets and liabilities explain most of the episodes. The main contribution is attributable to the equity subcomponent. For emerging markets and developing countries, valuation episodes are determined by sizeable net external positions and large rates of capital losses. In particular, the debt subcomponent played the main role. For most of these countries, the cumulated valuation shift was persistent, the real exchange rate largely depreciates and the trade balance improves. In what remains, the paper is organized in four sections. In Sect. 2, we present the method to identify large valuation shocks. In Sect. 3, we evaluate the relative importance of gross stocks and net positions. In Sect. 4, we analyze the dynamics of the valuation channel and a set of related macroeconomic and asset price variables, in the neighborhood of the valuation episodes. In Sect. 5, we conclude.",4
145,3,Review of World Economics,02 September 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0024-3,Real exchange-rate uncertainty and US foreign direct investment: an empirical analysis,October 2009,Christian W. Schmidt,Udo Broll,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Multinational enterprises (MNEs) and foreign direct investment (FDI) are important elements of global commerce and factor mobility. The growth of FDI has exceeded the growth of exports and has become the driving force for economic development in many countries. On the one hand, FDI allows for a more efficient allocation of resources for the investing firm in the home country. The host country, on the other hand, benefits from knowledge transfers and spillovers as well as inciting competition and increased productivity. Policy makers have recognized the special position of incoming FDI as it can play an important role in promoting economic growth.Footnote 1
 Theoretical predictions for the effect of exchange-rate uncertainty on FDI are mixed across the literature. While, among others, Capel (1992), Campa (1993), and Rivoli and Salorio (1996) explain a negative relationship mainly due to a deterring effect of exchange-rate uncertainty on FDI. Theories of Cushman (1985, 1988), Broll and Wong (2006), Goldberg and Kolstad (1995), and Aizenman and Marion (2004), for instance, explain a positive link between increased exchange-rate uncertainty and the size of FDI. Under the assumption of imperfect capital markets, Froot and Stein (1991) connect the exchange-rate level and wealth positions with FDI. In their theory FDI is positively related to a depreciation of host-country currency. A similar theoretical result comes from Blonigen (1997) who plausibly shows how a real currency depreciation in the receiving country can increase acquisition FDI to this country. Cushman (1985, 1988), furthermore, presents diverse theoretical outcomes for the effect of the level of the real exchange rate on FDI decisions, depending on the source country of the inputs used for production, where the good is produced, and the country where the final good is sold. The author derives mainly a positive effect of real host-country currency depreciation on FDI that is along the lines of Froot and Stein (1991) and Blonigen (1997). In addition, he models expectations about the future evolution of the real exchange rate and finds mixed results. Contrary, Campa’s (1993) theory, which follows Dixit (1989), predicts a negative relationship between real home-country currency valuation and FDI transactions to the host country. Empirical findings for the effect of both exchange-rate uncertainty and the exchange-rate level on FDI mainly confirm these varying predictions. A positive impact of exchange-rate uncertainty on FDI is presented in studies by Cushman (1985, 1988), Goldberg and Kolstad (1995), de Meńil (1999) as well as Pain and van Welsum (2003), among others. Studies reporting a negative correlation come from Campa (1993), Bénassy-Quéré et al. (2001), Urata and Kawai (2000), and Kiyota and Urata (2004) to name a few. Görg and Wakelin (2002) in contrast found no significant relationship between real exchange-rate uncertainty and FDI. Froot and Stein (1991), Cushman (1985), and Blonigen (1997) corroborate their theoretical predictions of a positive correlation between host-country currency depreciation and FDI in their empirical analyses of FDI data, which is also in line with other empirical studies, e.g., Klein and Rosengren (1994) and Ito (2000). Campa (1993), to the contrary, reports a negative effect. However, a number of studies, including Pain and van Welsum (2003) and Stevens (1998) are not able to identify a statistically significant effect of host-country currency valuation on FDI. Following a version of the analytical framework applied by Kiyota and Urata (2004), this paper will investigate empirically how the volatility and the level of the real exchange rate as well as its expected future fluctuation affect US outward FDI. Due to the vast variety of possible specifications of exchange-rate uncertainty particular attention is given to the application of two measures of exchange-rate risk. In accordance to Cushman (1988), the standard deviation of recent annual changes in the real exchange rate is adopted as benchmark definition. In the course of the analysis, this is tested against an alternative measure of uncertainty, specified as the part of real exchange-rate volatility that is not explained by the failures of the law of one price (Kiyota and Urata 2004). The empirical analysis will focus on industry-specific effects, using disaggregated FDI data at industry level. This is expected to provide better insight into the coherences across different industries and through pooling produce more efficient estimation results as compared to using country-level data.Footnote 2
 The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the analytical methodology used for the empirical investigation, including the benchmark model and the alternative measure of uncertainty, followed by a description of the underlying data.

145,4,Review of World Economics,28 October 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0030-5,Bilateral trade of cultural goods,January 2010,Anne-Célia Disdier,Silvio H. T. Tai,Thierry Mayer,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"In most countries, household expenditures on recreation and cultureFootnote 1 account for around 5% of GDP. In 2005, this share was 6.4% in the United States, 5.5% in Canada, 7.7% in the United Kingdom and 5.2% in France. In 1970, those were 4.5% in the United States, 4.9% in Canada, 5.1% in the United Kingdom and 4.3% in France (OECD 2007). Apart from the increase in income per capita, a frequent and presumably important explanation of this growth of cultural expenditures over the last decades is the emergence of the information society, combined with the development of leisure and of cultural tourism. This growth in consumption is associated with an impressive rise in trade. Between 1980 and 1998, world imports of cultural goodsFootnote 2 have increased by 347% going from 47.8 to 213.7 billion of US dollars (UNESCO 2000). According to United Nations Comtrade data, world imports of all commodities increased by 189% between 1980 and 1998. An unexpected outcome is that in 1996, cultural products became the largest export industry of the United States, surpassing, for the first time, traditional manufacturing industries.Footnote 3 An interesting characteristic of these cultural trade flows is their high concentration: most of world trade in cultural goods is the fact of a remarkably small number of countries. In 2002, the United States, the United Kingdom, China (including Hong Kong and Macao), Germany and France accounted for 55.5% of total exports and 53.5% of total imports (UNESCO 2005). For global trade, these percentages were 39.7% for exports and 45.3% for imports. Furthermore, trade liberalization of these flows was one of the most sensitive issues of recent and current multilateral negotiation rounds. Discussions set the partisans of free trade in cultural goods against the advocates of a “cultural exception”. The latter consider that cultural goods and services reflect countries’ identities and individuals’ diversity and as such should not be submitted to GATT/WTO general principles, for fear of generating a worldwide standardization of tastes and behaviours.Footnote 4 Cultural goods trade is therefore an empirically important phenomenon, and politically sensitive topic. In addition, there has been a recent surge of academic interest in “cultural economics”, understood as the quest for cultural origins of various economic outcomes such as regional development (Tabellini 2008), diffusion of innovations (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2009) or labour market performance (Algan and Cahuc 2007). It is therefore somehow surprising that despite this wide interest in the topic, this type of exchanges has not been much studied in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the determinants and the influence of bilateral trade in cultural goods. We first focus on the sensitivity of cultural flows to usual spatial friction and cultural proximity variables. Next, we use bilateral trade in cultural goods as a measure of countries’ cultural proximity. Used as a proxy for bilateral preferences, these data help shed light on the spatial spread of cultures and their impact on trade flows. The impact of bilateral cultural “affinity” on trade patterns has been recently analyzed in details in several papers (e.g., Guiso et al. (2009) on bilateral trust or Disdier and Mayer (2007) on bilateral opinions). Also related to this literature are the issues of linguistic proximity (Boisso and Ferrantino 1997; Melitz 2008), and past colonial links (Rose 2000; Eichengreen and Irwin 1998) or the link between immigration and trade (Wagner et al. 2002). However, these papers have to rely on proxies that often cover a low number of countries, and/or do not exhibit time variance. Trade in cultural goods has the advantage of world coverage and large changes over time.Footnote 5 An additional contribution of our paper is to provide up-to-date estimates in terms of gravity equation estimation technology. Our results first show that cultural goods are traded over shorter distances than non-cultural ones. Besides, common language fosters trade of cultural goods with a written support, while past colonial relationships influence consumers’ preferences for cultural heritage goods and visual arts. Current cultural flows are also strongly influenced by past ones, which suggests the presence of what has been analyzed as addictive behaviour in the literature. Finally, we show that cultural flows have a positive and significant influence on overall trade and capture countries’ cultural proximity better than traditional measures do. This last result differs from the one obtained for genetic distance, a measure of cultural proximity recently used in the literature. Giuliano et al. (2006) suggest that genetic distance between countries captures the impact of transportation costs and not of cultural differences in trade flows. The paper proceeds as follows: the related literature is briefly surveyed in Sect. 2. Section 3 describes our data and specifies the gravity model. In Sect. 4, we provide results for the determinants of trade in cultural goods and for its influence on flows of other commodities. Section 5 concludes.",54
145,4,Review of World Economics,08 November 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0035-0,Why don’t foreign firms cooperate in US antidumping investigations? An empirical analysis,January 2010,Michael O. Moore,Alan K. Fox,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Foreign firms facing allegations of “unfair trade” within the US antidumping system face a dilemma. On the one hand, these firms can decide to cooperate with the complex and time-consuming Department of Commerce (DOC) investigations into whether there is evidence of pricing at “less than fair value.” Such cooperation can ensure that the data used to calculate the potential dumping margin are based on the firm’s economic and commercial realities. However, this compliance can result in significant legal and administrative costs as firms organize and submit the wide-ranging set of data required by the DOC. On the other hand, firms can avoid compliance costs by deciding not to cooperate but this choice subjects foreign firms to a DOC procedure under which the US authorities, consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), can use “facts-available,” which may include the allegations submitted by the domestic petitioning industry. The consequences of this decision are not trivial. Firms deemed “non-cooperative” are subject to far higher margins than those that cooperate. For example, in the pre-WTO period between 1980 and 1994, average calculated dumping margins were 22% for foreign firms that cooperated with US antidumping authorities compared to 70% for those facing “facts-available” (FA) procedures.Footnote 1 These higher duties for individual firms are even more problematic if other foreign competitors cooperate in the antidumping investigation. Foreign firms consequently face the real possibility that non-cooperation could lead to prohibitive antidumping duties based on information from domestic petitioners, who have clear incentives to overstate the degree of actual dumping. Moreover, the frequency of non-cooperation has been anything but rare—from 1980 to 1994, the DOC used facts-available methods in 279 of 960 investigations of alleged foreign firm dumping, i.e., just over 29% of all investigations. There is, however, considerable variation across countries in terms of their cooperation. The DOC reported final dumping margins for 145 individual Japanese firms for the 1980–1994 time frame; 53 of these firms, or 37%, were subject to facts-available procedures. In sharp contrast, Canadian firms were involved in 55 separate antidumping firm level antidumping investigations during this same time period for which there were only seven instances when these Canadian firms were found to be uncooperative by US authorities and therefore subject to facts-available procedures (Moore 2006). The relatively high percentage of firms subject to facts-available margins along with the differences across nations raises the following question. Why would some foreign firms choose to cooperate while so many others apparently are willing to face such high margins, especially given that past DOC behavior suggests that the resulting dumping margin might be as much as triple those they would face if they cooperate? One line of research initiated by Blonigen (2006a) has focused on the role of DOC discretion. Antidumping margins have risen markedly since 1980 in the US and Blonigen’s work indicates that DOC interpretation of its own regulations has led to frequent use of facts-available techniques and consequently higher margins. Blonigen (2006b) focuses on the role of US firms, especially how their actions can affect antidumping outcomes, especially with regard to the likelihood of an affirmative final decision. Our research in a sense takes over from where this earlier work stops by focusing on how foreign firms’ own decisions may affect antidumping outcomes in the US. There is some anecdotal evidence that foreign firms may choose not to cooperate at the DOC stage of an antidumping investigation because they do not believe that the benefits are worth the costs. For example, Petroflex, a Brazilian firm facing an antidumping investigation in 1998, stated in an official letter to the US government that it does not anticipate a significant reduction in the final margin to warrant further participation in the [Department of Commerce’s] investigation...[and] has therefore decided to focus its efforts on the injury proceedings at the U.S. International Trade Commission.Footnote 2
 This research will offer some tentative suggestions about what factors might help explain these decisions. In particular, we will use a two-stage instrumental variable probit analysis to examine the behavior of 372 individual foreign firm decisions about whether or not to cooperate in dumping allegations in the US between 1995 and 2002. This period has the advantage that antidumping law and regulations remained essentially unchanged between the implementation of the Uruguay Round in 1995 and the passage of the Trade Promotion Authorization Act in 2002. The empirical analysis, inspired by a theoretical framework developed in Moore (2005), suggests that foreign firms choose whether or not to cooperate based on the net expected benefits of cooperation. The empirical results indicate that respondent firms are indeed sensitive to petitioners’ dumping allegations when considering whether or not to cooperate with the DOC investigation. An increase of 1% in the alleged margin leads to about a 0.39% lower probability that a respondent firm will find itself subject to adverse facts-available. The data suggest that foreign firms are also likely to cooperate if doing so will lower their expected dumping margins. We also present evidence that the US share of foreign firms’ exports are important. In particular, the larger the US market for the firm’s sales, the more likely that the firm will cooperate. In short, we find evidence that, far from ignoring credible threats of DOC “punishment”, foreign firms’ decisions are weighing the relative benefits of cooperation versus non-cooperation. Note that we do not analyze whether or not the DOC is “appropriately” applying the law and its own regulations but instead focus only on foreign firms’ decisions, holding constant the DOC’s own, possibly biased, procedures.",4
145,4,Review of World Economics,17 November 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0037-y,Employment and export specialisation along the development path: some robust evidence,January 2010,Aleksandra Parteka,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"This paper explores the theme of sectoral diversification and its evolution along the development path. The argument of specialisation (from now on we use the terms specialisation and diversification as antonyms) can be analysed from two different perspectives, depending on whether the subject of interest is its degree (thus if a certain country specializes and to what extent) or its nature (thus in what kind of sectors economic activity is concentrated). In this paper we concentrate on the former aspect of economic activity distribution, still not so much explored in the empirical literature. Understanding such a relationship is important in the light of arguments suggesting not only that the nature of specialisation is important for economic growth (Grossman and Helpman 1991; Hausmann et al. 2007; Plümper and Graff 2001) but that also the degree of diversification is crucial from the perspective of economic progress (Acemoglu and Zilibotti 1997). It is especially relevant in low-income countries where high risk associated with low diversification can be particularly dangerous (Kalemli-Ozcan et al. 2003; Koren and Tenreyro 2007). One of the problems that the empirical research on specialisation—GDP per capita nexus should address is the fact that the degree of economic structures’ diversification can be examined from two distinct points of view: as a characteristic of an internal industrial structure or as a trade issue. Can we state that the degree of employment and export diversification are two phenomena evolving in parallel, or should they instead be treated separately as having different dynamics along the development path? The overview of existing studies (usually limiting the analysis to the data of one type) gives a rather mixed picture. There is some evidence for the decreasing degree of export intensity in Europe (Aiginger et al. 1999), in OECD countries (Laursen 2000), or in a heterogeneous group of developed and developing economies (Wörz 2005). At the same time, other studies confirm increasing trends of industrial specialisation in Europe (Aiginger and Davies 2004; Amiti 1999; Brülhart 1998).Footnote 1
 So far, few studies match specialisation patterns with GDP per capita performance at the international level, and there is still some incongruity in the conclusions drawn. The results vary depending on the set of data used (trade or industrial statistics), adopted measures of specialisation (relative or absolute, thus relating specialisation patterns to the general trend or not, respectively), and the inclusion or exclusion of country-specific effects in the estimation. It has been argued by means of nonparametric unconditional methodologyFootnote 2 (providing flexibility but not accounting for the importance of any other determinants of specialisation, not even country-fixed effects) that economies may undergo different stages of specialisation as they grow, first diversifying and then again specialising their industrial structure (Imbs and Wacziarg 2003; Koren and Tenreyro 2007) or trade composition (Cadot et al. 2007). At the same time a pattern of consistent decreasing specialisation has been revealed through semiparametric estimationsFootnote 3 performed with international trade statistics and taking into account country-specific effects (de Benedictis et al. 2009). It is possible that the differences in the conclusions drawn by various authors result only from the diversity of methodological and computational settings, but given the aforementioned variety of cross-country evidence, the omission of country-specific effects seems to be a serious problem.Footnote 4 In order to address all of these points, we perform a fully comparable analysis of various (export and employment) aspects of specialisation along the GDP per capita expansion path within our perfectly homogeneous empirical setting. We apply a wide range of absolute and relative specialisation measures calculated for 32 economies over the years 1980–2000. To our knowledge, no systematic analysis of this kind has been performed so far.Footnote 5
 Since the very beginning we have not wanted to impose any limitation on the nature of the relationship between the extent of economic structures’ diversification and corresponding development levels. In order to provide full comparability with the existing evidence, we start from the simplest unconditional nonparametric framework. Subsequently, however, we apply semiparametric estimation, which allows us to correct the flexible shape of the specialisation curves by including country-specific effects. Parametric methods are used as a supporting tool. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2, following the introduction, describes basic concepts linked to the measurement of ‘overall specialisation’ and the composition of our data set. In Sect. 3 we briefly describe the methods of estimations we apply. In Sect. 4 we present results based on unconditional estimations of the specialisation—GDP per capita nexus, while in Sect. 5 we present robust results obtained by means of semiparametric estimation with country-fixed effects along with robustness checks. Concluding remarks are presented in Sect. 6. We do not find a robust support for a U-shaped pattern of specialisation along the path of growth, but rather a tendency towards manufacturing despecialisation in the initial phase of economic development, especially in relative diversification dynamics compared to the overall trend.",25
145,4,Review of World Economics,25 October 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0031-4,"Higher productivity in importing German manufacturing firms: self-selection, learning from importing, or both?",January 2010,Alexander Vogel,Joachim Wagner,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since the mid-1990s economists used micro data at the firm level from many countries to uncover the role that firms play in international trade. These micro-econometric studies revealed a number of stylized facts regarding differences between exporting and non-exporting firms (summarized in Bernard et al. 2007) that in turn inspired theoretical models with heterogeneous firms in open economies (see the influential contributions by Melitz 2003 and Bernard et al. 2003) instead of the representative firm models from the older literature on international economics with a focus on industries or countries. Productivity differences between exporting and non-exporting firms from the same industry play a central role in both the empirical investigations and the new theoretical models. Numerous empirical studies show that exporting firms are more productive than non-exporting firms even if observed and unobserved firm characteristics are controlled for, and that there is self-selection of the more productive firms into exporting, while empirical evidence for positive effects of exporting on productivity is scarce (for a survey of the empirical literature see Wagner 2007a). While the causes and consequences of export and its mutual relationships with productivity (and with other firm characteristics, including firm size and growth, and wages paid) are prominent topics in the recent literature on internationally active firms, imports are seldom dealt with. A case in point is the recently published Bruegel study on the internationalisation of European firms (Mayer and Ottaviano 2008) where imports are not dealt with at all. As Bernard et al. (2007: 123) recently put it, “(t)he empirical literature on firms in international trade has been concerned almost exclusively with exporting, largely due to limitations in data sets …. As a result, the new theories of heterogeneous firms and trade were developed to explain facts about firm export behaviour and yield few predictions (if any) for firm import behaviour.” This situation, however, is changing rapidly. With new data sets that include information on imports at the firm level becoming available for more and more countries a new literature (reviewed in Sect. 2 below) is emerging since 2005 that has a focus on the links between productivity and imports. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting the first empirical results on the relationships between imports and productivity for Germany, a leading actor on the world market for goods.Footnote 1 Furthermore, we look for the first time systematically at the direction of causality in this relationship by testing for self-selection of more productive firms into importing, and for productivity-enhancing effects of imports (‘learning-by-importing’). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the recent literature on imports and productivity. Section 3 introduces the newly available firm level panel data for Germany used in our empirical investigation. Section 4 reports productivity premia for firms active in international trade. Section 5 investigates whether more productive firms self-select into import activities. Section 6 reports findings on productivity-enhancing effects of imports. Section 7 concludes.",131
145,4,Review of World Economics,20 November 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0038-x,Openness and income disparities: does trade explain the “Mezzogiorno effect”?,January 2010,Claudia M. Buch,Paola Monti,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"There is a growing concern that the increasing integration of the world economy could lead to increased income disparities. International integration may lead to income disparities across different skill groups and across different countries. But does increased openness also affect regional income differentials within a given country? Stylized facts for Italian regions suggest that it perhaps does. Both, GDP per capita and trade openness in Southern Italy have been persistently below comparable values for the Centre-North.Footnote 1 In this paper, we analyze whether a low degree of de facto trade openness at the regional level can account for the “Mezzogiorno effect”. Whether trade causes growth—or rather the reverse—has been a long disputed topic in international economics, in particular in relationship with trade policy choices and thus de jure openness (see, e.g., Baldwin 2003; Rodriguez 2006). Instead, our paper is in the tradition of literature that examines the link between de facto openness and income. From a theoretical point of view, improved utilization of scarce resources, improvements in technologies, and the exploitation of economies of scale can explain a causal effect of trade on growth (Helpman 2004). In principle, the link between trade and the level of income at the regional level should not differ much from the link at the national level. Yet, estimating the relationship is problematic since growth and trade are endogenously determined: more trade might spur growth, but regions whose incomes are high for reasons unrelated to trade might also trade more. Many previous studies based on cross-country data use instrumental variables (IV) to account for the endogeneity of trade. Frankel and Romer (1999) propose accounting for the endogeneity of actual trade volumes using the time-invariant geographical component of trade. Applying this modeling strategy in a panel context requires time-varying instruments such as foreign GDP. Our empirical approach differs from earlier studies in two main regards. First, we argue that cointegration models, which account for the endogeneity of trade, are a useful tool for analyzing the openness—growth nexus in a panel context. Using different panel cointegration tests and estimates of the cointegration parameters, we find evidence for a positive impact of trade on regional GDP per capita which is qualitatively similar to those from the IV estimates. Second, while panel cointegration models can be readily applied also to a cross-country setting, our use of regional data has further advantages because differences in institutions are less pronounced within than between countries. Hence, we address the concern that differences in institutions across countries might affect both, per capita income and trade. A further advantage of regional data is that differences in convergence rates between regions of the same country are likely to be smaller than those between countries. This addresses the point made by Felbermayr (2005) that the model of Frankel and Romer (1999) might be mis-specified because of its implicit assumption that countries are in their respective steady state. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents stylized facts on openness and on the macroeconomic convergence for Italian regions. Section 3 gives our results concerning the openness—and growth nexus using standard IV estimates. In a first step, an openness equation is estimated showing that geography has a significant impact on trade openness. Even controlling for geography, the Southern Italian regions are significantly less integrated internationally than the regions in the Centre-North. In a second step, the estimated openness equation is used to generate predicted values for trade that serve as IV for actual trade in the growth equation. Results indicate that there is a positive link between trade openness and GDP per capita. Section 4 presents the results of panel cointegration techniques which account for common trends and address the endogeneity problem as well. We support our qualitative results using IV estimates and even find similar coefficient estimates. Section 5 concludes.",4
145,4,Review of World Economics,14 January 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0036-z,FDI and productivity convergence in Central and Eastern Europe: an industry-level investigation,January 2010,Martin Bijsterbosch,Marcin Kolasa,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"After more than 15 years of transition and despite an impressive catching-up process, productivity levels in central and eastern European EU countries remain substantially below those in the rest of the EU. In 2005, for example, average GDP per capita in the region stood at around 55% of the euro area (Arratibel et al. 2007).Footnote 1 Further raising productivity levels, therefore, remains a key priority for economic policies in these countries. The catching-up process in Central and Eastern Europe has coincided with large inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). A key question arising from this phenomenon is how important FDI inflows have been for the convergence process in general and for productivity gains in particular. If FDI has a consistent positive impact on productivity, this would imply that countries should continue to pursue policies aimed at attracting FDI. In addition, it is important to understand whether and which economic conditions affect the size of the benefits associated with FDI inflows. The existing cross-country studies on growth and productivity in Central and Eastern Europe largely have a stocktaking or growth-accounting character and concentrate mostly on the macro-level (e.g. Campos and Coricelli 2002; Doyle et al. 2001; European Commission 2004; Lenain and Rawdanowicz 2004). The main focus of this literature is on the pace and nature of the growth process, concentrating on the period since the start of the transition to a market economy. These studies mostly underline the importance of economic policies (including institutions) for growth and convergence. There have been a number of attempts to investigate the link between FDI and economic growth in a more formal way. Only very few of them, however, take a cross-country or cross-industry perspective, mainly due to the lack of comparable data. For instance, Holland and Pain (1998) examine the early stages of transition in Central and Eastern Europe (1992–1996). They estimate a labour demand function using aggregate data for eight countries and find that the stock of inward foreign investment has a positive impact on productivity, with the beneficial effects being higher in the more market-orientated economies. These results were broadly confirmed by a related study of Barrell and Holland (2000), based on industry-level data covering eleven manufacturing sectors in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Other empirical evidence on the role of FDI in the catching-up process of transition economies has been less conclusive. For example, Mencinger (2003) applies a Granger causality test to aggregate data covering eight central and eastern European economies in the period 1994–2001. The main finding is that the relationship between FDI and GDP growth is negative, which is attributed to the character of FDI during this period (mostly privatisation-related rather than greenfield investment). Hunya (1997) estimates that foreign-owned enterprises operating in the region have on average higher labour productivity than domestic firms, but notes that this may be related to the concentration of the former in more capital intensive industries. This hypothesis was confirmed by Djankov and Hoekman (2000), who use firm-level data from the Czech Republic and conclude that, after controlling for various kinds of selection biases, FDI does not seem to have a significant effect on productivity growth. Following an improved availability of firm-level data, an increasing number of papers on the link between FDI and growth have focused on productivity spillovers from foreign-owned companies to other firms in the economy.Footnote 2 A key conclusion emanating from these studies is that spillovers vary by country, sector and type of firm, depending also on the nature of FDI and absorptive capacity of domestic enterprises. The approach taken by the most recent spillover literature has many advantages over the earlier studies. While it is certainly of interest whether there are any externalities associated with FDI inflows, an important question remains about their total impact on aggregate productivity. More specifically, since multinational companies are among the most technologically advanced firms, their presence may be beneficial for a recipient country even if their superior knowledge does not spill over to domestic firms. Therefore, it may still be useful to take a less disaggregated perspective for assessing the macroeconomic impact of FDI. A relatively detailed industry-level analysis has recently become possible thanks to the EU KLEMS database. It covers a wide range of sectors in an internationally comparable way and can be considered as a state-of-the-art source for cross-country and cross-industry comparisons. By merging this relatively new and to a large extent still unexploited database with the WIIW database on Foreign Direct Investment in Central, East and Southeast Europe, we can carry out an econometric analysis, using data with both a country, industry and time dimension.Footnote 3
 There are two other important features of our paper that distinguish it from the previous literature. First, we investigate formally how the size of overall benefits associated with FDI depends on the absorptive capacity of the recipient country, which allows us to shed more light on the cross-country variation in the estimated effects of FDI found in previous studies. The concept of absorptive capacity is based on the idea that the potentially positive impact of FDI on the receiving economy may fail to materialise if domestic companies lack sufficient abilities to imitate or adopt superior technologies used by foreign firms. Absorptive capacity can be measured in various ways, for example on the basis of human capital indicators or using the relative productivity level (see Sect. 3 for details). Second, in the empirical part we employ two alternative econometric approaches, differing in the extent to which they exploit the industry versus the time dimension of the data. This makes our main conclusions more robust compared to earlier studies that rely only on one single method. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides stylized facts on the catching-up process and foreign capital inflow to Central and Eastern Europe. In Sect. 3, we discuss some theoretical considerations underlying our empirical investigation. Section 4 presents the econometric strategy. Section 5 describes data sources and definitions of variables. The main results and robustness checks are discussed in Sect. 6. Section 7 concludes.",57

145,4,Review of World Economics,06 November 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-009-0034-1,What do we really know about fiscal sustainability in the EU? A panel data diagnostic,January 2010,António Afonso,Christophe Rault,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The sustainability of public finances is a key policy issue for the European Union (EU). Within the EU fiscal framework, fiscal discipline is an important support for the implementation of monetary policy, particularly in the case of the EMU member countries. In EMU, the existence of sound fiscal policies is seen as a necessary objective for individual countries to pursue. It is not possible to exclude adverse responses from the financial markets when fiscal behaviour is deemed to be unsustainable. Indeed, the accumulation of government debt, following continued budgetary imbalances, may in the end trigger the need for higher long-term interest rates in order to place additional sovereign debt in the markets. Moreover, the Treaties governing the EU also require sustainable public finances. Countries are urged to comply with the budgetary requirements of EMU, by avoiding excessive deficits, keeping debt levels below the 60% of GDP reference value, and respecting the requirements of the stability and growth pact (SGP). The aim of this paper is to examine the sustainability of public finances for the EU-15 countries (covering the EU Member States before the 1 May 2004 enlargement) by applying recent advances in the econometrics of non-stationary panel data methods.Footnote 1 The econometric literature on unit roots and cointegration testing has been expanding rapidly, and now distinguishes between the first generation tests developed on the assumption of cross-section independence (except for common time effects), and the second generation tests that allow, in a variety of forms and degrees, the dependence that might prevail across the different units in the panel. This question is crucial and responds to the complex nature of the interactions and dependencies that generally exist over time and across the individual units in the panel. For instance, observations on firms, industries, regions and countries tend to be cross-correlated as well as serially dependent. As pointed out by Breitung and Pesaran (2005), the problem of cross-section dependence is particularly difficult to deal with since it could arise for a variety of reasons, including spatial spillover effects, common unobserved shocks, social interactions, or a combination of these factors. In the context of our paper, cross-dependence can mirror possible changes in the behaviour of fiscal authorities related to the signing of the EU Treaty in Maastricht on 7 February 1992, with the setting up of the convergence criteria that urged the EU countries to consolidate public finances in the run-up to the EMU on 1 January 1999, when most EU legacy currencies were replaced by the euro, and in the context of the SGP since then. Generally, fiscal sustainability is considered on a country basis and can usually only be restored by changing national fiscal policies. From a monetary policy point of view, fiscal policy in the current institutional setting of EMU must be considered a largely national competence and responsibility. Although, even if there is no single fiscal policy in the EU, a panel sustainability analysis of public finances has to be seen as relevant in a context of EU countries seeking to pursue common and sound fiscal policy behaviour within the SGP framework. Possible cross-country dependence can be envisaged either in the run-up to EMU or, for example, via integrated financial markets. Indeed, with cross-country spillovers in government bond markets especially after the completion of the single EU-15 capital market from 1994 were to be expected, interest rates comovements inside the EU became also more noticeable. To the best of our knowledge, few comparable studies have taken into account the possible cross-sectional dependence among countries when investigating the sustainability of public finances for the EU-15 countries. A few studies provide panel unit root and panel cointegration analysis in this context, notably Prohl and Schneider (2006), for eight OECD countries and Claeys (2007) for the EU (not allowing for cross-section dependence). Indeed, although the main analytical techniques used to analyse the sustainability of public finances have been stationarity tests for the stock of public debt and cointegration tests between government expenditures and government revenues, this has been mostly performed for individual countries, which sometimes poses the problem of relatively short time series.Footnote 2 This paper takes these results in the literature regarding the sustainability of public finances, and assesses them to see whether they still hold when more powerful cointegration techniques are employed in a panel framework. Our econometric methodology uses two approaches for unit root testing: panel data integration tests of “first generation” (Im et al. 2003; Levin et al. 2002), which assume cross-sectional independence among panel units (except for common time effects); and panel data unit root tests of the “second generation” (Choi 2006; Moon and Perron 2004), which allow for more general forms of cross sectional dependency (not only limited to common time effects). We also implement panel cointegration techniques developed by Pedroni (1999, 2004), and generalised by Banerjee and Carrion-i-Silvestre (2006) and Westerlund and Edgerton (2007), to a structural long-run equation between general government expenditures and revenues. The advantages of panel data methods within the macro-panel setting include the use of data for which the spans of individual time series data are insufficient for the study of many hypotheses of interest. Other benefits include better properties of the testing procedures when compared to more standard time series methods, and the fact that many of the issues studied, such as convergence, purchasing power parity or the sustainability of public finances, naturally lend themselves to being studied in a panel context. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we briefly review the analytical framework of public finance sustainability. In Sect. 3 we present a brief overview of our fiscal data. In Sect. 4 we perform the stationarity analysis of the fiscal series. In Sect. 5 we report the cointegration results for the general government expenditure and revenue series. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",55

Footnote 1 The majority of countries have opted for such transitional restrictions. In 2004, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Sweden were the only exceptions, and when Bulgaria and Romania became members in 2007, the UK and Ireland too have joined the countries invoking the transitional agreement. Germany, the largest and closest country to those new members, has been particularly strict and, like Austria, intends to extend restrictions until the year 2011. What is the economic rationale for transitional restrictions? Policy makers in Germany and elsewhere fear a large inflow of workers from accession countries and seem to expect rising native unemployment and lower wages. But what is the empirical support for this presumption? Would native workers on average suffer from immigration from the accession countries? If so, by how much? Which types of workers would gain, which would lose? Could the labor inflow give rise to a native welfare gain on the aggregate level?
Footnote 2
 In this paper we give tentative answers to these questions, proceeding in two steps. First, we estimate a set of disaggregate labor demand elasticities that determine whether immigrant and native workers are substitutes or complements in general equilibrium, as well as wage-setting equations that characterize labor market institutions responsible for unemployment. In a second step, we then use these elasticities in order to numerically simulate a counterfactual scenario where Germany would have abstained from the aforementioned transitional immigration restrictions. We compute employment and wage effects, as well as overall welfare effects, thus quantifying the pains and gains foregone by invoking the transition agreement. We follow Borjas (2003) in specifying a system of labor demand functions disaggregated by levels of education and work experience. Using wage and employment data for natives and immigrants from German household survey data, we estimate elasticities of substitution that govern labor demand, allowing for imperfect substitution between native foreign workers.
Footnote 3 Our contribution is to extend this approach by incorporating wage-setting equations along the lines suggested by Layard et al. (2005). This allows us to allow for equilibrium unemployment in our numerical simulation, which is crucial in the European context. For our counterfactual scenario, we utilize information on the recent flows of workers from accession countries into the UK, in order to proxy the size and educational composition of the additional immigration that Germany would have received under free movement without transitional restrictions. Our paper is closely related to D’Amuri et al. (2009) and Brücker and Jahn (2008), but it features key differences in terms of the data used and the empirical strategy employed to model labor market imperfections. Importantly, it focuses on a special policy scenario which is motivated against the backdrop of eastern EU enlargement.
Footnote 4 Our results indicate that in the long run these restrictions have a negative effect on native workers and on overall welfare of native-German factor owners. The only group that profits from the transitional restrictions are incumbent foreigners. In the short run we find a negative, but very small effect on native workers. Hence, it appears difficult to rationalize the use of transitional restrictions in Germany on grounds of political economy. Section 2 explains the theoretical background and estimation framework. It also describes the data and presents key estimation results. Section 3 uses these results to simulate our counterfactual scenario, focusing on how wages and employment of natives as well as foreign workers would have evolved had Germany not imposed transitional restrictions. We also present calculations for forgone welfare effects of natives. Section 4 concludes.",23

This paper considers the impact of this enlargement on service enterprises near to Germany’s eastern border to Poland and the Czech Republic. Specifically, we use panel data from German official statistics for 2003–2005 and treat the EU enlargement as an exogenous shock for enterprises close to Germany’s eastern border. Our results from regression-adjusted difference-in-differences estimators on matched samples suggest a small negative impact on both the turnover and the export intensity of large enterprises situated in a federal state with an eastern border relative to enterprises in other federal states, while we find divergent effects with respect to the turnover and the profitability of small enterprises. There are a number of reasons why we might expect to find an effect of the enlargement on the performance of (service) enterprises. The main theoretical reasoning here follows standard textbook models on the elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade (see e.g. Gandolfo 1998, pp. 195–204): The integration of the eastern countries into the common market lowers previously existing trade barriers and consequently the costs for both enterprises in the old and new membership countries to engage in trade with the respective other country. This (possible) increase in international trade may influence enterprise performance and behavior through an increased competition on the respective domestic market as well as through the emergence of new economic opportunities in the new foreign market. Note that the existence of trade barriers prior to the enlargement is a necessary condition for this effect to emerge as otherwise a decrease in trade costs is logically impossible. In this study, we focus on service enterprises as strong legislative barriers existed in this sector before the expansion, for instance through residence and work permits as well as through the approval of foreign degrees in occupations with minimum qualification requirements (see Scharr and Untiedt 2001, p. 186).Footnote 1 The case would be different for manufacturing where free trade agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic had been established as early as 1992 (European Agreement 1993, 1994). While an increase in international trade could still emerge through less restrictive border controls and lower waiting times, the effects of the EU enlargement on trade in goods is likely to be quite small (see Scharr and Untiedt 2001, p. 185). Additionally, note that the effects of the EU enlargement should be stronger for enterprises close to Germany’s eastern border as services often require a personal contact between buyer and seller which is obviously cheaper to establish for both importers and exporters that are geographically close to the border. In our empirical investigation, we exploit this fact and compare differences over time within enterprises that are situated in a federal state with a border to the new member states with differences over time within enterprises that are situated in a federal state without such a border. This paper is—to the best of our knowledge—the first study that considers the impact of the 2004 EU enlargement on enterprise performance. There is, however, a small empirical literature that considers the economic consequences of the opening of borders. Hanson (1996) finds that the increasing economic integration of Mexico and the United States and the resulting expansion in Mexican exports has increased US manufacturing employment in several border cities. Egger and Egger (2002) find a significant relationship between trade in intermediate and final goods and industry wages in eastern and central European countries. Moritz and Gröger (2007) consider the impact of the fall of the Iron Curtain on the wages of Bavarian workers close to the Czech border using a 2% sample from German social security and unemployment benefit records and find relatively minor effects on wages and the skill distribution in the border region. However, none of these studies deal with the economic consequences of the EU enlargement. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the data, while our empirical modeling strategy is outlined in Sect. 3. Results are presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",8

Apart from offering additional investment resources, FDI may help host countries foster economic development by offering access to internationally available technologies and managerial know-how, rendering it easier for the host countries to penetrate foreign markets, and making them less prone to sudden reversal of flows in times of crisis. At the UN Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2002, Heads of State and Government propagated the view that FDI provides an important means to eradicate poverty in developing countries. According to the Monterrey Consensus, the central challenge is to overcome the concentration of FDI in few (large and relatively advanced) developing countries so that poor countries would be able to reap the benefits of FDI (UN 2002). Hence, it is not surprising that policy makers in almost all countries are engaged in fierce competition for FDI inflows. However, it has remained disputed as to how effective the means are that national policy makers have at their disposal when attempting to attract FDI. Major driving forces of FDI (e.g., the size and development of host country markets, the endowment of local factors of production, and geographical and cultural proximity to major source countries) are largely beyond the realm of short-term policy making. This may explain why policy makers have increasingly pinned their hopes on two sets of measures: (i) unilateral regulatory changes and incentives such as opening up previously restricted industries, removing foreign ownership restrictions, promotional efforts, and tax and fiscal inducements; and (ii) bilateral agreements through which host country governments commit themselves to binding obligations, e.g., concerning the entry of foreign investors, post-entry regulations, profit remittances and dispute settlement. In this paper, we focus on the effectiveness of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) in stimulating additional FDI inflows. The few empirical studies addressing this question have produced highly ambiguous results (Sect. 2). We suspect that this is at least partly due to the fairly small sample of host countries covered by most previous studies. We make use of the extensive data on bilateral FDI flows collected by UNCTAD (which is largely unpublished, but available from its Data Extract Service). In this way, we avoid a sample selection bias which is likely to arise when the sample is restricted to relatively advanced host countries. Moreover, this paper is the first to address the issue of isolating the effects of BITs from the effects of unilateral regulatory changes on FDI inflows. After reviewing the results obtained by previous studies in Sect. 2, we illustrate some stylized facts on both BITs and unilateral measures to liberalize the capital account in Sect. 3. The gravity-type model applied is presented in Sect. 4, where we also discuss methodological choices (notably the use of bilateral FDI flows) as well as the data employed. Sect. 5 reports our main results. We find that BITs are effective in promoting FDI inflows and may even substitute for weak domestic institutions, though probably not for unilateral regulatory measures to promote FDI. Various robustness checks are carried out in Sect. 6. Sect. 7 concludes.",114

Micro-level wage effects of international outsourcing in three European countries,April 2010,Ingo Geishecker,Holger Görg,Jakob Roland Munch,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Over the last years globalisation and its alleged negative effects for the distribution of income, unemployment, poverty and social cohesion has caused immense public anxiety in Europe, particularly against the backdrop of eastern enlargement of the European Union. Indeed, globalisation in the form of intensified international trade and, in particular, international outsourcing of production, has a deep structural impact fostering the specialisation of open economies in industries where they possess a comparative advantage. Other, less competitive industries on the other hand shrink. Following standard trade theory, international specialisation is expected to yield significant efficiency gains improving the welfare of open economies.
Footnote 1
 However, even if there are overall welfare gains there will inevitably be distributional consequences leading to winners and losers of the globalisation process in the economy. This paper concerns itself with one aspect of globalisation, namely the practice of outsourcing of production around the globe. A key feature of today’s globalisation process is the ever increasing international fragmentation of production resulting in outsourcing, that manifests itself in a fast growing share of trade with intermediate goods. What we witness now is a dramatically intensified international division of labour which does not only take place between industries but is prevalent within each manufacturing industry and increasingly within business services. Trade liberalisation and technological progress have substantially lowered transaction costs which increasingly enables firms to outsource and relocate production to those locations where production costs are lowest. Analogue to conventional trade this outsourcing potentially yields large efficiency gains that materialise in the form of increased competitiveness and thus higher growth and employment.
Footnote 2 However, it is also clear that this process generates winners and losers. Particularly low-skilled workers in industrialised countries are arguably at risk to suffer higher economic insecurity, income losses, unemployment and social exclusion. The aim of the paper is, hence, to try and identify winners and losers from international outsourcing in European economies. Specifically, we investigate the impact of outsourcing on wages of individual workers. A further aim of the paper is to establish whether the impact of international outsourcing differs across countries with different types of welfare states and, in particular, labour market institutions. In other words, we try to address the question as to what role labour market institutions may play in shaping the wage effect of international outsourcing on workers. This makes our paper of particular relevance in the European context and highlights the importance of institutional characteristics of the labour market that affect the wage setting. Welfare states face the challenge of mitigating adverse effects of the globalisation process while at the same time the institutional characteristics of the welfare system directly shape the potential welfare gains and losses from international outsourcing. In the public but also academic debate one often refers to the European Social Model or the European Welfare System partly to contrast the American Social Model. However, institutional characteristics of the welfare system starkly differ within Europe. Somewhat simplifying, one can identify three types of social models within the European Union: the Anglo-Saxon, the Central European and the Scandinavian. All three substantially differ in terms of institutions and legislation particularly with respect to employment protection, unemployment benefits, minimum wages or the role of unions. The literature lacks detailed theories on how labour market institutions affect the impact of outsourcing on wages, so it is an open question that will be addressed empirically in this paper which social model is best suited to cope with the challenges of globalisation through outsourcing of production. Empirical evidence so far suggests that low-skilled workers are the losers from international outsourcing of production in many countries.
Footnote 3 However, the existing empirical studies generally use fairly aggregated data which prevents an in-depth analysis of the social impact of this phenomenon. Namely, existing studies do not allow to separate changes in the composite demand for various skill groups in wage and employment effects. Furthermore, using aggregated data does not allow differentiating absolute gains and losses from relative ones. However, when designing policies it clearly matters whether the task is for instance to tackle increased income inequality that comes through absolute wage gains for highly educated workers or through absolute wage losses of low-skilled workers. This paper provides a detailed disaggregated estimation of the impact of international outsourcing on individual wages for various population groups. We will identify winners and losers from the globalisation process and assess to what extent education and, thus, skills determine the individually experienced impact of globalisation. Although wages at the aggregate level are central determinants of social cohesion our micro level approach allows us to also look at other important factors. It is now not only possible to look at aggregated wage effects but also to assess the role of globalisation for individual economic security that manifests itself in annual income fluctuations. The analysis is carried out for three countries: the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark, that exemplary stand for the three different social models in Europe and significantly differ in terms of the institutional setting. Comparing the social impact of relocation across these three countries can provide interesting new insights into the role of institutions and social policies for shaping and mitigating the impact of globalisation. Section 2 discusses briefly the theoretical background and the expected impact of labour market institutions on the relationship between international outsourcing and wages. Section 3 describes the empirical approach, measurement of outsourcing and micro data for the three countries. Estimation results are reported in Sect. 4. The final section offers a brief conclusion.",26
146,2,Review of World Economics,10 April 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0054-x,Preferential trade agreements and their role in world trade,June 2010,Denis Medvedev,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) have been on the forefront of the trade policy agenda for over forty years, since the Treaty of Rome—the precursor to today’s European Union (EU)—became the first modern agreement to enter into force in 1958. Since Tinbergen (1962) pioneered the inclusion of a PTA dummy variable in the gravity equation, most of the ex post analyses of the impact of PTAs on trade flows have relied on the gravity framework. Despite the large volume of research, however, surprisingly little agreement exists on the average impact of PTAs on trade flows between members. For example, Ghosh and Yamarik (2004) used extreme bounds analysis to conclude that most estimates of PTA treatment effects tend to be “fragile,” and a meta-analysis exercise by World Bank (2004, Chap. 3) found that the variance about the average semi-elasticity of imports with respect to PTA membership is large enough to make the effect insignificantly different from zero. There are a number of potential reasons for the lack of empirical consensus on PTA treatment effects. With few exceptions (e.g., Rose and van Wincoop 2001; Adams et al. 2003; Baier and Bergstrand 2007), the majority of studies have not used the theoretically correct version of the gravity equation, which results in biased coefficient estimates as shown by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003). Some authors (e.g., Adams et al. 2003) have also explored the impact of zero/missing trade flows, arguing that failure to take them into account introduces additional bias in the estimates. Others (e.g., Baier and Bergstrand 2004) have focused on the potential endogeneity of the PTA membership dummy. Still others (e.g., Li 2000; Adams et al. 2003) have attempted to depart from the dummy variable approach and create explanatory variables that better reflect the heterogeneity of PTAs in force. This paper picks up on several of these themes by arguing that at least two variables in the previous gravity analyses have been misspecified. The first is the number of PTAs considered in the analysis: while most studies account only for a small subset of all PTAs in existence, this paper relies upon a comprehensive data base of the PTAs in force which includes agreements not notified to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The second is the dependent variable, which I argue should be restricted to trade flows that can be meaningfully considered “preferential.” In order to do this, the paper combines the PTA data base with detailed data on trade flows to exclude trade in tariff lines with zero or very low most favored nation (MFN) rates, where the margin of preference is not high enough to justify importing goods under the preferential regime. I then generate two sets of theoretically consistent gravity estimates: one using total bilateral trade as the dependent variable, and one in which only preferential trade is considered. The preferential specification also allows me to estimate the impact of product exclusions and long phase-in periods on trade between PTA members, as well as assess how the impact of PTAs on bilateral trade changes with the type of agreement: notified or un-notified to the WTO, and North-North vs. North-South vs. South-South. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the information in the PTA data base, details the methodology used in calculating the share of world trade covered by PTAs, and presents the estimates. Section 3 builds a gravity model of preferential trade and presents the estimates. Section 4 explores some alternative specifications and provides estimates of the impact of product exclusions and phase-in periods. Section 5 offers concluding remarks.",24

Djerdjian,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There is an overwhelming consensus in the political economy literature regarding the vital role ideology and inequality play in trade policy formation. Within a Heckscher–Ohlin framework, the ideology hypothesis states that a pro-capitalist (pro-worker) government will take pro-trade (anti-trade) policies in capital-abundant countries. And, a pro-capitalist (pro-worker) government will take anti-trade (pro-trade) policies in labor-abundant countries. Furthermore, within a median voter framework, as in Mayer (1984), the inequality hypothesis states that as inequality increases, the median voter votes for anti-trade (pro-trade) policies in capital (labor) abundant countries. Both hypotheses have been empirically tested with encouraging results.Footnote 1
 We focus here on an interactive model where both ideology and inequality interact to determine trade policy. The precise manner in which these variables intermingle can be derived from a Bergson–Samuelson social welfare function that reflects both economic (i.e., national welfare) and political (i.e., ideology, inequality) considerations. As inequality increases, a pro-worker government takes more anti-trade (pro-trade) policies in capital (labor) abundant countries to transfer wealth from the capital-rich to the capital-poor. Furthermore, as inequality increases, and capital accumulates in the hands of few lobbying capitalists, a pro–capitalist government takes more pro-trade (anti-trade) policies in capital (labor) abundant countries to transfer wealth from the capital-poor to the capital-rich. Hence, in a pro-worker regime, an increase in inequality leads to more equitable trade policies. And, in a pro-capitalist regime, an increase in inequality leads to more inequitable trade policies. We augment this interactive model by incorporating an important determinant of trade policy formation. We consider a model that encompasses both the interactive political (ideology-inequality) hypothesis and the strategic economic (scale) hypothesis.Footnote 2 The inclusion of economies of scale as a strategic consideration for trade policy is justified on both theoretical and empirical grounds. Ethier (1982a) employs economies of scale, external to the firm but internal to the industry, and finds that some countries may be better-off imposing trade barriers.Footnote 3 On the empirical level, Antweiler and Trefler (2002) discover that one-third of all industries display evidence of economies of scale. Furthermore, Paul and Siegel (1999) and Hanson (2005) show support for small but significant scale economies in manufacturing. Within a standard two-good (one good produced under economies of scale) and two-factor general equilibrium model of trade between two countries, the capital-abundant country specializes in the capital-intensive good produced under increasing returns to scale and the labor-abundant country in the labor-intensive good produced under constant returns to scale. Since economies of scale reduce the average cost of production, the labor-abundant country will have an incentive to raise its tariffs on the goods produced under economies of scale to realize the welfare gains from expanding that industry at home. Alternately, the capital-abundant country will have the opposite incentive toward its own trade policy. Thus, the augmented model predicts that an increase in the scale effect leads to restrictive trade policies in labor-abundant countries and liberal trade policies in capital-abundant countries. In conclusion, using nested and non-nested tests, we show that the model which encompasses economies of scale, ideology and inequality dominates in terms of explanatory power over models which include either political (ideology, inequality) or strategic economic (economies of scale) variables. The paper proceeds in the following manner. Section 2 lays out the basic theoretical model and integrates both economic (scale) and interactive political (ideology, inequality) considerations and determines equilibrium trade policies. Section 3 presents the data and the econometric specification. Section 4 empirically evaluates the results of the theoretical predictions. Section 5 considers the possibility of endogeneity and provides Hausman regressions and Sect. 6 concludes.",1

The only question is: How big is the magic? (Baldwin 2006, p. 36) Since the pioneering work of Rose (2000) and his result that currency unions increase trade by more than 200%, a whole new stream of literature has emerged and thrived, focusing especially on the eurozone in recent years. How much does the euro boost trade among eurozone members? While some researchers are rather skeptical to search for “the one number” (e.g., Richard Baldwin, as the opening quotation suggests), others keep seeking: in a narrative literature review, Frankel (2008a) estimates the euro’s Rose effect to lie between 10 and 15%. Even Baldwin (2006, p. 48) himself talks about 5–10% and expects the effect to double as the euro matures. This question is very attractive for welfare economists and policy makers: for instance, Frankel (2008b) uses his estimates to give Central and Eastern European countries advice on the timing of their admission to the eurozone; and Masson (2008), employing the result that “currency unions double trade,” asseses the welfare effects of creating a monetary union in Africa. There has been one meta-analysis
Footnote 1 on this subject. Rose and Stanley (2005), using a combined sample of studies on both the eurozone and other currency unions, report the general underlying effect to lie between 30 and 90%. The purpose of this paper is to extend the aforementioned work by including new studies and different meta-analysis methods, which enables us to concentrate on the effects of the euro and other currency unions separately. It is shown that the distinction between euro and non-euro studies is important since both sub-samples tell a very different story. Twenty-seven new studies were added to the sample, 21 of which focuse on the eurozone. Together, there are 61 studies, 28 on the eurozone and 33 on other currency unions (see Table 4 in the Appendix). We examine publication bias among the literature (Card and Krueger 1995; Stanley 2005a), using the meta-regression approach (Stanley and Jarrell 1989; Stanley et al. 2008) and graphical methods (funnel plots, Galbraith plots); the “true” underlying effect is estimated as well. The meta-regression analysis (MRA) by Rose and Stanley (2005) is augmented with multiple different techniques (robust estimators, multilevel methods). Explanatory meta-regression methods, including robust meta-regression (see, for example, Bowland and Beghin 2001) and random effects meta-regression (Abreu et al. 2005), are used to examine systematic dependencies of results on study design and thus to model the heterogeneity present in the sample. Moreover, a test for the “economics research cycle” is conducted (novelty and fashion in economics research, see Goldfarb 1995). The paper is structured as follows: in Sect. 2, the essence of meta-analysis is briefly described and the basic properties of the sample of literature are discussed. Section 3 focuses on publication selection and search for the true Rose effect beyond publication bias. In Sect. 4, the explanatory MRA is conducted. Section 5 concludes.",64

First, the results indicate that wholly-owned affiliates, in contrast to partially-owned affiliates, can circumvent financial constraints during periods of sharp currency depreciation by accessing capital from their parent companies and related parties. The ratio of loans granted from a German parent company to total assets of a wholly-owned affiliate increases by about 2% points during years of sharp currency depreciation in emerging markets. Meanwhile, this ratio is lower by about 2.5% points in the case of partially-owned affiliates during episodes of currency crises. Decomposing the partial ownership structure into minority and majority-owned affiliates shows that the negative effect on the loan ratio is more pronounced in the case of minority-owned affiliates. With regards to differences in sales of both types of firms, the evidence suggests that sales of partially-owned affiliates decline in periods of crises, while wholly-owned affiliates manage to keep their sales unaltered. Second, the results suggest that wholly-owned affiliates rely more on debt shifting than partially-owned affiliates. Particularly, a 10% increase in the corporate tax rate in emerging markets increases the ratio of total debt to total asset of wholly-owned affiliates by about 27% points. However, for partially-owned and minority-owned affiliates, we cannot find evidence on debt shifting responses to higher tax rates. This is also true in the sample of affiliates operating in OECD countries suggesting that the ownership structure matters for tax planning and debt policy of affiliates not only in emerging markets but also in advanced economies. These findings are linked to two branches in the literature: the literature on the costs of shared ownership and the literature on the effects of sharp depreciations and currency crises. Theoretical and empirical studies that address the costs of sharing the ownership of the affiliate emphasise aspects such as coordination costs and the cost of shared control rights and technology; Desai et al. (2004), Ramachandran (1993), and Grossman and Hart (1986). Furthermore, costs of shared ownership arise with regard to shifting taxable profit from high tax to low tax rate countries. For instance, Weichenrieder (2009) finds that a change in the tax rate has a larger impact on the profitability of wholly-owned than partially-owned German affiliates. Desai et al. (2004) find a similar effect for US affiliates. In this context, our results point out to two new potential costs of shared ownership. The first finding indicates that accommodating the financial needs of multinational affiliates is easier when the parent enjoys full control over the affiliate. In periods of currency crises it is more difficult for partially-owned affiliates to access capital from parent companies than wholly-owned affiliates. The second finding on debt shifting experiences suggests that multinational firms engage in worldwide tax planning not only with respect to profit shifting but also with respect to debt policy. However, the reaction of partially-owned affiliates is not consistent with international debt shifting. This result is a new evidence that partially-owned affiliates are less inclined to be shaped in a tax efficient way.Footnote 1
 The effects of sharp depreciations and currency crises are examined in the literature by focusing on various aspects. A macroeconomic aspect includes for example studies that investigate the response of macroeconomic variables such as output and the current account to currency depreciations (Gupta et al. 2007). A microeconomic aspect concentrates on financial issues such as the foreign exchange exposure of the firm and corporate financial policies around periods of sharp depreciation (Bris and Koskinen 2002; Bris et al. 2004). There are recent attempts, to which this paper belongs, to use data at the firm level to provide microeconomic evidence on ideas that have macroeconomic interpretations. For example, Desai et al. (2008) compare the reaction of US affiliates with local firms to currency depreciations, and conclude that US affiliates, in contrast to local firms, expand their activities after sharp depreciations. This finding supports the idea that foreign direct investment (FDI) tends to mitigate the negative effect of a sharp depreciation or the severity of a currency crises. As an explanation for their finding, Desai et al. (2008) provide evidence for the hypothesis that foreign affiliates overcome financial constraints through internal capital markets with the parent companies. These results are connected to the rich literature on the positive effects of FDI on host economy firms through channels such as technology spillover as for example in Keller and Yeaple (2009).Footnote 2 Alvarez and Görg (2007) consider a distinct but related issue of employment response of multinational subsidiaries and local firms in a period of economic slowdown in Chile, and find no evidence on differential reactions between both types of firms. In conjunction with this literature, our results contribute to the evidence that FDI helps in mitigating the negative consequences of sharp currency depreciations. Moreover, the results put forth that the effect works especially through inflows of loans from parent companies and related parties to wholly-owned affiliates. This is an indication of a negative effect of restricting foreign ownership of the affiliates by the law of the host economy. This paper proceeds as follows: In Sect. 2, we describe the data, identify episodes of sharp currency depreciation and provide descriptive statistics. We present our empirical results in Sect. 3 and conclude in Sect. 4.",14

First evidence from linked employer-employee data",June 2010,Thorsten Schank,Claus Schnabel,Joachim Wagner,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Exporting firms pay higher wages than firms that serve the national market only. This is one of the stylized facts from the emerging literature on the micro-econometrics of international firm activities. It was pointed out by Bernard and Jensen (1995) in their pioneering Brookings Paper, and it has been confirmed in a large number of studies (surveyed in Schank et al. 2007) with firm level data from many different countries. Some recent studies using linked employer-employee data have demonstrated that this positive link between export activities and the level of wages paid by a firm can even be found after controlling for observed and unobserved characteristics of both the employer and the employees.Footnote 1
 An issue that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been investigated empirically with linked employer-employee data is the sequencing behind the correlation of export activities and higher wages at the firm level. Does exporting lead to a wage premium? Or did exporting firms pay a wage premium even before they started to export? Theoretical considerations point to possible links in both directions that are by no means mutually exclusive: Hypothesis 1 (H1): The observed exporter wage premium reflects self-selection of more productive firms with higher wages into export markets. The recent literature on exporting by heterogeneous firms, pioneered by Melitz (2003) and surveyed by Greenaway and Kneller (2007), argues that only the more productive firms in an industry can bear the extra costs of entering foreign markets. In these models, exporters are more productive than non-exporters, and we observe self-selection of more productive firms into export activities, with the ex ante more productive firms becoming exporters. If wages are higher in more productive firms—due to higher profits and rent-sharing, or because higher (efficiency) wages cause higher productivity (see Akerlof and Yellen 1986)Footnote 2—and if more productive firms self-select into export markets, we expect that these future exporters already paid a wage premium to the workers ex ante, i.e. before they started to export. Hypothesis 2 (H2): Exporting makes firms more productive and leads to higher wages. This hypothesis found in the literature on exports and productivity points to the role of learning-by-exporting (see Bernard and Jensen 1999; Bernard and Wagner 1997; Baldwin and Gu 2003). Knowledge flows from international buyers and competitors help to improve the post-entry performance of export starters (see Crespi et al. 2008). Furthermore, firms participating in international markets are exposed to more intense competition and must improve faster than firms which only sell their products domestically. Exporting thus makes firms more productive. If wages are higher in more productive firms due to higher profits and rent-sharing, we may expect that exporting leads to higher wages. More specifically, this hypothesis predicts that after a firm has started to export, the wages of its employees increase stronger than the wages of employees who work in firms that continue to produce for the national market only, leading to an ex post exporter wage premium.Footnote 3 Mainly due to a lack of suitable data at the level of individuals, these two hypotheses have not been convincingly investigated for wages.Footnote 4 Since empirical studies of exporter wage differentials must control for observed and unobserved characteristics of both employers and employees that might determine wages besides exporting, they have to use linked employer-employee (LEE) panel data. To investigate the relevance of both the self-selection hypothesis and the learning-by-exporting hypothesis in explaining exporter wage differentials, LEE data are needed which cover a period that is long enough to follow cohorts of firms over a couple of years before and after they start to export, and which can be used to test for ex ante and ex post wage differentials. Apparently, such LEE data were not available until recently. Using suitable LEE data for Germany, a leading actor on the world market for goods, this paper contributes to the literature by testing the two hypotheses mentioned above on the direction of the link between exporting and wages.Footnote 5 For the period 1994–2006, we show that the exporter wage premium does already exist in the years before firms start to export, and that it does not increase in the years after exporting started. According to our findings, higher wages in exporting firms are due to self-selection of more productive, better paying firms into export markets, but they are not caused by export activities. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the LEE data. Section 3 presents the results of our empirical investigation, and Sect. 4 concludes.",36

Feinberg,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Small firms have been shown to be particularly vulnerable to international competition. However, that research, along with almost all of the empirical literature on determinants of exit or firm survival, has been confined to the manufacturing sector of the economy. Are firms further down the distribution chain, small wholesalers and retailers, hurt by real exchange rate movements? The answer is not obvious, as determinants of survival or exit likely differ between retail (and wholesale) establishments and manufacturing firms. To the extent that currency appreciation results in lower prices on manufactured goods which can be passed on in the distribution chain to consumers, wholesale and retail sales may increase and these firms may prosper. However, if upstream manufacturers respond by pressuring the downstream wholesalers and retailers to tighten margins the impact may not be as favorable. Furthermore, if some wholesalers are closely tied to particular manufacturers, or to purely domestic distribution channels, they will be more likely to be negatively affected by stronger foreign competition. Retailers, in contrast, may simply purchase from the cheapest supplier and pass along to their customers the lower manufactured/wholesale prices resulting from gains in the external value of the currency. Annual data for 1989–1998 for 58 SIC-based wholesale and retail sectors and for 1998–2005 for 48 comparable NAICS-based sectors,Footnote 1 from the Statistics of US Business (SUSB), available from the US Small Business Administration (in collaboration with the US Census Bureau), are analyzed below to explain small firm exit rates in several employment size categories—under 10 employees, 10–19 employees, 20–99 employees, and 100–499 employees. While there is variation across industry sectors, the basic result is that wholesalers respond negatively to a stronger currency in a manner similar to that of manufacturers, while retailers are generally unaffected.",4
146,2,Review of World Economics,02 April 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0053-y,Euro area inflation: aggregation bias and convergence,June 2010,Joseph P. Byrne,Norbert Fiess,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"“One significant feature of euro area inflation differentials is their persistence” Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, 31 March 2006. Since the inception of European Monetary Union (EMU), the European Central Bank (ECB) has focused on aggregate euro area inflation. There are growing concerns that by focusing on aggregate data, national inflation rates may actually diverge. Such divergence, if persistent, could prove harmful to monetary union in the long term. While different explanations for diverging euro area inflation rates have been brought forward, to date, the very impact of aggregation on this persistence has not been studied. Aggregation is important since it may act as a veil and suggest persistent inflation differentials when disaggregate inflation rates actually converge. This issue is highly relevant to current euro area members, as adherence to an inappropriate model can be costly. It is also of particular interest to potential future EMU entrants as well as others interested in emulating an EMU style currency union. The primary objective of the ECB is to achieve stable inflation and initial evidence suggests that it has been successful in achieving this aggregate goal (Wyplosz 2006). The ECB targets a single euro area inflation rate, calculated as annual changes of a weighted average of national consumer prices indices (CPIs). A major concern, however, is that by targeting a euro area aggregate, inflation rates of individual member countries may actually diverge. While identifying national inflation divergence is in principal straightforward, evidence of divergence may be driven by aggregation bias over heterogeneous dynamic cross section (see Pesaran and Smith 1995; Altissimo et al. 2006, 2009; Imbs et al. 2005a, b, 2009). Economic theory is ambiguous about the impact of monetary union on inflation divergence. The optimum currency area literature would suggest that in the absence of nominal exchange rate flexibility, inflation differentials will take on the role of shock absorbers. Inflation divergence could also originate from the Balassa–Samuelson effect, as countries with accelerating productivity growth may experience higher inflation. Furthermore, monetary union produces lower real interest rates for countries with higher inflation, which generates a tendency to perpetuate inflation differentials.Footnote 1 A growing empirical literature examines divergence of inflation in EMU. Recent studies have identified some divergence of aggregate inflation since the beginning of monetary union. Lane (2006) identifies high level of persistence in inflation differentials across EMU members. Busetti et al. (2007), using formal methods, find evidence of recent divergence in euro area inflation based on panel tests for stationarity which are robust to cross-sectional correlation. We seek to extend Busetti et al. (2007) with respect to sectoral inflation data. Our main concern is whether aggregate inflation data overstates evidence of inflation divergence, as the process of aggregation can affect the dynamic properties of the data and as a result can make common effects more pervasive and less stationary. Empirical work by Imbs et al. (2005a),Footnote 2 Altissimo et al. (2006, 2009) support evidence of aggregation bias. Imbs et al. (2005a) find evidence of purchasing power parity (PPP) when they utilise disaggregate Eurostat price data. PPP evidence is absent at the aggregate level because of aggregation bias. Impediments to price arbitrage are expected to vary with different goods’ characteristics. This gives rise to high relative price persistence at the aggregate level but lower relative price persistence at the disaggregate level. In a paper that summarizes work by the euro area Inflation Persistence Network, Altissimo et al. (2006) investigate sectoral and aggregate inflation dynamics in the euro area. Altissimo et al. (2006) suggest that aggregation bias can be found when examining the level of inflation and report a very high degree of inflation persistence at the aggregate level, but find a considerably reduced level of inflation persistence at sectoral level. The authors attribute this to the influence of transitory sector-specific shocks that are “smoothed” out through aggregation. Given the importance of disaggregation for convergence stories of inflation, it seems surprising that the literature has not yet tested the inflation divergence hypothesis using both aggregate and disaggregate data in EMU. This paper intends to fill this gap. While the primary aim of this paper is to inform theoretical work on the stylised facts regarding inflation differentials, we nevertheless aim to provide some lessons for the conduct of monetary policy. The current debate on the persistence of inflation differentials in the euro area appears to offer a wide range of policy implications: from no action at all to calls for national accommodating fiscal and structural policies and even recommendations to increase the safety margin around the ECB inflation rate target or to raise the inflation target itself to avoid deflation in some countries, see Sinn and Reutter (2001). Our paper focuses explicitly on the impact of aggregation on the nature of inflation differentials. Evidence of aggregation bias would have wide-ranging policy implications: rather than changing policies, it may be advisable to change the way we construct the aggregate or at least be aware of sectoral performance. In the presence of aggregation bias, the use of a different set of weights (e.g., giving more weight to countries with more persistent dynamics) may improve effectiveness of the ECB in achieving its goal. Issing (2005) discusses if inflation series less responsive to shocks or policy changes should receive a larger weighting in the euro area inflation aggregate, and this might then prove even more to the point. This all highlights the information content of disaggregate data. Our study tries neither to identify the determinants of euro area inflation differentials nor to uncover to what extent determinants of inflation differentials differ for aggregate and disaggregate data. Our primary concern here is to establish to what extent aggregation explains the observed persistence of euro area inflation differentials. As aggregation bias is associated with the dynamic properties of time series, see, e.g., Pesaran and Smith (1995), conditioning on other explanatory variables will not remove it. Unless we can rule out aggregation bias, the identification of other determinants of inflation differentials (either at aggregate or disaggregate level) seems to us therefore of secondary importance. We use a novel data set of disaggregate euro area harmonized indices of consumer prices (HICP) to systematically investigate if the level of persistence of inflation differentials is related to the level of aggregation. We test for a unit root in relative inflation in the euro area using the Panel Analysis of Non-stationarity in Idiosyncratic and Common components (PANIC) approach suggested by Bai and Ng (2004) with the number of estimated common factors using Bai and Ng’s (2002) information criteria. This approach accounts for cross-sectional correlation and a multiple factor structure, it further provides evidence to what extent idiosyncratic and common factors explain non-stationarity in inflation differentials. Using aggregate inflation data we do not find evidence of pervasive convergence. However, when we examine disaggregate inflation differences we do find evidence of pervasive convergence. Our results are robust to cross-sectional correlation and structural breaks. A Monte Carlo experiment further confirms that our results are not due to the different cross-sectional dimensions in the panel data sets. The greater evidence of non-stationary aggregate inflation differentials is consistent with theoretical and empirical evidence on aggregation bias of inter alia Pesaran and Smith (1995), Imbs et al. (2005a, b) and Altissimo et al. (2006, 2009). Difficulties do arise in the examination of the euro area given the short time span since its inception. Our panel approach seeks to compensate the paucity of time series data on euro area by fully utilising the cross-sectional dimension. And given that both panels have the same time dimension the different results at the aggregate and disaggregate levels are not dependent upon only 10 years of data on the euro area. The rest of the paper is laid out as follows: Sect. 2 provides a brief review of relevant literature; Sect. 3 discusses the econometric methods used in this paper; Sect. 4 discusses the aggregate and disaggregate data from Eurostat; Sect. 5 provides results based on our panel data set and a Monte Carlo simulation of the statistical properties of our main estimator; and Sect. 6 concludes and makes policy recommendations.",3
146,2,Review of World Economics,01 April 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0051-0,Output collapses and productivity destruction,June 2010,Juan S. Blyde,Christian Daude,Eduardo Fernández-Arias,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper assesses the evolution of long-run total factor productivity (TFP) dynamics after a significant collapse of GDP and its associated welfare impact, measured by the resulting gap between actual and counterfactual levels of TFP. We focus on the TFP gap instead of the GDP gap in order to leave aside gross output reductions associated with lower factor accumulation. Thus, the TFP gap is a measure of efficiency costs directly linked to welfare losses, net of investment costs in factor accumulation. Cleary, the potential welfare costs of a GDP collapse will depend critically on the persistence of the subsequent TFP gap: i.e. the faster the recovery in productivity, the lower the welfare cost. Given our focus on welfare costs, we are particularly interested in exploring the conditions and shocks under which a GDP collapse is associated with a very persistent—possibly permanent—decline of aggregate productivity. This focus on TFP jibes well with the well established finding that TFP is the main determinant of economic development in the long run (e.g. see Easterly and Levine 2001). For example, the empirical evidence of growth accounting exercises shows that a systematic shortfall in TFP growth is the main factor behind the widening gap in per capita income between Latin America and developed countries over the past 50 years (Blyde and Fernández-Arias 2005). This is also consistent with the evidence compiled by Kehoe and Prescott (2007) that changes in TFP are the main driver of the 16 great depressions during the 20th century studied in their book. While these papers basically perform an accounting exercise, in most cases the implicit causality goes from TFP shocks to output performance. A mechanic interpretation of our focus on the evolution of TFP after an output collapse could suggest an implicit causality in the opposite direction, but we acknowledge that causality could run both ways, as pointed out by Cerra and Saxena (2008). While we explore the causal interpretation of growth collapses leading to persistent productivity effects by specifically looking at a subsample of collapse episodes generated by exogenous factors, by and large we take an agnostic approach.Footnote 1 Therefore, the main contribution of the paper is to explore the productivity dynamics after an output collapse and the transmission channels at work. If collapses are associated with detrimental persistent effects on the level of TFP, then they may lead to a lower average growth rate of GDP over long periods of time. If so, output shocks may generate a widening income gap between those countries that experience lots of them and those that do not, on account of those countries with incomplete TFP recovery within the sampling period. In particular, a permanently lower level of TFP would translate into a permanent effect on the level of GDP and, therefore, a reduction in the long-term growth rates. If sharp output collapses are associated with persistent declines in TFP, they could be an important factor behind the absolute income divergence that has been observed in the world according to Pritchett (1997). Our methodological approach is based on a characterization of the anatomy of events and an exploration of some factors that have a significant correlation with the magnitude and duration of the decline in TFP. This alternative to the standard cross-country panel approach used in the empirical growth literature has received some attention in recent times due to the methodological shortcomings of cross-country regressions and their disappointing results in terms of policy evaluation. For example, Pritchett (2000) points out that systematic differences across countries in volatility and trends of GDP series make cross-country growth regressions essentially uninformative, while an approach that establishes some stylized facts by analyzing episodes and events associated with surges or collapses of output might be more enlightening.Footnote 2
 From a theoretical point of view, once market equilibrium in factor accumulation and utilization is restored after an output collapse, the existence of permanent income effects depends on the resulting steady-state aggregate productivity or TFP. In fact, if steady-state productivity remains unchanged, then growth rates would be altered during the period of collapse and recovery but the (average) long-term growth rate over this cycle would not. Consequently, welfare costs would be limited, associated with the transitory cyclical downturn. By contrast, if the collapse is associated with a decline in steady-state TFP, that is to say, if there is “productivity destruction”, then income would be reduced permanently and welfare costs would not be confined to a transition period but would continue accruing permanently. In the framework of a neoclassical growth model, an output collapse may be caused by an exogenous collapse in TFP or by shocks to distortions on investment and utilization of physical capital and other inputs, called “wedges” in the literature (see Chari et al. 2007), with no permanent effect on productivity. By contrast, endogenous growth theory provides a better framework to understand the potential mechanisms by which output collapses, whatever their cause, could have a permanent impact on TFP. In these models, an output collapse may erode the fundamentals behind aggregate TFP, thus lowering trend GDP. Furthermore, in some endogenous growth models a collapse may actually diminish the steady-state rate of growth of TFP and consequently of GDP, further reducing trend GDP and increasing the welfare cost.Footnote 3
 A number of endogenous growth models could account for a permanent effect on TFP following an output shock. For example, in models of knowledge accumulation, like Romer (1990) and Grossman and Helpman (1991), a reduction in the fraction of the labor force engaged in research and development (R&D) could have permanent negative effects on the level of productivity. Moreover, if the production of new knowledge depends largely on the stock of existing knowledge, the growth rate of productivity could also be permanently affected. Therefore, in these models, shocks that affect the return of the factors engaged in R&D relative to those engaged in the production of final goods could have potential long standing consequences on productivity. Martin and Rogers (1997) employ an endogenous growth model in which labor productivity is augmented through learning by doing to show that recessions are periods in which opportunities for acquiring experience and improving productivity are foregone. Even if productivity growth resumes after a recession, there would be a permanent wedge in the level of productivity. There is a growing literature studying the role of policy distortions and TFP (see e.g. Parente and Prescott 2000). Restuccia and Rogerson (2008), for example, develop a model of firm heterogeneity in which policies that distort the relative price faced by individual firms can result in large declines of aggregate productivity due to the misallocation of resources. Although not directly related to recessions, the model implies that if crises lead to an upsurge of these distortionary policies, aggregate TFP and output could be significantly affected in the long-run. The facts show that governments often use subsidies, tariffs and quotas, undervalued exchange rates or other policies after recessions to revitalize output and employment. Although such policies can ignite the economy in the short run, they may also hinder aggregate efficiency in the long run to the extent they are not removed and lead to misallocation of resources. Furthermore, output collapses might be accompanied by institutional and social breakdowns, which may destroy intangible “capital” needed for efficient economic cooperation. There is another strand of the literature that shows that economic crisis may have positive impacts on TFP. Following Schumpeter’s notion of creative destruction, Caballero and Hammour (1994), for example, show that recessions may cleanse the economy of inefficient firms, leading to higher productivity and output growth. A related idea is the “pit-stop” view of recessions, according to which recessions are seen as times when profitability is low and, therefore, much needed restructuring can be undertaken because of a temporarily low opportunity cost (Aghion and Saint-Paul 1998).Footnote 4 Ranciere et al. (2008) present evidence that countries which have suffered occasional crises—identified as a sharp collapse in credit growth—grow faster. They also present a model consistent with a positive correlation between risk and economic growth under certain conditions. In addition, there is also a political economy argument for a positive effect of crises on growth. For example Tommasi and Velsco (1996)argue that economic crises facilitate economic reforms.Footnote 5
 As the discussion above shows, in theory it is possible that output collapses are associated with positive or negative effects on productivity that last for long periods of time or even permanently. As an empirical matter, there are a number of papers in the literature that address related issues. Cerra and Saxena (2008) use panel-VAR techniques to show that GDP growth is significantly and persistently lower after financial crises and some types of political crises. Our work is complementary to their, given that they do not explore whether this persistent decline in growth is due to a decline in factor accumulation or mainly due to a lower TFP growth. Jones and Olken (2008) identify episodes of GDP growth accelerations and collapses using a small-sample version of a structural break tests by Bai and Perron (1998, 2003) to detect regime changes. They identify 73 breaks in 48 countries using Penn World Table data, of which 43 are down-breaks and 30 up-breaks. Their results show interesting asymmetries between growth ignitions and collapses. In particular, while growth accelerations are associated with increases in trade, without a significant change in investment rates, collapses in GDP growth are associated with a significantly lower investment, inflation, devaluations and internal conflict. Our approach differs in various aspects from this paper. We concentrate on the question of whether TFP returns to it potential level taking into account initial conditions and the evolution of the TFP frontier. More than 62% of all the collapses identified by Jones and Olken (2008) occurred in the 1970’s during the global productivity slowdown of the world economy. This suggests that—especially for developing countries—it is important to take into account what happens to its technological frontier in order to construct the level of TFP that would have prevailed in the absence of a crisis. Second, we focus on output collapses, defined as a large departure below the trend level of GDP, rather than growth collapses, which can be the natural consequence of an unsustainable boom, without implying a major crisis with destructive potential. Furthermore, we identify the events as a decline below a common threshold for all countries. This has the advantage that we capture all large events, rather than relying on a statistical identification of events that depends critically on the variability of the time series. This limitation explains why important crises, like the Uruguayan currency and banking crises in the early 1980’s, Argentina’s collapse during the hyperinflation of 1989, or Chile’s collapse around the rise and fall of the Allende regime, are not identified as episodes using Jones and Olken’s methodology. Several additional papers look at growth performance during extreme events, although without reference to productivity or other structural underpinnings relevant for long-run effects on income and welfare which are the focus of our paper. For example, similar to Jones and Olken (2008), Berg et al. (2006) and Hausmann et al. (2006) analyze the factors related to the duration of growth spells or collapses. Becker and Mauro (2006) analyze episodes of output drops but their main concern is on the nature of the shocks behind these drops rather than on the evolution of productivity. We use several of their classifications of shocks to analyze whether the evolution of TFP differs according to the type of shocks associated with the output collapse. Hong and Tornell (2005) analyze the recovery of GDP growth during currency crises. They find that growth rates rapidly return to pre-crisis levels but may not surpass them, thus possibly producing a persistent effect on GDP levels, but in contrast to our paper, they focus on cyclical GDP dynamics during currency crisis. Finally, our paper is also somewhat related to Calvo et al. (2006) on the miraculous recoveries after systemic financial crises. However, their emphasis is on the short-run or cyclical performance of TFP during systemic sudden stops in capital flows to emerging markets, while we focus on the long-run or permanent consequences of a broader class of output collapses. We look at a panel of 76 countries during the period 1960–2004 to identify episodes of GDP collapses and estimate the counterfactual post-collapse TFP trend. We test whether output collapses are systematically associated with temporary or permanent declines of aggregate productivity and measure their welfare costs in terms of GDP forgone. Although results differ across countries and regions, the analysis shows that the losses from productivity destruction can be substantial. In addition, we characterize the types of shocks that are associated with output collapses and quantify the corresponding welfare losses.Footnote 6
 The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and identifies the output collapses in the sample. The next section constructs the counterfactuals of trend TFP and tests whether the effects on productivity after collapses are temporary or permanent. It also analyzes how these effects differ across time and regions, and performs some robustness checks. In Sect. 4 we explore how productivity effects differ depending on the types of shocks associated with output collapses and estimate the extent of the post-collapse loss in terms of the welfare costs. Section 5 concludes.",6

Bowen,Haris Munandar,Jean-Marie Viaene,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The past decade has witnessed a surge of negotiating activity around regional trade agreements (RTAs) as numerous subsets of countries have sought deeper integration among themselves. The WTO expects close to 400 RTAs to be implemented by 2010.Footnote 1 To date, the most notable examples of RTAs include NAFTA (United States, Canada and Mexico), the accession of 12 additional countries into the European Union (EU), and MERCOSUR. However, there are several ongoing efforts to initiate or renew agreements among a variety of nations (e.g., Free Trade for the Americas, ASEAN). On average, each trading nation is currently a member of six preferential agreements. However, the typical developed country of the Northern hemisphere is on average a member of 13 agreements (World Bank 2005). Geographically, free trade initiatives are unevenly distributed across various parts of the world. Regional economic integration has come late to East Asia, but its pace has accelerated since the creation of the WTO. The present “spaghetti bowl” of preferential treatments is a complex web of treaties and rules whose prospects for a reallocation of global production are fundamental, but not yet fully understood (Bhagwati 2002). The potential for greater mobility of productive factors within any given integrated area is increasingly powerful, not only because cross-border factor flows are becoming more important,Footnote 2 but also because the international trade literature has long recognized that cross-border factor flows and trade in goods and services can be substitutes (Mundell 1957) or complements (Markusen 1983). Hence, reduced barriers to the movement of goods and of productive factors within a RTA would be expected to affect the final distribution of production across RTA members. Since integration is multidimensional, the measurement of its intensity is a challenging issue of considerable importance. This paper is an attempt at developing such a methodology. Quantification of the degree of economic integration within an integrated area generates fresh insights into a number of critical questions. First, it is important to evaluate integration efforts of major existing RTAs and to observe how these evolve through time. Second, it allows for a comparison of the degree of economic integration across different RTAs since the coverage and depth of preferential treatments vary from one agreement to the other. For example, some RTAs involve only traditional tariff-cutting policies while others include rules on e.g. services, competition, investment and migration, and further institutional arrangements like the European Monetary Union to adopt a single currency. The economic union of the United States is perhaps the most sophisticated form of integration, with member states unifying all economic and socio-economic policies. As a rule, it is believed in policy circles that the degree of integration increases with the intensity of policy harmonization. Finally, assessing the degree of economic integration for the world as a whole serves to quantify the effects of globalization. On the one hand, most WTO liberalization initiatives that emerged from the Uruguay Round went into force only in the mid-1990s. On the other hand, the architecture of a RTA is discriminatory since member countries seek to eliminate trade barriers among themselves but maintain those on imports from non-member countries, with numerous rules of origin also usually imposed to prevent the free movement of goods even within a RTA. Several empirical studies estimate the extent of economic integration by openness, often measured by the ratio of trade to GDP. Greenaway et al. (2001) extend these proxies to construct the so-called index of extended intra-industry trade that can distinguish between penetration of a market due to increased imports versus increased production by domestic affiliates of foreign companies. However, a trade measure is a narrow indicator of the changes brought about by a RTA, and for this reason broader measures of globalization have also been estimated. For example, Andersen and Herbertsson (2003) use factor analysis to combine several variables believed to be indicators of globalization into a single indicator. Riezman et al. (2005, 2006) use applied general equilibrium techniques to compute alternative metrics of the distance between free trade, autarky and observed (restricted) trade equilibria. Our point of departure relative to this literature is that we seek to measure the degree of integration within a given RTA. In addition, we consider forms of integration that are deeper than “globalization” in that the latter is considered a liberalization process that leads to “a reduction in the barriers—whether technological or legislative—to economic exchanges between nations” (Ethier 2002). Our analysis expands on this to include also economic and socio-economic policy coordination. Our indicator of the degree of integration measures the distance between observed values (shares) of output and factor stocks across RTA members and the values (shares) expected theoretically to emerge within a fully integrated economic area (IEA), the latter being an integrated area in which goods and factors are freely mobile and policies are harmonized. The theoretical foundation of our indicator uses the cross-country equalization of factor marginal products as the force driving the allocation of resources across IEA members, and we combine this with the latest developments regarding the increasingly observed empirical regularity of Zipf’s law in economic data (e.g., Gabaix 2008). Our framework yields three related theoretical predictions. The first is that factor mobility among members of an IEA implies that each member’s share of total IEA output will equal its shares of the total IEA stock of each productive factor (i.e., its shares of total IEA physical and human capital). We call this theoretical outcome the “equal-share” relationship. The second prediction is that the distribution of output and productive factors across IEA members is expected to exhibit Zipf’s law;Footnote 3 this law establishes a specific relationship among member shares of output and productive factors, namely, that the e.g. output share of the largest member is twice that of the second largest member, three times that of the third largest member, etc. Of course, the question arises as to why Zipf’s law will occur. In the literature, a central mechanism for the emergence of Zipf’s law is random growth of shares, and similarly our explanation builds on the random nature of output and factor shares that arises from policy harmonization within an IEA. In this setting, we apply the results of Gabaix (1999) to infer that if IEA member shares evolve as geometric Brownian motion with a lower bound, then the limiting distribution of these shares will exhibit Zipf’s law. Thirdly, if Zipf’s law holds, we show that the expected distribution of shares within an IEA is a harmonic series, where the shares of this series depend only on the number of IEA members. This allows us to derive, for an IEA of fixed size, the expected distribution of shares across IEA members. The closer the actual distribution of shares is from this expected distribution the greater the degree of integration within the given IEA. Our measure of the degree of economic integration reflects therefore the distance between expected and actual distributions. Given the potential importance of our metrics for future integration policies, we empirically compute our measures of integration for the 50 US states and the District of Columbia (hereafter called the 51 US states) and for different RTAs (e.g., EU countries, Andean Community, MERCOSUR, Latin American Integration Association, and Bangkok Agreement) and a “world” comprising 64 countries.Footnote 4 The data generally cover the period from 1965 to 2000. The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 derives the theoretical properties of a fully integrated economic area with respect to the distribution of output and factors across IEA members and the expectation that member shares of IEA output and factors will evolve randomly. Section 3 discusses the implications of this randomness for the long-run distribution of output and factors across IEA members and the expectation that member shares will conform to a rank-share distribution that exhibits Zipf’s law. Section 4 computes the theoretical shares and describes the data used to measure actual shares of our economic groups. Section 5 provides a weak test of the equal-share relationship. Section 6 defines our integration measures and computes these measures for alternative economic groups. Section 7 summarizes and discusses the consequences of our findings. An Appendix discusses data methods and sources.",6

146,3,Review of World Economics,12 June 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0062-x,Entering new country and product markets: does export promotion help?,September 2010,Christian Volpe Martincus,Jerónimo Carballo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A simple portfolio argument suggests that, if covariance of firm sales across countries is not perfect, then spreading these sales over a larger number of countries will be associated with more stable total sales, which can be expected to result in lower likelihood of failure, in general, and of exiting international markets, in particular (see, e.g., Hirsch and Lev 1971; and Bernard and Jensen 2002).Footnote 1 However, given the severe information problems deterring export activities, adding new destination countries or new export products may be challenging, especially for firms with limited export experience based in developing countries. Trade promotion activities ameliorate these information problems and might therefore affect the probability that firms start exporting to a new country or selling a new good abroad. Is this really the case? Even though some previous studies report evidence on the effect of these activities on the growth of firms’ export margins (see, e.g., Volpe Martincus and Carballo 2008), no formal evaluations have been performed of their direct impact on the probability of incorporating a new destination or introducing a new export product.Footnote 2 Taking explicitly into account the discrete-choice nature of the decision to enter new countries or product markets, such an evaluation could provide valuable new insights on how trade promotion actions specifically affect the extensive margin of firms’ exports and thereby their overall export performance, including their ability to survive in foreign markets.Footnote 3 This requires specifying and estimating an econometric model with discrete outcomes, which allows for heterogeneous responses to treatment over observationally identical persons. This paper aims precisely at filling this gap in the literature, estimating a discrete-choice, latent index model using trade support and highly disaggregated export data for the entire population of exporters of a small developing country, Uruguay, over the period 2000–2007.Footnote 4
 Incomplete information creates frictions in the process of matching between buyers and sellers across national borders and can therefore become an important obstacle to developing export activities (see, e.g., Rangan and Lawrence 1999; Rauch and Casella 2003; and Huang 2007). Information gaps are particularly pronounced in the case of differentiated products. These products differ along multiple dimensions in such a way that their prices do not convey all relevant information to guide resource allocation (see, e.g., Rauch 1996).Footnote 5 As a consequence, international trade of differentiated goods is especially favored by factors reducing the aforementioned gaps such as common language, colonial ties, and co-ethnic business networks (see Rauch 1999; and Rauch and Trindade 2002). Heterogeneity in the degree of information incompleteness is also likely to prevail across different export activities. More precisely, information problems tend to be more severe when firms attempt to export to a new country or sell a new product abroad than when they simply expand their export activities in countries they already export to or increase their sales of already exported products. When exporting to a new destination, firms must learn, among other things, about the alternative ways and respective costs of shipping their merchandise, the tariffs/non-tariff measures, and technical regulations applied on their goods, both for the home country and for competing countries; domestic consumer preferences relevant for the saleability of the good to be traded; the distribution channels, in general, and potential business partners, in particular; and the main marketing strategy of incumbent firms. Gathering this information requires performing market-specific studies, whose costs are at least partially fixed in nature. As highlighted in recent international trade models with firm heterogeneity, these costs can prevent firms with productivity levels below certain thresholds from entering such export markets (see, e.g., Melitz 2003; and Melitz and Ottaviano 2008). Several trade promotion actions aim at reducing the frictions generated by incomplete information and thereby the fixed costs associated with exporting. Thus in general, export promotion agencies provide firms with training on the export process as well as with information on foreign markets; organize, coordinate and sometimes co-finance their participation in trade fairs, shows, and missions; and help companies establish specific business contacts (see Jordana et al. 2010). These activities could be rationalized as public interventions correcting market failures if the search for business partners is assumed to be subject to free-riding through information spillovers (see, e.g., Rauch 1996). Hence, by helping overcome information barriers, trade promotion programs may facilitate the expansion of exports along the extensive margin in terms of both countries and products, and, in the latter case, especially those of differentiated goods. More specifically, these programs may aid firms adding an entirely new market, i.e., a market they never had trade relationships with before. Notice that this is not the same as an overall increase in the number of markets in which firms operate as studied in Volpe Martincus and Carballo (2008), since such an increase might result from simultaneously adding several markets and dropping others, potentially some already having been served in the past. In fact, in Uruguay only about 30% of the exporting companies registering expansions in the number of destination countries and products exported have actually penetrated a new market between 2001 and 2007.Footnote 6 The aforementioned specific extensive margin dimension is particularly interesting in itself for at least three reasons. First, as mentioned above, this is precisely where information problems hit more forcefully and accordingly where export promotion can make the largest difference. Second, when doing it, firms tend to add new markets gradually rather than in large clumps (see, e.g., Eaton et al. 2007; Lawless 2009; Schmeiser 2009).Footnote 7 In particular, most firms incorporate only one market at a time. For instance, in the case of Uruguay, among exporting companies with new destinations (products) in a given year, more than 60% (approximately 50%) add just one country (product).Footnote 8 Third, sales to new destinations and those of new goods may be influential in determining firms’ export performance and even aggregate export outcomes. Thus, in Uruguay, new products account for almost 10% of total exports of firms with continuous presence in international markets over the period 2000–2007 and 3.8% of the country’s total exports. After 5 years, the shares of these products increase to 27.6 and 6.7%, respectively.Footnote 9 Hence, a deeper understanding of the channel through which trade promotion programs affect exports can be reached by assessing their influence on firms’ penetration of new markets. This is what this paper aims to do. It therefore addresses one main question: Do export supporting activities performed by trade promotion organizations in developing countries actually help firms add new destination countries or new export products?Footnote 10
 Answering this question involves performing a counterfactual exercise, i.e., in order to determine the effect of export promotion programs, one needs to estimate how firms would have behaved had they not participated in those programs. Since this potential behavior is not observed, it must be estimated from the data using information on non-participating firms to build an appropriate control group. More precisely, establishing causal impacts instead of simple correlations requires controlling for all firm characteristics that may potentially affect both usage of export promotion programs and export outcomes. Standard methods such as matching are based on the identifying assumption that selection into trade promotion activities is only based on observed (by the econometrician) attributes. Since there might be several unobserved factors that may play an important role in determining assistance status and also export performance, this may turn out to be a very restrictive assumption. Furthermore, the decision whether to add a new destination country or a new export product is primarily a discrete choice and the interest accordingly lies on the probability that such events actually occur (see, e.g., Roberts and Tybout 1997). Thus, in our case the outcome variables of interest are dichotomous. This raises additional specific econometric issues for program evaluation (see, e.g., Athey and Imbens 2006). To address these issues we use the estimator proposed by Aakvik et al. (2005), which allows for unobserved factors that may affect selection into programs and export outcomes and thus heterogeneous responses to programs (i.e., firms respond differently to the same program). We thereby contribute to the existing literature assessing, to our knowledge for the first time, the impact of export promotion programs on probably the most relevant dimension of firms’ export extensive margin, i.e., the decision to enter new country or product markets, while taking into account its discrete choice nature.Footnote 11 In doing this, we exploit a new database primarily consisting of an annual list of companies assisted by Uruguay’s main export promotion agency, URUGUAY XXI, and firm-level export data disaggregated by product and destination country covering the whole population of this country’s exporters over the period 2000–2007.Footnote 12 Noteworthy, we thus focus on the impact of trade support on already exporting firms. Unfortunately, due to data constrains, we cannot evaluate whether URUGUAY XXI helps non-exporters become exporters.Footnote 13 While admittedly this is a limitation of our study, for the reasons listed above, we believe that much is to be gained by investigating the effects of export promotion activities on exporters’ entry into new markets. Further of interest from both academic and trade policy points of view, we look at the experience of a small developing country, where obstacles hindering expansion of exports along these margins are likely to be stronger. In particular, products of firms from these countries might be perceived as less technologically advanced and of poorer quality than those from developed countries (see, e.g., Chiang and Masson 1988; Han and Terpstra 1988; Hudson and Jones 2003).Footnote 14
 We find that export supporting activities by URUGUAY XXI have been effective in helping Uruguayan firms reach new destination countries, especially non-OECD, Latin American and Caribbean markets, and in introducing new differentiated products. In contrast, no significant impacts are observed when no distinction in terms of the degree of differentiation of the goods is performed. This result can be explained by the fact that, in this case, we are implicitly pooling over goods whose trade involves information problems of varying intensity, so we are accordingly likely mixing effects of trade support actions of varying intensity, i.e., strong for differentiated products as referred above and weak or null for homogeneous products. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 explains the empirical methodology. Section 3 presents the data set and descriptive evidence on firms’ export performance. Section 4 reports and discusses the econometric results, and Sect. 5 concludes.",37

According to the Agenda 2000, the decisions by the European Council at the Copenhagen meeting in December 2002 and the budgetary plans by the European Commission for the enlarged Union for the period 2007–2013, this EU enlargement has been financed mainly by a redirection of Structural and Cohesion Funds (SCF) expenditures from the EU-15 to the new EU member states. By preserving current overall expenditure levels in the enlarged EU, the redistribution of SCF aims at promoting the catching up process of the ten new members—eight of which are Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC)—and at closing the still considerable gaps in infrastructure and capital endowments as a legacy of these formerly planned economies. This redistribution of funds is expected to increase foreign direct investment (FDI) into the accession countries in relative terms at the expense of FDI into the EU-15 member states. The aim of this paper is to project the magnitude of the redistribution of FDI from the old to the new EU member states. The reallocation of SCF expenditures should affect the inward FDI position of incumbent EU countries relative to the entrant economies. The theory of multinational enterprises (MNEs) suggests that SCF expenditures may reduce the plant set-up costs and, in this way, change the trade-off between exporting and setting up foreign affiliates in favor of MNE activity (Breuss et al. 2001). On the other hand, they may also improve the infrastructure of a country such as its transportation network. The latter effect reduces transportation costs and favors trade. The overall impact of SCF expenditures on the allocation of FDI remains an empirical question, which is best analyzed in a logistic regressions framework, accounting for spatial dependence. This approach allows analyzing the determinants of a country’s share in FDI, originating from a ’typical’ parent country, as the dependent variable. Further, one is able to explicitly account for external effects of changes in SCF expenditures on FDI across borders. Finally, a spatial econometric framework explicitly takes into account that investment decisions across host markets for a given parent company are interdependent. With such a model it is possible to simulate the hypothetical impact of a reallocation of SCF as formulated in Agenda 2000 and the updated cost calculations of EU enlargement on the distribution of FDI across old and new member countries in the past.
Footnote 1
 We study two enlargement scenarios: the 2004 scenario with eight CEECs plus Cyprus and Malta, and the 2007 scenario with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. Both scenarios take into account the financial agreements of the decisions made by the European Council in December 2002 and the financial perspectives for the programming period 2007–2013. Based on these scenarios and a consistent and robust estimate of the corresponding share-multiplier, we can then project the consequences of the reallocation of SCF expenditures across old and new EU host countries. The paper is organized as follows: The next section reports the main features of the structural policy reform in the EU. Section 3 draws on the MNE literature in international economics and formulates the most important hypotheses concerning the impact of SCF expenditures on the distribution of inward FDI. Section 4 introduces the logistic bilateral FDI regression framework, which accounts for spatial dependence. Section 5 reports both the estimation and the simulation results. The last section summarizes the main findings.",14
146,3,Review of World Economics,23 May 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0057-7,Trade impact of European measures on GMOs condemned by the WTO panel,September 2010,Anne-Célia Disdier,Lionel Fontagné,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"From the beginning of the 90s, the European Union (EU) implemented legislation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which was however challenged by major GMO producer and exporting countries: In May 2003, the United States (US), Canada and Argentina launched a case at the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the EU. For the three complainants, the EU policy on GMOs reduced their exports to the EU market. In September 2006, the WTO panel stated in its report that the EU had applied a general de facto moratorium on the approval of GMOs since June 1999 and undue delays in the processing of product-specific applications, and consequently had breached its obligations under the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement. The report also concluded that the national safeguard measures put in place by certain EU Members on biotech products that had already been approved as safe by the EU were inconsistent. The purpose of this paper is to quantify the trade impact of EU measures on GMOs in the perspective of the WTO complaint.Footnote 1 Quite surprisingly, no research has been carried out to date to measure and quantify the potential export losses faced by the three complainants—Argentina, Canada and the US—in the EU market in monetary terms. Accordingly, our main aim is to provide an estimation of the revenue lost from the EU market by complainants. According to WTO dispute settlement practices, this revenue loss is indeed key to defining the magnitude of the retaliatory measures that might be enforced were the Panel’s recommendations not implemented by the EU.Footnote 2 It could be argued that European measures against GM products were put in place following consumers’ rejection of GMOs. However, one has to remind that WTO rules do not state that the preferences of consumers justify regulatory measures affecting trade. These rules only state that any trade-impeding decision must be based on scientific evidence. Hence, applying bans without providing such evidence might well not only affect trade but also consumers’ preferences. Ultimately, what matters from the point of view of the panel is the impact of the unjustified (according to WTO) regulations on exports of complainants. The decision of the WTO has been criticised on two major grounds: applicability of the SPS Agreement to the EU regulations on GM products (Conrad 2007); interpretation of the acknowledged scientific evidence provided by the EU (Perez 2007). European measures may have impacted other countries as well. Similarly, complainants may have been affected by other measures than the ones imposed by the EU. We will check, as an extension, whether it is the case or not. Our paper therefore provides two contributions to the literature: First, we focus on the main GM products being grown commercially in the complaining countries and potentially affected by EU measures, and provide an estimation of losses in terms of exports to the EU market by product, complaining country and measure at stake. To perform the estimation and get unbiased results, we make use of the most recent advances in gravity equation estimation. In particular, we try to avoid the most usual misspecifications found in the literature relying on the traditional simplest gravity framework that have been clearly described by Baldwin and Taglioni (2006). The main issue here is the necessary control for unobserved relative prices when it comes to explaining bilateral trade. Baldwin and Taglioni (2006) refer to this as the “the gold medal of classic gravity model mistakes”, namely the fact that the bilateral trade costs used as regressors in the estimated equation are correlated with the omitted variable since trade costs enter into these unobserved prices.Footnote 3 The solution generally adopted is to rely on fixed effects by country but here there is an additional difficulty associated with the panel dimension of the data, since relative prices vary over time. Hence, country × year fixed effects should be used instead. We also use the Poisson estimator suggested by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) rather than the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. The authors show that heteroskedasticity in the error terms can cause the OLS method to yield biased estimates. They argue that the most robust estimation method for multiplicative equations like gravity is Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML). This specification deals adequately with the zero-value observations, since the dependent variable is measured in levels. Furthermore, it provides estimates that are comparable to elasticity estimates from the standard linear-in-logs specification. The second contribution is to investigate, for comparison purposes, the impact of moratoria or non-approvals of GM products adopted by other countries that were not part of the WTO panel, such as New Zealand, Switzerland and Norway on the exporting countries complaining against the EU measures. In the same way, we examine the impact of EU measures on Brazilian exports, even though Brazil did not join the complaints. This research is related to the broader literature on the economic effects of the introduction of GM products and the costs induced by regulations on authorization and labelling aiming to segregate and preserve the identity of non-GM grains from GM ones. Bullock and Desquilbet (2002) investigate how these costs affect US seed producers, farmers and grain handlers and how they depend on standards defining goods as non-GM. The authors show that most of the costs faced by farmers come from the production process itself, while the handlers’ main cost is the cost of dedicating equipment to either GMOs or non-GMOs but never both. Lapan and Moschini (2004) introduce the costs of segregation and identity preservation in a partial-equilibrium, two-country trade model. In their model, seeds of a new GM product are produced by a home-country monopolistic innovator and sold to a competitive farming industry. Consumers in the foreign country can choose between GM and non-GM products and view GM products as inferior in quality. Due to the presence of segregation and identity preservation costs, the introduction of GM products can lower welfare. Furthermore, regulations on imports of GM products, such as labelling requirements or bans, will affect income distribution among trading partners. Moschini et al. (2005) also allow for differentiated demand. The authors distinguish between GM, conventional and organic food and analyse the effects of the introduction of GM products. Organic and conventional products, which existed prior to the introduction of GMOs, are horizontally differentiated, while GM and conventional goods are vertically differentiated (GMOs are inferior in quality to conventional food). On the supply side, the authors account for segregation and identity preservation costs. Calibrated simulations show that, due to the associated segregation costs for non-GM products, the introduction of GMOs reduces welfare. However, this introduction benefits producers of organic food. Last but not least, Moschini (2008) provides a detailed review of GM product adoption in the agro-food sector over the 15 years and further expected development. If GM crops grew very rapidly between 1994 and 2008, future development may be impeded by restrictive regulations adopted in particular by the EU. The next section provides some statistics on world production and trade of GM products. It also reviews EU legislation on GMOs and summarizes the dispute between the US, Canada and Argentina on the one hand, and the European Communities (EC) and its Member States on the other. In Sect. 3, we describe our data and detail our econometric specification. Section 4 reports the estimation results. Section 5 concludes.",23

G. Rübbelke,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Kyoto Protocol (KP) does not prescribe greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions to developing countries. This fact is employed by opponents to the KP to stress its inefficiency, since GHG emission mitigation options can regularly be exploited more cheaply in the developing world. The US, which refused to join the Protocol, has called for participation of developing countries in the next rounds of climate agreements (Zabarenko 2008). This has been resisted by developing countries because of the economic burden that such efforts would imply (see, e.g., China Daily 2007). Seeking to address these opposing views, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the KP allows industrialized countries to fulfil their GHG abatement obligations partly by mitigating GHG emissions in developing countries and hence to exploit cheaper abatement options (Zhang 2000; Hepburn and Stern 2008). Beyond climate change mitigation, ‘sustainable development’ benefits to the host country of CDM projects are regarded to be positive additional benefits of the CDM.Footnote 1 Yet, according to the World Bank (2009: 50), the potential of CDM projects to contribute to sustainable development does not receive the same level of consideration as the carbon aspects. This is criticised because many projects “could contribute significantly to improving the basic needs of people in poorer countries” (World Bank 2009: 50). In this paper we revisit the issue of sustainable-development co-benefits by considering the poverty alleviating and environmental effects of the CDM. Viewing the CDM as a subsidy on climate-protecting technologies in developing regions, we explore how the rate of subsidy may affect private consumption and environmental protection in the host region. In particular, we assess how alternative domestic environmental policy approaches in the host countries promote or hinder positive impacts. The aim is to identify the ways in which host countries can best take advantage of the co-benefits of the CDM via the design of their domestic environmental policies. We conduct the analysis by first developing an analytical model, and second by exploring the model framework with empirical data. Although the model is designed to be as general as possible, when we introduce data we focus on China and the European Union as the host and client CDM agents respectively. China is expected to be the largest host of CDM projects, on account of low costs and a coal-driven energy system (Zhang 2006). According to the CDM Pipeline Database of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), as of July 2009, there were currently over 1,800 active projects in China, 580 of which were at registered status (Fenhann 2009).Footnote 2 Vennemo et al. (2006) ascertain that upper limit estimates in the literature put China’s energy-related CDM potential to be 236 Mt CO2 per year in 2008–2012, while Rive and Aunan (2010) using the UNEP database estimate that the actual annual CO2 reductions (which will later be credited as Certified Emissions Reductions—CERs) via China’s CDM activities in 2010 will be approximately 300 MtCO2 per year. The European Union, on the other hand, is the largest purchaser of CDM credits under the Kyoto Protocol. In 2008, European buyers dominated the CDM and Joint Implementation markets for compliance with a combined market share of over 80%. The paper is organized as follows. The impure public character of climate policy and different effects generated by CDM transfers will be discussed in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, we develop an analytical model to explore the CDM’s scope for raising the global climate and local environmental protection levels as well as for reducing poverty in the host country. The prerequisites for such transfers are identified. We explore the influence of the different domestic environmental policy settings in the host country on the effects of these transfers. In Sect. 4, we apply our analytical model using empirical data characterizing the CDM transfers channelled from Europe towards China. We carry out simulations in order to analyze the effects of different CDM ‘subsidy’ rates on welfare, poverty, and air quality in China, as well as on the global climate protection level. In Sect. 5, we conclude with a discussion of our results.",27
146,3,Review of World Economics,08 May 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0056-8,Labor market deregulation and globalization: empirical evidence from OECD countries,September 2010,Niklas Potrafke,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Commentators believe that globalization plays a significant part in shaping labor market institutions. Advocates of the skeptical view on the role of globalization fear that working conditions for unskilled workers will deteriorate and many jobs of unskilled workers will disappear in the course of globalization. They therefore encourage a more stringent role of government in the domestic economy. In contrast, advocates of the market-oriented view argue in favor of a less regulated labor market because labor market regulation comes at a cost for employers, raises labor costs and unemployment.Footnote 1 A final verdict on the two views of globalization can only be derived from an empirical analysis. Several recent studies have focused on the relationship between globalization and labor market (de)regulation. In his intriguing paper Boulhol (2009a: 223), for example, presents a theoretical model which “incorporates labor market rigidities… of footloose capital in order to study how globalization might affect the trade-offs generated by labor market regulation and put pressure on labor market in institutions.” Boulhol (2009a: 223) identifies two transmission channels of this process: first, “capital mobility triggers a re-allocation of resources, which trade integration amplifies, away from the high-rent/highly unionized sector. Second, the threat of costly relocations encourages labor market deregulation. The latter channel is more efficient because it avoids sub-optimal sectoral specialization”. These predictions on the influence of globalization on labor market (de)regulation need to be evaluated empirically. Implementing this task, however, raises the question of how to measure labor market (de)regulation and globalization. Scholars have investigated various aspects of labor market (de)regulation such as, for example, unemployment benefits, employment protection and deunionization and various facets of globalization. Empirical studies suggest mixed results about the relationship between labor market institutions and globalization. In a nutshell, globalization does not appear to have a systematic influence on various aspects of labor market (de)regulation. I will discuss the different approaches and empirical findings in more detail below. Many economic indicators are associated with labor market (de)regulation. Nickell (1997), Blanchard and Wolfers (2000: C19f.) and Bassanini and Duval (2006), for example, distinguish between eight labor market institutions: three measures of different dimensions of the unemployment insurance system: the replacement rate, benefit length, and a measure of active labor policy; one measure of employment protection; the tax wedge; three measure aspects of collective bargaining: union contract coverage, union density and (union and employer) coordination of bargaining. 
An encompassing empirical analysis investigating the influence of globalization on labor market (de)regulation needs to address all these potential channels. Moreover, globalization is a multi-faceted concept that cannot be captured by single economic indicators such as trade openness and foreign direct investment. Therefore, all-embracing globalization indicators have been developed over the last years. The KOF index of globalization is a case in point (see Dreher 2006 and Dreher et al. 2008a). In this paper, I employ the annual data set on labor market institutions by Bassanini and Duval (2006) and the KOF index of globalization in order to empirically investigate whether globalization has induced labor market deregulation in OECD countries in the 1982–2003 period. My analytical design takes advantage of a compatible data set on labor market institutions. The results suggest that globalization did not have a systematic influence on labor market deregulation. In fact, domestic aspects, such as such as unemployment and government ideology are more important determinants of labor market institutions and their deregulation processes in OECD countries than globalization. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the data on labor market institutions and globalization. Section 3 sets up the dynamic panel data model and describes the empirical strategy. Section 4 empirically investigates the relationship between the single measures for labor market institutions and globalization: in each scenario, I will first briefly describe the political economic reasoning and results of related empirical studies (if available), specify a hypothesis to be tested and then turn to discuss my own regression results for every single labor market institution indicator. Section 5 concludes.",48

146,4,Review of World Economics,31 August 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0068-4,Multinationals and plant survival,December 2010,Roger Bandick,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The recent literature on firm heterogeneity in international trade demonstrates that globally engaged firms, that is, multinational enterprises (MNEs) and exporters, differ from purely domestic firms in many respects.Footnote 1 It has been shown that there is a clear ordering of firm types, with the best firms becoming outward investors, less well-equipped firms becoming exporters, and the least well-equipped firms remaining in the domestic market. Moreover, it is a stylized fact that MNEs tend to be larger, more capital- and skill-intensive, and not least, to be more productive and pay higher wages than non-MNEs.Footnote 2
 Another important characteristic of MNEs is that, as compared to non-MNEs, they can respond more easily to adverse shocks in one country by simply moving production to another country. This “footloose” character of MNEs means that, conditional on the superior factors that reduce the likelihood of closure, the survival rate of plants of MNEs would be expected to be lower than for plants of non-MNEs. Moreover, since foreign MNEs are less rooted in the local economy than domestic MNEs (and non-MNEs), the former may be more inclined to shift production to other countries whenever the conditions change to their disadvantage. In other words, plant survival rates are expected to be lower for foreign MNEs than for domestic MNEs. It may well be the other way around, however. An investment in a foreign country involves a major commitment, because setting up, and to some extent also taking over a plant abroad, entails substantial sunk costs. This means that if the conditions in the host country do not deteriorate drastically, it is likely that foreign-owned plants will continue to stay on. Domestically owned MNEs that existed for a long time in their home market may, on the other hand, begin to realize that some of their production in the home country is better carried out abroad. Furthermore, recent reductions in transport and information costs have made it easier to exploit the advantages of relocating production between countries. Therefore, plant survival rates may be lower for domestic MNEs than for foreign MNEs. Finally, in line with recent literature on firm heterogeneity in international trade, it could be argued that since globally engaged firms have more diversified sales profiles than non-exporting non-MNEs, they have better prospects of withstanding negative shocks such as temporary drops in the demand for some of their products. The probability of shutdown would then be lower among plants of globally engaged firms than among plants of purely domestic firms. Apparently, it is an empirical question whether there are differences in shutdown probabilities between; (i) plants of MNEs and non-MNEs, (ii) plants of foreign and domestic MNEs, and (iii) plants of globally engaged firms and purely domestic firms. In this paper, I use recent, unique detailed plant data (which also provide some information at the firm level) for Sweden to investigate the survival probabilities of plants with different ownership structures. Sweden is an interesting case in this context. For a long time, Swedish manufacturing was dominated by domestically owned MNEs. Yet in the 1990s, Sweden introduced considerable liberalization reforms and as a result we observe a substantial increase in foreign ownership. This increase has sparked public concerns in Sweden about the uncertainty of foreign MNEs’ impacts on plant security and, ultimately, on employment. As argued above, plants of MNEs (foreign or domestic) may experience a reduction or an increase in their survival probabilities. From a policy perspective, it is important to determine which of these two effects predominates in order to refine some of the current policies. Although this is important to analyze, the empirical evidence to date is rather limited. One more important dimension to analyze is the interaction between foreign MNEs and local plants. The presence of foreign MNEs may affect the survival rate of indigenous plants in two different ways. On the one hand, foreign presence may increase indigenous plants’ survival if there are knowledge and technological spillovers from foreign MNEs to indigenous companies. On the other hand, domestic plants, which in general are less endowed with advanced technologies, may find it hard to stay in business due to the competition imposed by foreign MNEs. Moreover, the presence of foreign MNEs may have different impacts on various types of plants depending on their ability to benefit from technology transfers (their absorptive capacity) and to withstand intensified competition. Accordantly, this paper also examines how foreign MNE presence affects the survival prospects of plants within domestic MNEs, exporting non-MNEs, and non-exporting non-MNEs. So far, a few studies, e.g., Görg and Strobl (2003a) for Ireland and Bernard and Sjöholm (2003) for Indonesia, have analyzed differences in survival rates between foreign-owned plants and plants of indigenous firms (domestic MNEs and non-MNEs).Footnote 3 Bernard and Jensen (2007) focus on differences in plant survival rates in US manufacturing between plants of domestic (US) MNEs and plants of other firms (foreign MNEs and non-MNEs). The results of these studies, after controlling for other factors related to plant survival, such as plant age, size, and productivity, indicate that the probability of shutdown is larger for plants of MNEs. The only study, to my knowledge, that has been able to analyze the differences in survival rates between MNEs (domestic- and foreign-owned) and non-MNEs is the study by Van Beveren (2007). The result, after controlling for plant-specific differences, shows that domestic and foreign MNEs in Belgium were more “footloose” than national firms in the manufacturing sector during the period 1996–2001. As regards the effect of foreign MNE presence on domestic plant survival, Görg and Strobl (2003b) find that there are positive effects on domestic plants in Irish high-tech manufacturing industries, but no effects on domestic plants operating in low-tech industries.Footnote 4
 I extend and improve upon these earlier papers in a number of ways. First, by using the detailed and unique data for Sweden, I am able to link this work to the recent literature on firm heterogeneity in international trade. Specifically, I am able to categorize all domestic plants as part of (i) a domestic multinational firm with affiliates abroad, (ii) a domestic exporter, or (iii) a purely domestic firm. A negative shock in the domestic market will most likely hit the latter firms and their plants harder because they rely more heavily on the domestic product market. Plants of domestic MNEs and exporters have a more diversified sales profile, which means that they can resist impaired conditions better. Moreover, the impact of foreign MNE presence may differ depending on the extent of global engagement of the domestic plants (multinational, exporting, none). Second, unlike some of the former studies, I do not mix mergers and acquisitions with true exits, and my data set does not place cut-off limits on plant size. Such limits entail the ambiguity that an exit may be the result of decreased plant size below the cut-off level rather than the result of closure.Footnote 5
 In line with previous literature, the results—conditional on controlling for other factors affecting survival—show that foreign MNE plants have lower survival rates than non-MNE plants. However, separating the non-MNEs into exporters and non-exporters, the results show that plants of foreign MNE have higher survival rates than non-exporting non-MNEs, while the survival rates of foreign MNE plants and exporting non-MNE plants do not appear to differ. Moreover, the results, unconditional or conditional on controlling for other plant-specific factors and for separating the non-MNEs into exporters and non-exporters, show that domestic MNE plants are more likely to exit the market than other plants. Finally, the increased foreign presence in Swedish manufacturing seems to have had a negative impact on the survival rate of plants in non-exporting non-MNEs, but not to have affected plants in exporting non-MNEs or plants in Swedish MNEs. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the related theoretical and empirical literature and Sect. 3 briefly describes the data set used. Moreover, it shows the changing importance of Swedish MNEs, foreign MNEs, and non-MNEs in Swedish manufacturing. Section 4.1 discusses the econometric modeling, and Sect. 4.2 presents the results of the analysis. Section 5 summarizes and concludes.",30

R. Elliott,Supreeya Virakul,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The study of international trade has been transformed by the modelling of firm heterogeneity, productivity and exporting (see e.g. Melitz 2003; Yeaple 2005; Melitz and Ottaviano 2005; Bernard et al. 2007a). What the early literature failed to take into account was that world production and trade is dominated by multi-product firms which has led to recent developments in both the theoretical and empirical literature (Eckel and Neary 2010; Iacovone and Javorcik 2008; Bernard et al. 2006a, 2007b; Nocke and Yeaple 2006). The importance of multi-product firms was first revealed for the US by Bernard et al. (2005, 2006a) who show that 41% of firms produce more than one product but that multi-product firms account for 91% of total output while multi-product exporters account for more than 95% of total exports. An important element of firm heterogeneity therefore is how firms expand or contract their product range in response to changes in trading conditions. However, detailed investigations of the multi-product firm phenomenon are limited and almost exclusively concentrated on developed countries. Yet, the role of foreign firms in developing countries is considered a crucial part of the development story with developing countries becoming increasingly aggressive in their approach to attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). Thus, gaining an understanding of the dynamics of introducing new products at the firm level and how government policy can influence the export structure of firms is of direct policy relevance. In this paper, we examine the role of multi-product firms in a developing country, in this case Thailand. A first pass of the data suggests that there are both similarities and dissimilarities with the US. For Thailand, 43% of firms produce more than one product (compared to the 41% figure for the US). However, 57% of output is produced by multi-product firms and 52% of total exports are from firms that export multiple products (compared to the US figures of 91 and 95%, respectively). The headline figures for the production and exporting share are clearly of a different magnitude to those of Bernard et al. (2006a) for the US. The smaller output percentage for Thailand hints at the differences in the behaviour of firms in developed and developing countries certainly in terms of the size distribution of firms.
Footnote 1
 In this paper we argue that for the case of a newly industrialising country such as Thailand it is important to make the distinction between single and multi-product firms for the following reasons. First, FDI subsidies and tax breaks for foreign firms are often justified by their ability to attract firms and to subsequently benefit from technology and knowledge spillovers. From a spillover perspective, multi-product firms are likely to be more attractive as logically, the greater the number of products produced, the wider the range of technologies employed and thus the greater the likelihood that domestic firms will benefit. The process of a firm becoming multi-product is also associated with process and product R&D which is also strongly associated with positive spillovers. Second, since the growth through exporting route has proved to be particularly successful for many East Asian countries over the last two decades, governments are likely to prefer investment from foreign firms that produce more than one product as this will increase the likelihood of exporting at least one of the products. Third, multi-product firms may be more attractive to host governments as they should exhibit less susceptibility to demand shocks as the risk from, for example, changes in fashion or advances in product-specific technology, is spread over a variety of exports and possibly export markets. Hence, domestic employment may benefit from a smoothing effect. In this paper we provide an analysis of the structure of foreign firms and the characteristics of firms that produce multiple products which should provide a useful insight into the role of MNEs in developing countries. More specifically we examine two aspects of the multi-product and development question. In the first stage we examine the relationship between multi-product firms’ extensive margins (number of products produced or exported) and intensive margins (output or export sales per product). Given that changes in trade barriers or trade costs will lead to intra-firm adjustment along firms’ extensive and intensive margins we examine how this relationship affects the distribution in firm size. In addition, we examine the correlation between firms’ extensive and intensive margins. In the second stage of the paper, we examine the characteristics associated with multiple product producers making a distinction between domestic and foreign-owned firms. A complex picture of the behaviour of MNEs in developing countries emerges where foreign-owned firms that export are strongly associated with being multi-product but foreign firms that only serve the domestic market show a strong negative partial correlation with being multi-product. These factors might explain, in part, why evidence for knowledge diffusion and productivity spillovers is less widespread that one might expect. Our finding that a significant proportion of foreign-owned firms supply only the domestic market and produce just a single product is an interesting new stylised fact. The structure of the remainder of this paper is organised as the follows. Section 2 describes the data. In Sect. 3, we discuss our empirical model and present the results of our intensive and extensive margin analysis while Sect. 4 presents our results examining the characteristics of those firms that produce multiple products and the factors related to the number of goods produced. Section 5 concludes.",3
146,4,Review of World Economics,10 August 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0065-7,Innovation and exporting: evidence from Spanish manufacturing firms,December 2010,Aida Caldera,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The recent trade literature has unveiled a large heterogeneity among firms that trade. Most of this literature has focused on the link between productivity and exporting and confirmed the empirical regularity that more productive firms self-select into export markets.Footnote 1 However, there is far less evidence on the role of innovation, one potential driver of productivity differences among firms (e.g., Griliches 1998) on the firm export behavior. A comprehensive study of the relationship between innovation and trade at the firm level may improve our understanding of the drivers of firms’ exporting decisions and the characteristics of firms that trade. This paper aims at filling this gap by investigating the relationship between innovation and the export behavior of firms. It presents a simple theoretical model of the decision to export and innovate by heterogeneous firms which is based on the work by Bustos (2005, 2009) to guide the empirical analysis assessing the effect of innovation on firm export market participation. In the model firms are heterogeneous in terms of productivity and have the choice to invest in innovation to upgrade their technology. The model predicts that innovating firms are more likely to participate in exporting than non-innovating firms. Although innovating and non-innovating firms face similar fixed costs to access export markets, the innovating firms generate higher expected profits from exporting, that makes them more likely to export. I test this proposition for a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 1991–2002. There are several advantages of the unique data set I use in the analysis. It contains not only the information on R&D investments as more commonly available in the literature (see Aw et al. 2007, 2009), but also the data on the output from the innovation process. In particular, the data set contains time-varying information on product and process innovations of firms that allows a more precise investigation of different channels through which the innovation efforts are linked to the returns to exporting. My empirical analysis confirms the theoretical predictions summarized above. The results suggest a positive effect of firm innovation on the probability of participation in export markets. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, firms that introduce cost-saving innovations are more likely to export than those firms that don’t innovate. This result is in line with the theoretical intuition that innovating firms are more likely to export because they can charge lower prices and thus obtain higher returns from foreign sales than non-innovating firms. Also firms that innovate by upgrading their products or introducing completely new ones are more likely to export. This result supports the discussions in the previous literature indicating that product upgrading is an important component of firms’ exporting decisions (Bernard and Jensen 2004; Iacovone and Javorcik 2008). The empirical results further disclose the heterogeneous effects of different types of innovations on the firm export participation. The effects of product upgrading appear to weight more on the firm export participation than those of introducing cost-reducing innovations. In particular, the results indicate that current introduction of product innovations leads to greater probability of future exporting in the range of 2–16% depending on the econometric specification, while the effect of process innovation is by half smaller ranging between 1 and 8%, depending on the econometric specification. These results suggest that product upgrading gives a greater advantage to Spanish firms in export markets than the improvements in their production techniques. An interpretation of this result is that product upgrading allows firms to differentiate their products from rival firms, which may give a better advantage over competitors in export markets than cost-advantages gained though process innovation. These empirical findings are robust to alternative regression techniques to control for firm unobserved heterogeneity, an in particular to instrumental variables regressions to control for the potential endogeneity between innovation and exporting. My study relates to the literature on trade and firm heterogeneity by investigating the role of firm innovation efforts on their export market participation. Clerides et al. (1998) and Bernard and Jensen (1999) were among the first to document the superior performance of exporters relative to purely domestic firms. Following their research, an extensive literature has reached the consensus that exporter premia can be explained by self-selection of best performers into export markets, rather than by learning by exporting.
Footnote 2 These empirical findings have been incorporated into theoretical models of trade that consider firm heterogeneity to explain differences in patterns of export participation as an interaction between firm productivity and fixed costs to export (Bernard et al. 2003; Melitz 2003; Yeaple 2005). The importance of innovation for productivity and exporting of firms has been only recently brought into focus. A few empirical studies using micro-level data have documented a positive correlation between investment in R&D and exporting.Footnote 3 And only since very recently, a few theoretical papers have formalized the potential linkages between firm productivity, export decisions and R&D efforts (Aw et al. 2009; Constantini and Melitz 2008). In particular, in a recent paper Aw et al. (2009) develop a structural model of the firm decision to invest in R&D and participate in the export market and estimate the model using plant level data for Taiwan. They find that the self-selection of high productivity plants is the main driver of the decision to export and to undertake R&D. Their study suggests further that both R&D and exporting have a positive effect on the plant’s future productivity. However, they find little effect of investments in R&D on the export decision once they control for the initial productivity differences. In particular, my paper contributes to the above literature by investigating the effect of firm innovation activities on its export market participation. To characterize the linkages between the export and innovation decisions of firms, I derive a theoretical trade model of heterogenous firms that builds on the work of Bustos’ (2005, 2009) and test its implications using a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms. The main prediction of the model is that firms that innovate will also be more likely to export. The empirical analysis investigates in depth this proposition by relating firm innovation in terms of R&D investments (both internal and contracted) and the introduction of new processes and products to its export participation decision.
Footnote 4 By contrast to other studies that assess the effect of R&D on exporting (e.g., Aw et al. 2007, 2009), my data allows me to empirically investigate the effect of actual innovation rather than R&D investments on the exporting decisions of firms. As such this study assesses the heterogenous effects of different types of innovations on the export decisions of firms. There are some previous studies analyzing the exporting activities of Spanish firms. Cassiman and Martínez-Ros (2005) have also studied the link between innovation and exporting for the Spanish case, while Fariñas and Martín-Marcos (2007) have documented the superior performance of exporters versus non-exporters. Relative to these studies, this paper contributes to the understanding of the Spanish economy by documenting systematic and significant differences between exporters and non-exporters in terms of innovation efforts and outcomes. It also shows that previous innovation contributes to explain the heterogenous participation of Spanish firms in foreign markets, and that these results appear to be robust to a careful consideration of the econometric problems that concern the investigation of the link between innovation and exporting at the firm level, such as unobserved heterogeneity, endogeneity and dynamic considerations. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework. Section 3 presents the preliminary evidence and provides an overview of Spanish firms’ innovation and exporting activities during 1991–2002. Section 4 describes the empirical strategy to estimate the effect of innovation on firm export market participation. Section 5 presents the econometric results and discusses the sensitivity checks. Section 6 concludes.",115
146,4,Review of World Economics,04 September 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0070-x,Geography and firm exports: new evidence on the nature of sunk costs,December 2010,Martina Lawless,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The aim of this paper is to analyse the geographic dimension of trade in terms of the trading patterns of individual firms. Increasing availability of firm-level data has resulted in a number of papers examining firm export decisions, primarily in terms of sunk costs to entry (Wagner 2007; Roberts and Tybout 1997; Bernard and Jensen 2004; Bernard and Wagner 2001) and spillovers from other exporters (Aitken et al. 1997). Throughout this literature, the export market has generally been treated as a single entity, with little consideration given to the fact that firms can export to multiple geographic markets at the same time. This gap in the literature has been primarily due to an absence of firm-level data containing detailed information of export destinations. This paper utilises a new survey of Irish firms that contains information on both export participation and the geographic coverage of exports. The data cover 2 years, which allows us to examine both the export coverage of firms and the extent of entry and exit to and from new destination markets. The paper makes three contributions to the recent literature on firm exporting. The first is a confirmation of some stylised facts identified by Eaton et al. (2004) and Bernard et al. (2009). A consistent finding to emerge from this firm-level analysis of exporting is the large number of firms serving only the domestic market and that even amongst exporting firms, many export only to a single foreign market. The second contribution is to provide some evidence on the firm characteristics associated with the number of markets exported to. A number of characteristics of the firm prove to be important. In particular, larger firms are more likely to export and also export to more markets, as are firms in high technology sectors. Firm age is found to have opposite effects on market participation compared to coverage: Older firms are more likely to export, but once export status was controlled for, younger firms were more diversified across markets. The third contribution of this paper exploits the availability of 2 years of data to shed some light on the nature of the sunk costs associated with becoming an exporter. If there are significant sunk costs associated with entry into each new export market, we would expect to see a high level of persistence in the firms’ portfolio of destination markets. On the other hand, if the main sunk cost involved in exporting is captured by the initial effort involved in becoming outward orientated; we might expect to find that firms experience less persistence in their market coverage than they do in their export status. Our analysis shows that although there is little movement of firms into and out of exporting, firms’ involvement in individual export markets is much more dynamic. Approximately one-third of firms change their market coverage over the 2 years of data, usually by entering or exiting one additional market. These patterns seem consistent with the hypothesis that the experience of exporting to one market significantly reduces the costs associated with entering a second market. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews some literature on the destination of trade. Section 3 introduces the data sources. Section 4 describes firm-level export market coverage and reports the results of a regression analysis of its determinants. Section 5 exploits the 2-year span of the data by analysing the entry and exit of exporting firms to and from individual markets. Section 6 concludes.",13

High interest rates, for example, can deter governments from borrowing to finance investments on which to base future economic growth. High rates are often due to risk premiums that reflect the possibility that the government will default. It seems likely that the risk of default is lower if a country has better political institutions. Although this hypothesis seems intuitive, no scholarly work documents or tests whether in fact institutions that improve electoral accountability and foster more democracy reduce the risk of default and therefore lower risk premiums. This paper tests whether changes in political institutions have a direct effect on financial markets, measured as a reduction in the risk premium. Previous work estimates the effects of institutions on economic growth and documents that some institutions improve it. This work is based on the theoretical contributions of, for example, Shleifer and Vishny (1993), who argue that the structure of government institutions is important for economic development. Also Acemoglu et al. (2005) make a theoretical case that institutions provide an important role for economic development. Similarly Acemoglu and Johnson (2005) find evidence that property rights institutions matter for the overall level of financial development, while contracting institutions affect the form of financial intermediation. Herger et al. (2008) confirm the robustness of Acemoglu and Johnson’s (2005) findings. They show evidence by pointing out that the development of democratic institutions in Great Britain in the 18th century played an important role in Great Britain’s economic development. Institutions that have been found to slow economic growth include corruption and insecure property rights (e.g., Mauro 1995; Keefer and Knack 2003; Acemoglu et al. 2005). Determinants of insecure property rights and high corruption include the timing of elections and the lack of checks and balances (Keefer 2004). Besides growth as a measure of economic performance, some scholars explain performance in the financial sector as a consequence of the institutional setting. For example, financial sector employment and banking crises are related to the security of property rights, the rule of law, and checks and balances. North and Weingast (1989) provide a theoretical case and evidence that improved checks and balances, credible commitments, and better property rights in England during the seventeenth century led to the development of stable capital markets and reduced interest rates, which at that time was an important prerequisite for economic growth. Related work on financial markets includes Keefer (2001, 2002), who points to the critical role of checks and balances for suitable governmental decisions related to banking crises. Further, Keefer and Knack (2003) show that political institutions are important determinants of sovereign creditworthiness. In this paper, we examine the effect of institutions, such as checks and balances, quality of governance, elections, and other democratic institutions, on sovereign interest rate spreads. Better institutions can affect financial markets through at least two channels. One is that better institutions lead to better fiscal policy, which reduces default risk. The other is that they affect financial markets because better institutions promote trust, facilitate exchange, and thus facilitate economic growth. We look at the direct effect of political institutions on financial markets, controlling for fiscal policy. We focus on explaining spreads from emerging market economies that have issued debt since the early 1990s. The spreads are a measure of the risk premium demanded by investors for holding these bonds. Differences between spreads have been explained in terms of country fundamentals, such as inflation, debt, and reserves (see for example Edwards 1994; Cline et al. 1997; Eichengreen and Mody 2000). However, no scholarly work has examined how spreads respond to changes in political institutions and government accountability. We find that financial markets value institutions beyond the economic and fiscal outcomes the institutions shape. Democracy and accountability lower sovereign spreads, and political risk increases them. Finally, financial markets demand higher spreads in election years. In what follows, Sect. 2 presents the analytical framework, Sect. 3 discusses the empirical strategy, and Sect. 4 describes the data and presents the results.

After the first generation models of exchange rate determination, which see the exchange rate as the relative price of domestic and foreign monies (Dornbusch 1976a, b; Frenkel 1976; Kouri 1976; Mussa 1976) were brought to the data, it became clear that exchange rate models can only partly be used to explain past exchange rates with the help of fundamentals, and that they perform poorly in forecasting, in particular (Meese and Rogoff 1983, 1988). The results of the seminal study by Meese and Rogoff (1983) still represent the benchmark: exchange rate forecasts by structural models can hardly outperform naïve random walk forecasts (Rogoff 2009). Since then, many contributions have tried to refute their results. Sticking to the implicit assumption that exchange rates and fundamentals are cointegrated, and implementing exogenous parameter restrictions, a couple of authors find predictability in the long run for a similar period, as in Meese and Rogoff (Mark 1995; Chinn and Meese 1995).Footnote 1 However, extending the estimation period yields mostly contrary findings (Kilian 1999; Abhyankar et al. 2005). A critical point is the implicit assumption of cointegration, which leads to biased conclusions if a stable long-run relation does not exist (Berkowitz and Giorgianni 2001). While the empirical models of the late 1980s mostly neglected the potential existence of a long-run relationship between the fundamentals and the exchange rate, structural models were applied at the beginning of the 1990s which tested explicitly for a long-run relationship among exchange rates and fundamentals. These kinds of empirical model, which are based upon cointegration relationships, can indeed improve the evidence in favour of predictability in the long run when periods up to the end of the 1990s are covered (MacDonald and Taylor 1993, 1994).Footnote 2 However, any extension of the sample period typically yields a breakdown in cointegration relationships (Groen 1999). Surprisingly, little attention is directed to an examination of the link between exchange rates and fundamentals with respect to structural changes in cases where cointegration does not hold. Stock and Watson (1996) show that univariate and bivariate macroeconomic time series are subject to substantial instabilities which result in poor forecasting performance. Different market surveys suggest that various fundamentals are important during different periods (Cheung and Chinn 2001; Gehrig and Menkhoff 2006). Bacchetta and Wincoop (2009) argue that large and frequent variations in the relationship between the exchange rate and macro fundamentals naturally develop when structural parameters in the economy are unknown and subject to changes. As a consequence, market participants can give “excessive” weight to some (macroeconomic) fundamentals during specific periods, i.e. to so-called “scapegoats” (Bacchetta and van Wincoop 2004). Parameter instabilities then arise when the empirical realisation of such a scapegoat changes. A similar explanation of parameter instabilities can be obtained from the imperfect knowledge approach (e.g. Goldberg and Frydman 1996b, 2007). This approach is based on the view that market participants do not know the exact model but use fundamentals for forecasting exchange rates in a way consistent with the assumed theory. Accordingly, the link between fundamentals and the exchange rate changes when the market participants revise their beliefs in the underlying model. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that a strong and significant relationship between exchange rates and fundamentals exists during some subperiods and that its nature tends to change considerably over time. Goldberg and Frydman (1996a, b, 2001) report evidence that fundamentals do matter in a way which is not entirely consistent with the monetary model during some subperiods of floating while such evidence cannot be found during other periods.Footnote 3 Thus, the instability of the monetary model in the data-generating process might serve as an explanation for the findings of Cheung et al. (2005). The latter suggest that model specifications which work well in one period do not necessarily work well in another period.Footnote 4 From this point of view, a fundamental value of the exchange rate exists in the sense that a part of the exchange rate movements is driven by fundamentals. In the recent past, models capable of taking different regimes into account have been applied to the monetary approach.Footnote 5 For instance, Sarno et al. (2004) use a Markov regime-switching model in order to investigate the response of exchange rates to deviations from fundamental values in different regimes. Sarno and Valente (2009) demonstrate that exchange rate models that optimally use the information in the fundamentals often change, which in turn implies frequent shifts in the coefficients. What is more, de Grauwe and Vansteenkiste (2007) investigate particularly the adjustment of the nominal exchange with respect to changes in the fundamentals under different inflation regimes. Taylor and Peel (2000), Taylor et al. (2001) and Kilian and Taylor (2003) make use of models that allow for a smooth transition between two states, supporting the hypothesis that real exchange rate adjustment towards equilibrium paths are nonlinear. To be more specific, fundamentals become important if the deviation from an equilibrium rate is large. Frömmel et al. (2005a, b) test directly for the significance of different regimes in the exchange rate determination equation of the real interest rate differential model. However, since the authors specify their model in first differences, they do not investigate a long-run relationship in a strict sense.Footnote 6 Joining Goldberg and Frydman (1996a, b, 2001), the coefficients in the exchange rate determination process itself are allowed to change within their framework. All other contributions focus on deviations of the exchange rate from a fundamental value which assumes cointegration with implied restrictions without modelling the long-run structure separately. Both of the above-mentioned regime-switching approaches, however, have in common that they only allow for a fixed number of perseverative, i.e. regularly recurring, regimes. In early works, Schinasi and Swamy (1989) and Wolff (1987) applied a time-varying coefficient model (TVP) to monetary models. They were able to show that their models displayed rather better forecasting properties than fixed coefficient models. Hence, the consideration of time-varying coefficients appears to be a worthwhile next step towards a valid empirical model of the exchange rate. Taking these considerations as a starting point, we address several research questions by using a general exchange rate determination model which is based upon the monetary approach and nests a range of variants of the latter. Our working hypothesis is that a relationship between the exchange rate and fundamentals continuously holds, but that its composition varies considerably over time. To test our hypotheses we proceed as follows: firstly, we check whether the long-run equilibrium relationship among some fundamentals and the US dollar exchange rate vis-à-vis the Deutschmark/euro since the breakdown of Bretton Woods I has been subject to structural changes. Secondly, we test whether the estimated relationships represent cointegrating relations. The latter is the case if the hypothesis of non stationarity of the error term resulting from the stepwise relationship can be rejected. As regards our third hypothesis, we check empirically whether fundamentals matter for each regime identified by us. Fourthly, we then test whether the regimes are not perseverative, which would imply that the empirical realisation of the estimated coefficients for specific fundamentals and/or their significance differs across different regimes. Fifthly, we focus on a test of rational expectations in the tradition of Goldberg (2000). Finally, we test whether the exchange rate adjusts to disequilibria and investigate whether the adjustment speed tends to be stable. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a short overview of the array of fundamental models we consider later on, and motivates coefficient instability from a theoretical perspective. In Sect. 3 we describe our econometric methodology and in Sect. 4 present the empirical results. We start with the estimation of a multiple structural change model, as developed by Bai and Perron (1998, 2003), which we apply to the reduced form of structural exchange rate models. As a next step, we make use of the estimated breakpoints to generate indicator functions, and, based on these, we estimate the structural model in order to obtain estimates for the different regimes. To this purpose, we apply the fully modified OLS estimator by Phillips and Hansen (1990), which is generally claimed to be able to deal with nonstationary variables as regressors and regressands. Finally, we construct an error-correction term from the estimated relationships and regress the change of the exchange rate on this error-correction term, in order to investigate whether the exchange rate adjusts to deviations from a fundamental equilibrium relationship.

New evidence based on a Taylor rule model for the ECB,April 2011,Jan-Egbert Sturm,Jakob De Haan,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since monetary policy is increasingly becoming the art of managing expectations, communication has developed into a key instrument in the central bankers’ toolbox. Greater disclosure and clarity over policy may lead to greater predictability of central bank actions, which, in turn, reduces uncertainty in financial markets. Nowadays, there is a strongly held belief among central bankers that a high degree of predictability is important. According to Poole (2001, p. 9), “The presumption must be that market participants make more efficient decisions … when markets can correctly predict central bank actions.” Communication may also enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. The extent to which central bank communication has been successful is very much an empirical issue. Therefore, it is no surprise that the empirical literature on central bank communication has seen major developments in recent years.Footnote 1 Many of these studies refer to the communication policy of the European Central Bank (ECB). There is substantive evidence that ECB communication moves financial markets in the intended direction (see, for instance, Ehrmann and Fratzscher 2007; Musard-Gies 2006; Brand et al. 2006). There is also a consensus that ECB communication increases the predictability of interest decisions by the ECB (De Haan 2008). The ECB tries to prepare markets for upcoming interest rate decisions using its communication policy. So, ECB communication contains some forward guidance and may have predictive power. Even in the absence of forward guidance, central bank communication variables can meaningfully enter a Taylor (1993) rule model: with only inflation and output included, a Taylor rule model is very likely to be mis-specified, since central banks typically base their interest rate decisions on many more economic variables. If the ECB President gives the overall assessment of the economic situation based on all the variables that the ECB looks at, central bank communication might be a very useful way to summarise this information content in a very parsimonious fashion. However, there is disagreement in the literature about the extent to which ECB communication adds information compared to the information contained by macro-economic variables that are typically included in a Taylor rule model. For instance, whereas Heinemann and Ullrich (2007) and Rosa and Verga (2007) conclude that communication adds information not provided by these macroeconomic variables, Jansen and De Haan (2009) find that straightforward Taylor rule models outperform models using only communication indicators. The purpose of this paper is to re-examine to what extent ECB communication adds information compared to the information provided by a Taylor rule model in which expected inflation and output growth are used when forecasting upcoming interest rate decisions. There are some important differences between our study and previous research. First, Heinemann and Ullrich (2007) and Rosa and Verga (2007) estimated backward-looking Taylor rule specifications. However, as Svensson (2003) has shown, even if the ultimate objective of monetary policy is to stabilize inflation and output, a simple Taylor rule will not be optimal in a reasonable macroeconomic model. Interest rate changes affect inflation and output with a sizable lag. Therefore, monetary policy has to be forward-looking. Some recent studies suggest that the use of expected inflation and output growth lead to very different results than backward-looking Taylor rule models for the ECB (Sauer and Sturm 2007; Gorter et al. 2008).Footnote 2 For instance, Gorter et al. (2008) report that in their backward-looking Taylor model the Taylor principle does not hold, in contrast to the Taylor model with expected inflation and output growth. So the findings of Heinemann and Ullrich (2007) and Rosa and Verga (2007) may just reflect their use of a potentially mis-specified Taylor rule model. Jansen and De Haan (2009) employed a similar forward-looking Taylor rule model as used in the present paper and conclude that their communication indicator does not increase the fit of the model.Footnote 3
 Second, all previous papers use just one indicator of ECB communication. Whereas Heinemann and Ullrich (2007) and Rosa and Verga (2007) use communication indicators that are based on the introductory statement of the ECB’s President at the press conference following the ECB policy meeting, Jansen and De Haan (2009) employ an indicator based on Bloomberg news reports. We will show that even if various communication indicators are based on the same information, i.e. the speech of the ECB’s President after the policy meeting, they give very different signals about the direction of the ECB monetary policy. In order to test to what extent results are sensitive to the choice of a particular indicator, we employ five different indicators of ECB communication that are all based on the ECB President’s introductory statement at the press conference following an ECB policy meeting. Apart from the indicators of Heinemann and Ullrich (2007) and an updated version of the index of Rosa and Verga (2007), we employ the aggregate index of Berger et al. (2010), the KOF Monetary Policy Communicator (MPC) as published by the KOF Swiss Economic Institute, and the indicator of Ullrich (2008). Our main finding is that ECB communication turns out to be significant in our Taylor rule model. In other words, it is worthwhile for financial market participants to read the ECB President’s lips, as this adds information about upcoming interest rate decisions that is not provided by expected inflation and expected output growth. This conclusion holds for most communication indicators. We include the interbank rate to control for financial markets forecast of future ECB monetary policy moves (e.g. Bernoth and von Hagen 2004). Even in this specification, the ECB communication indicators remain significant. Using Brier scores and the ranked probability scores, we conclude that Taylor rule models that include ECB communication indicators outperform models without those indicators in terms of their out-of-sample forecasting abilities. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 outlines the model, while Sect. 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents the results and Sect. 5 offers the conclusions.",79
147,1,Review of World Economics,16 December 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0083-5,The spatial effects of trade openness: a survey,April 2011,Marius Brülhart,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Trade economists have long studied what happens within countries when trade barriers are removed between countries. By far the most attention has been paid to the sectoral dimension of this problem. Theories of comparative advantage are all about how the market reallocates resources across industries and production factors to reap the gains from international specialisation. More recently, the focus has shifted from sectors to firms, with theories of intra-industry trade and heterogeneous firms shedding light on how trade affects distributions of firm types within countries. I focus on a third dimension of within-country adjustment to trade: space. The importance of this issue is well understood by policy makers. An oft-heard fear related to trade liberalisation is that it could accentuate intra-national inequalities not only across industries and occupational groups but also across regions. Take the following quote from the 2009 World Development Report: “The openness to trade and capital flows that makes markets more global also makes subnational disparities in income larger and persist for longer in today’s developing countries. Not all parts of a country are suited for accessing world markets, and coastal and economically dense places do better. China’s GDP per capita in 2007 was he same as that of Britain in 1911. Shanghai, China’s leading area, today has a GDP per capita the same as Britain in 1988, while lagging Guizhou is closer to Britain in 1930. China’s size, the openness of coastal China to world trade, and Shanghai’s location are the reasons (World Bank 2008, p. 12)”. This quote is representative of mainstream economic thinking in so far as it makes two central assertions: that trade liberalisation increases within-country spatial inequality, and that it favours regions with better access to international trade routes. My aim is to test these two common claims against the insights from the relevant scientific literature. Policy makers cannot ignore the spatial implications of international trade, if indeed they turn out to be a general corollary of open markets. In the European Union, for instance, redistributive regional policies have formed part and parcel of the post-war integration project since its very inception. While in reality these policies may chiefly be the result of political horse-trading, their intellectual underpinning is invariably provided by the claim that integration may harm “peripheral” or “disadvantaged” areas. Is this is a valid intellectual case? If it were, i.e. if trade systematically favoured regional divergence within countries, then accompanying regional policies such as those adopted in Europe might fruitfully be considered elsewhere too. The last two decades have seen a resurgence of research interest in economic geography, and significant advances have been made in terms of scientific rigour and data availability. This is therefore a propitious moment to take stock of what this research teaches us about the effects of trade liberalisation on intra-national economic geographies. This survey covers both theoretical and empirical analyses, in an attempt to give as comprehensive as possible an overview of the current state of the relevant economic research. “Trade liberalisation” is understood primarily as the opening of cross-border goods markets through policy changes or technological improvements, but I also consider some papers that explore the effects of liberalised cross-border investment flows.Footnote 1
 The paper has a simple structure. Section 2 summarises relevant theoretical work, and Sect. 3 presents corresponding empirical evidence. Section 4 concludes.",62
147,1,Review of World Economics,16 November 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0080-8,The heterogeneous effect of international outsourcing on firm productivity,April 2011,Fergal McCann,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"One would expect that the inter-firm importing of intermediates, or international outsourcing, would lead to increases in firms’ total factor productivity (TFP) for a number of reasons. Feenstra and Hanson (1996) consider a good produced in multiple stages, any of which can be moved offshore. Stages intensive in unskilled labour will be moved to countries with lower relative wages for unskilled labour. One strong possibility is that TFP is increased due to the lower costs of the inputs produced abroad, due to factor price differentials, and economies of scale due to specialisation of another country in the particular input. The stages that remain at home can then be aggregated into a production function, with the foreign-produced stages entering the production function as an additional input. Moreover, the stages remaining at home will likely be the “value-adding” stages of production that require more skilled labour. As an example of the potential within-firm reallocation that international outsourcing can allow, Görg and Hanley (2009) show that firms that engage in more international sourcing of services engage in more research and development (R&D). Furthermore, an increased variety of inputs available on the world market compared to the local market should give a higher likelihood of finding the input that perfectly fits the firm’s production process (as in the “market thickness” effect of theoretical papers such as Grossman and Helpman (2003)). Given the higher number of inputs available once a firm enters the import market, the quality of inputs should also rise, particularly for firms located where domestic producers are not up to international standards. Similarly, one may assert that there is a certain technological advantage embedded in international intermediate inputs, due to firm interaction with foreign dealers who may possess a higher level of expertise. Another way of putting it, as in Keller (2004, p. 755) is that
 \(\ldots\) employing a foreign intermediate good in final-output production involves the implicit usage of the technology in embodied form. There is a spillover in this process of international technology diffusion to the extent that the intermediate good costs less than its opportunity costs—which include the R&D costs of product development. In this paper I empirically assess the role that international outsourcing of material inputsFootnote 1 plays in increasing firm productivity. Before moving on to estimate the effect of outsourcing on TFP, I first show that outsourcing must be treated as an endogenous variable. In order to show this, I turn to the literature on exporting originating with Bernard and Jensen’s (1999) (BJ henceforth) paper on the selection into versus learning from exporting to attempt to estimate a selection effect into international outsourcing. From the pool of non-outsourcers at a given time t − 1, I show that the more productive firms do indeed select into the international outsourcing market. Given this endogenous entry of more productive firms into the intermediate import market, it is clear that causality may run both ways in the outsourcing-productivity relationship. I distinguish at all times between international outsourcing and intra-firm trade, as productivity effects that come from purchasing from a headquarter may involve transfer of firm-specific knowledge, rather than the effects that I have outlined above. For this reason, in all empirical analysis, only firms that source from outside their firm boundary are considered. The empirical analysis of outsourcing’s effect on TFP allows outsourcing to be captured in two different ways, with the aim of illustrating how differing these two approaches are in the mechanisms they are set up to capture, and in the results at which they arrive. Outsourcing, either measured as outsourcing intensity (imported material inputs over the total wage bill) or as a binary outsourcing status variable, is included in a firm-level production function in logs. Fixed effects, difference GMM (Arellano and Bond 1991), system GMM (Blundell and Bond 1998) and a modified version of the Olley and Pakes (1996) (OP henceforth)Footnote 2 structural estimator are used as methods to estimate the production function. If, as in Gorzig and Stephan (2002), Görg et al. (2004, 2008), Görg and Hanley (2005) and Hijzen et al. (2010), we treat outsourcing as a continuous variable, using the firm’s outsourcing intensity as an independent variable that enters into a Cobb–Douglas production function, we arrive at the conclusion that more international outsourcing leads to productivity gains for foreign owned firms and for indigenous exporters in Ireland. This is broadly in line with the findings of Görg et al. (2008), who find that being more embedded in international markets leads to larger productivity gains from outsourcing. I propose that if international outsourcing is treated as a binary variable, different results should be arrived at under certain estimation techniques, the usage of a binary outsourcing measure amounts to testing the effect of switching into outsourcing on productivity. This discrete variable approach is grounded in the idea that becoming an outsourcer may lead to a fundamental change in the way a firm operates. The discrete variable also allows outsourcing to be used as a “treatment” in propensity score matching (PSM) techniques, estimating difference in difference (DD) effects for outsourcing on TFP. All analysis of the binary variable gives the intuitive result that indigenous non-exporters benefit the most from being an international outsourcer. For indigenous exporters and foreign affiliates, the effect of outsourcing on productivity is either lower, insignificant or negative. The intuition for the results stems from the idea of a “productivity ordering” of international activities. Indigenous exporters and multinational affiliates are likely to have exhausted a lot of the potential for productivity improvement due to the selection effects and the learning effects from entering into these activities. They are unlikely to experience as large a fundamental shift in the way they operate due to their being an importer of intermediates. Indigenous non-exporting firms, on the other hand, are further down the “productivity chain” so to speak, and are, therefore, more likely to benefit from being an international outsourcer relative to similar firms who only source inputs at home. Thus it is as a first step into international trade that becoming an outsourcer leads to the largest productivity improvements. Papers that embed the decision to import intermediates in the estimation of a firm production function include Amiti and Konings (2007) and Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008), who both find that importing of intermediates leads to increased productivity for Indonesia and Chile, respectively. The latter applies both a discrete and continuous measure of outsourcing and finds both to have positive significant effects on productivity. The approach taken in Sects. 4.2 and 4.3 is very similar to that in Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008), but can be seen as an extension, given that they do not break heterogeneous firms down by their internationalisation status. The analysis here, by breaking firms down along the delineation of Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004, HMY henceforth), gives more insight into the detail of the productivity improvement brought about due to outsourcing. Lopez (2006), in related work, shows that importer status positively predicts plant survival in Chile. The topic of international outsourcing has grown exponentially in relevance in the last two decades. As Grossman and Helpman (2005, p. 135) state, “we live in an age of outsourcing”. The reasons for the onset of this “age of outsourcing” lie in what Baldwin (2006) refers to as globalisation’s “second unbundling”. He defines the first unbundling as being marked by industrialisation, trade, growth, urbanisation and increasing internal inequality in the North. The firm was considered a “black box”, and firm-to-firm competition was the lowest level of aggregation to be analysed. In Baldwin’s “second unbundling”, which began in the 1980s, that “black box” was opened up, as firms started to locate different parts of the production process in different locations. The lowest level of disaggregation was no longer the firm but the task. Myriad factors can explain this shift in the process of production. These factors are well documented in the literature. For the purpose of all analysis that follows I define outsourcing as the procurement of inputs to the production process from outside the boundary of the firm. Firms’ sourcing modes To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to look at both outsourcing status and intensity and test their effect on the productivity of heterogeneous firm types. It is also the first paper to my knowledge to have tested the selection and learning equations proposed by BJ for outsourcing, using a structurally estimated TFP measure and propensity score matching. The paper can be viewed as an extension of Görg et al. (2008), in that it also looks at the heterogeneous effect of outsourcing for domestic, exporting and foreign firms, but looks at both outsourcing intensity and outsourcing status. It can also be seen as an extension of Kasashara and Rodrigue (2008) in that it looks at both outsourcing intensity and status, but also looks at the effect for heterogeneous firms. The intuitive nature of the differing results, depending on the measure of outsourcing used, comprises an addition to the literature’s understanding of the importance of both the importing of intermediates and international trade in general to firm performance. The paper proceeds as follows. The reasons to expect a causal relationship from outsourcing (both in general and offshore) to firm-level productivity are outlined in Sects. 2. Section 3 explains the data source, the Census of Industrial Production, and offers descriptive statistics. Section 4 reports regression results, while Sect. 5 concludes.",10

Export spillovers in Sweden,April 2011,Patrik Karpaty,Richard Kneller,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A key feature of the Swedish economy over the last two decades has been the rapid expansion of the stock of foreign-owned capital. Over the second half of the 1990’s Sweden was the seventh largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) globally and saw the percentage ratio of foreign to domestically owned firms rise by 10% points to 27% between 1990 and 2000 (Blomström and Kokko 2003). Within the data we use in this study we calculate that the number of foreign-owned firms increased by 60% between 1990 and 2001 (to 597 firms by 2001). Alongside this increase in inward FDI, there has also been a rapid rise in Swedish exports. Our data reveal that the volume of export trade has risen by 150% (to 691 million Swedish krona) over the sample period, while Greenaway et al. (2006) and Hansson et al. (2007) have previously reported that the number of firms exporting from Sweden rose from 75 to over 86% over the same time frame. Moreover this increase in exports has been faster amongst domestically owned firms: the share of total exports accounted for by domestically owned firms rose from 21 to 32% between 1990 and 2001.Footnote 1
 An interesting question considered in other contexts has been to what extent there are export spillovers from foreign to domestic firms.Footnote 2 The aim of this paper is to test whether rising foreign presence in the Swedish economy has helped domestic firms to expand their export sales. For this purpose we use data on Swedish manufacturing firms for the period 1990–2001. Export spillovers are believed to be important for a number of reasons. To the extent that it encourages the growth of firms in industries in which the country has a comparative advantage then the country will benefit from classic gains from trade. As part of these gains, the recent heterogeneous firm literature has emphasised the effect that greater exports by firms has on aggregate productivity. Some studies have additionally suggested there is a causal effect from the decision to export on firm productivity.Footnote 3 Finally, there could also be dynamic gains from large scale production. If a firm can lower its average costs by entering new markets the extra resources that this releases could be used for investment in R&D ensuring that the firm brings its product or services into line with consumer needs.Footnote 4
 While the above discussion suggests that export spillovers are of economic relevance and that Sweden is an interesting country to search for them, the main contributions that we make come from the empirical modelling of spillovers. Building on the work of Greenaway et al. (2004) we are able to separate the sales of foreign firms into those aimed at the domestic market and exports. This difference should allow us to determine whether any spillover effects we observe are general, in that they do not depend on the destination of final sales, or specific to export markets. As in the paper by Greenaway et al. (2004) we are also careful to allow for separate effects of foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) on the extensive (number of firms who export) and the intensive margins (the intensity with which those firms export) of exporting, accounting for the interdependence of these decisions through a Heckman selection model. In addition to information on whether sales are to the domestic or export markets, we also have information on the buyer of those goods: whether sales are between other affiliates within the same group or not. This allows us to explore the possibility that sales between affiliates within the same firm reveal different information compared to sales to unrelated firms. In turn we also use this information to compare spillovers according to the type of FDI that has taken place. The presence of intra-firm domestic sales indicates that the foreign-owned firm has multiple plants located in Sweden. We investigate whether this deeper integration (either geographic or industrial) means that export spillovers are stronger than for single-plant foreign-owned firms. We also explore possible heterogeneity in the effects of spillovers across other dimensions. Firstly, we test whether the characteristics of the foreign multinational (which we label sender-capacity) are important.Footnote 5 Specifically we examine the question of whether one can find stronger evidence of spillover effects from foreign-owned firms that are more productive compared to measures of foreign presence based on the size of firms. Secondly, we explore whether the effects of export spillovers differ according to the characteristics of the domestic firm. Are some firms better placed to capture the spillover benefits of foreign-owned firms? Absorptive capacity effects have previously been explored in the productivity spillovers literature by Cohen and Levinthal (1989), Grünfeld (2003), Girma and Wakelin (2002), Haskel et al. (2002), Kokko et al. (1996). However, to the best of our knowledge there is no previous study on the effects of sender capacity. To preview some of the main findings of the paper, we find that in general increased FDI has had a positive effect on Swedish exports, where this effect has been primarily on the export intensity of existing exporters. We also find support for the extensions that we make to the spillovers literature. FDI spillovers are stronger for intra-firm sales (domestic and export) compared to inter-firm sales. This suggests that foreign multinationals that are more deeply embedded in the local economy impart stronger spillover effects. We also find that controlling for such heterogeneity in the foreign firms sending spillovers and the domestic firms receiving them is important. Stronger evidence of export spillovers can be found when greater weight is given to more productive foreign firms and when domestic firms are more R&D intensive. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical methodology used in the estimation and Sect. 3 the data sources and the construction of the main variables of the paper. Section 4 presents the empirical results. These include the main results as well as tests of heterogeneity. Section 5 concludes the paper.",20

While plant closure results in job losses, the creative destruction associated with plant deaths may also improve productivity by replacing the least productive with more productive plants (Baldwin 1995; Baldwin and Gu 2006).Footnote 1 In a sample of all Canadian manufacturing plants, 65% of active plants in 1979 had ceased their production by 1996. Within this set of exiting plants, 91% are non-exporters and 86% are domestic-controlled plants. Exiting plants are on average 15% younger and 50% smaller than those continuing to produce; but, most significantly, they are less productive. Their death then leads to increases in industry productivity. Understanding the factors contributing to plant closure has important implications for industrial, trade, and foreign direct investment policies. Empirical and theoretical research in industrial organization and international trade has identified several factors contributing to plant death: age, size, productivity, export status and tariff reductions. By comparison, we know much less about how producers respond to exchange rate movements. Plants may respond to changes in exchange rates and tariffs in different ways. They may expand/contract existing operations, enter/exit domestic or foreign markets, relocate their production facilities, or consolidate operations through mergers and acquisitions. This paper focuses on the linkage to plant exit. The paper makes several contributions to our knowledge. We examine the predictions of recent international trade models with heterogeneous firms in the context of tariff changes and exchange-rate fluctuations, and how plants with different characteristics (efficiency level, export status, and domestic/foreign control) respond differently to changes in tariffs and exchange rates. Consistent with the implications of trade models with heterogeneous firms, we find that the impact of exchange-rate movements and tariff cuts on death are heterogeneous, particularly pronounced among least efficient plants. However, we also demonstrate in a comprehensive way using a consistent approach that current models featuring one-dimensional heterogeneity (efficiency differences across plants) cannot fully characterize the data. We find multi-dimensional heterogeneity. There are significant and substantial differences between exporters and non-exporters, and between domestic- and foreign-controlled plants: exporters and foreign-owned plants have much lower failure rates; however, their survival is more sensitive to changes in tariffs and real exchange rates, whether differences in their efficiency levels are controlled or not. This paper is one of the few that study the impact of exchange-rate movements on plant survival. While there are several papers that analyze the impact of tariff reductions (Head and Ries 1999; Trefler 2004; Lileeva 2008), work on how exchange-rate movements affect plant survival is limited (Head and Ries 1999; Fung 2008, and Baggs et al. 2009).Footnote 2 The paper provides empirical evidence on the simultaneous effect of tariff reduction and exchange-rate movements on plant exit using Canadian plant-level panel data covering a period from 1979 to 1996 during which Canada experienced large exchange-rate fluctuations and tariff reductions. We make use of Statistics Canada’s Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM), which allows for a rich set of covariates with regard to nationality, export intensity, and industry characteristics. As a result, we are able to examine the heterogeneity of responses of different subgroups of plants to changing tariffs and exchange rates. The paper also deals with the problems associated with interactions in probit regression and offers correct interpretation of the effects of interaction terms between tariffs/exchange rates and producer characteristics. Section 2 reviews a set of hypotheses regarding plant exit using a variety of models from the industrial organization and international trade literature. Section 3 introduces the data sources used herein and provides summary statistics. Section 4 outlines empirical specifications, and presents empirical results. Section 5 concludes.",37
147,1,Review of World Economics,16 November 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0077-3,The role of foreign direct investment in the host-country firm selection process: firm-level evidence from Slovenian manufacturing,April 2011,Katja Zajc Kejžar,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The paper aims to provide a deeper understanding of the role of incoming foreign direct investment (FDI) in the firm selection process in the Slovenian manufacturing sector. Several recent empirical studies provide evidence that within-industry reallocations from less to more productive firms and the exit/entry process contribute significantly to average productivity growth and constitute an important mode of industrial restructuring (see Olley and Pakes 1996; Roberts and Tybout 1996; Pavcnik 2002; Tybout 2003). At the same time, it is widely recognised that investment liberalisation is one of the most important triggers of the industrial restructuring process driven by intra- and inter-industry firm selection processes. As indicated in the theoretical literature (reviewed in, for example, Caves 1996; Blomström and Kokko 1997, 1998), there are two main opposing effects through which inward FDI can affect a domestic firm’s survival and performance: competition effects and productivity spillover effects. On the one hand, by increasing competition in the host country, a foreign firm’s entry and presence may lead to the crowding out of local firms within the particular industry. As emphasised by Görg and Strobl (2003), the increased production of foreign rivals will generally lead to a reduction of the output price which will shrink the price–cost margin and increase the probability of the exit of domestic firms. The competition effect may also operate in the factor markets, whereby foreign firms may crowd out domestic rivals by increasing factor prices in the economy. Moreover, a selection effect might also operate through vertical linkages, leading to a decrease in demand for intermediate products. The demand for domestically produced intermediates might decrease either because foreign firms use inputs more efficiently or they rely more on imported intermediates (see Rivera-Batiz and Rivera-Batiz 1991). In addition, some local suppliers might not be able to achieve the higher product standards or delivery conditions demanded by foreign firms. On the other hand, foreign firms’ activity in the host country may confer positive productivity spillovers on domestic firms.Footnote 1 An increase in productivity through spillovers will, ceteris paribus, reduce a domestic firm’s average production costs which in turn expands its price–cost margin. Thus, in the case of positive productivity spillovers we can expect a greater probability of survival. Productivity spillovers may occur within the same industry (intra-industry spillovers) as a result, for instance, of multinational enterprises’ (MNEs) training of local employees or demonstration effects, or in vertically—upstream and downstream—related industries through customer–supplier links between MNEs and domestic firms (inter-industry spillovers), or as a result of agglomeration (see Blomström and Kokko 1997, 1998). While there is a substantial body of empirical literature on spillover effects, evidence of the importance and mechanisms of competition effects is relatively rare. Therefore, I have chosen an industry and firm dynamics framework to focus on the mechanisms of competition effects and in particular on their impact on the crowding out of local firms (increased probability of exiting). More specifically, I estimate a firm exit model employing probit and log–log model specification on firm-level data for the Slovenian manufacturing sector in the 1994–2003 period. Despite the relatively numerous empirical studies on a firm’s survival and growth, empirical evidence on the impacts of inward FDI or even of foreign competition generally on the growth and survival of local firms is very limited. One exception is a study by Görg and Strobl (2003). Using plant-level data for the Irish manufacturing sector in the 1973–1996 period and employing a Cox proportional hazard model, they find that the presence of multinationals has a positive effect on the survival of Irish plants but this effect is only significant for plants that operate in high-tech sectors. Regarding foreign-owned plants, they provide evidence that foreign plants have higher hazards of exiting than indigenous plants and that the presence of multinationals has a negative effect on the survival of other foreign-owned plants in low-tech sectors. In contrast, De Backer and Sleuwaegen (2003) find evidence that inward FDI increases domestic exits for Belgian manufacturing data. The crowding-out effect is stronger in the case of FDI than in the case of imports. Using 1994–2001 firm-level panel data for the Czech Republic, Kosová (2006) provides evidence that foreign expansion, measured by the foreign sales growth rate, has a positive effect on both the growth and survival of domestic firms, but that the exit rates of domestic firms around the time of a foreign entry are significantly higher.
 My aim is to provide further evidence on the mechanisms and channels through which inward FDI affects host-country firm dynamics for the Slovenian manufacturing sector in the 1994–2003 period. The main contribution of this paper to the existent empirical studies lies in testing several new theoretical predictions of recent models of heterogeneous firm dynamics. Among others, the following hypotheses are tested: (i) Entry of foreign firms increases the probability of incumbent firms’ exit. (ii) Crowding out is most pronounced for firms that are orientated towards domestic market. (iii) Foreign firms’ activity affects the survival probability of incumbent firms also through backward and forward linkages (customer–supplier links) between MNEs and domestic firms and through regional spillover effects. One of the advantages of this study is that, unlike in most studies on FDI which restrict the sample to larger firms, it uses a data set that covers the whole population of manufacturing firms registered in Slovenia. This is particularly important for studying characteristics of competition effects of foreign firm entry since a restriction of the sample to larger firms would most likely cause biased estimates as mortality rates tend to be higher for smaller firms than for larger firms. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2, the data and main descriptive statistics with respect to domestic- and foreign-owned firms are presented. Section 3 specifies an exit (survival) model to be applied to panel data for Slovenian manufacturing firms and defines the variables. Section 4 discusses the main econometric problems dealt with in the empirical analysis. Section 5 presents the results and implications of the empirical estimations. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes with a summary of the main findings of the empirical analysis.",16
147,2,Review of World Economics,19 December 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0085-3,Endogenous market structure and foreign market entry,June 2011,James Markusen,Frank Stähler,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Analyses of cross-border acquisitions versus greenfield investments are motivated by the relatively large volume of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in total world flows of foreign direct investment (FDI). Even in developing countries, where we might expect entry of foreign firms by greenfield investments to dominate, about one-third of FDI inflows were by M&A by the late 1990s. For the world as a whole, the value of cross M&A activity was about four-fifths of total FDI flows (World Investment Report 2000). Thus international trade and finance economists have been keen to understand the factors driving the choice of entry mode by foreign multinational firms. There have been a fair number of papers written about cross-border acquisitions versus greenfield investments, and some include a third option for a foreign firm such as exporting. These models vary considerably in their structure and assumptions, presumably largely because the modelers have different underlying questions in mind. Our approach to this question comes indirectly from what is known as the strategic-trade-policy literature, a largely normative literature that considered the effects of trade and industrial policy in an environment of increasing returns to scale and imperfect competition. One thing that turned out to be crucial in determining the sign as well as the magnitude of optimal policies is whether or not there is free entry and exit of firms in response to the policy (Venables 1985; Horstmann and Markusen 1986; Markusen and Venables 1988). In our reading of the literature on greenfield versus acquisitions in the international context, we have not seen a model which allows for the entry or exit of domestic firms (other than the target of course) in response to the entry of a foreign multinational into the country.
Footnote 1 This is a concern both because of the big difference between fixed and free-entry approaches in the strategic-trade-policy literature just mentioned, and because some of the policy literature take a very strong position based on the fixed-firm case. Here is a quote from the World Investment Report 2000 Cross Border Mergers and Acquisitions and Development (2000, pp. xxvi–xxvii). Under normal circumstances (i.e., in the absence of crises or systemic changes) and especially when cross-border M&As and greenfield investments are real alternatives, greenfield FDI is more useful to developing countries than cross-border M&As... And when M&As involve competing firms, there are, of course, the possible negative impacts on market concentration and competition, which can persist beyond the entry phase The most important policy instrument, however, is competition policy. The principal reason is that M&As can pose threats to competition, both at the time of entry and subsequently. In our model with free entry and exit (but similar to traditional models in other dimensions), we show that this view is incorrect. Aggregate domestic output and price is ex post the same under either greenfield or acquisition implying that consumer surplus is the same. Even more, we show that an acquisition may improve domestic welfare because part of the acquisition rents accrue to the local seller. A greenfield investment, however, will not change welfare at all in our model.Footnote 2 Thus policies favoring greenfield as suggested by the World Investment Report, may be distortionary and inappropriate. Perhaps the closest discussion to our model is a short section in Navaretti and Venables (2004, chapter 3, written by Venables). They use a standard large-group monopolistic competition model and inquire as to the effect of the entry of a foreign multinational, either by switching from exports or by entirely new supply.Footnote 3 In either case, the entry can be by greenfield or by M&A, though there is no definition and no discussion about the acquisition process or price. Assume that the foreign firm is “new”, not a switcher from exporting. A central case assumes that the foreign multinational produces with the same marginal cost as local firms. Thus if the foreign firm enters by “greenfield” it will simply displace one domestic firm in the monopolistic-competition equilibrium, and if it enters by “M&A” it takes over one firm which leaves the profits of the remaining firms at zero. There is no observational difference between greenfield and M&A: in either case, ex post there is one foreign firm and (n − 1) domestic firms. A similar equivalence occurs if entry is switching from exports. They do not solve for an equilibrium under the assumption of a fixed number of firms and thus do not compare it to the free entry/exit case which is the principal focus of our paper.Footnote 4
 The purpose of this paper is to provide a model which endogenizes market entry of local firms and in which firms interact strategically.Footnote 5 We build a partial-equilibrium model of a single industry in a single host country, with an outside foreign firm that is initially exporting to the country.Footnote 6 There are zero profits earned by multiple host-country firms initially. Then the multinational is allowed to directly enter either by making a greenfield investment in a new plant, or by acquiring one local firm. This is analyzed both under the assumption that the number of other host-country firms is held fixed, or that the number adjusts such that zero-profits are maintained. Acquisition is modelled as a Nash bargaining game between the multinational and one firm, but we include the special case where all of the bargaining weight goes to the multinational (who makes take-it-or-leave-it offers) so that the multinational firm captures all of the surplus. The multinational’s outside option is exporting and the local firm’s outside option is then (continued) zero profits. Entry of the foreign firm (switching from exporting) by acquisition has the effect of driving up the product price in the host country under the fixed market structure (import supply disappears), but drives down the price when entering via greenfield (there is one more firm, with a marginal cost less than under exporting). Allowing the number of (zero-profit) domestic firms to adjust means that there will be entry under acquisition but exit under greenfield. Relative to the fixed-market structure, free entry and exit make acquisition less attractive relative to either greenfield or to exporting. The effects of the alternative market-structure assumptions on the profits of the entering multinational are interesting. Use the fixed assumption as a benchmark and now introduce free entry and exit. If the firm chose greenfield under the former or switches from exporting to greenfield, its profits will increase with entry, whereas if it initially chose acquisition the situation is a bit more complex. If the multinational continues to choose acquisition or switches to exporting it must be worse off. But if it switches to greenfield, it can be either better or worse off: free entry reduces the profits from acquisition but increases the profits from greenfield. If that latter profit level “jumps over” acquisition profits sufficiently that greenfield profits are now higher than the initial acquisition profits, then the multinational is better off. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up the general model and develops an important invariance result for an endogenous market structure. Section 3 specifies the model further and discusses the foreign entry option both for a fixed and an endogenous market structure. Section 4 presents the implications of parameter changes, and Section 5 concludes.",27
147,2,Review of World Economics,11 November 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-010-0078-2,"Offshoring and firm performance: self-selection, effects on performance, or both?",June 2011,Joachim Wagner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Offshoring is one of today’s catchwords. Putting it into Google lead to some 2,040,000 results in 0.22 s on August 14, 2009, the day I started writing this paper. As is often the case with catchwords, offshoring means different things to different people. In this paper I follow Olsen (2006, p. 6f.) and use offshoring to describe the relocation of processes to any foreign country without distinguishing whether the provider is external or affiliated with the firm, while outsourcing is defined as the relocation of processes to external providers regardless of the provider’s location within the home country or in a foreign country (see also Feenstra 2010, p. 5f.). Offshoring, therefore, includes international outsourcing (to a non-affiliated firm) and international insourcing (to an affiliated firm). Similarly, Görg et al. (2008a, p. 3) define outsourcing as a process whereby an activity which was previously undertaken in-house is contracted to another supplier, and this could be supply of intermediate inputs or services. When this process occurs across national frontiers, this is called offshore outsourcing or, for short, offshoring. This kind of offshoring often leads to what Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006, 2008) named international “trade in tasks” that is different from trade in complete goods, and it is this trade in tasks that is at the core of many theoretical models that discuss the issue of offshoring. In this empirical study, offshoring is measured as relocation of production of a manufacturing firm abroad either inhouse (to a foreign affiliate) or through arms-length-trade (by buying intermediates from a non-affiliated foreign firm). Since this measure of offshoring includes horizontal foreign direct investment (where former exports are replaced by final goods production abroad to serve foreign markets) it is related to but not identical to the theoretical concept of offshoring as trade in tasks. A more correct expression might be “relocation abroad”. Both expressions—offshoring and relocation abroad—will be used interchangeably in this paper. Most of the time (at least, in Germany) offshoring is used with a negative connotation, pointing to jobs lost due to relocating production from the high-wage country Germany to countries where labour is cheaper.Footnote 1 Obviously, however, a negative causal impact of offshoring on domestic employment is not necessary. Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006, p. 61f.) argue that when some tasks performed by a certain type of labour can be more easily offshored, the firms that gain the most are those that use this type of labour intensively. Profitability of these firms will rise, and this will lead to an incentive to expand relative to firms that rely most heavily on other types of labour. The increase in labour demand by these firms will in part fall on local workers who perform tasks that cannot easily be offshored. At the level of the offshoring firm, therefore, there might be a positive impact if the competitiveness of the production remaining in Germany is strengthened and productivity increases. At the macro level an increase in the international division of labour and specialisation on products where the home country has a comparative advantage might foster growth. Furthermore, it is often questionable whether the employment effects that are observed in conjunction with offshoring can be considered to be caused by offshoring. Often production that is relocated is no longer profitable in the home country, and the employees would lose their jobs even if the firm does not engage in offshoring. The sign and the size of the effect of offshoring on employment at both the level of the firm and the level of the economy as a whole, therefore, can only be revealed by empirical studies. For similar reasons, the same holds for the impact of offshoring on other dimensions of economic performance, including productivity growth and growth in human capital intensity. Given the large interest in offshoring in public discussions and the need for empirical research to uncover its consequences, the lack of stylized facts based on a large body of sound econometric studies comes as a surprise.Footnote 2 There is, however, both theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence that can be used to guide an empirical investigation on the causes and consequences of offshoring in German manufacturing enterprises.Footnote 3
 First of all, there is evidence that offshoring firms differ systematically from non-offshoring firms. In a comprehensive survey of the literature Görg et al. (2008a, p. 34) ask “whether, among a random sample of firms we would expect all to engage in offshoring or whether it is only a certain group of firms that do so”. According to the authors the “short answer to this is: only a certain group—and we would expect this to comprise the ‘better’ firms in any sample.” Görg et al. (2008a, p. 35) summarize empirical evidence from a number of studies which is in line with this big picture. This leads to a first hypothesis: Offshoring firms are “better” than non-offshoring firms—they are larger, more productive, more human capital intensive, and have a higher share of exports in total sales. If firms that relocated parts of their activities abroad are “better” than non-offshoring firms at a point in time this might be caused by self-selection of “better” firms into offshoring. Self-selection would be in line with recent developments in economic theory of international firm activities. Offshoring involves substantial sunk costs related to searching for a foreign partner, doing market research, fixing contractual arrangements etc. Therefore, only the larger, more productive, more human capital intensive firms with a higher share of exports in total sales will be able to overcome these sunk cost barriers and successfully start to offshore (see Antràs and Helpman (2004) and Görg et al. (2008a, p. 34f).Footnote 4 This leads to a second hypothesis: Offshoring firms were “better” than non-offshoring firms already before they started offshoring—they were larger, more productive, more human capital intensive, and had a higher share of exports in total sales compared to firms that did not start offshoring in the future. Better firms self-select into offshoring. The main focus of most empirical studies on the consequences of offshoringFootnote 5 is on labour market issues (i.e. the level and the skill composition of employment, and the level and the structure of wages). This literature is surveyed in Geishecker et al. (2008) and Crinò (2009). Summarizing, Görg et al. (2008a, p. 6) argue that although some studies have identified small negative employment effects of offshoring, the consensus that seems to be emerging is that employment effects are either broadly neutral or result in a small net gain. Similarly, Crinò (2009, p. 234) states that the results of the empirical studies suggest that the overall labour market effect of offshoring is rather modest. However, low-skilled workers in particular feel the pressure from international outsourcing (see Geishecker et al. (2008, p. 169), Munch and Skaksen (2009, p. 72), and Crinò (2009, p. 234)). This leads to a third and a fourth hypothesis: Employment effects are either broadly neutral or result in a small net gain in offshoring firms. The skill composition in offshoring firms changes in favour of high-skill employees. Studies focusing on other dimensions of firm performance are rare. We have some evidence, however, for productivity. Olsen (2006, p. 9) states that direct investigations of the impact of outsourcing on firm productivity are relatively few in number. Görg et al. (2008a, p. 8) summarize the findings by stating that for manufacturing firms offshoring results in higher labour productivity. This leads to a fifth hypothesis: For manufacturing firms offshoring results in higher labour productivity. What do we know about the validity of these five hypotheses for Germany? Empirical studies on the causes and on the causal effects of offshoring on the performance of enterprises in Germany, a leading actor in the world markets for goods and services, are rare. Kinkel et al. (2004) use data from a small sample of firms collected in 2003 to look at the extent, the determinants, and the employment effects of relocation of production (see also Kinkel and Maloca (2008, 2009)). The studies are descriptive only, and no causal effects of offshoring on firm performance are looked at. Geishecker and Görg (2005) combine individual level data from the German socio-economic panel SOEP and industry level information on imported inputs from input–output tables to investigate the effects of international fragmentation of production on individual wages (see also Geishecker (2005), Geishecker and Görg (2008)) and on individual employment security (Geishecker 2008). Bachmann and Braun (2008) use a similar approach based on individual level data from the IABS, a sample provided by the Institute for Empoyment Research (IAB), combined with industry level data on imports of intermediate products. By construction all these studies cannot uncover any causal effect of outsourcing on enterprises, and the same holds for studies by Geishecker (2006) and Schöller (2007a, b) based on industry level data. Marin (2006) is a study on the extent and determinants of relocation to Eastern Europe, based on a survey of German and Austrian enterprises that invested in East-European countries between 1990 and 2001. The consequences of offshoring, however, are not considered in this study. Buch et al. (2007) use firm level data from the “Going International”—survey performed in 2005 (see DIHK 2005) to investigate the causes and employment consequences of offshoring. Furthermore, they analyse a question from the 2004 wave of the IAB establishment panel (see Fischer et al. 2009) that deals with planned relocation to the new EU member countries, and they use micro data on foreign direct investments from the MiDi data base of the German central bank (see Lipponer 2003) aggregated at the regional level (federal states) and the level of broad industries. The focus is on the determinants of offshoring and on the employment effects of foreign direct investment at the regional and sectoral level. The causal effects of offshoring on firm performance are not investigated in this study. The only study using German firm level data to investigate the causal effects of offshoring that I am aware of is a recent paper by Moser et al. (2009). The authors use data from the IAB establishment panel (described in Fischer et al. 2009) for 1998–2004 to identify causal effects of offshoring on employment. They measure offshoring as qualitative increase in the share of intermediate inputs of an establishment received from abroad. Their variable offshoring takes the value of one if the establishment experienced an increase in imported intermediate goods and zero otherwise. The data allow to measure qualitatively such an increase as an establishment’s increase in its share of intermediate goods from abroad from “not at all” to “partly” or from “partly” to “predominantly” between business years. Moser et al. (2009) discuss various channels through which offshoring may impact employment.Footnote 6 First, there is the direct job loss through downsizing. Second, cost reduction and increased competitiveness on both the national and international markets compared to non-offshoring competitors might lead to an increase in employment. Third, and discussed for the first time in this paper, there may be negative effects on the employment of other producers in Germany if domestic intermediate inputs that were bought by the offshoring firm are now replaced by intermediate inputs bought on a foreign market. This indirect effect might be an important source of job loss in Germany.Footnote 7
 Moser et al. (2009, p. 3) find a statistically and economically significant positive employment effect of an increase in the foreign intermediate input share in total inputs (i.e. offshoring) on the domestic plant. Offshoring plants increase their average labour productivity, and their domestic and foreign market share compared to “twin”-firms that do not engage in offshoring. While the study by Moser et al. (2009) is for sure an important contribution to the empirical literature it is somewhat limited by its data-driven focus on measuring offshoring by an increase in the share of intermediate inputs of an establishment received from abroad only. This measure of offshoring is different from the measure used in this paper. As stated above at the very beginning of this paper, offshoring is defined here as the relocation of activities formerly performed in a domestic firm to a firm located in a foreign country. This relocation might take the form of substitution of intermediate products formerly produced in the firm in Germany by imported intermediate inputs, and this increases the share of intermediate inputs of an establishment received from abroad and indicates offshoring in the sense of Moser et al. (2009). On the one hand, however, substitution of intermediate inputs formerly bought from suppliers located in Germany by imported inputs is not considered as offshoring according to the definition used in this paper (but by Moser et al. 2009). On the other hand, relocation of activities from a firm in Germany to a foreign country that does not lead to an increase in the import of intermediates (like producing and selling a good in a foreign country instead of producing it in Germany and exporting it) is not counted as offshoring by Moser et al. (2009). One contribution of the paper is the application of an alternative measure of offshoring that has not been used in investigations for Germany before. Given the large degree of heterogeneity in firm behaviour with respect to outsourcing (Olsen 2006, p. 15) the lack of empirical studies using longitudinal data at the enterprise level to investigate the causes and the effects of offshoring on various dimensions of firm performance hinders an understanding of offshoring that could better inform public debates and discussion about policy measures (not only, but also in Germany). This paper contributes to the literature by using unique new data for German manufacturing enterprises from matched regular surveys and a special purpose survey conducted by the federal statistical office to investigate the causal effects of relocation of activities to a foreign country on various dimensions of firm performance. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the data used in this study. Section 3 presents the results of the empirical investigation. Section 4 concludes.",57

The indicators provide policy transparency, contribute to a better understanding of the various dimensions of agricultural support measures in high-income countries, and have been used extensively as inputs into economic models of agricultural markets. The OECD (2006) has also released PSEs for Brazil, China and South Africa, as well as for several East European countries; and it will soon add them for Chile. A recent global World Bank study (Anderson 2009) complements and extends the OECD’s efforts by providing similar estimates for a longer time period (back to 1955) and for individual member countries of the European Union. It also has comparable estimates for 45 other countries at different stages of economic development and includes a time series of rates of assistance to producers of non-agricultural goods, to compare with agricultural distortion estimates. The OECD and World Bank measures for each product are aggregated using the value of production and consumption as weights to obtain an annual average PSE and CSE for each country. That traditional aggregation method provides a reasonable indicator of the average price distortion across that country’s product set, but it is not necessarily a good indicator of the distortion to the volume of trade in farm products because that depends also on the responsiveness of domestic supply and demand to price changes (that is, price elasticities), and on whether there are any negative PSEs that are offsetting positive ones in the aggregating process. It is an even poorer indicator of the national welfare cost of that country’s farm price and trade policies, because for each product that cost is related to the square of the rate of price distortion and so the total cost depends on the extent of dispersion in product PSEs and CSEs. Certainly one can use the OECD or World Bank price distortions as inputs into national partial or general equilibrium models to estimate the trade- and welfare-reducing effects of a country’s agricultural policies (as in, for example, Anderson and Valenzuela 2007). However, such models are computationally intensive, and the results can be contentious if there is no consensus on what model specification and parameters such as elasticities to use. Even more problematic is that typically they are calibrated only for a particular past year and so are not able to provide a time series of estimated economic effects. An alternative is to use the raw data in the OECD and World Bank studies to calculate indexes of the trade- and welfare-reducing effects of policies. Anderson and Neary (2005) specify a simple, elegant and theoretically meaningful methodology to provide such measures as a supplement to aggregate PSEs and CSEs. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the Anderson and Neary methodology can be applied using no more information than that assembled already to generate price distortion estimates for OECD member countries. The method may have been ignored to date because it was traditionally thought that price elasticity estimates were necessary to estimate such indexes. However, it has recently been shown by Lloyd et al. (2010) that by assuming domestic price elasticities of supply are equal across commodities within a country, and likewise for price elasticities of demand, the index number formulae simplify to a share-weighted function using shares of production and consumption as weights. The resulting measures thereby can be generated as supplements to the current policy monitoring indicators generated by the OECD Secretariat without having to tackle the contentious questions associated with the size of price elasticities (such as whether they refer to the short or long run) and without having to continually update a sectoral or economywide model. Drawing on the Anderson and Neary framework, we estimate two indexes which go by the precise descriptors of a trade reduction index (TRI) and a welfare reduction index (WRI). The TRI and WRI are each computed from sub-indexes of the production and consumption sides of the market (the producer and consumer distortion indexes, PDI and CDI), which are derived from nominal rate of assistance (NRA) and consumer tax equivalent (CTE) estimates for individual products, respectively, from the World Bank’s database.Footnote 1 NRAs to producers and CTEs to consumers differ whenever there are domestic subsidies or taxes on production or consumption in addition to border measures. Thus, the indexes capture in a single scalar number the aggregate trade- or welfare-reducing effects of all policies directly affecting consumer and producer prices of farm products from all measures in place. Non-product-specific distortions are not captured in the indexes, which by construction aggregate only product-specific data. However, we attempt to gauge the importance of this limitation in the final section of the paper. The present paper is aimed at encouraging not only the OECD to add these indexes to their current set of indicators calculated each year, but also developing country governments or policy think-tanks to generate them so as to be able to monitor each year the trade and welfare effects of their national policies. A new FAO/OECD project, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and getting under way in 2010, aims to estimate agricultural policy indicators for a large sample of poor African countries over the next few years. Since many of those countries do not have a sectoral or economywide model of their economy, the two indicators outlined in this paper could provide at least a partial equilibrium indication of the effect of national policies in reducing agricultural trade and national economic welfare. They could then be compared with those provided in the present paper for high-income countries. Section 2 presents the methodology for computing partial-equilibrium trade and welfare reduction indexes. Section 3 outlines the data in the World Bank’s database, which are used for computing the indexes. In Sect. 4 the index results are presented and discussed, followed by Sect. 5 addressing several caveats. Section 6 concludes with lessons learned and areas for further research.",5

The case of the EU enlargement 2004 and Germany’s eastern border,June 2011,Nils Braakmann,Alexander Vogel,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper provides evidence on the labour market consequences of the 2004 EU enlargement in Germany’s eastern border region close to the new member states Poland and the Czech Republic relative to the rest of Germany. We look at wage and employment effects using plant level panel data aggregated from social security records and treat the EU enlargement as an exogenous event for enterprises close to Germany’s eastern border. As the effects of the enlargement may well depend on previous legislative barriers to trade, we also conduct separate analyses for various industries. Specifically, we consider the effects for firms in manufacturing, construction, business services, social and personal service activities and, finally, wholesale and retail trade and hotels and restaurants. Theoretically, an effect of the EU enlargement on the employment situation in German firms that are geographically close to the new member states of the EU could occur through the elimination of barriers to trade (see, e.g., Gandolfo 1998, pp. 195–204 for a standard textbook model). The economic integration lowers trading costs for producers and customers in the old and new member countries. These lower costs can lead to an increase in international trade, which in turn might influence firm performance and behaviour through the increase in competition in the respective domestic or foreign market.Footnote 1
 These effects of the EU enlargement should be stronger for enterprises close to Germany’s eastern border, in particular for firms offering products that are either hard to transport or require personal contact, e.g., services, or hotels and restaurants. However, even for firms that offer goods that are easy to transport a possible effect of the enlargement can be expected to depend on distance to the border, e.g., in the case of domestic demand shocks caused by local customers shifting their demand towards foreign producers—an effect that might be particularly relevant for retail trade. Additionally, a focus on border regions when looking at the effects of trade barriers is not uncommon in the previous literature. Hanson (1996) and Feenstra and Hanson (1997) focus on the economic integration of Mexico and the United States and find positive wage and employment effects in border regions of both countries. In the same context, Hanson (1998) provides evidence for Mexican cities that in particular trade costs and linkages between producers and customers influence the regional employment structure. Moritz and Gröger (2007) consider the impact of the fall of the Iron Curtain on the wages of Bavarian workers close to the Czech border using a 2% sample from German social security and unemployment benefit records and find relatively minor effects on wages and the skill distribution in the border region. However, none of these studies deal with the economic consequences of the EU enlargement. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one other study that considers the impact of the 2004 EU enlargement on enterprise performance. Braakmann and Vogel (2010) consider the effects of the enlargement on service firms situated in a Federal State with an eastern border relative to the effects on firms in other Federal States. Their results from difference-in difference (DiD) estimators combined with matching on panel data from official statistics, the German Business Services Statistics Panel (see Vogel 2009), indicate a relatively minor influence of the expansion on larger enterprises and a positive effect for smaller firms. As the existence and strength of trade barriers prior to the enlargement influences the expected increase in international trade, we conduct separate analyses for different industries as trade legislations and other entry barriers differed over sectors prior to the enlargement. The service sector, for instance, had relatively strong legal barriers before the expansion, caused by the necessity of residence and work permits and by the necessary approval of foreign degrees in occupations with minimum qualification requirements (see Scharr and Untiedt 2001, p. 186).Footnote 2 The case was different for manufacturing where free trade agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic had been established as early as 1992 (European Agreement 1993, 1994). While an increase in international trade could still emerge through less restrictive border controls and lower waiting times, one might expect the effects of the EU enlargement on trade in goods to be quite small (see Scharr and Untiedt 2001, p. 185). However, both the extent of border controls and waiting times might matter for customers frequenting retails stores on the other side of the border, e.g., Germans buying cigarettes in Poland, which makes an effect more likely for this industry compared to, e.g., manufacturing. For the construction sector, competition from East European workers working for German firms was a longer standing concern, which resulted in the introduction of minimum wages and work standards in the 1996 Entsendegesetz (see Möller and König 2008; König and Möller 2009, for an analysis). Additionally, Germany (and Austria) adopted transitional restrictions for workers and firms from the new member countries, the “2 + 3 + 2” rule, that restricts the free movement of labour and possibilities of foreign firms to enter and conduct work in the German construction sector up to 2011.Footnote 3 However, in 2004 market barriers in the construction sector were lowered through changes in the Handwerksordnung which changed minimum qualification requirements for a number of trades, e.g., pavers. Combined with the transitional restrictions, a possible effect of the EU expansion could arise through entry of single-person entrepreneurs into the German market, either through immigrants setting up their businesses in Germany or through East European craftsman serving the German market from Poland or the Czech Republic. Our empirical investigation builds on the idea that effects should be stronger for firms close to the border and compares differences over time within enterprises that are situated in a county (Kreis)Footnote 4 within the borderland to the new member statesFootnote 5 with differences over time within enterprises that are situated in a Federal State without such a border. Note that this implies that we compare firms that are situated in the direct eastern border region to firms with a considerable distance to that border. In our analysis, we use a 50% sample of the population of German plants, generated from aggregated social security records. In a first step, we match each border firm to a statistical twin from the group of non-border firms that experienced a similar development during the period 1992–2001 and is also similar in a large set of characteristics in 2002. In a second step, we use regression adjusted DiD estimators to compare the development in the “border firms” over time to the development in firms farther away from the border. We also explicitly check for differences in the outcomes between these groups of firms in 2003 to investigate possible anticipation effects of the EU enlargement. As outcomes, we consider total employment, employment of low-skilled workers and workers from eastern Europe as well as total wages and wages for low-skilled, skilled and high-skilled workers. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the data, while our empirical modeling strategy is outlined in Sect. 3. Results are presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",7

These range from broad analyses of global payments imbalances and interest rates (e.g. Dooley et al. 2004) to detailed examination of the exports of particular commodities by particular countries (e.g. Gallagher et al. 2008). Most of them refer to the past, but some forecast the future (e.g. Yang 2003; Mayer and Fajarnes 2008). They have used various methods, including inspection of trade data (e.g. Lall et al. 2005; Mesquita Moreira 2007; Kaplinsky and Morris 2008), revealed comparative advantage calculations (Lederman et al. 2008), gravity models (e.g. Greenaway et al. 2008; Hanson and Robertson 2010) and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models (e.g. Dimaranan et al. 2006). To survey this literature would require an entire paper, but good bibliographies are available in Goldstein et al. (2006), Winters and Yusuf (2006), and Broadman (2007). The focus of the present paper is on how the entry of China into world markets over the past three decades has affected the broad sectoral structures of other economies, especially developing ones. It looks in particular at the balance between the two broad traded sectors that matter most to developing countries, namely labour-intensive manufacturing, which is often said to have been harmed by competition from China, and primary production, which is often said to have gained from increased demand by China. The effects of China on both these sectors in other developing countries have aroused concerns and suspicions about retarded industrialisation, reduced employment and increased inequality in Africa, Latin America and the rest of Asia. The analysis in this paper goes beyond most other studies of the impact of China by examining the sectoral structure not only of exports but also of output (in this respect being similar to the CGE studies). It is also set in a more clearly specified theoretical framework—that of Heckscher and Ohlin (henceforth HO)—than most other studies. The relevance of HO is contested by Rodrik (2006), who finds China’s exports to be more sophisticated than normal for its level of development, but his results are challenged by Xu (2007), Amiti and Freund (2008), and Schott (2008). Section 2 explains how, in HO theory, the entry of China into world markets should affect the sectoral structures of other countries and outlines our method of estimating the size of this effect. Section 3 describes our data. Section 4 presents our calculations of the impact of China on world average endowments. Section 5 estimates the effects of endowments on output and export structures. Section 6 combines the results of the two previous sections into predictions of the impact of China on output and export structures in other countries. Section 7 compares the predictions with actual changes in these structures in developing countries. Section 8 concludes.",26

A Markov chain approach for US states,June 2011,Eckhardt Bode,Peter Nunnenkamp,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The United States (US) hosted about 1.6 trillion US$ of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) stocks in 2005, which is only 20%  less than the FDI stocks the US held abroad (UNCTAD 2006, p. 303). In terms of FDI inflows in 2003–2005, the US ranked at the top of all recipient countries (275 billion US$), followed by the United Kingdom and China. The US is also the most favored location for affiliates of the top 100 multinational companies (UNCTAD 2006, p. 34–35). Hence, it is fairly surprising that the economic impact of inward FDI in the US has received only scant attention in the literature, whereas the economic impact of inward FDI in less advanced economies such as China or India as well as its possible repercussions on advanced home countries has been investigated in a large number of studies. Empirical evidence is particularly scarce when it comes to the question whether inward FDI helps less advanced US regions to narrow the income gap to more advanced US regions (Torau and Goss 2004). This is again in striking contrast to less developed host countries such as China, where it has been shown that FDI inflows contributed to widening regional income disparities, rather than narrowing them (Mody and Wang 1997; Zhang and Zhang 2003; Xing and Zhang 2004). This neglect is rather surprising considering that, even if Washington, DC, is excluded, per capita income differed by a factor of almost two in 2005 between the most and least advanced US states (Connecticut and Louisiana, respectively). US states compete aggressively for FDI, especially for new manufacturing plants (Head et al. 1999; Torau and Goss 2004). Graham and Krugman (1995) observe that bidding between US states was fierce even at times when a flood of popular articles and books expressed concern that FDI would reduce employment, worsen the trade deficit and inhibit technological progress in the US.Footnote 1 Obviously, regional policymakers offering all sorts of incentives and outright subsidies to foreign investors work on a different assumption, namely that FDI inflows help improve income and employment prospects.Footnote 2
 The impact of FDI on regional growth in the US is theoretically ambiguous. Moreover, previous empirical studies on FDI-induced convergence (or divergence) across various host countries or within less advanced host countries offer only limited insights for the US. And the literature on location choice by foreign investors in the US provides at best indirect evidence on the growth effects of FDI at the state level. Hence, it is still open to debate whether competition for FDI among US states is just a “mad scramble for the crumbs” (Glickman and Woodward 1989). This paper contributes to this debate by assessing empirically the effects of inward FDI on per capita income growth of US states since the mid-1970s. Using a Markov chain approach, the paper focuses on whether inward FDI helps poorer states catch up with richer states. It turns out that the effects of FDI on income growth depend not only on quantitative measures of the density of FDI, but also on qualitative characteristics of FDI. In particular, employment-intensive FDI is conducive to long-run income growth, while capital-intensive FDI is not. The probability of staying or becoming rich in the long run is significantly higher for US states that have received larger amounts of employment-intensive FDI. Since growth enhancing employment-intensive FDI is concentrated in richer states, FDI has tended to be associated with weaker rather than stonger income convergence among US states since the mid-1970s. These major findings are robust against variations of the empirical setup, and there is little evidence for reverse causality. The next section discusses the analytical background and the previous literature.

147,3,Review of World Economics,13 March 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-011-0093-y,Preferential trade agreements and the structure of international trade,September 2011,Neil Foster,Robert Stehrer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the last two decades there has been a proliferation in the number of preferential trade agreements (PTAs).Footnote 1 According to Urata and Okabe (2009) the number of PTAs reported to the WTO was 25 in 1990, 91 in 2000 and 194 in 2007. For a long time most PTAs were regional in focus with members being geographically close to each other, as for example the European Union (EU) and the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). More recently however countries or regional blocs have signed PTAs with geographically distant partners and partners at differing levels of economic development.Footnote 2 Moreover, regional groupings have also become more diverse in terms of the development levels of their members, as for example the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). As discussed in the literature (see for example Viner 1950) there is a trade-off involved when discussing the benefits of PTA membership. On the one hand, there is a trade creation effect that comes from the elimination in distortions between the relative prices of domestic goods and those of other members. On the other hand, there exists the potential for a trade distortion effect due to the introduction of distortions between the relative prices of member and non-member goods. By now a large number of empirical papers have addressed the issue of whether membership in a PTA creates trade between members (see Sect. 2 below). A related issue that has been addressed is whether trade diversion is also an outcome of the presence of a PTA; that is, is trade between a member and a non-member reduced as a result of the presence of the PTA? These issues have usually been addressed using the gravity equation, with the results being mixed depending upon the sample, the time period, the specification of the gravity equation and the particular PTAs considered. To date the vast majority of papers considering PTAs have concentrated on the issue of whether trade creation and/or trade diversion effects of PTAs are present, usually using data on total bilateral trade or total exports as the variable of interest and dummies for the presence (or absence) of a PTA between two countries. There are very few papers that consider how PTAs affect trade however, recent exceptions being Urata and Okabe (2009) who examine the impact of PTAs on industry-level trade and Egger et al. (2008) who consider the effect on the structure of trade. In this paper, rather than examine whether PTA membership affects the level of trade between members (as well as between members and non-members) we examine whether membership in PTAs is associated with a change in the structure of trade between members. As discussed by Egger et al. (2008) this issue has been largely ignored to date in the empirical literature. Yet the issue of whether joining a PTA stimulates gains due to specialisation, i.e. inter-industry trade, or to gains from scale economies and product differentiation, i.e. intra-industry trade, would seem to be an important one when considering the benefits of PTAs and the question of which countries should form a PTA. In particular, if most of the growth in trade due to the presence of a PTA is attributable to intra-industry trade, then we may expect that the resource reallocation effects in the short to medium run would be lower than if inter-industry trade was most affected, since the change would require little inter-industry factor movements. In this paper, we examine whether membership in PTAs has a significant impact upon the popular Grubel–Lloyd index of intra-industry trade (IIT) in a gravity framework. To examine this issue we use data from Feenstra et al. (2005) on up to 168 countries over the period 1962–2000.Footnote 3 Our paper differs from that of Egger et al. (2008) in a number of ways. Firstly, while Egger et al. (2008) focus on a sample of largely developed countries and a limited number of PTA episodes the current paper employs data on a large sample of both developed and developing countries and a longer period of time, thus capturing a larger number of PTAs. It is usually thought that while IIT is particularly important for trade between developed countries, it is less relevant for North–South and South–South trade. By including both developed and developing countries in the sample we are able to examine whether the results found for developed countries by Egger et al. (2008) also hold in a broader sample. Secondly, while Egger et al. (2008) make use of matching techniques we employ the familiar gravity equation, taking account of the comments of Baldwin and Taglioni (2006) when specifying the gravity equation to deal with possible endogeneity. We employ the gravity model since the vast majority of the existing literature uses the gravity model, thus making our results comparable. Thirdly, the approach adopted by Egger et al. (2008) only allows one to consider the contemporaneous effects of PTAs on IIT. Given that it may take some time for the effects of PTA membership to filter through to trade structure it may be more appropriate to use the gravity model that can account for the longer-term effects of PTAs on trade structure. Fourthly, an important difference between our paper and the Egger et al. (2008) paper is that we search for a non-linear relationship between PTA presence and IIT, testing for non-linearities based on trade partner’s relative levels of development. Such non-linearities are suggested by the theoretical literature (see for example, Bergstrand 1990) and allow us to examine whether there are differences in the impact of PTA membership on IIT for partners at different levels of development. Our results indicate that membership in a PTA is associated with an increase in the extent of IIT. In addition, we find that the effect of PTA membership on IIT is larger when a PTA is formed between two developed countries. The remainder of the paper is set out as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing evidence on the impact of PTAs, while Sect. 3 discusses our main hypotheses, our empirical approach and the data used. Section 4 discusses our main results and Sect. 5 reports some robustness results. Section 6 concludes.",16
147,3,Review of World Economics,01 February 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-011-0090-1,Not all trade restrictions are created equally,September 2011,Matthew T. Cole,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There has been great focus in the recent trade theory literature on the introduction of firm heterogeneity into trade models beginning with Jean (2002) and Melitz (2003). These models, among many others, have provided a significant advancement in the literature on intra-industry trade since its conception with Krugman (1979, 1980). This comes, in part, from highlighting the entry and exit mechanism of firms. In fact, Chaney (2008) illustrates how properly accounting for the extensive margin, in a model with firm heterogeneity, actually reverses the Krugman (1980) prediction that the elasticity of substitution magnifies the sensitivity of trade flows to trade barriers. Additionally, the entry and exit of firms has direct ramifications for the number of varieties in equilibrium. Since consumers in these models show a love of variety, this has important welfare implications; if more low productivity domestic firms exit in response to lower trade barriers than foreign exporting firms enter, the domestic country actually loses varieties from freer trade. This is indeed interesting since all the gains from trade in the “New Trade Theory” stemmed purely from gains in variety.
Footnote 1
 The more recent trade theory models still find gains from trade. However, the effect on product variety has less consensus. In Melitz (2003), the effect on the total mass of varieties in a particular country is left ambiguous. Baldwin and Forslid (2010) address this issue and find that decreased trade restrictions, in fact, have a counterintuitive anti-variety effect for the importing country. However, Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) find that decreased trade restrictions have a pro-variety effect. In all three models (as in most models dealing with such issues), trade restrictions are modeled as the standard iceberg transportation cost.
Footnote 2 Although iceberg trade costs are equivalent to ad valorem tariffs in some settings, they are not equivalent in the case of monopolistic competition. Therefore one cannot take the lessons learned from the existing literature and blindly apply them to changes in tariffs.
Footnote 3 A key contribution of this paper is to show iceberg transport costs affect firm profits and consequently the entry/exit decision differently than ad valorem tariffs in a monopolistic competition setting. At first glance, this may seem to be a minor point. But, in models of monopolistic competition, the entry/exit decision affects total product variety and the aggregate price index; both of which determine welfare. In some sense, this is not unlike the literature contrasting the effects of ad valorem with per-unit transport costs.
Footnote 4 However, the difference between iceberg transport costs and tariffs are more subtle because the two trade barriers are both ad valorem and the prices consumers pay are identical under each restriction. It is this subtlety that makes it so important to bring these differences to light. To accomplish this, I provide a highly tractable model of heterogeneous firms that allows for asymmetric changes in three types of trade barriers; iceberg transport costs, ad valorem tariffs, and the additional fixed cost to become an exporter. Chaney (2008) uses a model with asymmetric iceberg transport costs and country sizes to investigate the effects of the elasticity of substitution on both the intensive and extensive margins of trade. He finds that the elasticity of substitution always dampens the impact of variable trade costs on trade flows. In particular, the decreased sensitivity of the extensive margin outweighs the increased sensitivity of the intensive margin. However, variable trade costs are modeled only as iceberg transport costs and not ad valorem tariffs. Thus, in this regard, my paper complements Chaney (2008) as it illustrates how the entry/exit decision of a firm is different depending on whether one models trade barriers as iceberg transport costs or ad valorem tariffs. In a general equilibrium model, this difference will affect the extensive margin directly and the intensive margin indirectly.
Footnote 5
 In order to provide the most tractable baseline model, I make various key assumptions that greatly ease the analysis of a situation with heterogeneous firms and endogenous entry. First, I assume firms are heterogeneous across fixed cost. Though the majority of the recent models assume firms are heterogeneous across marginal cost, there is a growing literature that assumes firms differ across fixed cost, e.g. Schmitt and Yu (2001), Jørgensen and Schröder (2006, 2008), and Davies and Eckel (2010).
Footnote 6 Jørgensen and Schröder (2008) provide a very nice motivation for the use of fixed cost heterogeneity. For instance, they point out that fixed cost heterogeneity is more appropriate with so-called “original brand name manufacturers” that differ in the power of their brand name—a result of marketing and other fixed cost activities. Arkolakis (2008) also incorporates marketing into a model with heterogeneous firms. Though firms can differ in expenditures on marketing, the main source of heterogeneity is from marginal cost in this model. This coincides well with recent empirical results that suggest there is heterogeneity in fixed as well as marginal cost. For instance, Cole et al. (2010) find that sunk costs (which are identical to fixed costs in my static model) and firm characteristics are important factors in explaining Thai manufacturing firm’s decision to export.
Footnote 7 I have chosen to use fixed cost heterogeneity for three reasons: using marginal cost heterogeneity will not change the qualitative results; marginal cost heterogeneity will complicate the comparative statics significantly; and there is evidence that firms do differ across fixed costs.
Footnote 8
 Second, I assume the representative consumer has Dixit–Stiglitz preferences embedded in a quasi-linear utility function. The cost of this assumption is that the income elasticity of demand for the heterogeneous good is zero. Despite the cost, this assumption is not entirely uncommon in the literature. Chor (2009) uses a similar technique to investigate the merits of subsidizing foreign direct investment (FDI) in a model with heterogeneous firms.
Footnote 9 Moreover, some models use more general utility functions, but then make other simplifying assumptions that mitigate income effects. Demidova and Rodríguez-Clare (2009) utilize a small country assumption to eliminate any income feedback effects. Similarly, Chaney (2008) makes a small/remote country assumption to ensure changes in transport and fixed costs have no significant impact on the general equilibrium.
Footnote 10 In this paper, quasi-linear preferences prove useful beyond the simplifications they provide. My goal is to compare the differences between iceberg transport costs and ad valorem tariffs. Tariffs generate income and transport costs are often assumed to be lost. Thus, tariffs would create an income effect whereas iceberg transport costs would not, clouding the difference I focus on. Alternatively, I could model a transport sector that generates income, but I would need to take up a stance on which country the transport sector resides in as the income would affect demand.
Footnote 11
 Finally, in addition to the typical barriers to trade (tariffs and transport costs), I consider the effect of “foreign beachhead costs”, that is, those fixed costs necessary to switch to engage in exporting.
Footnote 12 This is often a minor consideration, but with the rapid technological growth and service industries being created to facilitate business operations, these beachhead costs are becoming increasingly important. Friedman (2007:173) explains, “...UPS also has a financing arm—UPS Capital—that will put up the money for the transformation of your supply chain, particularly if you are a small business and don’t have the capital...UPS is creating enabling platforms for anyone to take his or her business global or vastly improve the efficiency of his or her global supply chain”. This has direct implications for these particular beachhead costs and needs to be considered in conjunction with investigating changes in other trade restrictions, as they may have conflicting results. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 sets up the model and characterizes the equilibrium. Section 3 analyzes the results including a discussion of the results under alternative modeling assumptions including marginal cost heterogeneity. Section 4 concludes.",7

By the mid-1990s the region had significantly fewer trade agreement initiatives than Europe or the Americas. Nevertheless, since 2000, many initiatives were proposed, negotiated, and even implemented.Footnote 1 FTAs with East Asian participation are concentrated within the region but have also seen extensions to extra-regional trading partners throughout the world. This introduces interesting perspectives for the analysis of trade agreements. Using trade data for 14 East Asian countries,Footnote 2 this paper focuses on the impact that FTAs have on trade at the different stages that East Asian economies participate in.Footnote 3 The central part of this study is an econometric analysis using panel data with the gravity model of international trade flows. To complement the discussion about anticipatory trade effects in the dimension of pre-implementation status, we control for year-to-year changes in the stages of the respective FTAs. We use suitable econometric methods to account for the potential endogeneity problem, which occurs due to the inclusion of the FTA variable and the dubious causal relationship with the volume of trade. Additionally, we distinguish between bilateral and multilateral FTAs as these forms of trade agreements may have different trade effects, due to the expectation that either bilateral or multilateral FTAs are more likely to trigger increasing bilateral trade. If this is the case, our variables in the econometric specification will reflect this difference. As we are particularly interested in the anticipatory effects of the agreements, the included variables distinguish between all (pre-) implementation stages of bilateral and multilateral FTAs. Our results reveal at least three interesting findings: firstly, there are anticipatory effects preceding the actual implementation of bilateral FTAs with East Asian participation. In particular, the stage during which bilateral agreements are (close to) being negotiated exposes significant positive trade effects. Secondly, we found no significant anticipatory trade impact for multilateral trade agreements. Thirdly, the fact that we obtain somewhat contradictory results using different regression techniques—including pooled ordinary least squares, generalised least squares (GLS) with random effects, Tobit regression with random effects as well as the fixed effects estimations of GLS, Poisson and negative-binomial—using identical data, highlights the need for a careful selection of the most appropriate econometric methodology. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 provides an overview of trade integration and trade agreements in East Asia. Section 3 then reviews the empirical literature on trade-creating effects of FTAs, with a focus on previous studies that examine anticipatory effects. In Sect. 4 we introduce our econometric methodology and our data, which is followed by a presentation of our results in Sect. 5 and conclusions in Sect. 6.",19
147,3,Review of World Economics,20 March 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-011-0094-x,The effects at home of initiating production abroad: evidence from matched French firms,September 2011,Alexander Hijzen,Sébastien Jean,Thierry Mayer,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Concerns are repeatedly expressed about the potential negative employment impact of the relocation of production abroad, often referred to as offshoring (see for instance Mankiw and Swagel 2006, for a discussion). Even though this issue has been subject to intense scrutiny for several years, it remains debated, with still widely varying conclusions found in the literature. Following Feenstra and Hanson (1999), several works have studied how foreign outsourcing, evaluated through direct or indirect measurements of imported intermediate inputs, affect labour demand (see e.g. Hijzen et al. 2005; Ekholm and Hakkala 2005, or Munch and Skaksen 2009). The results are mixed but point in several cases to a significant impact of outsourcing upon labour demand. Another approach relies on the estimation of multilocation cost functions by multinational enterprises (MNEs). Many of these studies conclude that the impact of foreign affiliates upon domestic employment is very limited, as for instance Slaughter (2000). However, following this approach, Mündler and Becker (2010) emphasize the need to take into account not only the intensive margin, as measured through employment changes in MNEs’ different locations, but also the extensive margin, i.e. new location decisions. Their results suggest that MNEs operations abroad may have a non-trivial impact upon their employment at home. Fears are heightened further by the recent feeling that service activities, often considered to be relatively skilled, are no longer invulnerable to the offshoring phenomenon (Blinder 2006). In this area, the evidence is scanter. While acknowledging the steady growth of service offshoring, Amiti and Wei (2005) show that it is not negatively related to sector-level employment growth in the United Kingdom; in the United States, a negative relationship can be found at a very detailed level, but it disappears when sectors are defined more broadly (Amiti and Wei 2008). While the influence of offshoring on labour productivity is noteworthy (Amiti and Wei 2009), these pieces of evidence suggest that the employment impact of services offshoring should remain limited—as also suggested by the fact that developed countries tend, more often than not, to run surpluses in trade in services. While these results are useful to clarify the orders of magnitude at stake, questions remain about the nature of the relationship between offshoring and labour demand. Focusing on the structure of labour demand, Crinò (2010) shows that offshoring increases employment in more skilled occupations, with potentially significant impact across labour categories. While anxiety surrounding services offshoring sometimes appear to have been exaggerated, the conclusions to be drawn from the existing literature remain contentious. To shed further light on the economic consequences of offshoring, we focus here on a more specific question by asking how the decision to invest abroad influences firms’ key outcomes at home, both in manufacturing and service sectors. We take advantage of this focus to cope with the well-known difficulty to separate out cause and effect in the specificities of foreign investors: the choice between investing or not investing for a firm in a certain industry largely results from a process of self-selection, as shown for instance by Helpman et al. (2004). Consequently, comparing firms that invest abroad to the average firm that does not do so would be misleading. Ideally, one would like to compare the outcome of firms that decided to become multinationals with the counterfactual outcome had those firms not decided to become multinationals, but this counterfactual outcome is unobservable. We address this concern by adopting matching techniques in combination with a difference-in-difference (DID) estimator. This allows one to evaluate the causal effect of establishing a foreign affiliate on a set of domestic firm-specific outcomes. The causal effect of firm’s global engagement strategies has received ample attention in the literature on exporting,Footnote 1 but so far has received limited attention in the context of multinationals. Egger and Pfaffermayr (2003) use several different endogenous treatment approaches to analyse the impact of investing abroad on the domestic investment behaviour of Austrian manufacturing firms. Barba Navaretti and Castellani (2003) use propensity score matching to estimate the causal effect of investing abroad on the performance of Italian firms, as do Hijzen et al. (2007) for Japan and Kleinert and Toubal (2007) for Germany. In studies concomitant to the present one, Barba Navaretti et al. (2010) for France and Italy, and Debaere et al. (2010) for Korea analyse the causal effects of becoming a multinational whilst distinguishing between high- and low-income investment locations.Footnote 2 Becker and Mündler (2008), based on linked employer-employee data, use propensity score matching techniques to show that foreign expansion induces German MNEs to retain more domestic jobs than their domestic competitors. Noteworthily, these studies are all restricted to the manufacturing sector. In the present paper, we approach the issue of relocation by focusing on the causal effects of decisions by firms to globalise their production, i.e. to become multinational, on the parent firm at home. For this purpose, we use rich firm-level data for France that cover the period 1987–1999. France is an interesting case given the intensity of globalisation debate: concerns over “délocalisations” (the French term referring to relocation abroad of production units) were according to the Eurobarometer the main reason for the no-vote in the referendum on the EU Constitution in 2005. The contribution of this paper to the literature is twofold. First, we do not restrict our analysis to manufacturing, but separately analyse the effects of becoming a multinational for manufacturing and services firms. The relocation of services activities has become more important in recent years and it is sometimes feared that the employment consequences in the home country might be even more widespread than in the case of manufacturing. Second, we analyse the causal effect of becoming multinational whilst differentiating between horizontal, vertical or complex investment strategies on the basis of the location of investment (high or low income) and the industry affiliation (with comparative advantage or comparative disadvantage) of the investing firm. Our main conclusion is that differentiating between investment strategies is crucial if one wants to grasp the effects of outward investment in the home country. In manufacturing, market-seeking investments have positive employment effects, whilst vertical investments mainly transform the investing firm’s production function. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the services sector is also associated with significant positive employment effects, which may reflect the possibility that FDI in this sector is predominantly motivated by market access considerations. These results contradict popular fears about the potential negative employment impact of FDI abroad. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 lays out the set-up. Section 3 discusses the matching methodology. Section 4 describes the data used for this study. Section 5 analyses the determinants of becoming a multinational in order to construct an appropriate counterfactual needed to evaluate the effects of investing abroad. Section 6 presents the results. Section 7 concludes.",69
147,3,Review of World Economics,16 April 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-011-0096-8,Comparative advantage FDI? A host country perspective,September 2011,Andreas Waldkirch,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In recent years, foreign direct investment (FDI) growth has far outpaced growth in either world production or trade. While merchandise trade grew about 85%, and world production grew 27%, world FDI flows increased by 535% during the 1990s. Remarkably, developing countries benefited disproportionately, raising their share of the world inward stock of FDI from 20.6% in 1990 to over 30% in 1999. While FDI growth slowed down somewhat during the 2000s, it has remained high until very recently, for example rising over 20% into developing countries in 2007 (UNCTAD, various years). Many developing countries are now actively seeking to attract more foreign investment, especially in the form of direct investment, which tends to be far more stable than portfolio investment. Often, this represents a reversal of policies that severely regulated and discouraged FDI. Presumably, the motive for seeking more FDI is its function as a catalyst of development. Positive welfare effects stem from increased employment, forward and backward linkages, and technological spillovers. The probability of such welfare improvements, and technological spillovers in particular, however, crucially depends on the motive for producing abroad and hence the type of multinational. In the presence of transportation costs, a market access motive gives rise to horizontal multinationals, which roughly duplicate production in multiple locations. If the motive is to exploit comparative advantage from differences in factor endowments, absent international factor prize equalization, the production process becomes vertically fragmented. While there is no consensus in the literature, recent evidence suggests that vertical spillovers are more likely than horizontal ones.
Footnote 1
 While the early literature has treated horizontal (Markusen 1984) and vertical (Helpman 1984) multinationals separately, recent work has provided a unified general equilibrium framework called the “knowledge-capital” model, in which all types of multinationals arise endogenously (Markusen 2002; see Markusen and Maskus 2001 for a survey). When the theory is taken to the data, the vertical model is strongly rejected in favor of the horizontal one (Carr et al. 2001; Markusen and Maskus 2002; Blonigen et al. 2003). Using different terminology, Brainard (1997) similarly finds support for the proximity-concentration, but not the factor-proportions hypothesis. Only a few studies, e.g. Braconier et al. (2005) and Yeaple (2003), find some support for the vertical model and thus a role for comparative advantage. The rejection of the vertical model is puzzling not only because of the increased share of developing countries as recipients of FDI, but in light of recent findings that explain much of the growth in world trade with increasing vertical specialization (Hummels et al. 2001; Yi 2003), which suggests that trade and FDI are complements. A possible source of bias in the above cited studies is that they all use data on FDI originating in or targeted at developed countries, usually the United States. Most partner countries are other developed countries, in which case horizontal multinationals would indeed be expected to dominate despite the presence of some developing partners. Using a detailed industry-level data set, this paper in contrast examines the determinants of FDI in a developing country, Mexico. By focusing on a comparatively skilled-labor and capital scarce host country, one would expect considerably more support for a comparative advantage motive. While this would cast some doubt on the result that worldwide FDI is dominated by market access–seeking multinationals, one should regard the results of this paper as complementary to the empirical work cited above, not as evidence against the finding that horizontal multinationals are important. In addition to providing a different perspective from which to approach the question of which motive for FDI finds more support in the data, this paper contributes to our understanding of the determinants and desirability of FDI in developing countries more generally. Mexico presents an interesting case not only due to its proximity to the United States, but also because it is arguably at an intermediate stage of development.
Footnote 2 Hence, its comparative advantage may no longer solely arise from an abundance of unskilled labor, but the availability of relatively more skilled labor than other developing countries as well as positive externalities from decades of foreign investment.
Footnote 3
 Finally, the availability of host country industry-level information not only on FDI, but factor intensities and other characteristics allows identification not only of country-aggregate, but also industry-specific determinants of FDI and any interactions between them, unlike many of the previous studies (e.g. Carr et al. 2001; Markusen and Maskus 2002; Blonigen et al. 2003). The results of the empirical analysis lend support to the hypothesis that Mexico’s comparative advantage in (unskilled-)labor intensive production processes is an important, though not the only, determinant of its inward FDI. Skill and capital intensity of production, differences in skill endowments relative to source countries as well as market size and similarity are statistically and economically significant determinants of FDI. When skill differences are very large, FDI flows into sectors that are intensive in total labor, regardless of skill level. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes the main features of the FDI data and provides some additional information on FDI in Mexico. Section 3 lays out the conceptual framework guiding the empirical estimation, which is described in more detail in Sect. 4, followed by a discussion of the results. Section 6 offers concluding remarks.",11
147,3,Review of World Economics,26 April 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-011-0097-7,Does comparative advantage explain countries’ diversification level?,September 2011,Asier Minondo,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Export diversification has recently become a hot topic in the economic research agenda (Carrère et al. 2009; Newfarmer et al. 2009). There are old and new reasons that may explain this interest in export diversification. On the one hand, diversification is considered a key policy objective for countries specialised in natural resources (Sachs and Warner 2001). On the other hand, countries seeking to accelerate economic growth through exports should determine whether diversification, rather than the intensive margin, is the best route to achieve this goal (Besedeš and Prusa 2007). In addition to that, some models suggest that countries can increase their growth rate if they diversify into products where learning by doing is larger (Matsuyama 1992) or into rich-country products (Hausmann et al. 2007). In any case, other models warn that diversification may be hampered due to the costs involved in discovering the new export products (Hausmann and Rodrik 2003). If exports diversification has a positive effect on economic growth, a relevant question is what determines its level. Some scholars show that diversification can be an outcome of the development process. Imbs and Wacziarg (2003), Koren and Tenreyro (2007), Cadot et al. (2007) and Klinger and Lederman (2009) find that countries grow through two stages of diversification. At low levels of income growth is accompanied by an increase in the level of diversification; however, once countries reach a certain level of income further growth is accompanied by re-concentration. In contrast, Parteka and Tamberi (2008) and De Benedictis et al. (2009) conclude that growth is always accompanied by an increase in the level of diversification.Footnote 1
 The contribution of this paper is to present and test an alternative explanation of the differences in export diversification across countries. We argue that countries’ diversification levels may be determined by the products in which they have comparative advantage. The link between comparative advantage and diversification is established through the concept of product proximity developed by Hidalgo et al. (2007). These authors show that some products, such as electronics, tend to be exported along with a large range of different products; in contrast, other commodities, such as oil, tend to be exported alone. According to these authors, those differences are related to the skills and other assets, such as technology, capital or institutions, needed to produce each product. For example, the manufacturing of electronic products demand skills and assets that can easily be deployed in a large range of additional manufactures (e.g. to master the logistics of the components that are assembled in a factory); however, the extraction of oil demands skills and assets that are more difficult to redeploy in other products (e.g. to master the operation of a drilling rig). Due to these differences, countries that happen to develop comparative advantage in products that are close to other products can diversify more easily than countries that happen to develop comparative advantage in products that are in the periphery of the product space. To test the validity of this explanation, we build an index of countries’ diversification possibilities based on the products in which they have comparative advantage and the proximity of those products to the rest of commodities. Using non-parametric and parametric techniques, we show that this index is a very strong and robust predictor of countries’ actual diversification levels, even when we control for differences in GDP per capita across countries. These results point out that countries’ diversification levels might not be an automatic outcome of countries’ development process. The conclusions of our paper are in line with a recent study by Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009), who using network techniques show that countries that have comparative advantage in products in which few countries also have comparative advantage are endowed with a larger set of capabilities; this larger set of capabilities, in turn, allows countries to export a larger set of products. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 explains in detail the relationship between countries’ comparative advantage and their exports diversification level. Section 3 presents the empirical analyses and Sect. 4 concludes.",29
147,3,Review of World Economics,16 February 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-011-0089-7,The investment development path in space,September 2011,Alexandros Ragoussis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The inward and outward foreign direct investment (FDI) positions of a country are known to be associated with the country’s level of economic development. More specifically, as economic development proceeds, inward FDI stocks initially rise. Over time, learning-by-doing allows outward FDI to emerge. In the long run, inward and outward stocks tend to balance. The ‘investment development path’ (IDP) is a popular theory developed to describe this dynamic phenomenon (Dunning 1980, 1981, 1986; Dunning and Narula 1996). In the stylized form of the path, countries progress through different stages first in response to the changing conditions that alter the country’s attractiveness to foreign investors, and second in response to a gradual upgrading of domestic firm-specific advantages. The empirical work on the IDP that has so far appeared in the literature is mainly descriptive and includes non-parametric tests of hypotheses on the determinants of the process. Formal empirical testing of the IDP hypothesis has been developed in Durán and Úbeda (2005) although the explanatory variables proposed in that model deviate from the standard framework used to explain FDI activity in international economics. Several other researchers in international business have applied the concept to analyses of specific cases of countries (see Dunning and Narula 1996, or more recently Gorynia et al. 2009). In all these empirical models, the hypothesis of spatial relationships as a determinant of a country’s evolution through the IDP is absent. In this paper we aim to extend the empirical work on the IDP to incorporate ‘space’. Although the literature on FDI determinants is very large, the analysis of investment flows in a spatial context is still in its infancy (see Blonigen et al. 2007, 2008; Ekholm et al. 2007). We seek to move one step further in that direction by associating a country’s geographical location with its role as a host and parent country of FDI. In order to do so, we add spatial lags as explanatory variables into a benchmark empirical model aiming to explain transitions in the IDP. The main contribution of our paper lies in the empirical estimation of the importance of spatial determinants for what could be called the ‘extensive-margin of FDI’; that is, the emergence of inward and outward FDI. Our main conclusion is that proximity to countries at higher stages up the IDP which are better integrated into the world FDI network, has a positive effect on transitions from any stage of the IDP to the next. More specically, we show that proximity to markets generating FDI increases the probability of a country becoming a host, while proximity to these countries and to countries receiving inward FDI increases the probability of receiving FDI.The results are consistent with a number of static spatial hypotheses in the literature. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the IDP hypothesis stage by stage, using findings from the international economics literature, and augments the scenario with spatial considerations. The analysis points at a number of spatial hypotheses to be empirically tested. Section 3 elaborates the data and the empirical model we use to test the hypotheses. The paper concludes with the results and a brief discussion of the findings.",4
147,3,Review of World Economics,24 February 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-011-0091-0,Sectoral border effects and the geographic concentration of production,September 2011,Gianluca Cafiso,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The degree of integration among trade partners is of interest to trade economists because research in international trade looks for the causes of limited trade integration (Head and Mayer 2000; Nitsch 2000). One frequently used measure of trade integration is the border effect (BE), which is estimated using a gravity equation (McCallum 1995). The BE accounts for the difference between national
trade and trade
with
foreign
partners, whereas in the case of full integration, there is no difference between the two. At an early stage, research focused on how to correctly estimate the BE (Anderson and van Wincoop 2003); later studies concentrated more on its explanation. Among the papers that attempt to explain the BE, we believe that Chen (2004) provides the most comprehensive analysis. The theoretical model in Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) shows that the BE is caused by the combined effect of the elasticity of substitution (between varieties produced in different countries) and the tariff equivalent of border costs.Footnote 1 The elasticity of substitution component of the BE is usually overlooked because it concerns individuals’ preferences, whereas interest focuses on impediments to trade. As for the border costs component, Chen (2004) points out that some specific border-related factors, such as exchange rate volatility and tariff and non-tariff barriers, are not explicative of the BE. Next, she turns to trade
cost variables and behavioural
response
to
trade
cost variables. Among the behavioural response to trade cost variables, Chen includes an index of geographic concentration of production activities. She concludes that concentration explains the BE. Our interest focuses on the relationship between concentration and the BE. A concentration index mirrors behavioural responses to trade costs because it reflects the outcomes of firms’ location decisions given the presence of trade costs. Indeed, new economic geography (NEG) models suggest that firms settle in ways that minimise trade costs (Ottaviano and Thisse 2004). Firms’ location decisions inevitably influence trade exchanges among countries; the ratio of internal to external trade changes in any country affected by firms’ decisions. From this perspective, a concentration index may explain the BE, and concentration changes should influence the BE. This is a relevant improvement in our understanding of the BE. The contribution of this paper lies in its clarification of the relationship between the BE and the concentration of production. We provide an explanation for this relationship, verify whether it emerges in an enhanced analysis that corrects some relevant points in Chen’s analysis and test whether our explanation of the relationship is supported by the data.Footnote 2 Moreover, the analysis of geographic concentration provides us with valuable insights into the structure of the European industry and its evolution. The paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 explains why the relationship between the BE and concentration emerges; Sect. 3 estimates the BE by industrial sector and discusses the relevant econometrics; Sect. 4 studies the concentration of production in the EU to compute an index for use in the analysis; Sect. 5 verifies whether the relationship emerges in our enhanced analytical framework; Sect. 6 applies our explanation of the relationship to the data; and Sect. 7 draws conclusions. The “Appendix” describes the data used.",5

Bergman,Per Johansson,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In 1988, a Swedish manufacturer of mining equipment, Atlas Copco, bought its US rival Wagner, located in Portland, Oregon. In April, 2003, Atlas Copco hired two Boeing 747s to shuttle the plant to a new location in Sweden, for a total cost of 17.5 million USD.
Footnote 1 Was this a commercially motivated decision—or did it reflect a tendency of managers to favour production in the country where their firm’s headquarter is located? We do not intend to answer this question specifically, but we will address the more general issue and test if multinational firms’ favour real investments within the home country over investments in other countries. For this purpose, we use a newly constructed international single-industry (the pulp and paper industry) data set. Although many previous studies touches on the relation between foreign and domestic investment activities, we have been unable to identify research that directly addresses “home bias” in multinational firms’ real investment decision.
Footnote 2
 Previous research has established home bias in trade (McCallum 1995; Nitsch 2000) and financial investments (French and Peterba 1991). The foreign direct investment (FDI) literature has focused on two related but distinct issues. First, do foreign-owned plants differ from domestically owned plants in characteristics such as labour productivity, plant closure rate, wages and so on?
Footnote 3 Second, will increased production in a firm’s foreign plants tend to increase or reduce its domestic activities?
Footnote 4
 Given the increasing importance of multinational firms and international acquisitions, the existence of a home-bias effect in real investments could potentially have important consequences. Between 1982 and 2007, the worldwide flow of inward FDI (in current US dollars) grew at an annual rate of 26%—more than twice the growth rate of nominal world GDP. Relative to GDP, the stock of inward FDI quadrupled, from 6.5% to approximately 28%.
Footnote 5 Although foreign greenfield investments are normally welcomed, there is often strong public concern over foreign acquisitions of domestic firms and existing assets. Examples of high-profile cross-border acquisitions that have generated debate are Novartis failed bid for its French rival Aventis, which was instead bought by Sanofi-Synthelabo, France; Chinese Lenovo’s acquisition of IBM’s PC division and Mittal Steel’s acquisition of Arcelor, a mainly French steel manufacturer.
Footnote 6 A number of proposed or completed cross-border mergers in energy, banking and steel has triggered a wave of protectionist feelings across Europe.
Footnote 7 The public concern appears to be founded on the belief that domestic employment and investments may be reduced in the wake of a foreign acquisition and that even the very existence of the domestic plants may be at risk. It is easy to find anecdotal evidence that supports these concerns, but solid econometric evidence appears to be missing at least when it comes to investment propensities. Hence, from a policy perspective, it is highly relevant to test the hypothesis that firm managers exhibit home bias when making real investment decisions. In order to focus the analysis on investment decisions where the investor has a strategic choice, we study “large” investments. We believe that the firms have more degrees of freedom in locating such investments, than they have for more routine maintenance-and-de-bottlenecking investments. Investments of the latter type can be expected to be largely proportional to the existing capital stock. In the present paper, large investments are defined as the installation of new paper machines and new pulp lines. Our data set contains the production capacities of 521 plants located in 15 European countries over a period of 18 years. It also includes data on the 131 firms, located in 18 countries, that own these plants. Finally, we have information on 180 large investments made during a period of 14 years at the plants in our sample. We do not only test a different hypothesis than previous studies we have been able to identify; our study differs also in several other respects. First, we use a multi-country single-industry panel data set, while previous studies have been based on single-country multi-industry data. This reduces the problem of data heterogeneity that is particularly relevant for cross-industry studies of differences between foreign-owned and domestically owned plants. Second, we include both firm and plant controls whereas, with one exception known to us, previous studies have had only plant controls.
Footnote 8 Third, since we study investments instead of exits, we can use a difference-in-difference approach. In that way, we are able to eliminate the effect of unobserved plant heterogeneity. The main finding is that, although there are some (weak) indications of a bias against foreign investments in the raw data, this bias disappears in a within-plant analysis. The structure of the paper is the following: the theoretical framework is described in Sect. 2. Section 3 provides some background information on the pulp and paper industry. Section 4 describes the data and in Sect. 5 a first analysis of the data is presented. The main results are presented in Sect. 6 and, finally, Sect. 7 concludes.",1
147,4,Review of World Economics,14 July 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-011-0104-z,"Exports, investment and firm-level sales volatility",November 2011,Alejandro Riaño,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Investment in physical capital and exporting are both extremely important activities for a firm. Because investment provides a strong indicator of a firm’s growth potential and exporting implies an ability to compete in global markets associated with high productivity, firms are often judged by their performance on these two dimensions. Although there is a substantial body of research focusing on each activity independently, there are almost no studies that consider the two in a unified model. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by developing a model of the joint exporting and investment decisions in an environment that seeks to approximate features of the capital markets faced by firms in developing countries. I use a calibrated version of the model to examine whether exporting increases the volatility of firm-level sales or not. This is an important issue in light of the increasing concern among the public and policy makers that individual producers’ greater exposure to globalization has rendered them more volatile and vulnerable to external shocks. A large number of empirical studies have found that across countries, industries and time periods, exporters constitute a minority among manufacturing firms.
Footnote 1 These studies have also shown that a firm’s exporting status is highly persistent over time, and that exporters tend to be larger and more productive than firms that sell only in the domestic market. These features are also present in the the data set of Colombian manufacturing firms used for the calibration, which is described in more detail in Sect. 3.
Footnote 2 Only 19% of the firms in the sample export, but the probability that they will continue exporting the following year is about 0.88. Moreover these firms are about four times larger and exhibit twice as much sales volatility as domestic firms. To reproduce these stylized facts, heterogenous-firm models of trade assume the existence of significant fixed and sunk costs associated with exporting.
Footnote 3
 Figure 1 presents a basic histogram of investment rates for machinery and equipment for Colombian manufacturing firms. Three important stylized facts emerge from inspecting Fig. 1 and Table 1: (i) Colombian manufacturing firms seldom divest capital by selling it in secondary markets. (ii) For a large number of (firm-year) observations investment rates are smaller than 1%, which means that investment inaction is quite common across firms. (iii) However, there is also a significant number of observations featuring intensive adjustment of capital stocks (investment spikes).
Footnote 4 Like the literature on the decision to export, research on investment seeks to identify what type of adjustment costs help to explain these investment patterns.
Footnote 5 However, the striking differences between exporters and domestic firms across these dimensions have not been documented before. As Table 1 shows, exporting firms engage in significant investment activity, since they are more likely to experience investment spikes and less likely to experience periods of inaction. Investment rate distribution—data. Source: Author’s own calculations based on the Colombian Annual Manufacturing Survey, 1981–1991. See data description in Sect. 3
 In this paper I set up and calibrate a partial equilibrium model that can match the stylized facts about exporting and investment described above. Furthermore, I use the quantitative model to understand how the decision to become an exporter affects firm-level sales volatility. The model features heterogeneous, risk-averse firms that operate in an environment characterized by firm-specific uncertainty (in terms of productivity and destination-specific demand shocks), irreversible investment and no capital markets. As in most heterogeneous-firm models of trade, exporting is costly. Domestic firms that decide to start exporting need to incur an up-front sunk cost as well as a fixed participation cost every period to maintain a presence abroad. The capital accumulation problem of firms is less standard, and aims to approximate conditions faced by firms in developing countries. The assumption that firms are risk-averse can be rationalized by thinking of firms owned by entrepreneurs who work in their own firms and whose main source of income is the firm’s dividends as in Bond et al. (2008).
Footnote 6 The second key assumption regarding the firm’s investment problem is that capital is perfectly irreversible as in Veracierto (2002). That is, once a firm has installed capital it can only divest it by letting it depreciate, since it cannot be freely disposed of or sold in a secondary market. Caballero (1993) notes that because of the relatively small size of the manufacturing sector and a highly volatile macroeconomic environment, secondary markets for capital goods are particularly thin in developing countries. Gelos and Isgut (2001) provide support for this view and show that investment irreversibility is a more important component of capital adjustment costs in developing countries like Mexico and Colombia than in developed economies such as the United States or Norway. Given that I am restricting the sources of funds available for firms to finance capital accumulation, it is natural to restrict the secondary market for capital goods as well. This characterization of capital markets shuts down mechanisms other than exporting that firms could potentially use to stabilize their sales. From a quantitative standpoint, the model performs quite well. Even though it is only calibrated to match export entry and exit rates and the average export-sales ratio, the model closely approximates the share of investment inaction episodes and spikes for both domestic and exporting firms. The model also reproduces the size and volatility premium of total sales for exporting firms. The implied costs to start exporting that result from the calibration are in line with previous estimates by Alessandria and Choi (2007), Das et al. (2007) and Ruhl and Willis (2008), although the fixed cost required to remain an exporter is substantially higher than what these authors report. The main shortcoming of the calibrated model is the fact that new exporters adjust the amount of output they choose to sell abroad immediately upon entry, contrary to the findings of Eaton et al. (2008) and Ruhl and Willis (2008), who show that new exporters tend to start out by selling small quantities, and only increase their exports if they are successful. After calibrating the model, two important results emerge. The first is that despite the assumption that firms are risk-averse, deriving higher utility from more stable profits, their export decision is not strongly affected by the correlation of idiosyncratic demand shocks when firm-specific productivity is highly persistent. In fact, given the highly-persistent productivity process used in the calibration, increasing the correlation between domestic and foreign demand shocks induces more firms to start exporting. The reason behind this pattern is that productivity’s persistence has a strong positive effect on the value of exporting for firms. Firms can safely expect that the positive productivity shocks that induce them to start exporting will take a long time to dissipate. Under these conditions, positively correlated demand shocks facilitate entry into the export market, trumping the positive effect that the high correlation of demand shocks might have on the volatility of profits. However, when the persistence of the productivity process decreases, demand shocks and their correlation structure become more important determinants of the decision to export. Thus, reductions in demand correlation have a positive impact on the number of exporting firms. The second finding pertains to the effect that exporting has on firm-level sales volatility. Using the calibrated model, I conduct two counterfactual experiments: in the first one, I shut down the foreign market so that all firms are restricted to selling in the domestic market alone. The second experiment looks at the opposite situation, where the fixed and sunk costs associated with exporting are set equal to zero, so all firms find it optimal to export.
Footnote 7 Comparing these two scenarios with the benchmark calibration shows that exporting increases firm-level sales volatility. The larger adjustment of total sales that firms undertake when entering the foreign market in response to the fixed and sunk costs results in higher firm-level sales volatility relative to the two counterfactual scenarios. This paper builds upon the quantitative models of a firm’s decision to export in the presence of sunk entry costs developed by Roberts and Tybout (1997), Alessandria and Choi (2007), Das et al. (2007) and Ruhl and Willis (2008), but goes beyond these studies by also considering the firm’s decision to invest in physical capital as in Veracierto (2002), Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006), Khan and Thomas (2008) and several other papers reviewed in Caballero (1999). This paper considers the joint nature of the exporting and investment decision in a unified environment, thus bringing together these two literatures. Although fixed and sunk costs to serve the foreign market are a staple of heterogeneous-firm models of international trade, almost all of these models, with the exception of Alessandria and Choi (2007) and Suwantaradon (2008), ignore the capital accumulation decision of firms.
Footnote 8
 A second contribution of this paper is to provide a better understanding of how trade openness affects firm-level volatility. Comin and Philippon (2006), probably the most cited paper in this area, does not take into consideration the effect of changes in trade openness on firm-level sales volatility. This research topic has also been overlooked in the international trade literature until very recently.
Footnote 9 To the best of my knowledge, there are only two recent papers that study how exporting affects firm-level volatility.
Footnote 10 Buch et al. (2009) use firm-level data from the German state of Baden-Württemberg and find that controlling for firm size and productivity, exporters have lower sales volatility than non-exporters. However, their empirical analysis does not identify the specific mechanisms that drive their result. Vannoorenberghe (2010) develops a partial equilibrium model of heterogeneous firms, where demand shocks determine a firm’s decision to become an exporter. Testing the model’s predictions using a panel of French firms, he finds that the effect of exporting on firm-level sales volatility depends crucially on the share of output that firms sell abroad, with large exporters having more volatile sales than domestic firms. While in Vannoorenberghe’s model all firm-level decisions are static, the model developed in this paper is fully dynamic, in the sense that a firm’s recursive problem is explicitly solved. This is an important distinction since it allows me to show that the adjustment of sales and capital in the transition towards exporting results in higher sales volatility for exporters. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 outlines the theoretical model, Sects. 3 and 4 describe the calibration strategy and the benchmark results respectively. Section 5 presents the counterfactual experiments, and Sect. 6 concludes.",13

Philip Davis,Dilruba Karim,Iana Liadze,Unknown,Female,Female,Female,"The recent financial crisis has led to a renewed interest in the predictors of financial instability, so-called early warning patterns. The literature has developed a number of distinctive multivariate approaches to the development of Early Warning Systems (EWS) for banking crises, including the logit (Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache 1998, 2005) and the binary recursive tree or BRT (Duttagupta and Cashin 2011).Footnote 1 What most existing work has in common is a focus on global panels of banking crises in order to derive relevant predictors. Given the prevalence of cross-country banking crises, the question “are all banking crises caused by common factors?” has become pertinent. Authors such as Laeven and Valencia (2010) examine the sub-prime crisis and show that these most recent crises affected developed economies with more sophisticated banking systems rather than developing economies. Consequently, these banking systems were large enough and interconnected enough to cause systemic distress and warrant public support (Davis 2008). Moreover, systemic risk was only directly imported to countries that had large cross-border exposures with banks in the epicentres. This exemplifies how crises have different causes and depend, amongst other things, on factors such as banking system development and pre-crisis conditions. Recent work by Barrell et al. (2009) has shown that for the logit model at least, the traditional right-hand side variables are not the most relevant for OECD countries once unadjusted bank capital adequacy, bank liquidity and house prices are added to the traditional variables. Equally, Davis and Karim (2008b) found that panel logit and BRT estimates including emerging market countries were unable to predict the sub-prime crisis in the OECD countries. Earlier work by Hardy and Pazarbaşıoğlu (1998) also using logit, found some differences in predictors for Asia relative to the rest of a global sample, focusing on a unique role of foreign liabilities of banks and exchange rate depreciation. This paper seeks to investigate further the appropriateness of aggregation, by assessing whether the crises in emerging market economies of Asia and Latin America have similar precursors. We utilise the logit and BRT.Footnote 2 The paper is structured as follows: In Sect. 2 we provide an overview of the literature on banking crisis prediction. Section 3 discusses our data sample. In Sect. 4 we reassess results for logit models using data for Asia and Latin America separately and together. Section 5 undertakes a similar exercise for the BRT approach, and finally Sect. 6 concludes.",28

Brada,Ali M. Kutan,Goran Vukšić,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Much of the success of the economic transition of the countries that made up the former Soviet Union depends on their ability to provide their citizens with steady improvements in incomes as well as social stability and new political freedoms. While systemic changes, including privatization, the creation of markets, the liberalization of trade and the establishment of market-supporting institutions are all important to achieving economic growth and high living standards in these economies, so is capital formation (Blanchard 1997; Buiter 2000). In many transition economies, the capital stock inherited from the era of central planning was worn out and technologically obsolete or unsuited to the needs of the new economic system. Moreover, investment in many economies in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) fell sharply over the first 15 years of the transition. Thus, a shortage of domestic funds for productive investments can be seen as having been an important barrier to economic progress in nearly all of the CIS countries.Footnote 1
 One of the reasons for the lack of domestic funding for investment is thought to be high levels of capital flight. However, estimates of capital flight from these countries are available only for some countries, usually for a few years, and they use a variety of methodologies. In this paper we present estimates of capital flight using a consistent methodology and time frame for seven CIS countries, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Russian Federation and Ukraine for the years 1995–2005.Footnote 2 In order to gain a better understanding of capital flight in these countries, we also model the causes of capital flight and, from our results, draw some policy conclusions. In particular, we extend the theory of capital flight to include explicitly the costs of moving capital offshore, and, based on the experience of the CIS countries, we show that these costs are an important factor in determining the volume of flight capital. The CIS countries are a particularly interesting sample from which to draw inferences about the drivers of capital flight because, unlike the African, Latin American and South East Asian countries that have been the focus of previous work on the causes of capital flight, some of the CIS countries exhibit much faster and more extensive progress in financial and market reforms. These reforms quickly altered the costs of moving capital abroad, as did their very rapid opening to the world economy. Moreover, some of these countries experienced large capital inflows related to natural resource development as well as funds for development assistance, inflows that the literature suggests should accelerate capital flight. As Buiter and Szegvari (2002) note, some of what is termed capital flight is a rational reallocation of capital from the home country to other countries in response to more favorable risk-return opportunities abroad and to investors’ desire for portfolio diversification. At the other end of the spectrum is money laundering, transactions that hide the illegal origin of the funds and convert them into legal income (Reuter and Truman 2004; Perez et al. 2011). Money laundering involves illegality in two ways. First, the money to be laundered is often earned though illegal activity such as prostitution, drug distribution, bribe taking, etc. Second, the money is then moved abroad, possibly in contravention of capital or currency controls, to hide its criminal origin and possibly to evade taxes. Falling somewhere in the middle in terms of legality are transactions that involve income that may be legally earned, but, because the home country has restrictions on capital outflows, investing such capital abroad effectively criminalizes the movement of money offshore. Particularly problematic from a welfare standpoint are situations where a country’s government borrows abroad while at the same time private individuals are investing abroad.Footnote 3 In such a situation, capital flight and borrowing offset each other, but domestic taxes must increase to service the debt, leading to a further increase in capital flight.Footnote 4
 Because it takes both legal and illegal forms, the measurement of capital flight is subject to considerable uncertainty even though central banks, treasuries and other government agencies as well as multilateral financial institutions have been increasingly concerned to improve their measures of capital flight and their understanding of what motivates it (Schneider 2003). While there is general agreement that it is the difference between the risks and returns available to investors at home and abroad that leads to capital flight, theoretical and empirical work on this topic has tended to emphasize either the differences in returns or the differences in risks as being more salient. Those stressing differences in returns take a portfolio-oriented approach and relate portfolio choices to home country macroeconomic variables. Hermes and Lensink (2001) and Harrigan et al. (2002), for example, emphasize the “importance of macroeconomic fundamentals in the capital flight process”. Cuddington (1987a), Collier et al. (2004), Le and Zak (2006) and Sheets (1995) all use models where home country residents are able to hold risky domestic and less risky or riskless foreign assets. Domestic risk includes financial risk, caused by macroeconomic shocks and policy fluctuations and inflation, and political risk, which reflects the stability of the ruling regime and the possibility of changes in economic policy by either the existing or a new government (Alesina and Tabelini 1989). Other researchers view capital flight as being more sensitive to what may be termed idiosyncratic country risk factors, meaning specific aspects of political, institutional and economic arrangements or policies in countries that create greater risks for investors. Dooley and Kletzer (1994) focus on the tax treatment of residents and non-residents. A similar argument is also put forward by Bhattacharya (1999), who adds that uncertainty about future trade liberalization creates an incentive for capital flight. In a paper that is particularly suggestive for capital flight from transition economies, Kant (2002) argues that the uncertainties and risks related to instability and lack of transparency in property rights, excessive taxation, corruption, lack of contract enforcement and the like are the key drivers of capital flight, and Khan and Ul Haque (1985) and Schineller (1993) emphasize that risk of expropriation serves as one of the main incentives for capital flight. Khan and Ul Haque (1985) were among the first to observe that private capital flight can occur simultaneously with public foreign borrowing, and they explain the phenomenon on the grounds of asymmetric risk of expropriation, which is higher for domestic investors than for foreign ones. This difference in emphasis on the drivers of capital flight has not been resolved by empirical research, as each approach enjoys some empirical support. Ndikumana and Boyce (2003) review a large number of empirical studies of capital flight, summing up which variables are significant explanatory factors of capital flight and Harrigan et al. (2002) also survey a number of empirical studies. Often, explanatory variables that are statistically significant in one study are found to be statistically insignificant or zero in another study. In some cases, coefficients are significantly positive in one study but significantly negative in another. In the case of transition economies, both portfolio and country-specific risk factors would seem to be important a priori. Portfolio considerations rest in part on the fact that, prior to the transition, there had been very little capital outflow from these countries due to currency inconvertibility and the state’s almost total control over foreign trade and foreign exchange transactions. As a result, at the start of the transition, domestic agents had virtually no foreign assets, and thus portfolio theory would suggest that normal considerations of portfolio diversification should have led to significant capital flight even in the face of restrictions on outward investment.Footnote 5 Moreover, domestic returns to capital were likely quite low during the onset of transition due to high inflation and falling output and profits, and real deposit rates were generally low or negative; in some countries, these problems persist. Thus foreign assets offer a much more attractive combination of risk and return, encouraging capital flight from transition economies (Grigoryev and Kosarev 2000). Even though investment returns in some transition economies have risen as economic conditions improved and risks have fallen, Ndikmana and Boyce (2003, p. 109) note that capital flight is “habit forming”, and the outflows of the early transition may have had a follow-on effect in the later transition period even as domestic risks have declined and returns increased. At the same time, there were also country- and transition-specific risks that investors in these countries faced. Perhaps the most critical was the uncertainty of property rights and the risk of expropriation (Wintrobe 1998). In Russia and some of the other CIS countries, privatizations were chaotic and favored a small coterie of insiders and financiers, and these privatizations continue to be seen as illegitimate by many, leading to the possibility of renationalization or expropriation. In other countries, little real privatization took place, meaning that firms were placed in the hands of a small kleptocratic elite that was allied with the current regime, but whose ability to extract rents from these firms was not likely to last beyond the life of the regime. One of the results of this uncertainty over property rights is that investors in these countries have sought to strengthen their hold on their companies by moving capital offshore and then bringing it back to their own country in the guise of “foreign” capital that would be subject to better treatment and less likely to be expropriated by the government.Footnote 6
 Another factor leading to expectations of high levels of capital flight from the transition economies is the weakness of the state and the resulting high levels of corruption and criminality. Drug dealing, prostitution, fraud, bribery and various economic crimes generate large amounts of cash, and so do bribes paid to politicians, regulators and business executives. Much of this money is laundered through foreign financial institutions and companies. Money to be laundered is deposited into the financial system of the home country and then moved offshore to disguise its origins. Firms engaged in international trade are also used to move money abroad. A common way of doing this even in the presence of capital controls is through under- and over-invoicing. De Boyrie et al. (2005) estimate that over- and under-invoicing accounted for the movement of $1.01 to $4.85 billion per year between the Russia and the United States for the period 1995–1999. Tikhomirov (1997) estimated that mispricing of Russian trade in the years 1990–1995 resulted in capital flight that was six-fold the official Russian government estimates of $35–40 billion.",8
147,4,Review of World Economics,21 June 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-011-0101-2,Oil revenues for public investment in Africa: targeting urban or rural areas?,November 2011,Manfred Wiebelt,Rainer Schweickert,Marcus Böhme,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The limited success of “Washington Consensus” type reforms in promoting growth and reducing poverty has reemphasized the importance of a more active role of the state in development (World Bank 2005; Rodrik 2006; Lin 2010). A more active role can entail enhancing budget neutral reforms, such as improvements in legislation, regulations and rules to attract private investments. It can also imply the scaling up of public spending, either related to shifts in existing budgets and/or through acquiring additional resources. There is broad consensus in the development economics literature that productivity-enhancing public investments designed to support private-sector led activities are key for growth and job creation (Syrquin 1988; World Bank 1993; Collier 2006; Breisinger and Diao 2009). However, scaling up of public investments raises important questions on the fiscal implications and institutional requirements for translating additional resources into development outcomes. Additional financial resources for public investments can come from a variety of sources, including domestic sources (taxes) or foreign inflows (grants, bonds, resource rents). For many African countries, the possibilities of raising additional incomes is restricted to grants and revenues from natural resources, given the generally limited scope for tax increases and limited access to international financial markets. However, several African countries are experiencing or are about to experience a surge in foreign-exchange inflows. For example, in Ghana and Uganda oil has been discovered, which is expected to significantly boost government incomes. Yet, using such foreign exchange inflows to finance public investments can have adverse implications for development. Empirical evidence of whether foreign inflows are good or bad for growth is inconclusive. While Sachs and Warner (1997, 2001) find that countries with high resource-exports-to-GDP ratios experience lower growth rates, other research shows that resource abundance has a neutral or even positive effect on growth (Davis 1995; Lederman and Maloney 2003). The reasons for explaining potential negative impacts on growth are twofold: a lack of absorptive and managerial capacity of overstretched public sectors and the negative impact of the windfall revenues on policy choiceFootnote 1 or, alternatively, Dutch disease effects in the form of reduced savings and distortions of relative prices with a bias against export oriented production.Footnote 2
 Public investment decisions are also made on the basis of their effect on growth and poverty, and an important policy question decision makers must ask is where to invest to bring about positive growth rates. Broadly speaking, public investments can be directed to rural or urban areas and sectors. The related debate is perhaps best reflected in the World Development Reports (WDR) 2008 and 2009. These reports convey two rather different messages of how to accelerate growth and poverty reduction in developing countries (World Bank 2008, 2009a). The WDR 2008 sees “agriculture as a vital development tool for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)”, while the WDR 2009 concludes that “Growing cities, ever more mobile people, and increasingly specialized products are integral to development”. The WDR 2009 argues that investments should be focused on leading (often urban) areas, where they are likely to have the highest returns (World Bank 2009a). The rationale behind this is that high population densities lead to agglomeration effects and industrial clustering, thereby increasing innovation and productivity. According to this line of thought, public investments need to focus on increasing density, i.e. managing urban expansion and congestion by connecting different parts of a city. Yet, empirical evidence also suggests that agriculture-led growth has large multiplier effects, is most poverty reducing, and also has high returns to investment.Footnote 3
 While there is disagreement of where to invest, there is broad consensus on the importance of public investments for productivity-led growth. Following Aschauer (1989), various studies present macro evidence and establish the importance of the stock of public infrastructure as one necessary ingredient for agricultural productivity growth (Binswanger et al. 1993; Ram 1996; Esfahani and Ramirez 2002). As pointed out by Hulten (1996) it is not only the quantity of public capital that should be considered but also the effectiveness of existing infrastructure capital stocks (Calderón and Servén 2004, 2008; Reinikka and Svensson 2002). Microeconomic studies echo these findings and show that the adoption of productivity enhancing technologies is positively influenced by public infrastructure (Antle 1984; Ahmed and Hossain 1990; Renkow et al. 2004). Micro studies are also able to link household welfare and the access to public capital. Results suggest a positive effect of public investment in infrastructure on the reduction of rural poverty (Fan et al. 2000; Fan and Zhang 2008; Gibson and Rozelle 2004), although these poverty effects will depend on the institutional setup (Duflo and Pande 2007). Beside its direct effects on productivity and output growth it has been shown that infrastructure investment can also decrease inequality in rural areas (Calderón and Servén 2004; Fan et al. 2003). While both poverty and inequality effects are often due to opportunities in the nonfarm sector it is not clear if the income effects are always big enough to change the existing income distribution (Jacoby 2000). As for the different types of public investment, many studies focus on transport networks and roads. But it seems that strong complementarities exist between physical and human capital (Canning and Bennathan 2000) and strong positive externalities of telecommunication (Canning 1999). These results would suggest a regional targeting of specific types of public investment (Fan et al. 2005). There are only few analytical attempts to compare public investments in urban and rural areas. For Uganda, Dorosh and Thurlow (2009) find that improving agricultural productivity generates more broad-based welfare improvements in both rural and urban areas than investing in the capital city. While investing in Kampala accelerates economic growth, it has little effect on other regions’ welfare because of the city’s weak regional growth linkages and small migration effects (Dorosh and Thurlow 2009). Evidence from Peru suggests that by investing in the leading more urbanized region, Peru may be undermining the economy in the lagging (mostly rural) region by increasing import competition and internal migration (Thurlow et al. 2008). The study also shows that for reducing the divergence between the leading and lagging region, investing in the lagging region’s productivity through extension services and improved rural roads is critical. This brief overview of the literature suggests that public investments in rural areas and agriculture are critical parts of development strategies in Africa. Yet, scaling up investments in either rural or urban areas is often complicated by the fact that financial resources come as foreign inflows, a fact not often captured in the literature. To address this gap, we chose Ghana as a stylized agriculture-based economy and its recent oil discovery as an example for scaling up of public investments that are based on foreign exchange inflows. To jointly assess the macroeconomic, growth, spatial and poverty impacts of rural-biased versus urban-biased investment strategies, we use a dynamic computable general equilibrium model. Ghana is a good case study for several reasons: Current conditions in Ghana seem favorable to avoiding the resource curse caused by institutional and/or political factors. Ghana’s economic structure is also comparable to many other African countries. Agriculture plays an important role for the economy and contributes about one-third of total GDP. Agricultural exports are concentrated in one crop (cocoa), which, together with gold, constitutes more than 60% of total exports. In 2007 oil was discovered off the coast of Ghana, with total reserves estimated at between 500 million and 1.5 billion barrels and the potential for future government revenues estimated at US $1–1.5 billion annually (Osei and Domfe 2008; World Bank 2009b; IMF 2009). Measured by a modest long-term oil price of US $60 per barrel over the next 20 years, oil revenues will add around 30% to government income annually and constitute 10% of GDP over the exploitation period. Although the relative amount of expected oil revenue is smaller than in other resource-rich countries (e.g., Angola, Botswana, and Nigeria), the expectations that additional oil revenue will help the country further accelerate growth and reduce poverty are high. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains the stylized model for an agricultural based economy with strong regional inequalities which will be used to simulate different scenarios. The simulations and their macroeconomic and sectoral implications are presented in Sect. 3. Based on these results, Sect. 4 discusses welfare and poverty effects. Section 5 concludes the paper and draws policy lessons.",5

However, the recent insightful paper by Bernhofen and Brown (2004) seemed to overcome this difficulty, focusing on the historical data of Japan’s opening up at the end of the 1850s. In Japan, the Tokugawa government had prohibited all international trade and contracts in 1641, except at Dejima, a tiny island off Nagasaki where Dutch and Chinese merchants were allowed to trade.
Footnote 1 Only a negligibly small amount of trade was conducted, and thus, Japan was virtually in autarky for more than 200 years. In June 1859, following the visit of US Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853, the Tokugawa government decided to open up the Japanese economy. Accordingly, the shift from autarky to free trade occurred rapidly. It was in this context that Bernhofen and Brown (2004) tested the validity of Deardorff’s theorem, using price data for 1851–1853 before the opening up (i.e., autarky) and trade data for 1868–1875 just after the opening up (i.e., free trade). Their results support strongly the law of comparative advantage. It is important to note that one of the key underlying assumptions in Deardorff’s theorem is balanced trade, a condition that has been commonly assumed in some of the empirical work in testing the trade theory. However, because balanced trade does not necessarily hold realistically, careful attention to the issue of balanced trade is needed in empirically testing the trade theory. Thus, for example, Leamer (1980) pointed out that the Leontief paradox rested on the assumption of balanced trade. Although Bernhofen and Brown (2004) is the only empirical study that has attempted to test Deardorff’s theorem directly, it is worth analyzing how the balanced trade assumption affects their results. In Sect. 2, I reconsider Deardorff’s theorem of the law of comparative advantage from an empirical point of view. When trade is unbalanced, not only net exports valued at autarky prices but also those valued at free trade prices are needed to test the law of comparative advantage. The results imply that the empirical success of the test of the law of comparative advantage by Bernhofen and Brown (2004) might simply rest on the existence of unbalanced trade. Section 3 conducts a test that is consistent with both balanced and unbalanced trade, and presents the results. The results support the empirical validity of the law of comparative advantage even after unbalanced trade is taken into account. Section 4 concludes the paper.",3
148,1,Review of World Economics,25 May 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-011-0099-5,"Trading away what kind of jobs? Globalization, trade and tasks in the US economy",April 2012,Thomas Kemeny,David Rigby,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Between 1970 and 2005, the value of US merchandise imports has grown far more rapidly than domestic output. These imports increasingly originate in the developing world. Indeed, over the last thirty years, the share of total US imports from developing economies increased from 8% to nearly 40%.Footnote 1 These trends signify a historic change, with profound implications for the nature of work and welfare (Baldwin 2006; Blinder 2006; Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2006). It is not merely that imports from developing countries have increased in magnitude, nor that they increasingly comprise manufactured goods and services rather than primary products, but rather that the nature of global integration is itself being transformed. Earlier waves of globalization were characterized by growth in the international exchange of final products, whether port for wheat, or automobiles for apparel. Reductions in trade costs, and in particular the cost of physical transportation, led to new possibilities for the spatial separation of consumers and producers. In contrast, recent declines in trade costs, largely enabled by new information technologies, have stimulated the ‘unbundling’ not simply of production and consumption, but of fine-grained activities within industrial sectors (Jones and Kierzkowski 1990; Baldwin 2006). No longer is comparative advantage determined at the level of final goods or whole industries, as it was in the days of Ricardo, or even Heckscher and Ohlin. Today, because agents can interact and share information effectively over great distances, comparative advantage operates at the level of individual tasks (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2006). The result has been the offshoring of an increasingly large range of design, production and service activities. A number of new models describe this process of ‘task trade’ (Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud 2007; Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2008; Kohler 2008; Robert-Nicoud 2008). Though approaches differ, a common theme is that delocalization of tasks reduces production costs and generates gains resembling those won by advances in production technology. Moreover, the effects of task trade, like the impact of technological change, may be biased toward a particular subset of the labor force, generating negative Stolper–Samuelson dynamics for local workers whose labor comprises the tasks most readily offshored to developing economies, where wages are lower. Many scholars believe that offshoring will replace physical and intellectual tasks that can easily be routinized and rendered in blueprints (Leamer and Storper 2001; Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2006). For others, the key distinction between tradable and nontradable tasks is the related idea of interpersonal interaction (Blinder 2007; Blinder and Krueger 2009). Currently, we do not know the extent to which nonroutine analytical, physical and interactive task categories disturb familiar distinctions, such as white/blue collar and high/low skill, that have traditionally been employed to understand the form and the impact of international trade (Markusen 2005; Baldwin 2006). What we do know is that the task structure of work in many advanced, industrialized economies has made a pronounced shift toward nonroutine interactive and analytical activity, and away from routine cognitive and manual labor (Autor et al. 2003; Spitz-Oener 2006; Goos and Manning 2007). Labor economists describe this shift using data on occupations and their constituent tasks, and argue that skill-biased technological change, and in particular computerization, explains changes in task content. However, task trade with developing economies might equally be responsible for the structural transformation of labor markets in developed economies (Levy and Murnane 2004). The purpose of this paper is to determine whether rising import competition from developing countries is associated with changes in the task structure of the US economy between 1970 and 2005. To examine this relationship, we build a data set that describes trade flows, industries, workers and the tasks that comprise their occupations. Specifically, we combine disaggregated US import data with the NBER-CES productivity database that includes various industry-specific variables, that are then linked to sector-specific measures of the share of nonroutine tasks. We use a measure of computer investment in manufacturing sectors to represent technological change. To describe the structure of tasks by industry, we merge selected task characteristics from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) with workers on the basis of their industry and occupation in the Decennial Census (1970–2000) and the American Community Survey (2005–2007). Due to the limitations of both the trade and industry data, we measure the relationship between trade and tasks for manufacturing industries only, and exclude the international exchange of services.Footnote 2
 Our results show that import competition from less developed economies is associated with sector-specific increases in the demand for nonroutine tasks. The direction of the relationship between trade and task structure resembles that of technological change, in keeping with theoretical expectations. Computer investment in manufacturing, our proxy for skill-biased technological change, has no significant relationship with nonroutine task shares. When we disaggregate our indicator of nonroutine tasks into its constituent components, we find that imports from developing countries are positively and significantly related to the growth of interpersonal and analytical tasks throughout the US economy, but inversely related to changes in demand for nonroutine manual labor. The remainder of this paper is organized in four sections. Section 2 reviews the literature on task trade, location and labor markets. Section 3 outlines our empirical strategy, including sources of data, variable construction and estimation concerns. Section 4 provides results from a series of statistical models. We conclude in Sect. 5.",34

Recent interest in factor shares stems from the fact that over the last two decades, the labour share across a host of industrialised countries has followed a downward trend, as opposed to the periods in the 1960s and 1970s where the labour share of national income was considerably higher. Figure 1 shows the evolution of the labour share for the European Union (EU) as a whole (left panel) and some large member states (right panel). The graphs clearly show why the evolution of the labour share has drawn much attention recently: whereas the labour share was at a high level and even increasing in the 1970s, this was followed by a significant decrease in the subsequent decades. In the later years the downward trend seems to have bottomed out. The evolution of the labour share has been rather similar within most large EU member states over the same time period. The evolution of the labour share in the EU-15. 1970–2005. Source: EU KLEMS database, March 2008, see Timmer et al. (2007) While early studies assumed factor share constancy as one of the key regularities characterising economic growth (e.g. Kaldor 1963), subsequent contributions have shown that factor shares have not been stable in the medium-term with several explanations being proposed.Footnote 1 Overall, no single theory or specific cause is able to explain all changes in factor shares. What does appear to emerge, however, is that explanations can essentially be grouped into temporary and cyclical factors such as energy price shocks and adjustment costs, while others can be viewed as being more structural in nature. This paper re-examines the possible factors which can explain the observed decline in the labour share and their relative importance. The structural factors affecting factor shares considered in this paper include changes in the sectoral composition of economies, (skill-biased) technological change, firm’s product market power and foreign competition. Several of these factors may have been influenced by increasing economic integration in general and by the European integration process in particular. Within the EU the Single Market programme, several waves of enlargement, and the introduction of the euro have all contributed to increasing European economic integration over the last few decades. Previous studies examining the impact of globalisation on the labour share tend to focus on the increasing role of emerging economies such as China and India in world trade (e.g. Jaumotte and Tytell 2007; Guscina 2007). Nevertheless, intra-EU trade accounts for approximately two-thirds of all EU trade,Footnote 2 and the period during which the decline in the labour share took place in most EU countries (early eighties to late nineties) corresponds to a period of intensive intra-EU trade liberalisation. This study therefore concentrates on the European integration process and examines how declining intra-EU trade costs impacted on the share of labour in national income. The legacy of obstacles to trade in the EU and their subsequent dismantling have had considerable implications on the European industrial structure (cfr. Lyons et al. 2001). While it is widely accepted that efficiency and welfare benefits emerge as a result of increased competition in product markets, European countries have been considerably slower in adopting anti-trust legislation when compared to the United States (Mueller 1996). In the founding treaty of the European Community, despite incorporating strict anti-trust rules, the emphasis was on cross-border implications and not on within country competition. It was not until the Maastricht Treaty that antitrust legislation in certain countries converged closer to European standards. Moreover, firms are ever more adept at employing innovative strategies in order to ensure that any rents earned are protected from strict regulation (Konings et al. 2001). Consequently, it would appear to be of interest to examine whether the market structure developments which occurred concurrently with the integration process in the EU have affected the labour share in member states. An additional channel through which the process of European economic integration might affect the labour share is through the increased mobility of firms. As firms become ever more footloose, member states increasingly compete with each other as a means of attracting foreign direct investment. Therefore, whether increasing international competition contributes to the decreasing labour share is also examined. Moreover, economic integration may have caused various changes in technology and factor markets, or may have happened concurrently with these. Some examples are the steady increase in the relative supply of skilled workers which has been observed in developed countries, technological innovations and capital accumulation leading to increased demand for capital-complementary skilled labour (Monfort et al. 2008), and shocks to prices of intermediary goods. These trends coincided with a general increase in the openness to trade, and we will attempt to determine to what extend the observed decline in the labour share can be attributed to each of these factors. To do this, we build on the work of Bentolila and Saint-Paul (2003). These authors estimate the impact of changing technology, factor prices, adjustment costs and the bargaining power of unions on the labour share. In order to investigate how European economic integration affects the labour share, this study extends their model and estimates the impact of declining trade costs, foreign competition, changes in market structure, skill-biased technological change and capital accumulation. Although the empirical analysis of this paper focuses on European economic integration, the theoretical framework applies equally well to global economic integration. Since European economic integration was already well under way when trade integration with low-wage countries started to strengthen, it may shed some light on possible future effects of closer integration at a global scale. A significant contribution of this paper stems from enhancing the measurement of factors explaining the labour share. For example, previous studies examining the impact of globalisation on factor shares use aggregated measures of trade openness such as the ratio of trade to the gross domestic product (GDP) (Guscina 2007; Moral and Gernre 2007), while this study uses bilateral trade data at the industry level to construct a measure of trade openness which is derived directly from theory. In addition, the role of market structure is estimated by using mark-ups and concentration ratios derived from firm-level data, which have not been examined empirically in previous studies. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the evolution of the labour share and the importance of compositional effects. Some statistics on potential explanatory variables are given, such as the evolution of trade costs and industry concentration. Section 3 then introduces a small theoretical framework, making predictions on the direction of the influence of some of the suggested explanatory variables. Section 4 presents the estimation results and Sect. 5 concludes.",30

Jørgensen,Philipp J. H. Schröder,Zhihao Yu,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In most countries, the lion’s share of domestic consumptions is serviced from home, and only a fraction of all domestic firms are engaged in export. In line with these stylized facts, the new heterogeneous firms trade theory (e.g., Melitz 2003) commonly sets a partitioning condition, i.e., the barriers to trade remain so substantial that not all firms in an industry find it worthwhile to engage in foreign markets. Though partitioning is certainly an empirically relevant case, the hypothetical situation of an ultra-globalized industry where trade liberalization has progressed beyond this point may be more relevant than first thought. It may, for instance, echo the structure envisaged in popular—and sometimes fearful—accounts of globalization.
Footnote 1 Beyond the point of zero-partitioning, intra-industry reallocations have eliminated purely domestic firms of the sector in question such that all existing firms service all markets. Furthermore, for low productivity firms, intense competition from abroad results in losses on the home market, which must be compensated by profits from export sales to ensure the survival of these firms. Even though, such a situation may be the exception, it will reflect situations for some firms in small highly trade-open economies, and it will undeniably be the reality for certain narrowly defined industries. For example, it is remarkable that the aim to compensate home losses has been featured as a central export motive already in the early literature on exporter behavior: see the widely cited survey by Bilkey (1978). More recently, the ‘born-global’ literature provides accounts of sectors and firms where such situations (i.e., losses on the home marked that are compensated by gains on foreign markets) may prevail: see, for example, Moen and Servais (2002) or Knight and Cavusgil (2004). The present paper examines the scenario of an ultra-globalized industry and the central questions that arise. Specifically, we ask if there continue to be gains from further trade liberalization, once integration has progressed beyond the point of zero-partitioning. We address this issue by exploring a simple symmetric two country intra-industry trade model in the spirit of Melitz (2003), albeit replacing the firm level marginal cost heterogeneity with fixed cost heterogeneity. Empirically, of course, firms will display heterogeneity in both the fixed cost and the marginal cost dimension. Fixed cost heterogeneity has been identified as an important channel for export market selection: see Roberts and Tybout (1997), Lawless and Whelan (2008) and Lawless (2009, 2010). The originators of the fixed cost heterogeneity modeling approach are Schmitt and Yu (2001) and Yu (2002) and more recently Jørgensen and Schröder (2006, 2008) and Cole (2009, 2011). A key feature in the present paper—similar to Cole (2009, 2011)—is that firms are heterogeneous in their fixed costs both on the home and foreign markets. In the resulting model we are able to characterize stationary equilibria and explore consequences of trade liberalization for industry dynamics. The main benefit of fixed cost heterogeneity—instead of marginal cost heterogeneity—is that all firms charge the same price. This is particular important when conducting welfare comparisons based on iceberg trade cost reductions. In contrast, marginal cost heterogeneity implies different iceberg trade costs for different firms, i.e., higher productivity firms face lower trade costs. This distortion is avoided in the fixed cost heterogeneity setting.
Footnote 2 The cost of solving this issue by focusing on fixed cost heterogeneity is, of course, that firm size within a given category (exporter/non-exporter) does not differ. Still, all the key components of marginal cost heterogeneity models are preserved by the present modeling choice, e.g., exporters are more productive and larger than non-exporters and gains from trade via intra-industry reallocations exist: see Jørgensen and Schröder (2008).
Footnote 3 For the present purpose of studying a hypothetical ultra-globalized situation, the fixed cost heterogeneity assumption is particularly useful because it makes for a highly trackable framework delivering simple closed form solutions of the model including welfare. The present paper contributes to the literature in two ways. Firstly, we provide an application of the firm level heterogeneous fixed costs specification following Schmitt and Yu (2001), Jørgensen and Schröder (2008) and Cole (2011), and thereby illustrate the simplicity of this alternative to the marginal cost heterogeneity assumption (e.g., Montagna 2001; Meltitz 2003). We follow Cole (2009, 2011) and improve upon the earlier fixed cost heterogeneity models by modeling firm heterogeneity already on the home market (not only in export market access), while still preserving the entry mechanism in the manner of Hopenhayn (1992) and Melitz (2003). Secondly, and more importantly, we use this framework to study the consequences of trade liberalization in an already ultra-globalized industry. Previous work has focused on the effects of trade liberalization, while partitioning prevails: e.g., Melitz (2003), Jørgensen and Schröder (2008), Demidova and Rodriguez-Clare (2009), Baldwin and Forslid (2010). The recently developed trade models with heterogeneous firms depart from the traditional trade models of monopolistic competition (i.e., Krugman 1979,  1980) in that only a fraction of firms are engaged in export. In the ultra-globalized scenario of zero-partitioning, we are back to Krugman’s world, where all firms serve both domestic and foreign markets though they are heterogeneous. From the present model we arrive at the following results. Once we abandon the partitioning condition, i.e., allowing for all firms in equilibrium to be export active, further trade liberalization will still generate more trade (at the intensive margin). The resulting increased competition and induced industry reallocations may force low productivity firms of the industry to exit or to ’cross-subsidize’ losses on the home market with profits made from export sales. The welfare implications of further trade liberalization in such a situation are analyzed. Firstly, we find that reductions in iceberg trade costs (as well as in fixed trade costs) always increase welfare. Secondly, any given reduction in iceberg trade costs turns out to generate a larger welfare gain once the industry is beyond the point of zero-partitioning. The reason for this latter, and somewhat counter intuitive, finding is as follows. With partitioning, trade liberalization benefits the trading firms and harms the purely domestic firms, yet bestows overall gains via industry reallocations and increased number of available variety. Beyond zero-partitioning, all firms trade, and no purely domestic firms can be harmed. Still, reallocations continue to occur. Specifically, with lower trade costs, in the ultra-globalized situation, all firms—and ultimately consumers—benefit from lower trade costs and increased sales abroad, even though intra-industry reallocations take place and a larger share of firms are forced to compensate losses on the home market by gains on the foreign market. The next section presents the autarky benchmark of the fixed cost heterogeneity model. In Sect. 3 we introduce the open economy version and derive the results with and without the customary partitioning condition. Section 4 presents our welfare results. Section 5 concludes.",2

Essentially, employment in foreign-owned firms is thought to be more volatile because foreign-owned firms can more easily shift production between locations. A related argument is made by Görg and Strobl (2003), who suggest that foreign-owned plants are more “footloose” in the sense that they are more likely to exit the market (close down) than similar domestic-owned plants. However, much evidence and theory suggests that multinational firms are positively selected from the productivity distribution of all firms (see Greenaway and Kneller 2007 for a literature review). In this case, plants belonging to multinationals might be more productive than domestic plants, and therefore enjoy a higher survival rate. There is a small empirical literature (described in Sect. 2 below) which estimates the probability of plant closure as a function of foreign ownership. This literature considers only the manufacturing sector. We use a large, representative sample of plants from all sectors of the economy to test the hypothesis for the German economy. We improve on the existing methodology by estimating the hazard to plant closure using discrete-time duration models which account for unobserved heterogeneity and delayed entry. In contrast to previous studies, our methods allow us to estimate the baseline hazard to plant exit as well as the impact of foreign ownership. The shape of the baseline hazard yields additional insights into the processes which cause plant survival or failure. Our sample of plants can be linked to information on individual workers, and so we are also able to examine the role of workers’ characteristics in determining plant survival. For example, we can examine whether the human capital of the workforce contributes to its survival. It has also been argued that foreign-owned plants have higher worker turnover rates even if they do not actually shut down. For example, Fabbri et al. (2003) argue that multinational firms have more elastic labour demand than domestic-owned firms, which would be consistent with higher worker turnover rates. However, a separate literature has suggested that foreign-owned plants have a greater incentive to prevent worker separation (to avoid knowledge spillovers to local plants) and will therefore pay higher wages in order to prevent worker separations (Glass and Saggi 2002). In this case, turnover will actually be lower in foreign-owned plants. However, the empirical evidence on foreign ownership and worker separation rates is limited to only two papers, only one of which uses micro-level data on workers. In this paper, therefore, we also use discrete-time duration methods to estimate the hazard to worker separation as a function of foreign ownership, conditional on plant survival. Our findings show clearly that, as a group, foreign-owned plants in Germany do not have higher exit rates, and workers in those plants have separation rates which are no different to workers in domestic-owned plants. We suggest that this result arises because foreign-owned plants in an advanced industrial economy such as Germany are “less different” to domestic plants than in other settings. Instead, the key factors which affect plant survival are size and profitability, but there is also a considerable role for workers. Plants with more experienced workers (after controlling for age) are less likely to exit. In Sect. 2 we discuss the related literature in more detail. In Sect. 3 we describe the data and how we construct our measures of plant closure and worker turnover. The econometric method we use for both measures is discussed in Sect. 4. Our results are presented in Sect. 5, and Sect. 6 concludes.",14
148,1,Review of World Economics,08 July 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-011-0103-0,Expropriation of foreign direct investments: sectoral patterns from 1993 to 2006,April 2012,Christopher Hajzler,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Expropriation is a common form of political risk where a host-country government seizes a company’s assets without fair compensation, and is a frequently cited barrier to foreign investment in many developing countries.
Footnote 1 In an effort to understand the extent of such risk, when governments are likely to expropriate and what they take, a number of studies have documented expropriation of foreign direct investment (FDI) for large samples of developing countries. These data have been instrumental in identifying technological, political, and macroeconomic determinants of expropriation patterns over time and across industrial sectors. These studies have mostly focused on the 1960–1990 period. Relatively little is known about global expropriation patterns in more recent decades. This paper is a continuation of these earlier efforts, constructing data on international expropriations and FDI, by industry, in all developing countries for the 1993–2006 period. Building on the work of Kobrin (1980, 1984) and Minor (1994), a frequency-based measure of expropriation is examined (rather than value of assets), which has the advantage of allowing for relatively comprehensive country coverage.
Footnote 2 Taken together, these data represent the most extensive historical coverage of developing country expropriations from 1960 to 2006.
Footnote 3 Examining sector and time patterns over this period, we evaluate a number of earlier predictions and reconsider several hypotheses. A number of the empirical regularities that we document using our expropriation database corroborate findings already emphasized in the literature, and we review explanations for this set of “stylized facts”. New evidence relating sectoral patterns of FDI and expropriation in developing countries is also presented, making use of unique country FDI stock data according to major industrial sector. Specifically, the following empirical patterns are evaluated and discussed. First, expropriation is less likely after 1980 in comparison to the 1960s and early 1970s, both in terms of frequency and the share of the total stocks of developing country FDI affected. However, the number of expropriations has risen since the mid-1990s, with a large proportion occurring in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. The virtual disappearance of expropriation during the 1980s is in part attributed to the widespread confiscation of virtually all vulnerable investments in developing countries a decade earlier.
Footnote 4 In addition, developing country commitments to the major multilateral investment treaties in the late 1970s and early 1980s reflect a general willingness of host-country governments to invite new foreign investments. These agreements have also provided a framework for resolving investment disputes with the aid of a formal, international arbitration process, which may help to resolve contract disputes before they result in the state taking extreme actions against the firm. In most instances of expropriation, however, international treaties and arbitration seem incapable of significantly impacting on these decisions. In sum, although expropriations are much less widespread compared to their peak in the 1970s, such risk remains an important consideration for foreign investors deciding where to invest. Second, FDI in resource-based sectors is more vulnerable to expropriation, particularly in mining and petroleum. Compared to the relative importance of these sectors in aggregate investment and output, foreign investment is expropriated more often in mining and petroleum than in other industries, and this pattern is fairly stable over time. Truitt (1970) is among the first to recognize this pattern, and a variety of explanations for the relatively high risk in extractive industries have been explored. Comparing the sectoral distribution of FDI of recent expropriating countries to that of non-expropriating countries, we present a new (and somewhat puzzling) observation that requires a more nuanced interpretation of sectoral patterns than those already proposed. We find that expropriating countries have a higher average share of aggregate FDI located in resources, and yet this difference is not reflected in average sector production shares. That countries which are more likely to expropriate attract a relatively large proportion of FDI in historically high-risk industries suggests that governments in these countries are offering additional investment incentives in resources (such as cheap mineral rights) to compensate for these risks. We review anecdotal evidence linking expropriation risk to mining sector concessions along these lines. Finally, we find that high resource output prices increase the likelihood of expropriation. This finding lends support to a standard assumption in the theoretical literature that the value of the assets seized figures prominently in the host country government’s decision to expropriate.
Footnote 5 Expropriation is at least in some sense driven by opportunism, rather than reflecting mere shifts in political ideology, a point Kobrin (1980) and Jodice (1980) have also stressed. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 outline the expropriation and sector FDI data, respectively, providing definitions and descriptions of data collection and measurement. In Sect. 4, dynamic and sectoral patterns of expropriation are examined, and both old and new accounts of the main facts are discussed. Section 5 concludes with a discussion of the contribution of our findings to both consolidating and reshaping several perspectives on expropriation of foreign investment.",64

Park,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement of the World Trade Organization (WTO) of 1995 is a global landmark agreement that raised the levels of intellectual property rights around the world, especially in developing countries where intellectual property rights were weak compared to standards in developed countries. While the North (developed countries) stood to benefit from stronger protection of its intellectual property assets, the South (developing countries) also stood to benefit if stronger protection in the South were to foster local innovation, attract inward technology transfers, and/or stimulate Northern innovation, particularly to aid in the development of technologies that could be appropriate for the South. Indeed, TRIPS has been a motivation for theoretical work on the influence of Southern intellectual property rights (IPRs) on Northern incentives to innovate and transfer technologies to the South. In North–South models of IPRs, the North conducts research and development (R&D), the outcomes of which are embodied in either new goods or the improved quality of existing goods, which the North supplies. The South does not engage in R&D, but it can copy or imitate Northern goods, depending on how weak intellectual property rights are in the South. Upon successful imitation, Southern firms end up producing the goods and exporting them back to the North. The theoretical conclusions of these models concerning the impacts of IPRs are mixed. Some models predict that stronger IPRs in the South discourage Northern investment in R&D and technology transfer; others reach the opposite conclusion, depending on model specifications. However, empirical work thus far has not tested the strength of the feedback from Southern intellectual property rights to Northern R&D. This feedback is an integral aspect of North–South models. Instead, previous empirical research has focused on whether stronger IPRs in the South help attract Northern technology transfers, such as foreign direct investment (FDI) and licensing, or help foster local innovation.Footnote 1 The purpose of this paper is to provide the first empirical analysis of whether Northern innovation responds to Southern IPRs (specifically patent rights) and thus fill a gap in the literature. The issue has important implications for whether an expansion of global intellectual property rights is conducive to world innovation. It also relates to whether stronger IPRs in the South can encourage Northern researchers to target the needs of developing countries, such as treatments for tropical diseases (see Diwan and Rodrik 1991; La Croix and Liu 2008). To carry out the empirical test, this paper has assembled micro-data on the research and development performed by US multinational firms and their foreign affiliates in developed countries. These firms represent our sample of Northern innovators. The objective is to examine how their R&D relates to patent protection in developing countries, controlling for other factors, including patent protection in other developed (Northern) countries. Measures of foreign patent rights are constructed by taking the weighted sums of indexes of patent protection in individual countries, where the weights are based on market shares, such as the share of exports accounted for by a foreign country. The empirical investigation is based on a panel of firms surveyed between 1982 and 2004. The chief, stark finding in this study is that the R&D of these developed country firms responds weakly to Southern patent protection. Instead, their incentives to perform R&D depend on patent protection levels in the North. The underlying intuition is that stronger patent rights expand the market size of innovators; however, in small economies, that expansion accounts for a small percentage change in the innovators’ global market. Consequently, variations in patent rights in the South would not substantially affect Northern incentives to conduct R&D. This paper is organized as follows: the next section provides a brief review of the literature on North–South IPRs. Section 3 discusses the empirical framework, particularly the construction of the measures of foreign patent rights. Section 4 discusses the unique panel data set of firm-level R&D and other variables, and presents some sample statistics. Section 5 presents the empirical results and Sect. 6 concludes.",9

Richardson (1995), among others, emphasizes two major trends, since the early 1980s, regarding unskilled versus skilled wage inequality in developed and (newly industrialized) developing countries: rise in wage inequality in favor of skilled labor; and rise in the proportion of skilled labor. These trends are concomitant with strong technological-knowledge progress and enlarged trade flows between those countries. Analyzing recent literature, one concludes that each major explanation explored to date contradicts at least one of these observed trends. Following Wood (1998), the mechanisms behind these explanations are grouped into two categories: technology, which is indeed the leading explanation, and trade. According to the technology approach, prominently explored by, for example, Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001) and Acemoglu (1998, 2002), the technological-knowledge bias and the resulting path of the wage premium are driven by the rise in skilled labor supply. Thus, this explanation emphasizes the market-size effect on technological-knowledge progress. However, the operation of this very same effect with trade openness can contradict the argument—with an increase in trade between a skilled abundant country and an unskilled one, the effect of the effective market-size channel under trade (size of the domestic and foreign markets) can generate a reduction in the skilled technological-knowledge bias. Nevertheless, by considering the closed-economy context, this explanation excludes the effects of international technological-knowledge diffusion and, by emphasizing the scale effects, contradicts the dominant literature on scale effects, which proposes its removal (Jones 1995a, b). As to the trade mechanism, adopted, e.g., by Leamer (1996) and Wood (1998), the explanation does not account for the role of technological knowledge (progress and diffusion) and relies mainly on the application of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem: imports of goods produced by unskilled labor reduce unskilled wages in the skilled abundant country. However, the same argument applied to the exporter country would predict a rise in the unskilled wage premium, which contradicts the trend in developing countries. As a result, there is a vibrant revived literature on trade and wage inequality, which, by trying to rethink the effects of trade on wages, reveals the recent increase in interest to the topic.

 Both sides of this debate have been, in fact, dominated by labor endowments, either in a Heckscher–Ohlian (trade explanation) way or through research and development (R&D) intensity (technology explanation). In the latter case, a larger skilled labor endowment, for example, creates a larger demand for R&D directed towards improvements in inputs used in goods produced by skilled labor, thus increasing relative skilled wages. However, in addition to this market-size channel, the direction of R&D is also influenced by the price of goods (price channel), since more expensive goods command higher profits for the producers of the respective inputs. For instance, the relative abundance of skilled labor increases the competitive price of goods produced by unskilled workers and, thus, the demand for R&D directed towards improvements in goods produced by unskilled labor. Pursuing this argument, when the skilled labor abundant North (developed) country exports inputs incorporating its R&D results to an unskilled abundant South (developing) country, it benefits from the higher prices of goods produced by skilled workers in the South. The resulting profit opportunities redirect R&D towards inputs that increase the marginal productivity, and thus wages, of skilled labor in the North and, due to technological-knowledge diffusion, in the South. In order to accommodate this point of view, we develop a scale-independent dynamic general equilibrium North-South model of endogenous growth, which, as is empirically supported by, e.g., Jaumotte et al. (2009) merges the technology and the trade approaches. The connection of both approaches is achieved by shifting the focus to the price channel (instead of the market size) (Afonso 2008) and by accounting for technological-knowledge diffusion (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1997), which we deem as non-dissociable from intermediate-good trade (Amiti and Konings 2007 and Goldberg et al. 2008). As a result, we follow and contribute to: (i) the technology and trade approaches, but in a context of technological-knowledge diffusion under trade and without scale effects; (ii) the international technological-knowledge diffusion models (Grossman and Helpman 1991; Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1997), but in a scenario with wage-inequality implications and without scale effects; (iii) the literature on scale effects, which omits the analysis of wage inequality issue (Jones 1995a, b). Our stylized North and South countries differ in levels of productivity, labor endowments and R&D capacity. These differences are assumed to have historical roots that are reflected in current institutional characteristics. Our main concern is not to explain these differences, but rather to take them as given at time zero and analyze the subsequent path of both economies. The North is more productive than the South due to domestic institutions, is endowed with a higher initial level of skilled labor, and its R&D activities result in innovations that improve the quality of products—Schumpeterian (vertical) R&D, as formalized by Aghion and Howitt (1992). The South has a marginal cost advantage in the production of final goods, and also conducts R&D, but its best results are imitations of the North’s innovations—as in Grossman and Helpman (1991, chs. 11 and 12). Since we want to focus on technological-knowledge diffusion through trade, it is reasonable to consider that the South is not too backward relative to the developed North. The degree of backwardness is acknowledged by making the South’s imitation of existing technology conditional to the distance to the technological-knowledge frontier. Additional features of our model relate the technology of production, in both the North and South, to the structure of international trade. Each economy produces final goods with labor and intermediate goods, where R&D is directly applied. We focus on international trade of intermediate goods, since it is most relevant for technological-knowledge diffusion. Indeed, the recent empirical studies by Amiti and Konings (2007) and Goldberg et al. (2008) provide strong evidence showing that imports of these goods improve productivity in developing countries. Moreover, in line with the dominant literature on scale effects,
Footnote 2 we isolate the price mechanisms of technological-knowledge diffusion through international trade. As for the production of (non-traded) final goods, the crucial feature is the concurrence of complementarity in the use of inputs and substitutability between types of technology, following Acemoglu and Zilibotti’s (2001) model. However, this scale-dependent horizontal R&D model without trade and thus without international technological-knowledge diffusion contrasts with our proposal, which, as stressed above, is a scale-independent vertical R&D model with trade and, thus, with international technological-knowledge diffusion. By shifting to the price channel (instead of the market size) and by accounting for technological-knowledge diffusion, which we deem as non-dissociable from trade, we propose a framework capable of generating predictions compatible with the trend described above of wage inequality in developed and developing countries. In particular, as the North-South average relative price of final goods produced by skilled labor (the one that becomes relevant under international trade) is always higher than the one prevailing in pre-trade North, through the price channel, trade redirects technological knowledge in favor of intermediate goods used with skilled labor. This, in turn, relatively increases wages of skilled workers in both countries. The path followed by prices is empirically supported by empirical studies, such as Krueger (1997) and Broda and Romalis (2009). To sum up, we follow and hope to contribute to three main lines of research previously incorporating scale effects and explored, notably, by: (i) technological-knowledge diffusion growth models of, e.g., Grossman and Helpman (1991, chs. 11–12) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1997); (ii) technological-knowledge bias and wage inequality growth models of, e.g., Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001) and Acemoglu (2002); (iii) trade and wage inequality models of, e.g., Leamer (1996) and Wood (1998). In particular, our results relate closely to Thoenig and Verdier (2003) and Helpman et al. (2008), in as much as the analysis is consistent with empirical findings of increased wage inequality in both developed and developing countries following trade liberalization. However, to the best of our knowledge, our model is unique in that it brings together scale-independent technological-knowledge progress (Northern innovation and Southern imitation, induced by the price channel) and its diffusion through trade (of intermediate goods). After these introductory remarks, the paper proceeds to characterize the North and South economies and the international market. Then, in Sect. 3, the dynamic general equilibrium is derived and, resorting to numerical computation, steady-state and transitional dynamics effects are analyzed. Section 4 concludes the paper with an assessment of the current state of this research.",23

Piermartini (2004) noted that approximately one-third of World Trade Organization (WTO) members impose export duties. Examples are export taxes implemented by Indonesia on palm oil, by Madagascar on vanilla, coffee, pepper, and cloves, by Pakistan on raw cotton, by the Philippines on copra and coconut oil, by Indonesia on palm oil, and by the European Union on wheat (Bouët and Laborde Debucquet 2010; OECD 2010). What are the effects of such policy measures? And why do governments restrict exports in times of food crisis? As will be shown in Sect. 2, economic analysis provides several rational justifications for using these restrictions, in particular in terms of changes in international terms of trade and the impact on domestic prices of final and intermediate goods and public receipts. Moreover, it appears that countries have a relatively large degree of freedom in the implementation of such taxes, as the WTO does not prohibit export taxes and other forms of export restrictions. More precisely, as stated by Crosby (2008, p. 3), “general WTO rules do not discipline Members’ application of export taxes”, but “they can agree—and several recently acceded countries, including China, have agreed—to legally binding commitments in this regard”. In addition, the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture stipulates that when implementing a new export restriction, a WTO member must (i) consider the implications of these policies on food security in importing countries, (ii) give notice to the Committee on Agriculture, and (iii) consult with WTO members that have an interest in the country’s export policies. This agreement does not, however, impose any penalty on countries that ignore the rules. Finally, this form of trade policy does not receive a great deal of attention from the public or the academic establishment. This paper provides a theoretical and empirical background that will contribute to a better understanding of export taxes in the context of food crises. The recent food crisis (2006–2008) has shown that governments may be tempted by these policies at a time when their use is not regulated by international cooperation. As we will show, these instruments may amplify the surge in world agricultural commodities prices, in particular when they are combined with a reduction of import tariffs by large net food-importing countries. This amplification effect is the result of a non-cooperative game between large net food-importing countries and large net food-exporting countries; small net food-importing countries do not have the capacity for reaction and are hurt by this game equilibrium. We illustrate this process through a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that quantifies these mechanisms. This modeling exercise clearly shows that when world food prices spike, both the implementation of new export restrictions and the reduction of import tariffs on agricultural commodities feed augmentation of world prices and harm small net food-importing countries. This represents a clear lack of international coordination; we argue that international institutions should promote more cooperation in this area.
 Section 2 provides an analytical framework that can help better explain these trade policies. In particular, in Sect. 2.2, we develop a theoretical model under general equilibrium which (i) describes what the consequences are of adopting import taxes in large and small net-food importing countries and export taxes in large and small net food-exporting countries and (ii) derives optimal policies when the objective of a government is to maximize the country’s real income. In Sect. 3, we use the MIRAGE modelFootnote 1 to illustrate the potential impact of world price shocks and how countries may react using either increased export taxes and/or reduced import taxes, emphasizing the effects of non-cooperative trade policies in this context. In this modeling exercise, the objective of the government is to keep domestic prices constant in the case of an external shock that implies a surge in world food prices. The rationale of this behavior is explained at the beginning of Sect. 3. Section 4 concludes.",42

148,2,Review of World Economics,09 March 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0124-3,Exchange rate volatility and first-time entry by multinational firms,June 2012,Katheryn Niles Russ,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Foreign direct investment (FDI) is the single largest source of capital inflows for developing countries. In industrialized countries, the size of FDI inflows ranges from zero to almost half the size of gross fixed capital formation. Surprisingly, the impact of exchange rate variability on FDI rarely enters debates over exchange rate management or monetary policy. One reason for this omission could be the lack of conclusive evidence regarding the impact of exchange rate variability on the investment behavior of multinational firms. A long list of studies provide patches of evidence that multinational firms are likely to consider the level and volatility of exchange rates before investing in overseas branches, but yield conflicting theoretical predictions and empirical results. This study takes a fresh look at the issue: it uses a very simple model with heterogeneous firms to motivate an empirical analysis of the effects of the interest rate volatility that underlies exchange rate volatility on cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As). The results show that while interest rate volatility both at home and abroad are positively correlated with exchange rate volatility, they have quite different effects on entry by foreign firms. Further, firms contemplating cross-border activity for the first time respond much differently than repeat foreign investors in a country, indicating that upfront sunk costs are a likely engine through which interest rate volatility influences multinational firms when they decide where to expand their geographic reach. The intuition underlying the model rests on four principal assumptions. First, an unrecoverable upfront entry cost—here, the costs associated with conducting M&As—effectively creates an option value in the tradition of Dixit and Pindyck (1994). In a world with no upfront costs, a firm could simply take over a new plant without regard to future conditions in any period when demand was strong enough to yield positive profits. In contrast, the sunk nature of the initial investment in this model forces the firm to weigh the present discounted value of all potential future profits against the anticipated upfront cost of starting to produce in a foreign country for the first time. The option value is the difference between the expected return from not investing (zero) and the return from investing, which can be negative in the presence of sunk costs. In this model, interest rate volatility affects the size of the option value for home and veteran foreign investors in a different way than it affects the option value for first-time foreign entry. Second, price stickiness causes an inverse relationship between the interest rate and demand for goods produced by any firm, whether domestic or foreign owned. Any uncertainty in underlying macroeconomic variables may either encourage or deter firms from entering the market, depending on the net impact it has on the present discounted value of future profits via the resulting covariance of the expected exchange rate with demand and production costs. Further, uncertainty has the effect of increasing the expected discounted value of marginal costs for firms setting prices in advance, causing them to set higher prices and pushing up the equilibrium aggregate price level. In this sense, we build on the same mechanism described in Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2000)—firms set prices based on their expectations of certain moments of the money supply. Given very weak assumptions regarding the distribution of shocks to the money supply growth rate, these moments contain the second-order moments of the money supply growth rate. In this model, greater uncertainty regarding money growth causes firms to set higher prices, generating a higher aggregate domestic price level and thus higher entry costs. Because entry costs for new foreign entrants into the domestic market consist of a combination of domestic and foreign sunk costs, while entry costs for domestic entrants and veteran foreign investors consist only of domestic takeover costs, an increase in domestic volatility translates into higher entry costs for domestic firms relative to new foreign firms. Thus, sticky prices can affect the option value of investing abroad for the first time differently than the option value of expanding operations within a firm’s domestic market. Third, we assume that the money supply in each country follows a simple exogenous innovation process. This means that exchange rate fluctuations are driven by monetary shocks in the host and source countries. In particular, an increase in monetary volatility in either country increases exchange rate volatility. As in Bergin and Corsetti (2008), first-order conditions from the consumer’s problem imply that the interest rate is a straightforward function of real money balances such that interest rate volatility equals the volatility of the money supply growth rate. Any special impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the expected discounted value of variable profits is neutralized for foreign firms by the risk-sharing properties of trading home and foreign bonds. However, by influencing the price level, the underlying interest rate volatility has a direct effect on the effective cost of upfront investment expenditures. I argue and show empirically that the impact of interest rate volatility on the magnitude of the sunk costs involved in investment affects first-time foreign investors in the home country differently than firms that already possess a functional facility in the home country, whether they are home-owned or “veteran” foreign-owned firms that have already invested there through M&As in prior periods. The combination of sticky prices and exchange rates governed by monetary conditions motivates a well known endogeneity problem first uncovered in aggregate data on bilateral flows of FDI between the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom by Goldberg and Kolstad (1995). Finally, the assumption that firms have heterogeneous productivity levels allows the model to predict how many firms will invest abroad. Russ (2007) discusses the difficulties that arise when addressing the question of how exchange rate risk affects FDI in a representative firm framework, where either all firms invest abroad or none do. In this case, one can proxy changes in FDI by observing whether production by the representative multinational firm increases or decreases in a particular period, but it is difficult to address questions about firms’ willingness to enter a market or, more broadly, why they would invest abroad in an environment with zero profits. The heterogeneous framework below allows one to predict that a larger or smaller number of firms will invest abroad given a particular set of macroeconomic conditions. It also embraces positive profits as an incentive to invest at home or abroad and corresponds with stylized facts regarding the size and value added per worker of multinational firms compared to firms that operate only in their native country discussed in Helpman et al. (2004) and documented in Bernard et al. (2006). Though this model is considerably more stripped down insofar as it eliminates interesting features such as persistence in exchange rate behavior, analyzed by Ghironi and Melitz (2005), it is the first model I am aware of that endogenizes the takeover price as in Nocke and Yeaple (2007) within a fully specified open economy macroeconomic framework. Previous empirical studies, listed in Table 1, have used a variety of data sources, measures of FDI (i.e., as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP), as a proportion of domestic investment, or in absolute levels), definitions of volatility, regression methods, and country breakdowns.
Footnote 1 Table 2 shows that whether investigators focus on real or nominal exchange rate fluctuations, the relationship between FDI and exchange rate volatility varies depending on the sample period, country sample, and method of measuring volatility. An important theoretical result in this study is that M&As by veteran foreign investors
Footnote 2 respond quite differently to the interest rate volatility that generates exchange rate volatility in the model. The empirical analysis below supports the predictions of the model for first-time and veteran cross-border M&As between OECD countries. The results uncover one more reason that past studies have found conflicting estimates of the relationship between aggregate FDI flows and exchange rate risk—the observed relationship may vary depending on the proportion of parent firms that are investing in a particular country for the first time.",16
148,2,Review of World Economics,21 February 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0121-6,Wage structure effects of international trade in a small open economy: the case of Belgium,June 2012,Philip Du Caju,François Rycx,Ilan Tojerow,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Over the last several decades, international trade has increased between industrialised countries and between high- and low-wage countries. One important indicator of this is the trade-to-GDP ratio in OECD countries, which increased from 13% in 1970 to more than 28% in 2007. In the EU-27, the trade openness ratio was 40% in 2007, while it was above 50% for small countries (OECD 2009). Globalisation is also reflected in the increased dispersion of geographical trade partners of OECD countries. Belgium, a small open economy at the core of Europe, is a noteworthy example of the increasing importance of international trade. Since the 1970’s, the trade openness ratio increased by almost 50%. Today, international trade represents more than 70% of Belgium’s annual GDP (Eurostat 2011). These major changes have raised questions about how international trade affects the labour market. Hence, a vast literature scrutinizes trade mechanisms to better understand changes in both labour demand and wage structure (Slaughter 1999). The impact of globalisation on labour-market outcomes is tackled through different trade and labour market models (e.g. Heckscher–Ohlin trade or specific-factor models). Moreover, a wide range of aspects and potential outcomes of globalisation is considered, i.e. impact of changes in trade protection, import penetration or export shares on employment, wage inequalities or the return to workers’ characteristics, such as education (e.g. Freeman 1995; Kugler and Verhoogen 2009; Melitz 2003; Verhoogen 2008; Wood 1994). In the case of developed countries, an important part of the literature concentrates on the role of imports from low-wage countries to explain the increasing pressure on unskilled labour markets (Freeman 1995). Particular attention is devoted to the effects of trade on low-skilled employment and on the evolution of the skilled/unskilled wage ratio. Studies on the wage consequences of international trade generally examine its impact on the return to workers’ characteristics (Pavcnik et al. 2004). However, a growing number of papers focus on the sectoral affiliation of the workers to analyse trade effects on wages (Hoekman and Winters 2005). In this case, the wage differential attributed to the workers’ industry affiliation is examined to understand the effects of globalisation on earnings. Given that the existence of sectoral effects on workers’ wages is a stylised fact in the economic literature (Krueger and Summers 1988; Vainiomäki and Laaksonen 1995; Hartog et al. 2000; Du Caju et al. 2010), some authors argue that studies that do not take into account the industry affiliation may neglect an important channel through which trade affects wages (Pavcnik et al. 2004). Trade effects on inter-industry wage differentials can pass through several channels. First, strong import growth or trade liberalisation reforms may involve pro-competitive effects in the product market that may influence industry rents and therefore the industry wage structure (Kramarz 2008). Secondly, changes in trade may have an impact on industry or firm-level productivity, thereby changing industry-relative wages (Martins and Opromolla 2009). Thirdly, growth in the import penetration level may be considered as a shock to labour demand that affects the industry wage structure in the presence of imperfect labour mobility across sectors (Dutta 2007). Regarding the export side, Schank et al. (2007) suggest that high-export sectors offer high wages as the result of relatively favourable foreign demand shocks. They also state that the wage premium in exporting sectors is compatible with the turnover version of the efficiency wage theory. For Lundin and Yun (2009), exporting industries pay higher wages since exports increase profits and stimulate growth. The empirical literature regarding the impact of trade openness on industry wage premia is still relatively scarce (Gaston and Trefler 1994; Borjas and Ramey 1995; Jean and Nicoletti 2002; Lundin and Yun 2009).Footnote 1 However, the existing results are quite compelling. For example, Grey (1993) and Katz et al. (1989) show for Canada and the US, respectively, that workers in import-intensive industries have lower wage premia, while workers in export-intensive industries receive higher wage premia. Using US data, Borjas and Ramey (1995) report a negative impact of import penetration on wages of low-skilled workers in concentrated industries. Yang and Mallick (2010) report the existence of an export premium for Chinese firms, while Frias et al. (2009) study the case of Mexico and find large and significant positive effects of exports on wages. In Europe, Salvanes et al. (1998) find a positive relationship between the degree of openness and wage premia in Norway. Lundin and Yun (2009) examined the situation in the Swedish manufacturing sector. Their results indicate that industries which face intensive import competition from low-wage countries have lower wage premia. In contrast, export intensities are not found to have a significant impact on workers’ wages.Footnote 2 Using a linked employer-employee data set of the German manufacturing sector, Baumgarten (2010) and Klein et al. (2010) find a significant export wage premium for high-skilled workers. The latter also report an export wage discount for lower skilled workers. For Denmark, Munch and Skaksen (2008) also find an export wage premium, but only in firms where the skill intensity is sufficiently high. In this paper, we investigate the impact of international trade on wage premia in a small open economy, i.e. Belgium. More precisely, our objective is to examine the following questions: Do workers in export-intensive sectors earn higher wages? Do workers in import-intensive sectors earn lower wages? Does the country of origin of imports matter? Is the size of wage differentials in import-intensive sectors different when imports are principally coming from high-income countries or from middle- and low-income countries? Our paper contributes to the existing literature as it is one of the few to: (i) use detailed, matched employer-employee data to compute industry wage premia and disaggregated industry-level panel data to examine the impact of changes in international trade on changes in wage differentials, (ii) simultaneously analyse both imports and exports, and (iii) examine the impact of imports according to the country of origin. To address these questions, we rely on detailed, matched employer-employee data (SES-SBS) covering all years from 1999 to 2006. These data contain detailed information both on firm characteristics and on individual workers. The Structure of Earnings Survey (SES) and the Structure of Business Survey (SBS) are merged with data on international trade (at the NACE three-digit level) coming from the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) International Trade data set. The richness of our data allows us to control for important econometric issues that are not systematically addressed in other studies, such as the potential endogeneity of trade variables and the existence of industry unobserved fixed effects. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In the next section a review of the literature on the magnitude and sources of inter-industry wage differentials is presented. Section 3 describes the data and the methodology. Section 4 examines the size, dispersion and stability of inter-industry wage differentials in the Belgian private sector over the period 1999–2006. The contribution of international trade to observed inter-industry wage differentials is analysed in Sect. 5. The last section concludes.",11
148,2,Review of World Economics,11 February 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0119-0,Does wealth inequality reduce the gains from trade?,June 2012,Mauro Caselli,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Starting from the 1960s many developing countries have opened their domestic markets to foreign imports. Opening to trade has intensified since the 1980s under the auspices of several international organisations in the belief that it would lead to a better allocation of resources, more competition and faster economic growth. However, empirical evidence has since shown that, while trade openness has benefited some countries, it has not been able to increase the growth rate in all countries, as was initially hoped by trade liberalisers. In addition, greater openness to trade has led to increasing income inequality in developing countries (Anderson 2005; Bensidoun et al. 2011). The objective of this paper is to look at the role of inequality in explaining the differences in countries’ growth experiences after trade liberalisation relative to their closed-economy period from an empirical point of view. Inequality of wealth and asset ownership, in particular, has been argued to affect the incentives of, and constraints on, economic agents, especially poor ones. Accordingly, variation among countries in the distribution of wealth could be hypothesised to affect both the benefits and the costs of opening to trade and, therefore, to be a cause of variation in the growth outcomes of trade reforms. The methodology makes use of within-country differences in growth rates before and after trade liberalisation, which is equivalent to a difference-in-differences approach and, thus, makes it possible to study the effect of wealth inequality on the cross-country variation of the growth outcomes of trade reforms in a causal way. The main findings are as follows. First, opening to trade may lead to faster economic growth. But, the addition to growth depends inversely on the level of wealth inequality at the beginning of the liberalisation process. Second, there is evidence to suggest that the reason behind this result may lie in a new aspect of the role of financial development. A better access to credit, particularly for people at the lower end of the wealth distribution, may counteract the negative effect of wealth inequality on the growth gains from trade liberalisation. However, this result is not robust to all specifications. The paper relates closely to the vast literature on trade and growth (see survey in Krueger and Berg 2003). Wacziarg and Welch (2008) provide an important contribution to this literature by making use of the timing of liberalisation in a within-country setting. Through this methodology, they are able to show that on average countries grow faster and have larger investment rates following trade liberalisation. At the same time, however, they confirm that this finding is not valid for all countries and that some countries may grow slower under a liberalised regime. This paper relates to the inequality and growth literature too and to the role that credit market imperfections play in this literature (Galor and Zeira 1993; Aghion et al. 1999; Matsuyama 2000; Lopez and Serven 2009).
Footnote 1 Starting from the premise in Grossman and Helpman (1993) that knowledge is non-rivalrous and non-excludable, Aghion et al. (1999) introduce learning-by-doing and knowledge spillovers in an overlapping generations framework showing that when the individual production function is concave and credit markets are imperfect, greater inequality in the distribution of wealth results in a lower rate of growth. The mechanism through which high inequality deters growth thus operates only at low levels of financial development. The reason is that when individuals are credit constrained, the distribution of wealth affects their production possibilities. This has an impact on the aggregate level of output as well as on its rate of growth. The economic literature provides only a few papers that lie at the intersection of these two strands. From an empirical point of view, Morrissey et al. (2002) find that the interaction between income inequality and trade liberalisation has no effect on growth. This is not surprising given the reasons listed below for not using income inequality as a proxy for wealth inequality. Foellmi and Oechslin (2010) build a ‘new’ trade model with heterogeneous individuals with respect to their initial capital endowment, capital as the only factor of production and monopolistic competition. The results in the present paper confirm the theoretical findings in Foellmi and Oechslin (2010), albeit in a growth context, that in countries with more wealth inequality fewer people, particularly at the lower end of the distribution, are able, by borrowing, both to take advantage of the new export opportunities created by trade liberalisation and to adjust to the economic disruption that it causes. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical background and explains the methodology used to test the hypothesis. Section 3 presents and discusses the data and a preliminary analysis of the relationship between land inequality and the difference in growth rates under liberalised and non-liberalised regimes. Section 4 presents and discusses the results and some robustness checks. Section 5 concludes.",6

In Europe, for example, the regions comprising London, Brussels, Hamburg, Prague, and Bucharest each generate more than twice the GDP per capita of the lowest income regions in the same countries (Commission 2007). Due to production externalities and the benefits of locating near more and wealthier customers, these regions are also attractive locations for firms. These inter-regional inequalities therefore provide an incentive for firms and individuals to migrate, which is reflected in empirical evidence showing that economic activity in most parts of the world is currently becoming more agglomerated (United Nations 2007). Over time, migration driven by a pursuit of higher standards of living serves to reduce the gap in standards of living between regions, with two caveats. Firstly, the cost of migration implies a direct disadvantage for residents of poorer regions who must move to attain the higher standard of living; indeed it would not be worth moving if the gain in standard of living does not exceed the cost of migration. And secondly, the inertia in location choice permits inter-regional inequalities to exist until a new steady-state allocation obtains. In order to reduce inter-regional inequalities, many governments institute regional policies that promote production or directly aid individuals in poorer regions through a system of subsidies or transfers. A conspicuous example is the regional policy conducted by the European Union (EU) through its Structural and Cohesion Funds, which currently represent 36% of the EU’s total budget, while the governments of EU member states also pursue their own regional policies in parallel.Footnote 1 Elsewhere, subsidy and transfer schemes are employed in most developed and even many developing countries, with various schemes instituted in the United States, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Turkey, Russia, and China, to name but a few examples. A substantial component of these policies is regional subsidies: a combination of subsidies to firms, individuals, and infrastructure in poorer regions. The principle underlying such policies is that a marginal improvement in wages, employment, or local services in the poorer regions will lead to a reduction in inter-regional inequalities. In a system of two regions, this holds true. However, the effects of such a policy in a system of many regions, particularly when considering migration, are less clear. It was pointed out by Assar Lindbeck in the 1960s that, in light of local production externalities, inducing firms to locate in an area with poor natural conditions rather than in a nearby area that would support a cluster of production could threaten the survival of the cluster (Lindbeck 1964). Though intuitive and relevant to the application of regional policy, to the best of my knowledge the idea is yet to be given a solid analytical foundation. The current paper formalises this idea by demonstrating in a rigorous manner, using a three-region general equilibrium model, that a subsidy to the poorest region may actually hurt it in the long run by drawing firms away from a nearby region that would more naturally function as a centre of production. Due to externalities in production that lead firms to cluster together, the overall effect may be a temporary increase in production in the poorest region but a larger and more permanent decrease in production in the neighbouring region. This would occur if the subsidy does not succeed in establishing the recipient region as a cluster, but reduces production in the neighbouring region below the threshold size for it to persist as a cluster. Agglomeration to the distant ‘core’ of the system represented by a more densely populated and productive region would therefore be made more acute. In the long run, individuals residing in the periphery would have worse employment opportunities and face higher consumer prices due to the costs of importing goods from further away. This implies a lower real wage and therefore a lower standard of living for residents of the periphery, including those in the region that receives the subsidy. The results presented in this paper imply that the most effective method for improving economic opportunity in the poorest regions may not always be to subsidise those regions directly, indeed this could be worse than doing nothing. Instead, in some cases it would be better to subsidise locations that have greater potential to support production. Further research is required to determine the conditions under which such a scenario would arise in reality and how such conditions could be identified, but the potential for poor-region subsidies to increase inter-regional inequality should be of concern to policymakers. Much of the existing economic theory on regional policy supports the apparently obvious notion that subsidising poorer regions is to their benefit and therefore promotes equality, though perhaps at the expense of growth in the economy as a whole (Martin 1999b; Ulltveit-Moe 2007). This inference depends, however, on how the funds are spent. A known potential flaw in regional policy design relates to improvements in transport infrastructure. Though improving transport links within a region directly aids economic activity in that region, improving the link between a more- and a less-developed region can enhance agglomeration to the more-developed region and thereby increase inequality, as firms relocate to the more-developed region to take advantage of the more profitable local market and simply export their products back to the less-developed region (Martin and Rogers 1995; Martin 1999a).Footnote 2 This reasoning has been used to explain the relocation of firms from the south of Italy that followed improvements in roads between the north and the south of the country after the Second World War (Faini 1983), as well as the increased agglomeration to already wealthy regions in Spain and Portugal following improvements to the highway networks in the 1980s and 1990s (Holl 2004; Teixeira 2006). With the addition of a third region the situation becomes more complicated: a poor region located between two wealthier regions may benefit from improved transport links to the other regions, as explained by Baldwin et al. (2003). It has also been noted that if capital is ‘footloose’, so that it may be allocated anywhere and the profits repatriated, then providing subsidies to firms in poorer regions may in fact constitute an implicit transfer from poor to rich regions that enhances inter-regional inequality (Dupont and Martin 2006). Furthermore, Baldwin and Okubo (2006) noted that when firms are heterogeneous in terms of productivity, regional subsidies attract only low productive firms to the subsidised region, these firms having the least to lose by relocating from the ‘core’ of the economy, which limits the effectiveness of the subsidies. The current paper contributes to this literature by demonstrating a further potential pitfall in the design of regional policy, which in turn demonstrates the importance of production externalities and migration dynamics to the allocation of subsidies. It is shown that if migration is allowed for in a system with multiple regions, a subsidy to a poor region may actually be harmful to its inhabitants in the long run, supporting Lindbeck’s hypothesis. The negative effect of the subsidy occurs without the subsidy being required to ‘backfire’ as in the footloose capital model and the mechanism does not depend on any changes in transport costs. Rather, the subsidy hurts the residents of the poor, recipient region by inducing convergence towards a less favourable long-term allocation of economic activity. In this scenario, by promoting activity in the poor region, the subsidy draws firms away from a nearby cluster that would otherwise have been self-sustaining due to production externalities but drops below the threshold mass of production required to survive as a cluster, while also failing to establish the subsidised region as a cluster. As residents of the poor region benefit from being near a cluster, in the long run the overall effect of the subsidy may be negative. The result is explained intuitively and demonstrated with reference to simulations for a given set of parameter values. The use of simulations raises the obvious question of generality. However, this is less problematic in the current context for three reasons. Firstly, the intention is simply to demonstrate that an effect of this type is possible under reasonable conditions. Secondly, the result emerges for all parameter specifications that produce migration dynamics that are qualitatively similar to those presented here, with long-term agglomeration in either the largest one or two regions, depending on the initial distribution of manufacturing. Indeed, such dynamics were selected because they are a good stylised approximation of empirical migration patterns. And thirdly, the same result would be obtained from any other model that shares certain basic characteristics with the one presented here. Namely, the result would hold for any three-region model in which agglomeration forces exist, welfare is increasing in the proximity to production, the subsidy increases net migration to the recipient region, and the migration dynamics of the system and the initial distribution of mobile factors resemble those presented below. The result does not emerge from a two-region version of the model, as the region receiving the subsidy would simply benefit from an inflow of tax revenue and eventually firms from the unsubsidised region, but obtains for a reasonable range of parameter values for three regions. With a larger number of regions, the range of parameter values for which this situation arises for at least one region expands.Footnote 3 The possibility of such an effect should be considered in the design of regional policy, with care taken not to attract economic activity away from key, potentially healthy regions in the periphery by applying subsidies elsewhere. As the purpose of this paper is to establish that a subsidy to a poor region may increase inequality by the mechanism explained above, a comprehensive analysis of the welfare effects of regional subsidies (a separate exercise that would require a vastly more detailed model and extensive calibration) is not attempted. As such, the absolute welfare effects of the subsidy are not interpreted, these being dependent on a number of subjective factors in the model design. Therefore, this paper does not offer an assessment of the overall effects of subsidies on production or of the optimal level of regional concentration, issues discussed in detail by Combes (2011).Footnote 4
 The analysis in this paper uses the core-periphery model of Krugman (1991), which has the dual features relevant to this analysis of allowing for the migration of labour and the agglomeration of production. Given these features, the Krugman model is relatively simple, being comprised of two sectors, manufacturing and agriculture, each of which uses a specific type of labour as the sole production factor for that sector. The model generates agglomeration in a transparent and intuitive way, through externalities in production and mobility of labour, driven by real wage differentials, in the manufacturing sector. Immobile workers in the agricultural or traditional sector constitute a permanent population in each region, which ensures that agglomeration does not occur for all parameter values. This model is appropriate to a world in which both workers and firms migrate between regions. Moreover, the model is simulated with initial population patterns that are not in steady state, which reflects current migration trends in most countries as people in general migrate to wealthier and more densely populated regions, often large urban agglomerations.Footnote 5 The model does not allow for overall population growth, a simplification that makes the model clearer without affecting the main results.Footnote 6
 To analyse the effects of regional subsidies, a government is introduced into the model that has the objective of improving regional equality in the long term. The government pursues this goal by exogenously providing subsidies to manufacturing firms in any region of its choice, which it funds by levying labour taxes on all workers in the economy. The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows: the model is presented in Sect. 2; the dynamics of a system of three regions are presented in Sect. 3; the effects of subsidies on such a system are demonstrated in Sect. 4; and concluding remarks are given in Sect. 5.",
148,3,Review of World Economics,14 June 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0129-y,The effect of exchange rates on firm exports and the role of FDI,September 2012,David Greenaway,Richard Kneller,Xufei Zhang,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods System in the early 1970s, nominal and real exchange rates have fluctuated significantly.Footnote 1 These fluctuations have in turn generated increased academic interest in the effects of exchange rate movements on international trade.Footnote 2 Although the standard view is that an appreciation of the exchange rate leads to rising prices in foreign markets and depresses export volumes, recent evidence using firm level data has not generated convincing support, finding instead ambiguous evidence for a negative effect (see for example Campa 2004 and Bernard and Jensen 2004a).Footnote 3
 In this paper we build on this literature to consider firm level export responses to exchange rate fluctuations amongst manufacturing firms located in the UK, both domestic and multinational, and whether there are further differences when we compare multinational enterprises (MNEs) from different origins. The effect of exchange rates on the exports of UK firms is of interest given the high levels of exposure to foreign direct investment (FDI): in our data 47.2 % of employment and 47.8 % of sales is accounted for by foreign firms. In general we would anticipate that MNEs have greater scope to deal with exchange rate fluctuations. Some of these instruments, such as hedging in forward markets, leading and lagging payables and receivables and diversification across export markets, are in principle available to all firms, although their access might be easier for large firms such as MNEs. Other strategies, such as holding a portfolio of assets and liabilities in different currencies and transfer pricing will be more specific to MNEs.Footnote 4
 There might also be reasons to anticipate differences across MNEs. As Clark et al. (2004) discuss, one reason why exports may be affected by exchange rate changes stems from the fact that firms cannot quickly adjust factor inputs to optimally take account of any relative price changes. MNEs, because they produce in multiple locations, are better able to exploit these temporary shifts in relative price however. Since Vernon (1966), Kogut (1983, 1985), and Caves (1996) it has been understood that MNEs may shift sourcing or production decisions across their plants in order to exploit differences in competitiveness that follow from a change in the exchange rate movements. We use this argument as motivation to compare the export response of firms whose primary motive for locating within the UK is market seeking (horizontal FDI) with those who use the UK to serve a broader set of countries (export platform FDI). Following evidence from Kneller and Pisu (2004) and Girma et al. (2008) we assume that MNEs from outside of the EU likely choose the UK for export platform FDI motives, whereas for those acquisitions by MNEs already inside the EU horizontal motives are likely to be stronger. Where tariff jumping motives are a dominant factor in a location decision, i.e. firms from outside of EU, exchange rate risk becomes second-order importance and the response of their exports may be quite similar to domestic firms. By contrast, UK-based affiliates of MNEs from inside the EU, motivated to undertake FDI to be close to centres of demand, have a greater incentive to use the (temporary) cost advantage offered by favourable exchange rate movements to change the marginal production decisions across their affiliates within the EU. From the perspective of the multinational group as a whole, this strategy would tend to increase the export responsiveness to exchange rate changes of affiliates based in the UK.Footnote 5
 Again, the UK provides a potentially interesting context to compare these differences: it is a member of the EU, but not a member of the euro zone. Both types of FDI are prominent within our data. Around 35 % of the observations on foreign firms are multinationals from other EU countries, similar to the proportion of observations of US and Canadian multinationals (36.5 %), while Japan and South Korea account for a further 6 %. Using data for UK manufacturing firms between 1988 and 2004, we find that across all types of firms, movements of exchange rate levels have little effect on export participation firms decisions but do have a significant and negative impact on export intensity after entry. They affect the intensive but not extensive margin of exports. However we find that there are differences according to country of origin of the foreign multinational. Consistent with the view that MNEs from other European countries have a greater incentive to shift production across the affiliates in response to an exchange rate change, we find that those from outside of Europe are affected by exchange rate changes to a similar extent to domestically owned firms, whereas multinationals from inside of Europe are more affected. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the theoretical and empirical background. Section 3 deals with some estimation and econometric issues. Section 4 introduces our method for computing industry-specific real effective exchange rates (REERs), and presents the firm level data and sample used to estimate the model. Section 5 reports our empirical findings. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",5

148,3,Review of World Economics,26 May 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0126-1,The gains from variety in the European Union,September 2012,Lukas Mohler,Michael Seitz,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The European Union (EU) with its 27 member states today constitutes the largest single market in the world. Over the past decade, several historical events have deepened the economic integration of economies within Europe but also of EU member states into the world economy. First, the euro was introduced as book money in 1999 and today is the official currency of 17 EU member states. Second, the transition of the Eastern European economies from planned economies to market economies after the fall of the Iron Curtain was accompanied by a surge and redirection of trade flows towards the “old” member states as well as a strong increase of trade between Eastern European countries themselves. This transition led to the eastern enlargement in 2004, when ten new member states joined the EU, followed by Romania and Bulgaria in 2007. Finally, the EU and its member states were confronted with the integration of fast-growing emerging markets into the world trading system over the last decade, with China and other East Asian economies at the forefront. These dynamic processes of economic integration were paralleled by a strong increase in trade flows for most member states. From 1999 to 2008 the total value of imports for all EU countries combined has more than doubled. This surge in trade flows was accompanied by an increase in the number of imported product varieties available to consumers. The establishment of new trade linkages (new goods and new trading partners) raised this number of imported varieties by 18 %, a value that suggests large gains for consumers as a result of newly available products. In this contribution, we adopt the methodology of Feenstra (1994) and Broda and Weinstein (2006) to structurally estimate the gains from imported variety for all 27 EU member states for the period from 1999 to 2008. We explore a rich data set of highly disaggregated trade data at the 8-digit level of the Combined Nomenclature product classification (CN). The effects on consumer welfare of newly available products are particularly interesting with regard to EU economies, since the EU consists of several small and medium-sized economies with a high degree of political and economic integration within the EU as well as within the world economy. In addition, studying a variety of countries allows us to analyze and interpret results across different economies, adding another dimension to this approach. Our results can be summarized as follows. For most countries the gains from variety are positive. However, the results largely differ across member states. We identify three different groups of economies. First, for the largest four members of the EU (in terms of GDP), the impact of imported variety is only slightly above zero or even negative for the considered period. This can be explained by small import shares and the fact that these economies were already well integrated within the EU and the world economy in 1999. Second, for the smaller “old” member states, we find modestly positive gains, all below 1 % of GDP. Third, for the “new” member states of the EU, with the exception of Malta, the gains from variety are strongly positive, mostly larger than 1 % of GDP. For example, variety gains in Latvia amount to 3.0 % of GDP, which is of the same magnitude as Broda and Weinstein (2006) find for the United States when examining the longer period from 1972 to 2001. Our results imply that especially for fast-growing, less-developed and smaller countries, the establishment of new trade linkages are an important source of trade-based welfare gains. When we split up the gains regarding regions of origin, we find that for a typical country about 70 % of the gains stem from intra-EU trade, indicating the importance of the European integration process regarding trade flows and imported variety. Our paper mainly contributes to two strands of the empirical trade literature. We add to the literature on the “love for variety” motive, a key element of the “New Trade Theory” laid out in the theoretical models of Krugman (1979, 1980, 1981). Contributions on this subject include, for example, Feenstra (1992) who shows in a numerical example how trade barriers can affect the number of available products and reduce consumer welfare. Following this idea, Romer (1994) calibrates a model with fixed export costs and finds that a substantial reduction in trade barriers will lead to more exported varieties, resulting in an increase of GDP of up to 20 %. The first extensive empirical analysis of the variety gains from trade was done by Broda and Weinstein (2006). These authors extend the methodology developed by Feenstra (1994) to construct an artificial price index that measures the impact of traded varieties on consumer welfare. Using highly disaggregated trade data and the assumption that goods are differentiated across countries, they show that the growth in product variety has been an important source of welfare gains. Covering US import data from 1972 to 2001, their results suggest an upward bias in the conventional price index of the magnitude of 1.2 % per year, which translates into an overall effect of 2.6 % of GDP for the overall period. Put differently, consumers are willing to pay roughly 0.1 % of their annual income to gains access to a larger set of goods and varieties. Similarly, and based on previous work by Klenow and Rodríguez-Clare (1997), Arkolakis et al. (2008) analyze how trade liberalization in Costa Rica has affected product variety and consumer welfare. They find, however, that the welfare increase after trade liberalization via an extended product variety set is very limited, since new products are imported in small quantities.
Footnote 1 In summary, some empirical evidence on the variety gains from trade exists; it is, however, restricted to very few country analyses. With our contribution, we add results for 27 countries to this literature. While the European integration process has attracted substantial interest in the literature, the analysis of EU trade flows, and in particular of their positive effects on consumer welfare, has been scarce. In the European trade literature three prominent lines can be identified. First, several studies have tried to quantify the positive effect of the introduction of the euro on trade: see Baldwin (2006) for a survey. Second, researchers have studied the effect of European integration and the role of national borders on intra-EU trade flows, including Nitsch (2000) and Chen (2004). Third, Buch and Piazolo (2001) and Manchin and Pinna (2009) study the implications of the Eastern European enlargement in 2004 on growth and the redirection of trade flows towards the EU. All these studies rely on aggregated trade data. A notable exception is Funke and Ruhwedel (2005) who provide an empirical analysis of disaggregated trade data on export variety and economic growth in Eastern European countries and find a high correlation between increased imported variety and economic growth.
Footnote 2 However, none of the papers in this literature dealing with Europe covers the potential effect of variety changes on consumer welfare. This is at the heart of our contribution. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the data set and provide detailed descriptive statistics on the number of imported varieties for all the member states. Section 3 briefly reviews the methodology developed by Feenstra (1994) and Broda and Weinstein (2006) to account for variety changes in import price indices, and Sect. 4 presents the results for the 27 members of the EU. Also, several robustness checks are carried out. Section 5 concludes.",14
148,3,Review of World Economics,13 March 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0122-5,Bilateral trade impacts of temporary foreign visitor policy,September 2012,Mahmut Yasar,David Lisner,Roderick M. Rejesus,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The main mechanism used by most countries, including the United States (US), to control the influx of foreign nationals into their borders is a national visa policy. Individuals from foreign countries wishing to enter the US are typically required to obtain a visa from a US consulate in their country (or another country) as a condition for entry. Visas are essentially documents that are attached to an individual’s passport and serves as a formal request to enter a particular country, like the US, as a temporary (non-immigrant) or permanent (immigrant) visitor.Footnote 1 Temporary visitors are those individuals wishing to enter the country on a temporary basis for a specific purpose like business and tourism, but still maintain permanent residence in their home country. Permanent visitors are those individuals wanting to seek permanent residence in the US. The visa waiver program (VWP) allows nationals from certain countries to enter the US as temporary visitors, for business or tourism purposes, without first obtaining a visa from a US consulate abroad. Temporary visitors from non-VWP countries, in contrast, must first obtain a visa from Department of State (DOS) officers at a consular post abroad before coming to the US. The VWP constitutes one of a few exceptions under the US Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) in which foreign nationals are admitted into the US without a valid visa (see the Appendix for a detailed description of the VWP). In 2006, 15.3 million visitors entered the United States under this program, constituting 51% of all overseas visitors. By eliminating the visa requirement, the VWP program facilitates international travel and commerce and eases consular office workloads abroad, but it also bypasses the first step by which foreign visitors are screened for admissibility to enter the US. More importantly, the VWP program expedites the travel of foreign businessmen to the US and, consequently, makes it potentially easier for foreign businessmen to foster trade relationships with US firms (see Poole 2010, for example). The influx of tourists from VWP countries may also facilitate trade by making the foreign visitors aware of the products and services available in the US that can be exported abroad. However, the reduction of the “visa barrier” to foreign entry has been hampered by important security concerns that stem from increasingly widespread international terrorist events (i.e., 9–11 terrorist attack in New York, transit bombings in London) and occurrence of disease epidemics (i.e., avian flu influenza, mad cow disease, swine flu, etc.). There are also concerns of temporary visitors “overstaying” and becoming illegal immigrants in the US. The desire to increase the flow of foreign business travelers and tourists to potentially increase commerce and trade volume has to be balanced with the need to restrict entry due to security concerns and illegal immigration issues. The objective of this study is to determine the ex post bilateral trade impact of the VWP. Intuitively, since the VWP facilitates international business travel and commerce, one would expect a priori that the VWP should positively impact bilateral trade levels between the US and the VWP countries. This is the hypothesis we are interested in testing. Investigating the bilateral trade impact of the VWP is important to national policymakers because it will allow them to better gauge the economic benefits from a less restrictive visa policy for temporary visitors and be able to weigh those benefits against the cost in terms of increased risks associated with security and illegal immigration. If it is shown that a less restrictive visa policy for temporary visitors (such as the VWP) does not contribute significantly to bilateral trade, then the government may need to rethink whether a more lenient visa policy for certain countries should continue in light of increasing security and illegal immigration concerns. Furthermore, a strong positive trade effect of a temporary business immigration policy provides another economic justification for the continued existence and maintenance of this particular visa policy. There have been a number of studies that have consistently shown a strong positive relationship between permanent immigration and bilateral trade for several different countries.Footnote 2 But no study specifically investigated the effect of a less restrictive visa policy for temporary visitors, like the VWP, on bilateral trade. Head and Ries (1998) examined the effect of entrepreneur and business class immigration (e.g., investors and self-employed individuals) on trade and found a small but statistically insignificant effect. Note, however, that Head and Ries (1998) explored the bilateral trade effects of permanent (rather than temporary) entrepreneurs and/or businessmen. Hence, this article contributes to the literature by focusing on the bilateral trade effects of a less restrictive visa policy for temporary visitors (nonimmigrants), instead of permanent visitors (immigrants). In addition, this study also contributes to the recent literature on the effects of face-to-face business interactions on bilateral trade. Several recent studies have argued that face-to-face visits of government officials and/or high-level business people from one country to another country (or countries) can probably contribute to increased trade levels between them. For example, Nitsch (2007) has shown that state and official visits by government officials are indeed positively correlated with exports (but not so much with imports). Presence of foreign embassies and foreign business agencies that facilitate face-to-face interactions between business people have also been shown to increase trade (see Rose 2007; Gil-Pareja et al. 2008). Head and Ries (2010), however, did not find any evidence of a statistically significant trade increasing effect from trade missions that facilitate interactions with foreign officials and businessmen. Since the VWP program facilitates face-to-face interactions of businessmen, this study also provides evidence on whether improved face-to-face interactions affects trade. We use country-level panel data to examine whether the VWP results in higher bilateral trade levels between the US and the VWP countries. Various econometric estimation strategies that control for dynamics, zero values in the data, and selection issues were used in the analysis, including a “random growth” specification that not only allows one to control for selection based on time-invariant unobserved country-specific characteristics, but also control time-varying unobserved characteristics that influence VWP designation and trade outcome changes. Results from the analysis indicate positive and statistically significant effects of VWP on US exports to VWP countries. The effect of VWP on US imports is positive in all specifications, but it is not as strong as the impact on exports. Thus, the findings from our empirical analysis suggest that the VWP program tend to encourage business travel and commerce that leads to strong trade effects. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the theoretical basis of the relationship between bilateral trade and temporary foreign visitor policy. Section three discusses the country-level data used in the study. The empirical specification is presented in the fourth section and the estimation strategy is described in the fifth section. Results of the empirical analysis are presented in the sixth section. Concluding comments are provided in the last section.",6
148,3,Review of World Economics,19 February 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0120-7,A regime-switching analysis of pass-through,September 2012,Kolver Hernandez,Aslı Leblebicioğlu,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"There is a growing empirical literature that documents the decline in exchange rate pass-through elasticities in various industries and for a number of countries—see, for example, Campa and Goldberg (2005) for OECD countries, Frankel et al. (2005) for a large set of developed and developing countries, and Marazzi and Sheets (2007) for the US economy. Even though there is a consensus on the implications of the decline in the pass-through for adjustments of external imbalances and monetary policy, the sources of the decline are not fully established by empirical studies. Theoretical studies suggest a number of economic fundamentals that determine an exporting firm’s optimal degree of exchange rate pass-through. While some of the studies focus on product- or industry-specific characteristics, others highlight the role of macroeconomic conditions. Some of the product- and/or industry-specific factors that have been studied are substitutability of the export good—e.g., Giovannini (1988), Donnenfeld and Zilcha (1991), Friberg (1998), Goldberg and Tille (2008)—; competitive conditions in foreign markets—e.g., Krugman (1987), Froot and Klemperer (1989)—; strategic complementarities and the market share of the exporting country—e.g., Feenstra et al. (1996), Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2005), Bodnar et al. (2002). The macroeconomic variables that have been theoretically identified as important factors affecting the degree of pass-through are exchange rate volatility and inflation—Taylor (2000), Devereux et al. (2004). As one or more of these factors vary across time for different exporters, the pricing policies of exports can change altering the degree of exchange rate pass-through. The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate how macroeconomic, product- and industry-specific characteristics affect the pricing policies of exporters, in particular their impact over time on the pass-through elasticities. Empirically assessing how these economic factors affect the optimal degree of exchange rate pass-through within the same framework requires the use of disaggregated data. Accordingly, we use a panel data set of 35 automobile models imported to the United States from 7 exporting countries, for the 1980–2004 period. We choose to work with data from the US automotive industry due to the availability of detailed information on import prices, as well as the industry characteristics and the source country. The challenge in disentangling different factors behind the changes in the pass-through of exchange rate shocks (and other shocks in general), is that as economic factors change over time, the general pricing policies of exporters, rather than solitary changes in the pass-through elasticity, might change. Hence, one needs to draw inferences about the general optimal pricing rule that the exporters follow jointly with the underlying economic fundamentals that can affect the choice of the pricing rule itself. For that reason, we consider the hidden regime-switching methodology by Hamilton (1990), (1996), and its later extension by Diebold et al. (1993) as the econometric framework to build inferences about the underlying fundamentals that determine the choice of the pricing policy, and to simultaneously estimate the elasticities of the pricing policies. We start, in Sect. 2, by formulating a theoretical export pricing equation, which provides us with the pricing equation to estimate, and it also illustrates how different exchange rate pass-through elasticities will imply different response coefficients on the other determinants of export prices, such as the marginal cost pass-through or the elasticity with respect to the price of competitors. The key assumption to obtain our result is to allow for a non-constant elasticity of demand. In the special case of a constant elasticity of demand, the exchange rate pass-through coefficient is independent of the other elasticities in the pricing equation. In particular, we assume that the elasticity of the exporter’s demand is function of a subset of the determinants of the demand function. Then, in Sect. 3, we build an empirical regime-switching framework that incorporates our theoretical pricing equation as follows. We assume that, contingent on the state of the economy, an exporter chooses one out of two possible pricing policies labeled “high pass-through” and “low pass-through” policies. The pricing policies are characterized by two different sets of parameters; that is, we allow for differences not only on the exchange rate pass-through but also in the other elasticities. The economic fundamentals that lead to the adoption of the “low” or “high” pass-through policy are the ones discussed in the literature on the determinants of the optimal choice of the exchange rate pass-through. In particular we consider monetary stability, market concentration and exporting country’s market share. Since we only observe the announced price, but do not observe the pricing regime that it comes from, we follow the regime-switching methodology of Diebold et al. (1993) to jointly estimate the parameters in the two pricing equations, as well as the probability of being in one regime versus the other. In turn, the estimated probabilities depend on the economic fundamentals mentioned above. The estimated sets of coefficients of the pricing equations capture the average elasticities in a high pass-through versus a low pass-through environment. The estimated probabilities show which factors are significant in determining the degree of pass-through. Furthermore, analyzing the evolution in those factors, we investigate their role in the changes over time in the average exchange rate pass-through implied by the model. Section 4 details our data set which consists of a total 35 automobile models from 7 exporting countries, which we have collected from the Ward’s Automotive Yearbooks for the 1980–2004 period. For each model we observe the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, the number of units imported into the United States, physical characteristics of the specific model, and the location of assembly for the units sold in the United States. The manufacturer’s suggested retail price is the price at the port of entry; thus, the exchange rate pass-through coefficients that we estimate are at-the-dock rates.
Footnote 1 The manufacturer’s suggested retail price captures the behavior of exporters more accurately than the transaction prices, since the transaction prices are set in part by the dealer.
Footnote 2 Similar catalog prices have been used by Gron and Swenson (1996) for the US market, and by Goldberg and Verboren (2001) and Goldberg and Verboren (2005) for the European market. The manufacturers’ suggested retail prices are net of local taxes, transportation costs, and optional equipment added by the dealer that may contain domestic components. Moreover, they do not include variations due to dealers’ discriminatory practices—see e.g., Goldberg (1996). We present the results from our estimations in Sect. 5. Our estimations suggest that the low pass-through (high pass-through) regime is characterized by: (i) a low (higher) annual exchange rate pass-through elasticity of between 10 and 15% depending upon the specification (of between 21 and 24%); (ii) lower (higher) sensitivity to changes in the industry price index, with an elasticity of 50–62% across specifications (between 85 and 92%); (iii) lower (higher) volatility of the unobservable shocks of about only 1% of the volatility in the high pass-through regime; and (iv) longer (shorter) average duration of the adoption of the pricing policy; once a firm adopts the low pass-through pricing policy it keeps it for between 2 years and 4 months and 3 years and 6 months (between 1 year and 10 months and 2 years and 7 months). These findings are robust to including different variables in the transition probabilities. Our study contributes to the literature that analyzes exchange rate pass-through at the product level by quantifying and comparing the relative importance of industry-specific and macroeconomic variables in the adoption of pricing policies of exporters. While there are a large number of studies that look at the decline in the pass-through at the aggregate level, there are relatively fewer studies that analyze pass-through at the product level.
Footnote 3 Recent examples of studies that use product-specific prices to analyze pass-through at the good level include Frankel et al. (2005), Hellerstein (2008), and Nakamura and Zerom (2010). The latter two papers focus on markup adjustments, local costs and barriers to price adjustments in the beer and coffee industries, respectively. Frankel et al. (2005) use data on imports of eight narrowly defined goods for a large sample of countries, and study the importance of macroeconomic and country-specific factors in explaining the changes in the pass-through. Similarly, our focus is on the changes in the exporter’s pass-through decisions and the underlying economic factors that lead to those changes in analyzing the decline in the exchange rate pass-through. The novelty in our approach, together with our data, further allows us to quantify the effects of industry-specific and macroeconomic determinants on the decline of the exchange rate pass-through (see Fig. 6) and to provide a horse-race between them. We show that the inflation rate in the United States, volatility of the exchange rate, the exporting country’s market share, and market concentration (measured by the Herfindahl index of the industry) are all statistically significant factors in explaining the adoption of alternative pricing polices (“low” vs. “high” pass-through policies). However, when we decompose the changes in the pass-through to investigate the contribution of each factor in the downward trend of the exchange rate pass-through, we find that monetary stability has been the most important factor behind the decline. Monetary stability explains more than 50% of the decline in the exchange rate pass-through, while country market share and market concentration explain about 25 and 10%, respectively.",2

A popular view among politicians and economists is that the pro-competitive effects of increased international trade in product and labour markets should make wages more sensitive to firm-specific conditions (see, for example, Flanagan 1999: 1169–1170). As a result, increased international markets integration should be associated with more decentralised wage bargaining institutions (see, for example, Katz 1993). This hypothesis is labelled as the “rent-seeking view”. More recently, it has been argued that the process of European integration and the adoption of the euro should encourage structural labour market reforms favouring further wage decentralisation in the EU (see Bertola 2010). One possible theoretical explanation for these effects of integration on centralisation is provided by Calmfors (2001). Calmfors argues that the degree of centralisation stems from a negotiation between employers and unions. Employers prefer decentralisation over centralisation, because the former is likely to increase both the level and the employers’ share of product market rents. Trade integration, by improving the employers’ conflict payoff in such a negotiation, will increase the likelihood that more decentralised wage bargaining institutions will be observed in equilibrium. However, the existing empirical evidence on the correlation between centralisation and integration suggests a different story. Agell (1999, 2002) considers macroeconomic cross-country data for 20 OECD countries and shows that more open economies on average are associated with more centralised wage bargaining institutions. Agell measures centralisation by using the Calmfors and Driffill (1988) centralisation ranking. The economic explanation for this less conventional result is based on a social insurance argument, which is akin to Rodrik’s (1998) explanation of why more open economies have bigger governments and/or a bigger share of public sector employment. The argument runs as follows. As long as more open economies are more prone to external shocks, the fraction of the workforce facing uncertainty about their future position in the wage distribution is higher in these economies. If workers are risk-averse, more open economies will be characterised by a higher demand for insurance against the risk of excessive wage variability. But as long as more centralised wage bargaining institutions lead to a bigger compression of the wage distribution, this increased demand for wage insurance will be satisfied by more wage centralisation. As a result, openness and centralisation will be positively correlated. This hypothesis is labelled as the “social insurance view”. This paper aims at showing that the popular rent-seeking view described above may be actually consistent with the data, at least if using macroeconomic yearly panel data for a sample of 17 OECD countries over the 1975–2000 period. In particular, this paper measures the degree of wage centralisation by using the time-varying bargaining level (BL) index computed by Golden et al. (2006). To preview the main results, the paper shows that the correlation between the degree of centralisation and the degree of trade openness, which is interpreted as a two-way trade proxy measure of international trade integration, is negative. This result is robust to alternative estimation methods and when controlling for the potential endogeneity of the degree of openness. The paper is organised as follows. The next section presents the main results based on linear estimation methods. Section 3 presents the results of random ordered probit estimates that, given the ordinal nature of the dependent variable, seem the appropriate estimation method to be used with panel data. Section 4 concludes with final remarks.",1
148,4,Review of World Economics,12 July 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0133-2,"Pricing to market, firm heterogeneity and the role of quality",December 2012,Roberto Basile,Sergio de Nardis,Alessandro Girardi,Male,Male,Male,Male,"A bulk of empirical evidence shows that exporting firms change the price of their goods according to destination markets. In search for causes of price differentiation, analysts have long focused on exchange rate shifts. Dornbusch (1987) investigates pricing strategies drawing on models of industrial organization, while Krugman (1987) formalizes the concept of pricing to market (PTM). Both in general—(Betts and Devereux 1996; Corsetti et al. 2005) and partial-equilibrium models (Baldwin 1988; Marston 1990), it is presumed that firms differentiate markups and prices in destination markets as an optimal response to fundamental changes in market-specific competitive pressures (epitomized by exchange-rate movements). Since PTM behaviour is by now common wisdom for international economists, an interesting question is how this consolidated proposition relates to the literature on firm heterogeneity and international trade: does the fact that firms are heterogeneous in productivity exert any influence on their capacity to modify prices according to markets? In this paper we investigate this issue. Our contribution is threefold: (i) we uncover the PTM behaviour of exporters that is implicit in one of the basic models of firm heterogeneity and international trade, (ii) we show that PTM policies take place not only in reaction to shifts in price competition, but also in response to movements in non-price competitiveness factors, such as taste for quality of consumers in destination markets, (iii) we point out that provided quality has a role there is heterogeneity in firms’ capability to move prices in response to market-specific competitive shocks, in the sense that higher-quality producers are able to practice PTM more than lower-quality firms. The issue of PTM and firm heterogeneity has been addressed by some recent works. Atkeson and Burstein (2008) use a nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) demand system where markup is variable on the assumption that goods are more substitutable within a sector than between sectors. This model gives rise to heterogeneity of firms’ pricing behaviour as markups respond to changes in firms’ market shares in destination markets. Also Berman et al. (2009) consider a standard constant-elasticity Dixit–Stiglitz framework. In this model, variability of markup in destination markets is ensured by country-specific distribution costs. The latter make perceived demand elasticity variable according to markets and dependent on firm heterogeneity: high performance firms perceive lower demand elasticity and can practice PTM more than the low performance ones. Firm-level pricing policies are studied under perfect competition by Auer and Chaney (2008). In their model producers sell goods of different quality content to consumers with heterogeneous preferences for quality. Exchange rate shocks lead to incomplete exchange-rate pass-through and heterogeneous price responses: high-quality firms limit the pass-through of exchange rate more than the low-quality ones. Incomplete exchange rate pass-through at the firm level is also pointed out by Rodriguez-Lopez (2011) who adopts a monopolistic competition model with heterogeneous producers and endogenous markups. In the benchmark case of continuum-goods version of the translog expenditure function, this author finds that more productive firms are actually able to set higher markups, but adjust them proportionally less than less productive firms. This result, which contrasts with formerly quoted works, is confirmed in the quality-augmented version of the model as least capable exporters absorb a higher proportion of exchange rate shocks in their markups. However, such a finding proves sensitive to the choice of the preference function, as quite an opposite result (lower pass-through for higher productivity/capability firms) is obtained with quasi-linear-quadratic utility function. A different route is followed in our work. We consider the more general framework of endogenous distribution of market-specific markups delivered by the model of Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) (MO henceforth), where price differentiation and PTM arise as natural outcomes of the basic setting. Besides making explicit the influence of exchange rates in diversifying price-setting in domestic and foreign markets, we modify the framework proposed by MO along two directions: (i) consumers are characterized not only by preference for variety, but also by love for quality, so that their utility rises with quality-augmented quantities of differentiated varieties, (ii) such preferences are not uniform across markets, but vary from one country to another. The way we treat country-specific quality taste is similar to Hallak (2006), although we incorporate it in quite a different preference structure. Introduction of quality evaluation on the demand side implies a mechanism of quality generation on the supply side. We adopt the simple rule proposed by Baldwin and Harrigan (2007), featuring a direct link between marginal cost and quality content of varieties. Such a quality generation mechanism works as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for price differentiation. A single variety has the same quality content wherever it is sold; what matters is that consumers in different countries have different valuations of quality attributes. This approach shares with endogenous-quality models (e.g. Antoniades 2008) the basic prediction that, in presence of quality improvement, prices increase with productivity. Kneller and Yu (2008) propose a model similar to ours: quality is added to the MO preference structure and is generated on the supply side by the Baldwin–Harrigan rule. However, they do not allow for different quality preferences in destination countries and leave unspecified the parameterization of cost distribution. Both features are instead central in our model. The framework we propose allows us to derive a whole range of empirically testable responses to market-specific changes in price and non-price (quality) competition factors. As price competition becomes tougher in a destination market, due to exchange-rate appreciation or lower price of competitors, firms reduce their markup and fob price in that market, in line with PTM predictions of open-economy models. As for quality factors, we show that, when consumers’ tastes for quality rise, firms may either increase or reduce prices in the relevant destination market, depending on the relative quality of their products with respect to competitors. If quality is higher, the rise of consumers’ quality preference causes a reduction of demand elasticity and an increase of price in the relevant market. If it is lower, demand elasticity gets larger and the low-quality firm responds by reducing the price practiced in the destination market. Firm heterogeneity influences the fob-price variation depending on quality variables. When quality has no role, we are in the basic MO case: price differentiation in reaction to price-competition shocks is independent of producers’ heterogeneity. Firm heterogeneity becomes relevant for price setting when quality matters as price responses to tougher price competition are stronger for those firms producing higher quality goods. A similar finding is in Rodriguez-Lopez (2011) when the benchmark translog expenditure function is replaced by a MO preference structure. As for reaction to rise in quality tastes, the positive response of prices practiced by above-the-average firms is larger for producers selling top-quality goods; the negative price response of below-the-average firms may be less or more negative, depending on the distance of the firm from the average quality of competitors and the intensity of quality tastes of consumers. We test the model against data on Italian firms, making use of a longitudinal survey-data set which gives consistent information on the pricing policy pursued by the firm (the margin between the price charged in foreign markets and the price practiced domestically), the price and quality competition factors faced by the firm in international markets, plus several firm-level controls. Estimation results document that export-domestic price margins are significantly affected by price and quality competitiveness factors even controlling for foreign and domestic demand conditions, export intensity, destination markets and unobservables. A random parameter specification gives also support to the hypothesis that, when quality matters, there is heterogeneity in the pricing behaviour of firms, with the higher-quality ones endowed with more market power and able to react in their price setting more strongly to modification in price and quality competition in destination markets. The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we introduce the theoretical framework used to model pricing behaviour of firms. Data set characteristics are illustrated in Sect. 3. Section 4 reports the empirical specification and estimation results. Section 5 concludes.",6

First, there seems to be a large home bias in trade. And second, real exchange rates seem to be much more volatile, and deviations from the purchasing power parity (PPP) more persistent than justifiable by economic theory. The amount of the unexplained missing trade, size and persistence of the PPP deviations, and the factors influencing them are the subject of this text. “How is it possible to reconcile the extremely high short-term volatility of real exchange rates with the glacial rate…at which deviations from PPP seem to die out?” (Rogoff 1996, p. 664). The answer to this question is linked to the so-called law of one price (LOP), a disaggregated version of the PPP. The reason why the LOP should hold is that if it were possible to buy a particular good in one place, transport it to another place and still sell with profit, such arbitrages would tend to equalize the prices in both locations. It is not surprising that in a world of high transportation and other transaction costs the deviations from the LOP were large and very long-lived, as Volckart and Wolf (2006) show in their example of Medieval Europe. However, even today the functioning of the LOP is still very slow and imperfect with long-lasting price dispersion between states. A vast literature deals with this paradox, calling the unexplained part of price differentials a “border effect”, i.e. the impact of the existence of national borders on trade. The general conclusion is that there isn’t nearly as much international trade as the standard models suggest there should be, while the formal barriers such as various tariffs are too low to explain the revealed missing trade (Anderson 2000, p. 115). The first wave of studies in the second half of the 1990s only addressed the size of this border effect (Engel and Rogers 1996; McCallum 1995). Only recently have authors started to explain it, i.e. look for other explanatory variables in addition to transportation costs and reduce the extent of the unexplained residuum. Many authors estimate the size of the border effect and explain the role of various factors influencing cross-border price dispersion (Bergin and Glick 2007; Parsley and Wei 2007; Wolszczak-Derlacz 2008). The underlying idea in their studies is that arbitrage is a process which should automatically equalize the prices in different places once we remove the influence of these factors. However, arbitrage is an entrepreneurial activity and as such should be influenced by institutional quality. The reason is that low-quality institutions can impose prohibitive costs to arbitrage in the same way as large distances between cities or high tariffs. And contrary to, e.g. distance or language differences, the institutional quality is improvable making it potentially subject to economic policy. However, the role of institutions is completely neglected by existing literature on the border effect. The main hypothesis of this paper is that institutional quality significantly influences the extent of the price dispersion. In Section 2, I provide an overview of the existing literature and various approaches to border-effect analysis and present the existing results. In Sect. 3, I propose a theoretical explanation of the role of institutions in the functioning of the LOP. Section 4 describes the used data. In Sect. 5, I construct the price dispersion measures and point out their differences. In Sect. 6, I carry out a regression analysis to empirically assess the impact of several factors, including institutional quality on the cross-border price dispersion. Section 7 provides a number of robustness checks. I conclude in Sect. 8.",
148,4,Review of World Economics,22 July 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0135-0,Closure within multi-plant firms: evidence from Japan,December 2012,Richard Kneller,Danny McGowan,Toshiyuki Matsuura,Male,Male,Male,Male,"When large firms shut down production plants as part of their domestic or international restructuring, there are often severe local output and employment losses. There is as a consequence, considerable policy interest in understanding which plants are most at risk of closure by parent firms, with particular attention given to those plants owned by large multi-plant firms, such as multinational enterprises (MNEs). The goal of this paper is to provide evidence on plant closure within multi-plant firms, focusing on differences according to whether a firm is an MNE or non-MNE. Our starting points are twofold. Firstly, the view that plants owned by MNEs and/or multi-plant firms are somehow at greater risk of closure is not without foundation. A recurrent finding within the academic literature is that plants owned by MNEs and multi-plant firms are more likely to close down (Disney et al. 2003; Bernard and Jensen 2007; Lieberman 1990; Harrigan 1980; Baden-Fuller 1989). Secondly, it has been shown that plants belonging to multi-plant firms and MNEs are, relative to single-plant firms and non-MNEs, larger, more productive and more capital intensive. These are also factors which have been shown to be related to the probability of exit. We build on this evidence to investigate a related set of questions using Japanese data. We begin by trying to understand which matters more, the MNE or the multi-plant status of the firm. We also examine whether the likelihood of closure increases for multi-plant MNEs and non-MNEs when we condition on the effect that superior performance characteristics such as size and productivity have on plant closure. For these questions we build on similar evidence for other countries (see for example Bernard and Jensen 2002), and consider questions that are new to the literature, exploiting the rich information on the characteristics of firms and their plants available to us. We consider what plants owned by multi-plant MNEs and multi-plant non-MNEs are most at risk of closure. Does the size of a plant relative to the size of the firm raise the risk of closure for both types of firm for example, or does it matter if they are concentrated in industries facing high levels of competition from abroad, or produce products that are outside the firm’s core competencies? Our empirical evidence suggests that the perception that multi-plant firms, in particular multi-plant MNEs, are quicker to close down plants is not misplaced, and holds also when we condition on their generally superior performance characteristics. We find that there is a clear ordering of the likelihood of plant closure according to ownership structure. Relative to larger single-plant non-MNEs,Footnote 1 plants belonging to multi-plant MNEs are the most likely to be shut, followed by multi-plant non-MNEs and then single-plant MNEs. We find that these effects are quantitatively very large. Multi-plant MNEs, multi-plant non-MNE firms and single-plant MNE firms are 300, 130 and 60 % respectively more vulnerable to closure compared to single-plant non-MNEs. We also explore the type of plants that are shut by multi-plant firms. Within this we consider the relative characteristics of plants in comparison to the rest of the firm, but also the behaviour of multinationals with respect to other multi-plant firms that do not have overseas affiliates. We find strong similarity in the type of plants that are shut across multi-plant MNEs and non-MNEs.Footnote 2 Regardless of ownership structure, plants that are small are more likely to be closed. There are differences however. Domestic multi-plant firms are more likely to maintain plants that are capital intensive, whereas for MNEs these characteristics do not appear to matter. As identified above, in seeking explanations for the exit process within multi-plant firms, we build on a relatively small literature which has focused on the question of whether multi-plant firms are more likely to close plants compared to single plant firms (the first question we explore). A number of alternative explanations have been put forward to explain why plants owned by multi-plant firms are more likely to be closed. Lieberman (1990) argues that larger multi-plant firms are more likely to close plants in declining industries, whereas Harrigan (1980) and Baden-Fuller (1989) have argued that large, diversified firms encounter fewer agency problems when deciding upon plant closure. The role that plant characteristics relative to the rest of the firm have in shaping exit has received less attention. Here, even though greater diversity in what is produced within the plant relative to the rest of the firm is found to increase the probability that a plant will exit (Bernard and Jensen 2007), the multi-plant ownership effect remains. A similar result is found by Gibson and Harris (1996). Related to this is the idea that strategic interactions within multi-plant firms may be the source of the higher failure rates. When a multi-plant firm expands output, or cuts price to improve the profit of one of its plants, it generates a negative externality for the other plants within the group (Sutton 1997). A separate strand of literature has considered how ownership by a subset of multi-plant firms, namely MNEs, affects survival. Substantial evidence exists to support the view that MNEs are more likely to closedown plants, even when multi-plant status is taken into account. The regularity of these findings has been impressively robust across countries with similar evidence found for Sweden (Bandick 2010), Japan (Kimura and Kiyota 2006), Chile (Alvarez and Görg 2005) and the United States (Bernard and Jensen 2007). As a consequence of such evidence, MNEs have become labelled as ‘footloose’. The theories used to explain the ‘footloose’ nature of MNEs emphasise vertical over horizontal foreign direct investment (FDI) motives.Footnote 3 Under vertical FDI, MNEs change the geography of their production plants in response to changes in local costs (as in Antras and Helpman 2004). They e.g. relocate low-skill-intensive activities to countries that are low-skill abundant.Footnote 4 Empirically much of the literature has focused on the factors that make locations relatively more attractive, rather than linking those FDI decisions with the closure of production units in a different location.Footnote 5 The destination characteristics studied here have included the roles of taxation and agglomeration. Devereux and Griffith (1998) for example find that conditional on producing in Europe, industries with lower effective tax rates attract more US multinationals. Recent theories of economic geography suggest that firms within the same industry may also be regionally concentrated due to spillovers created by agglomeration effects. Evidence in support of these models can be found in Devereux and Griffith (1998) and Head et al. (1995). A smaller number of papers has focused on the consequences of outward FDI decisions for other aspects of the firm. Most closely associated with this paper is the work of Simpson (2008). Using data for the United Kingdom she finds that overseas investment in low-wage economies leads to changes in the structure of firms, including the closure of plants. These effects are found to be strongest for multinationals operating in low-skilled industries with affiliates located in low-skill-abundant countries, compared to firms in the same industry not investing in low-wage countries. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the data set we use. In Sect. 3 we investigate the magnitude of the effect of multi-plant and ownership status. Section 4 studies the determinants of exit within multi-plant firms. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Sect. 5.",
148,4,Review of World Economics,07 July 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0132-3,"Trade openness, real exchange rates and job reallocation: evidence from Belgium",December 2012,Italo Colantone,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In today’s global economy, domestic firms and workers in each country have become increasingly sensitive to international competition. This has induced the emergence of serious concerns about the labor market’s drawbacks of globalization. Such issues figure prominently in the agenda of policy makers around the world. A good illustration of this is the current political pressure, especially exerted by the US and the EU, towards a revaluation of the Chinese renminbi. Indeed, the Chinese government is accused of keeping the value of its currency deliberately undervalued, in order to grant Chinese firms a competitive advantage on the export markets. And yet, recent reports are showing that China has been displaying a substantial appreciation in real terms lately, due to the relatively high increase in wages, thus emphasizing the importance of looking at real exchange rates, besides nominal ones.
Footnote 1 This paper studies the impact of real exchange rate movements on net and gross job flows at the industry level, focusing on the manufacturing sector of Belgium, for the time span 1996–2002. In a context of increasing trade openness, firms are expected to become more responsive to variations in real exchange rates, which reflect the relative prices of competing goods on the international markets (Gourinchas 1998). Indeed, real exchange rates can be seen as synthetic indicators of the competitiveness of domestic firms relative to their foreign competitors. In particular, real exchange rates are influenced by the evolution of nominal exchange rates and by the relative price dynamics across countries. Thus, they capture the influence of monetary policy and currency trading on the financial market, but also the effects of relative costs and productivity dynamics, which are finally reflected in prices. Until now, only a few papers have studied the relation between real effective exchange rates and job flows: Gourinchas (1998, 1999) on the US and France, respectively, Klein et al. (2003a) on the US, and Moser et al. (2010) on Germany. All these studies have found that real appreciations have a negative impact on net employment growth, and that this impact is magnified by increasing levels of trade exposure, at the firm and industry level. However, differences have been found with respect to the adjustment process, which may work mainly through lower job creation (France and Germany) or through higher job destruction (US), depending on the specific context. Building on this literature, this paper aims at deepening our understanding of the impact of real effective exchange rates on job flows, by focusing, for the first time, on a small open economy such as Belgium. Belgium constitutes a very interesting case study for this research question. Indeed, it is one of the most open economies in the world, and has experienced the highest increase in trade exposure among the EU countries over the considered period.
Footnote 2 Moreover it is characterized by strong labor market rigidities, which are typical of EU continental economies.
Footnote 3 Finally, very good data are available at the firm level for the Belgian manufacturing sector, allowing to carry a micro-founded analysis by relying on a large data set.
Footnote 4
 The empirical analysis is based on the theoretical model by Klein et al. (2003a), where job flows are put in relation with industry-specific real exchange rate (RER) changes and openness to trade. The main prediction of the model is that a real appreciation induces lower job creation and higher job destruction at the industry level, and these effects are stronger the higher is the level of trade exposure in the industry. The main findings of my analysis can be summarized as follows. First, I find that real appreciations do have a negative impact on net employment growth, and this impact increases with the level of trade exposure. Second, concerning the margin of adjustment, the net employment effect is driven by an increase in job destruction, while job creation is not significantly affected. This result is robust to using different measures of job flows, and is stable across a number of different estimations. Such evidence of a job destruction-driven adjustment is in line with earlier findings by Klein et al. (2003a) for the US, and differs from what has been found for other European countries, in particular France (Gourinchas 1999) and Germany (Moser et al. 2010), where the adjustment to RER shocks was mainly driven by the job creation margin. Moser et al. (2010) attributed the difference between the US and Germany to the far-stricter employment protection legislation in Germany, which makes firing costly and thus prevents smooth adjustments to shocks through job destruction. The same explanation could be proposed for France, where employment protection is also high. And yet, according to the OECD Index for the Strictness of Employment Protection, the Belgian labor market displays a level of rigidity in line with Germany and France, and thus much higher than the US one (OECD 2004).
Footnote 5 Hence, differences in labor market institutions are not likely to explain the different findings for Belgium on one hand, and France and Germany on the other. In my interpretation, these different findings are consistent with Belgium being a small open economy. Indeed, Belgian firms are operating in a much smaller domestic market than French or German firms, and they face, on average, much higher levels of trade exposure. As a result, they are forced to be more reactive to shocks hitting their international competitiveness. This may explain why Belgian firms adjust through the job destruction margin when they face a real exchange rate shock. In fact, even though destroying jobs can be costly for the firms, due to the strictness of employment protection, the cost of failing to adjust timely to the shock may be even higher in a small open economy. Overall, this highlights the importance of studying the effects of RER changes on job flows in different contexts, where results can be significantly different. Analyzing the case of a small open economy constitutes the main contribution of this study. As previously mentioned, this paper builds upon previous work by Gourinchas (1988, 1999), Klein et al. (2003a) and Moser et al. (2010). More generally, it is related to the growing body of literature on the connections between international trade and the labor market, as reviewed by Klein et al. (2003b) and Crino’ (2009). Several studies have explored the impact of increasing foreign competition on net employment growth at the industry level. Net job losses have been found to be induced by lower import prices and RER appreciations in open industrialized economies.
Footnote 6 More recently, other papers have started to study the implications of trade also on gross job creation and destruction flows.
Footnote 7 Focusing on gross flows is important for assessing the adjustment costs implied by increasing trade integration, as resources get reallocated to their most productive uses. Indeed, trade-related adjustment costs are likely to be proportional to gross flows rather than net ones. Moreover, the same net variation in employment might be generated by different combinations of job creation and job destruction, with potentially diverse welfare implications, as discussed by Klein et al. (2003a, b).
Footnote 8 Consistently, this paper focuses on the impact of RER movements both on net and on gross job flows. My analysis starts in Sect. 2.1 with the computation of job flows, following the methodology developed by Davis and Haltiwanger (1992). In Sect. 2.2, I turn to the analysis of trade exposure at the industry level. In Sect. 2.3, I discuss the computation of real effective exchange rates, following the approach by Gourinchas (1998, 1999) and Klein et al. (2003a). In Sect. 3, I present a descriptive analysis of the correlations between job flows, trade exposure and RER movements. In Sect. 4, I first sketch the theoretical model by Klein et al. (2003a), focusing on its main predictions; then, I present the econometric analysis, and discuss the results. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",6

148,4,Review of World Economics,20 June 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0130-5,Specialization dynamics and natural resources abundance,December 2012,Roberto Álvarez,J. Rodrigo Fuentes,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Theoretical models in international trade aim to understand which factors determine a country’s comparative advantage. One interesting empirical issue is to study how comparative advantage evolves over time and which factors are responsible for these changes. The neoclassical trade model generates predictions, but few empirical papers have analyzed these implications. Leamer (1987) has extended the neoclassical model to consider a third production factor—natural resources—in a model with n goods, but the empirical part of his work only exploits cross-country differences in factor endowments. Schott (2003) has analyzed the existence of different diversification cones, i.e., countries specializing in different product mixes, but his work also only considers a cross-section of countries. These cross-section analyses are useful for understanding how a labor-abundant country, for example, China, changes its specialization patterns once it reaches similar endowments as a capital-rich country, such as Germany. However, there is little evidence for which countries have actually changed their specialization patterns in that direction. How likely are these changes to take place? In what types of goods? How important is natural resources abundance for specialization dynamics? Does the type of natural resources abundance matter? These and other similar questions have received little attention in the empirical trade literature. Some exceptions have been Proudman and Redding (2000) and Redding (2002), which analyze trade specialization dynamics. These two works, however, have not analyzed an important issue, the role of natural resources abundance in driving or retarding changes in comparative advantage. In this paper we are particularly interested in studying how resources abundance affects the chances of gaining comparative advantage in manufacturing. This is in line with Leamer (1987), which shows that it could be particularly difficult for resource-abundant countries to achieve a comparative advantage in manufactured goods. We contribute to this literature by distinguishing among three types of resources abundance: mineral, forest, and agricultural. Previous works on this area have used a narrow definition of resource-abundance by focusing only on differences in arable or other forms of land (Leamer 1987; Schott 2003). Our focus on manufactured goods and natural resources abundance is motivated by several concerns regarding the bad performance of resource-abundant countries. One very influential idea on this issue was initially proposed by Singer (1950) and Prebisch (1950) which argued that the negative consequences of commodity specialization was because of the secular deterioration in the international prices of these goods. More recently, the so-called natural resources curse has revived the debate on the negative consequences of natural resources abundance on economic growth (Sachs and Warner 1995; Sachs and Warner 2001; Gylfason 2001; Kronenberg 2004).Footnote 1
 A country’s amount of natural resources has been indicated as not only harmful for economic growth, but also as having negative consequences for income distribution. Leamer et al. (1999), for example, have shown that natural resource-rich countries may exhibit a specialization pattern that increases income inequality. They argue that natural resource-intensive sectors absorb the scarce capital in these economies, delaying industrialization. The absence of incentives to accumulate human capital increases inequality and delays the surge of manufacturing industries that require skilled labor.Footnote 2
 The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we highlight the main facts of the dynamics of specialization for different products. Second, we study how natural resources abundance can impede gaining a comparative advantage in manufactured goods. In general, the results suggest that mobility tends to be different for different types of products, but we do not find evidence that a comparative advantage in resource-intensive goods is necessarily more persistent than one in manufactured goods. In addition, though it is less likely that resource-rich countries have comparative advantage in manufactured goods, the abundance of natural resources does not inhibit significant changes in specialization for these countries. This paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the conceptual framework for studying specialization patterns. In Sect. 3, we describe the data. In Sect. 4 we show our main evidence on specialization dynamics. Finally, in Sect. 5 we summarize the main results.",3
148,4,Review of World Economics,15 June 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0128-z,Can bribes buy protection against international competition?,December 2012,Christian Bjørnskov,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Adam Smith was one of the first to recognise that domestic industries and politicians have an interest in policies that reduce competition, collaborating ‘in a conspiracy against the publick, or in some contrivance to raise prices’ (Smith 1776, 145). Domestic producers are interested in policies hindering competition that allocate market power to them and enable higher prices or a cheaper quality of goods. Self-interested politicians may perceive such support as necessary, in particular when informed voters are not always likely to support their preferred policies. Alternatively, they may simply want to step onto ‘the gravy train’. Politicians therefore engage in creating a rent-seeking process in which they seek support in exchange for giving producers protection. The process is outlined in Grossman and Helpman’s (1994) seminal paper on special interest politics, Hillman’s (1982, 1989) earlier contributions, and many general contributions on rent-seeking.Footnote 1 Subsequent empirical studies have in general found considerable support for political-economic determinants of trade policy (Goldberg and Maggi 1999; Gawande and Bandyopadhyay 2000). From the positive point of view of corporatist theories to the literary excesses of Hunter S. Thompson—who hardly had a positive view of politicians—the importance of special interest politics is well documented. Corruption is the illegal part of a standard rent-seeking process where politicians and public servants are paid directly for using their influence to illegally benefit the bribing party. Klitgaard (1988, 75) famously characterised corruption as ‘equal to monopoly plus discretion minus accountability’, and as Rose-Ackerman (1997, 31) stresses, ‘whenever a public official has discretionary power over distribution to the private sector of a benefit or a cost, incentives for bribery are created’. One of the most potent means for controlling distribution to the private sector is indeed trade policy, as it in most cases distributes benefits from consumers and foreign producers to narrow groups of domestic producers and the government while imposing deadweight losses on society as a whole (Tullock 1967; Hillman and Katz 1987). Corrupt behaviour intuitively appears to be associated with barriers to trade, a causal association that could go both ways. The existing literature, however, has focussed on the link from trade to corruption, making the theoretical point that more protection against international competition leads to more domestic rent-seeking activity and thereby to more corruption (Krueger 1974). This has since Ades and di Tella (1999) virtually become a stylised fact in the corruption literature and has been replicated in the related literature on capital account restrictions.Footnote 2
 The additional possibility exists that corrupt practices might affect trade policy. Ades and di Tella (1999) make the point that if some sort of coordination mechanism exists between customs officers implementing trade policy and policy-makers, the level of protection might be set to maximise the income from corrupt practises, given the constraints imposed by politics and international rules. Yet, two alternative potential mechanisms need not involve coordination. First, Rose-Ackerman (1997, 56) notes that ‘once a pattern of successful payoffs is institutionalised, corrupt officials have an incentive to raise the size of bribes demanded and to search for alternative ways to extract payments’. Whenever firms have begun using bribes to lower costs associated with the regulatory framework, politicians and public servants are given an incentive to adjust the height of barriers to maximise their corrupt incomes. The causal chain between corruption and trade policy could therefore go the other way without the need of a coordination mechanism if customs officers have some discretionary power over the administration of tariff barriers and regulations. Second, domestic producers are interested in being sheltered from international competition. Single producers as well as their organizations could therefore rationally attempt to bribe policy-makers to raise all effective barriers to trade. Such an increase would be in the interest of corrupt customs officers although it would not require any action on their behalf. Consequently, corruption can potentially influence the formation and implementation of trade policy, as in the specific context of trade reforms, or directly affect trade volumes, directions and enforcement of agreements (Andersson and Marcouiller 2002; de Jong and Bogmans 2011; Lee and Azfar 2008). Yet, there are also internationally negotiated limits to such policy-making through both tariff limits and the abolition of import quota in the Uruguay Round agreement. Even so, effective barriers to trade through inherently illegal behaviour were central in the case brought by the United States against the European Union arguing that the Union failed to live up to its obligation to apply uniform customs measures across its member states (WTO Dispute Settlement case DS315). The corrupt formation of skewed trade policies needs to be concealed, which puts additional limits on the effectiveness of corruption. Corruption may thus be substantially stronger associated with less visible trade policies in the form of non-tariff barriers (NTBs)—non-quantified barriers outside the official use of tariffs or quotas, such as regulatory barriers, intransparent or complex standards and bureaucratic or politically engineered bottlenecks—for which the burden of proof is more difficult to lift and that can be more readily hidden from voters, while still conferring benefits on special interests. The main question to be explored in this paper is therefore whether corruption leads to more protectionist non-tariff trade policy and under which political conditions: is corruption less effective in buying protection in competitive democracies, does effectiveness depend on the ideology of the incumbent government, or is corruption perhaps more effective the more restricted the media are in writing about such problems? The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 outlines a set of intuitive theoretical considerations. Section 3 describes the data and the empirical strategy to deal with endogeneity used in Sect. 4, which provides empirical results that are discussed and concluded upon in the final section.",12

149,1,Review of World Economics,05 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0140-3,Reconsidering learning by exporting,March 2013,Miguel Manjón,Juan A. Máñez,Juan A. Sanchis-Llopis,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The relation between exports and productivity has been extensively studied.Footnote 1 Using rich micro data sets from a wide range of different countries, this research has consistently found that exporters are generally more productive than non-exporters. However, without further research at this point studies cannot distinguish between two well-known phenomena in this literature, ex ante productivity (self-selection) and/or ex post productivity improvement (learning by exporting, LBE hereafter). Thus, studies focussed on the LBE phenomenon should take into account that self-selection postulates that productivity gains are a precondition for export participation, not a result, and, therefore, self-selection does not offer any hint on the underlying mechanisms generating productivity differences across firms once they have started to export. In the self-selection mechanism firms need to reach a minimum productivity threshold to enter the more competitive foreign markets (Melitz 2003). Thus, only the ex ante more productive firms are able to sell abroad. On the other hand, in the LBE mechanism firms improve their productivity after entering a foreign market (Clerides et al. 1998). Therefore, exporting results in productivity gain because, among others, the growth in sales allows firms to profit from economies of scale, knowledge flows from international customers provide information about process and product innovations that might reduce costs and improve quality, and increased competition forces firms to behave more efficiently. Whereas there exists widespread empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis of self-selection into export markets (see e.g. Bernard and Jensen 1999; ISGEP 2008), the evidence on LBE is mixed and far from conclusive.Footnote 2 Some works do not find any evidence of post-entry productivity changes (Wagner 2002; Arnold and Hussinger 2005; Hansson and Lundin 2004), and those that find differ in the time span and extent of the productivity changes.Footnote 3
 As De Loecker (2010) has recently shown, however, most previous tests on the existence of the LBE mechanism could be flawed. The usual empirical strategy is to look at whether a productivity estimate, typically obtained as the residual of a production function estimation, increases after firms enter in the export market. But for such an estimate to make sense, past export experience should be allowed to impact future productivity. Yet some previous studies (implicitly) assume that the productivity term in the production function specification is just an idiosyncratic shock (Wagner 2002; Hansson and Lundin 2004; Greenaway and Kneller 2004, 2007b, 2008; Girma et al. 2004; Máñez-Castillejo et al. 2010), while others assume that this term is governed by an exogenous Markov process (Arnold and Hussinger 2005; Serti and Tomassi 2008). It is this sort of assumptions, often critical to obtain consistent estimates (Ackerberg et al. 2007), what makes these tests of the existence of LBE to lack internal consistency. In the first part of our analysis, we address this drawback by considering a more general process driving the law of motion for productivity. In particular, we explore the potential role that export experience might have in shaping firm’s future productivity. Moreover, in the specification of the production function we acknowledge that exporters and non-exporters may have different demands of materials. Lastly, we incorporate these features into the generalized method of moments (GMM) framework proposed by Wooldridge (2009). In the second part of our empirical analysis we analyse whether allowing past export experience to affect productivity has any impact in the analysis of LBE. Thus, we use matching techniques to analyse the causal effects of exports on productivity, both using a productivity estimate based on an exogenous Markov process and a productivity estimate based on a more general process in which we allow past export experience to affect productivity. We do not obtain evidence of LBE when using productivity estimates based on an exogenous Markov process. In contrast, we obtain yearly average gains in productivity of around 3 % when estimates are based on the more general process. The international comparability of our results is difficult as to the best of our knowledge De Loecker (2010) is the only research that uses quite a similar method to the one in this paper. Our approach is closely related to that followed by De Loecker (2007, 2010). In particular, Van Biesebroeck (2005) is probably the first study to extend the estimation framework developed by Olley and Pakes (1996) to include lagged export participation status as a state variable in the estimation of productivity. However, De Loecker (2007) includes export status in the control function, and he is the first to explicitly consider two different demands of investment for exporters and non-exporters. De Loecker (2007, 2010) allows the law of motion of productivity to depend on past export status.Footnote 4 In our study we will consider, as in De Loecker (2010), both two different demands of intermediate materials and we will allow export experience in the law of motion of productivity. However, although closely related, the estimation method in our study differs at some points to that in De Loecker (2010). De Loecker (2010) relies for estimation in Ackerberg et al. (2006) while we implement the GMM framework proposed by Wooldridge (2009). Olley and Pakes (1996, OP hereafter) and Levinshon and Petrin (2003, LP hereafter) proposed a two-step estimation method to estimate the coefficients in a production function. Ackerberg et al. (2006) showed that there exists an identification problem with the first step estimation of variable inputs coefficients in the previous methods and derived a mixture of OP and LP approaches to solve the problem. However, theirs is still a two-step estimation procedure. More recently, Wooldridge (2009) has argued that both OP and LP estimation methods can be reconsidered as consisting of two equations which can be jointly estimated by GMM in a one-step procedure. This joint estimation strategy has the advantages of increasing efficiency relatively to two-step procedures and of making unnecessary bootstrapping for the calculus of standard errors. We also differ from De Loecker (2007, 2010) in that he uses investment as a proxy variable (and so does Van Biesebroeck 2005) whereas we use intermediate materials. In this way we avoid possible concerns about zero-investment observations (Levinshon and Petrin 2003) and the invertibility of the investment function (Van Biesebroeck 2005). Further, whereas De Loecker (2007) uses an export participation dummy to proxy for export experience, we will also use export values. Another important difference with respect to these related studies arises from the data. Whereas we analyse a panel of firms observed for almost 20 years, De Loecker (2007, 2010) observe firms for 7 years at most and Van Biesebroeck (2005) for less than three. Having a longer time period should help to identify LBE effects. It is also interesting to note that Van Biesebroeck (2005) and De Loecker (2007, 2010) provide evidence from developing countries (at the observational period), whereas we do from a developed country. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly presents the data and provides empirical evidence of the significant differences between exporters and non-exporters in critical variables. Section 3 is devoted to the production function estimation method. Section 4 empirically analyses the relationship between firms’ productivity and their export status. Sections 5 and 6 present some evidence on the quality of the matching analysis and a robustness check of the main results in Sect. 4, respectively. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes.",47

Damijan,Jozef Konings,Sašo Polanec,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Back in 1957, at a conference on Economic Consequences of the Size of Nations, a Dutch economist P.J. Verdoorn (published in a conference compendium in 1960) presented path-breaking empirical evidence on the Intra-block Trade of Benelux countries. The evidence demonstrated that the Benelux countries engage in simultaneous two-way trade in similar products. This evidence was in sharp contrast to the predictions of the standard Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model. In particular, it predicts that countries differing in relative factor abundance will specialize in goods produced more intensively in countries’ relatively abundant factor, thus leading to one-way trade specialization in homogeneous goods. Verdoorn’s findings ignited a landslide of empirical research studying the extent and determinants of intra-industry trade of differentiated goods. In 1975, the Grubel and Lloyd (1975) monograph provided the definitive evidence showing intra-industry trade as a key empirical regularity of trade between developed countries, which was shown to be as high as 70 % of bilateral trade among some country pairs. However, it lasted more than two decades after the initial work of Verdoorn to come up with theoretical foundations for this regularity, based on a monopolistic competition framework, developed initially by Krugman (1979, 1980). Although firms in the Krugman model are homogenous in terms of size and productivity, the model shows that it is optimal for them to differentiate and specialize in producing one variety. Consequently, countries with similar income per capita are shown to engage in trade of differentiated, but not identical varieties.Footnote 1 The more recent trade models additionally exploit the role of heterogeneous firms, which reduces the scope for producing and trading identical varieties even further (Melitz 2003; Bernard et al. 2011). In contrast to this theoretical work, Damijan et al. (2012), studying the role of imported varieties on firms’ productivity and expanded export scope, surprisingly find that a sizeable proportion of products added or dropped on a year-to-year basis by Slovenian manufacturing firms consists of identical varieties. Similarly, recent evidence by Bernard et al. (2010d, 2012) using linked production and export data at the firm and product level for Belgium indicates that there exist additional regularities in trade, which cannot easily be reconciled with existing multi-product models of trade. In particular, they document that three quarters of the exported products and 30 % of the export value of Belgian manufacturers are in goods that are not produced by the firm. This is called carry-along trade (CAT). Furthermore, they find that the shares of CAT products and CAT exports are strongly increasing in firm productivity and hence these products are concentrated in the largest and most productive firms. This paper documents a related phenomenon. In particular, using detailed transaction-level data for Slovenian manufacturing, we document that a large fraction of firm-level exports occurs in the same 8-digit Combined Nomenclature (CN) product category that a firm has imported in the same or in the previous year. Thus manufacturing firms seem to engage in simultaneous two-way trade in the same varieties, where firms pass-on previously imported varieties to exports. We will call this pass-on trade (POT), which can be potentially seen as a sub-set of CAT.Footnote 2
 We document that, on average, over the 1995–2008 period, almost 70 % of all exporting firms engage to some extent in POT. Almost 40 % of all exported products of an average exporter consist of POT products, whereby the intensive margin of POT products is lower than in exports of firms’ own products. Overall, by 2008 the value of POT exports is close to 13 % of the aggregate value of manufacturing exports. This indicates that POT is a prevailing regularity of trade of Slovenian manufacturing firms. We document that the extent of POT is increasing in firm size, product diversification, multinational status as well as firm productivity and profitability. There could be various potential explanations for these new facts characterizing trade. The first is related to simple price arbitrage between different markets, with firms acting as trade intermediaries in line with Akerman (2010) and maximizing the profits from price differences within the same product category across markets. Second, a firm may serve as an intermediary within the multinational firms’ networks. Bernard et al. (2012) offer additional explanations for CAT, which may be also relevant for POT. The first one relates to firm’s efficiency of distribution networks allowing to sell a wider range of sourced products through an own distribution network. And the second one refers to the complementarities in the demand scope allowing a firm to offer additional sourced products that are complementary to its own products. Confronting these possible explanations with the data points towards three plausible explanations of why do firms engage in POT: (i) firms engage in serving as an intermediary within the multinational firms’ networks, (ii) firms engage in price arbitrage of ready-made products, which are sourced internationally, across a wide range of markets they serve with their own products, and (iii) firms engage in placing imported products, which are sourced as proprietary products. All of these firms’ strategies of engaging in POT, however, require both high firm efficiency in placing the products (efficient distribution network) and a complementarity in firm demand scope. Our empirical work finds robust evidence on the importance of firms’ multinational networks and demand complementarities between firms’ own and POT products in firms’ decisions to introduce and expand the number of POT products to any market. The remainder of the paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 describes the data set. Section 3 provides major stylized facts about POT by investigating the extensive and intensive margins of POT exporters as well as the productivity and profit premia of POT exporters. Section 4 empirically accounts for the main determinants of POT and provides a number of empirical tests of firm efficiency in placing own and sourced products and the role of complementarity in demand. Section 5 concludes.",19
149,1,Review of World Economics,08 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0141-2,"Exports, imports and firm survival: first evidence for manufacturing enterprises in Germany",March 2013,Joachim Wagner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the publication of the Brookings Paper by Bernard and Jensen (1995) a large and still growing empirical literature emerged that discusses the mutual links between international trade and firm performance.Footnote 1 The most prominent topic in this literature is the relationship between productivity and exports,Footnote 2 not least due to the central role played by productivity in the Melitz (2003) model of an exporting firm and the many variants of this model that are at the core of what is labelled the new new international trade theory. More recently, empirical investigations looked beyond exports and investigated the links between imports and productivityFootnote 3 or the relationships between productivity and both exports and imports.Footnote 4 Stakeholders in firms, however, care for other dimensions of firm performance, too. Workers care for working conditions in general and especially for wages. Shareholders are interested in stock prices, dividends and profits. All of them care for the long-run development of the firm and for firm survival as the ultimate goal. The links between international trade and firm survival are the topic of this paper. Why should we expect that international trade activities and firm survival are linked, and in which direction should we expect these links to work? To start with, exporting can be considered as a form of risk diversification through spread of sales over different markets with different business cycle conditions or in a different phase of the product cycle (see Hirsch and Lev 1971). Therefore, exports might provide a chance to substitute sales at home by sales abroad when a negative demand shock hits the home market and would force a firm to close down otherwise. Furthermore, Baldwin and Yan (2011, p. 135) argue that non-exporters are in general less efficient than exporters (younger, smaller and less productive) and that, as a result, one expects that non-exporters are more likely to fail than exporters. As regards imports, imported intermediate inputs or capital goods might be cheaper and/or technically more advanced than inputs bought on the national market. Gibson and Graciano (2011) argue that the benefit of using imported inputs lies in a combination of the relative price and the technology embodied in the inputs. Imports, therefore, lead to an increase in price competitiveness and non-price competitiveness of importers compared to firms that do not import. Furthermore, there is empirical evidence for a positive link of imports and productivity (discussed in Vogel and Wagner 2010), documented by a significant productivity differential between firms that import and firms that do not trade internationally. Therefore, the probability to survive can be expected to be higher for importers than for non-importers, ceteris paribus. Firms that both export and import can be expected to benefit from the positive effects of both forms of international trade on firm survival. Furthermore, two-way traders tend to be more productive than firms that either only import, or only export, or do not trade at all (see Vogel and Wagner 2010). Therefore, we expect the probability of firm exit to be smaller for two-way traders than for firms that only export or only import. A small number of recent empirical studies look at the role of international trade activities in shaping the chances for survival of firms; Wagner (2012a) summarizes this literature.Footnote 5 As a rule the estimated chance of survival is higher for exporters, and this holds after controlling for firm characteristics that are positively associated with both exports and survival (like size, age and productivity). This might point to a direct positive effect of exporting on survival. To the best of my knowledge López (2006), Gibson and Graciano (2011) and Namini et al. (2011) are the only empirical studies on imports and survival. All three studies use data for Chile. These studies find that importers are less likely to exit than non-importers. However, López (2006) reports that exporters are more likely to survive only if they import intermediate inputs. Exporting per se, therefore, does not seem to decrease the probability of plant failure. In the light of the empirical evidence for a positive link of imports and productivity the positive link between imports and firm survival does not come as a surprise. The same holds for the positive link between two-way trading (i.e. importing and exporting) and survival. However, in light of the evidence for a positive link between exporting and survival found in the other studies surveyed in Wagner (2011a) (that do not deal with the role of imports) the finding that in Chile exporting per se does not seem to decrease the probability of plant failure is a puzzle. This paper contributes to the literature by providing the first evidence on the role of exports, imports and two-way trade for firm survival in a highly developed country, Germany, one of the leading actors on the world market for goods. It uses unique new representative data for manufacturing enterprises that merge information from surveys performed by the Statistical Offices and administrative data collected by the Tax Authorities. To anticipate the most important result, the analysis reveals a strong positive link between firm survival on the one hand and imports and two-way trading on the other hand, while exporting alone does not play a role for exiting the market or not. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the new data set. Section 3 presents descriptive results. Section 4 reports probit estimates for trader survival premia for four cohorts of exits of enterprises.Footnote 6 Section 5 concludes.",57

Firms split up their value chains and relocate those activities which they perform with less efficiency to foreign affiliates or to external foreign suppliers. Numerous studies have documented the rapid growth in offshoring over the last decades (see, e.g. Hummels et al. 2001 or Amiti and Wei 2005). While offshoring has for a long time been limited to material inputs, the last decade has also witnessed an increase in offshoring of services, a trend that has been triggered by the revolution in information and communication technologies (Blinder 2006). In the public perception offshoring is often associated with layoffs, wage reductions, and a rise in wage inequality. These fears have even led Germany to elect outsourcing in 1996 as “faux-pas word of the year”. Indeed, there is evidence of at least some adverse labour market effects. In particular, offshoring is blamed to penalise low-skilled workers since their jobs often involve routine activities which are more easily offshorable than the activities of high-skilled workers (Feenstra and Hanson 1996; Geishecker and Görg 2008). Blinder (2006, 2009) has caused alarm with estimates of about 25 % of American jobs that are potentially exposed to offshoring. In light of the anxiety about job losses and wage reductions, research has been mostly focused on the labour market effects of offshoring, while there is only a small literature on the productivity effects of offshoring. This study argues that the importance of this aspect has been overlooked. First, productivity is an important driver of economic growth and hence interesting in its own right. Second, recent theoretical studies show that there are positive feedback effects on the labour markets provided that offshoring raises productivity. According to Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) the wages of unskilled workers may rise despite their vulnerability to offshoring if the productivity effect induced by offshoring is sufficiently large; Mitra and Ranjan (2010) show that due to the presence of productivity effects offshoring may decrease unemployment and increase wages; Kohler and Wrona (2010) identify conditions under which job creation dominates job destruction in the presence of productivity effects. Hence, analysing the offshoring-productivity link is important to better understand feedback effects on the labour markets. The existing literature on this topic provides some evidence that offshoring can increase productivity, but the identified effects are quite heterogeneous depending on the analysed country, the type of firms (e.g. exporters versus non-exporters) or the type of offshored inputs (materials or services):Footnote 1 Görg and Hanley (2005) find that material offshoring has contributed to an increase in the productivity of firms with low export intensities in the Irish electronics sector. Egger and Egger (2006) find that offshoring lowers the productivity of low-skilled workers in the short run, but raises their productivity in the long run. Görg et al. (2008) find that service offshoring enhances the productivity of exporting firms in the Irish manufacturing sector. Hijzen et al. (2008) show for Japanese firms that offshoring to foreign affiliates raises productivity, while offshoring to external suppliers has no such effect. Amiti and Wei (2009) find that offshoring increases productivity, with service offshoring accounting for 10 % and material offshoring accounting for 5 % of the productivity growth in the United States. Winkler (2010) finds that service offshoring increases the productivity of German manufacturing industries, when controlling for domestic outsourcing. Wagner (2011) finds some evidence for positive productivity effects for German firms using a matching approach. A criticism which applies for most studies in this literature is that the interpretation of the central offshoring measure is ambiguous. Offshoring is widely defined as the share of imported inputs in total inputs and is measured at the industry level through a combination of input-output tables and import data (Feenstra and Hanson 1996). The offshoring measure per se does not allow distinguishing whether internal production is moved out to foreign suppliers (offshoring) or to domestic suppliers (domestic outsourcing), or whether domestic suppliers are replaced by foreign suppliers (supplier change). See Castellani et al. (2011) for a detailed analysis of this problem. The present study provides stylized facts on offshoring in Europe between 1995 and 2008 taking into account this distinction. This study shows that many services which were previously provided internally have systematically been offshored and outsourced domestically. For material inputs, by contrast, there is also evidence of systematic replacements of domestic by foreign suppliers. Overall the share of internal production has gone down by 4.5 percentage points, which raises the question whether firms have achieved productivity gains through this specialisation effort. This question is addressed by combining industry data on offshoring and domestic outsourcing with a firm panel. Using fixed effects regressions and an instrumental variable approach this study finds evidence that service offshoring and offshoring of non-core manufacturing activities have contributed to an increase in productivity, whereas no significant link is found for offshoring of core manufacturing activities and domestic outsourcing. The estimated productivity gains are found to be driven in particular by the gains of multinational firms. The remainder of this study is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses possible channels for productivity effects. Section 3 illustrates how offshoring is measured and provides stylized facts on offshoring in Europe. Section 4 describes the empirical model, Sect. 5 presents the regression results, and Sect. 6 concludes.",40

Weche Gelübcke,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This is the first study addressing the performance of foreign-controlled enterprises in German manufacturing, one of the most important destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows worldwide (UNCTAD 2011).Footnote 1 To counter the lack of empirical knowledge on foreign companies in Germany, a comprehensive set of performance variables is analyzed, based on newly available micro-data from official German statistics. Foreign-owned firms have long been the subject of public and academic debate. For example, foreign takeovers are associated with fears of downsizing (Bofinger et al. 2007: 388) and receive unbalanced media coverage when compared to domestic takeovers (Friebel and Heinz 2011). At the same time, governments spend huge sums of money to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in the hope of positive externalities in favor of domestically owned competitors (e.g., Görg and Greenaway 2004) and job creation. Such policy efforts, by far, are certainly not restricted to developing or transition economies but are also prevalent in leading developed countries, such as Germany. The German government tries to attract foreign investors, for example, through the investment promotion agency Germany Trade & Invest, in particular. Efforts are essentially aimed at research and development (R&D) intensive high-tech companies to benefit from job creation, R&D investments, and innovations in various fields. Policy instruments used for attraction are, for example, the provision of information but also particular subsidies.Footnote 2
 Although a huge body of literature has been devoted to the investigation of foreign ownership performance premium, an indispensable precondition for positive externalities, these studies produce ambiguous and country-specific results. Despite the importance of FDI inflows for the German economy and the remarkable economic impact of foreign-controlled firms (see Fig. 1) there has been only little empirical knowledge on foreign enterprises in the German economy. From a methodological point of view, the new database allows comparison of foreign affiliates with domestic affiliates for the first time and therefore avoids the problem of comparing foreign dependent enterprises with domestic headquarters. Furthermore, the analysis extends beyond a simple comparison of unconditional means through use of premium regressions and tests for differences across the entire distribution of particular variables. The data allow for a separate analysis of foreign-controlled enterprises by country of origin and type of ownership. Performance measures examined are productivity, profitability, export behavior, R&D intensity, wages, and firm size. Foreign-controlled enterprises in German non-financial sectors (%).

This is in line with recent literature on heterogeneous firms and trade (e.g., Melitz 2003; Helpman et al. 2004). Section 2 discusses the general theory linking foreign ownership and performance. Section 3 introduces more specific performance measures and surveys empirical findings with a focus on Germany. Data and variables used in the empirical analysis are introduced in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 comments on the methodological strategy. Section 6 presents the results.

149,1,Review of World Economics,24 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-012-0143-0,"Financial development, exporting and firm heterogeneity in Chile",March 2013,Roberto Alvarez,Ricardo A. López,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The recent financial crisis that affected many economies of the world during the latter part of the 2000s demonstrated the importance of financial systems for economic growth and international trade. While empirical studies at the macro level have shown that financial development is an important determinant of economic growth (King and Levine 1993; Levine 1997; Levine et al. 2000), and trade volumes and trade patterns (Beck 2002, 2003), still surprisingly little is known about the heterogeneous responses of firms at the micro level. A series of empirical studies has shown that international trade is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity. Firms that are involved in exporting or importing activities are, on average, more productive, larger, more capital and skill intensive, and pay higher wages than firms that participate in domestic markets only (Bernard and Jensen 1999; Alvarez and López 2005; Kasahara and Rodrigue 2008; López and Yadav 2010).Footnote 1 The purpose of this paper is to link the macro and the micro literatures by examining the effect of financial development on firms’ exporting decisions taking into account the potential different responses by heterogeneous firms. Our conceptual framework is based on the recent theoretical analyses by Chaney (2005) and Manova (2010), who extend the Melitz (2003) model of international trade to study the relationship between firm export decisions and financial constraints. In these theories, given that exporting involves entry costs that need to be paid up front, limited access to financing can prevent the entry of firms into international markets. An implication of these analyses is that a higher degree of financial development should help reducing financial constraints at the firm level, thereby increasing the probability of exporting. Using plant-level data from the manufacturing sector of Chile for the period 1990–2000 we study the effect of financial development on the probability of exporting, and we extend the previous literature by considering explicitly the differential impact of financial development across plants and industries. Most of the previous empirical papers at the micro level have examined the role of firm-specific credit constraints or financial health on the probability of exporting, but have overlooked the potential role of financial development. While some studies on this area find that firms with lower credit constraints are more likely to export (e.g., Berman and Héricourt 2009; Bellone et al. 2010; Minetti and Zhu 2011), others find that causality runs in the opposite direction, so that exporting improves firms’ financial health (e.g., Greenaway et al. 2007). Since exporting and financial health are likely to be endogenous, establishing the direction of the causality is a challenge in all these studies. The only paper we are aware of that considers the role of financial development explicitly in the export decision is the study by Berman and Héricourt (2009), who use a data set with information for 5,000 firms from nine developing countries. Similar to our approach, they include in some regressions a measure of financial development interacted with firm-level productivity. They find that financial development disproportionally increases the probability of exporting of more productive firms. Our paper extends the previous literature by analyzing whether productivity and other plant characteristics, such as size, age and foreign ownership, may play a role in determining the effect of financial development on the exporting probability. In addition, we also look at how the heterogeneous effect of financial development differs across industries depending on their degree of financial dependence. To do this, we use a variant of the identification strategy developed by Rajan and Zingales (1998) to analyze whether financial development has a larger effect on more productive firms (or younger or foreign-owned firms) in those sectors where external financial needs are more relevant. This strategy has been used in a cross-country setting by Aghion et al. (2007) to study the effects of financial development on firm dynamics. Their results show that financial development matters most for entry of new firms and post-entry growth in sectors that are more dependent on external financing.Footnote 2
 Our econometric results consistently show that financial development benefits more productive and foreign-owned firms in industries that are more dependent on external finance. In contrast, smaller and younger firms do not appear to be particularly affected by financial development. Our results hold to several robustness checks such as the introduction of interactions between aggregate shocks and firm characteristics, and the use of alternative measures of financial dependence and estimation techniques. One usual concern when analyzing the effect of financial development is the potential endogeneity of this variable. In our case, since a country’s financial development is exogenous to the decision to export at the firm level, our analysis does not need to deal with the issue of causality going in the opposite direction. It can be argued, however, that capital markets development may depend on the industry characteristics of the country, which needs to be taken into account in the empirical analysis. In fact, Braun and Raddatz (2008) argue that changes in the relative strength of trade promoter and trade opponent industries result in changes in the political equilibrium level of financial development. They find evidence that strengthening of promoter relative to opponent industries resulting from trade liberalization is a good predictor of subsequent financial development. Similarly, Do and Levchenko (2007) show that a country’s trade pattern can affect its financial development. They present evidence that countries with a higher specialization in financially dependent goods have a higher level of financial development than countries producing goods for which external finance is less important. Given that we use plant-level information we can rule out the effect of industry-specific shocks that can simultaneously affect both financial development and the probability of exporting, by including industry-year fixed effects in all our regressions. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data and presents some basic patterns. Section 3 introduces the empirical methodology. Section 4 presents and discusses the econometric results, and also several robustness checks. In Sect. 5 we conclude and discuss the implications of our findings.",10

149,2,Review of World Economics,14 February 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0150-9,Over-optimistic official forecasts and fiscal rules in the eurozone,June 2013,Jeffrey Frankel,Jesse Schreger,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Fiscal rules are increasingly proposed as a means of reining in excessive budget deficits. By now it is clear to all that the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has failed to keep budget deficits and debt levels of eurozone members within the limits specified: originally 3 % of GDP and 60 % of GDP, respectively. In response to the euro crisis that began in 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has proposed and won acceptance for a new Fiscal Compact among the euro states. The goal of the compact is to strengthen fiscal rules among euro members, in particular by writing them into laws and constitutions at the national level. In any effort to revise or strengthen fiscal rules, it would help to know why some rules have failed in the past, such as the SGP itself, and what the record with national rules of various sorts is: limits on spending versus deficits, conditional or unconditional, with or without independent fiscal agencies, and so forth. One factor behind excessive budget deficits worldwide is a tendency for official forecasts of growth rates, tax receipts, and budget balances to be over-optimistic. It stands to reason that a government that foresees, or claims to foresee, healthy surpluses in coming years is less likely today to take the difficult steps that might be necessary to strengthen the budget, such as cutting spending and raising tax rates. Framing the budget rules in cyclical terms, as in the Fiscal Compact (technically called the Treaty on Stability, Coordination, and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union), is desirable in terms of macroeconomic impact. But it does not help to solve the problem of forecast bias. In fact, it can make the problem even worse. In a year when a forecast for the structural budget deficit turns out to have been over-optimistic, the government can still claim that its own calculations show the shortfall to have been cyclical rather than structural. After all, estimation of potential output—and hence the cyclical versus structural decomposition of the fiscal position—is notoriously difficult, even after the fact. The bias toward optimism in fiscal forecasts among the 24 countries included in this study is 0.28 % of GDP at the 1-year horizon, 0.93 % of GDP at the 2-year horizon, and 1.90 % at the 3-year horizon. For the 17 European countries, the bias is even higher, despite the rules of the SGP (or perhaps because of them): 0.52 % at the 1-year horizon, 1.29 % at the 2-year horizon and 2.4 % at the 3-year horizon.Footnote 1 An important component of the over-optimism in official forecasts of the budget deficit is over-optimism in official forecasts of GDP.Footnote 2
 Many experts and some elected officials have suggested that annual deficits and long-term debt can best be held in check through fiscal policy rules or mechanisms such as deficit or debt caps.Footnote 3 Some countries have already enacted laws along these lines. The most important and most well-known example is the fiscal rules of the eurozone, which supposedly limit budget deficits to 3 % of GDP and debts to 60 % of GDP.Footnote 4 (The Maastricht Treaty specified these fiscal rules as criteria for determining what countries are admitted to the eurozone. The SGP supposedly dictated that member countries must continue to meet the criteria). Some euro countries have enacted budget rules at the national level. Other countries have also adopted fiscal rules and other similar institutions.Footnote 5 In a recent IMF Working Paper, Schaechter et al. (2012) create a new database of national and supranational fiscal rules across 81 countries from 1985 to 2012. The authors report that while only five countries had fiscal rules in place in 1990, 76 countries had them in place by the end of March 2012, most of them purporting to put limits on the deficit or debt. The success of these measures, however, depends on making accurate forecasts of government spending and revenues. Getting those forecasts right has proven to be very difficult for most governments. Econometric studies have already shown that government budget forecasts in many countries are over-optimistic on average, often because official estimates of economic growth are over-optimistic. Auerbach (1994) finds over-optimistic official U.S. forecasts in the decade up to 1993. McNees (1995) finds an optimistic bias in official forecasts of long-term American growth through 1994. Auerbach (1999) again finds a tendency for US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forecasts to overestimate revenues during the period 1986–1993, but found a tendency to underestimate revenues during the subsequent period, 1993–1999. McNab et al. (2007) find that OMB’s 1-year ahead forecasts of US tax receipts were biased over the period 1963–2003 and suggest that the bias may have been strategic on the part of various administrations seeking to achieve particular goals, such as overstating budget balance when the administration is seeking to increase spending or cut taxes. Frendreis and Tatalovich (2000) show that US administrations (OMB) are less accurate in estimating growth, inflation and unemployment than is the independent Congressional Budget Office or the Federal Reserve Board. They find partisan bias, interpreted as Republican administrations over-forecasting inflation and Democratic administrations over-forecasting unemployment. Forni and Momigliano (2004) find optimism bias among OECD countries in general. Ashiya (2005, 2007) shows that official Japanese growth forecasts are biased upwards and are significantly less accurate than private sector forecasts. According to O’Neill (2005) and Mühleisen et al. (2005), Canada underestimated its budget deficits in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but subsequently overestimated them (1994–2004), perhaps to reduce the risk of missing its target of a balanced budget under its strengthened institutional framework. Jonung and Larch (2006) find that budget agencies in the EU systematically overestimate the economic growth rate. The tendency toward over-optimistic forecasts is especially strong in Italy and Germany. The United Kingdom is an exception. Strauch et al. (2009) find a statistically significant optimism bias for some euro members: Germany, Italy, Greece, Luxembourg, and Portugal for the period 1991–2004. The United Kingdom, Finland and Sweden, on the other hand, tend to overestimate their deficits. In light of this difference, it is suggestive that the United Kingdom and Sweden were not trying to get into the euro, which would have required meeting the fiscal criteria of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, while the others were trying to get in, and are now there and thus subject to the SGP.Footnote 6 Brück and Stephan (2006) explicitly conclude that eurozone governments have manipulated deficit forecasts before elections since the introduction of the SGP. Most of these authors argue that the systematic over-optimism in ex ante forecasts translates directly into larger ex post deficits, and particularly to deficits larger than targeted under the SGP. Similarly, Beetsma et al. (2009) find that realized budget balances among SGP countries on average fall short of official ex ante plans. Marinheiro (2010) adds another complete business cycle to the data under the SGP, and again finds that the forecasts of European fiscal authorities are systematically too optimistic. This evidence is not consistently strong across the set of 15 EU countries, but the bias is high for France, Italy and Portugal at all forecast horizons.Footnote 7 Beetsma et al. (2011) decompose the overall optimism bias in the budget forecasts of EU governments into the component that arises between initial plans and the first release of actual budget numbers and the component that arises between the first release and the final revised budget numbers. One of the present authors (Frankel 2011a, b) recently studied forecasts of real growth rates and budget balances made by official government agencies in 33 countries. A number of striking findings emerge. (i) The official forecasts have an upward bias, which is stronger at longer horizons. On average the gap between the forecast of the budget balance and the realized balance is 0.2 % of GDP at the 1-year horizon, 0.8 % at the 2-year horizon, and 1.5 % at the 3-year horizon. (ii) One reason for the optimism bias in official budget forecasts is an optimism bias in forecasts of economic growth. The country’s growth rate is an important determinant of the budget balance at all three time horizons, so over-optimism in predicting growth is linked to over-optimism in predicting budget balances. On average, the upward bias in growth forecasts is 0.4 % when looking 1-year ahead, 1.1 % at the 2-year horizon, and 1.8 % at 3 years. (iii) The bias is stronger in booms than in normal times. These findings can help to explain excessive budget deficits, and especially the failure to run surpluses during periods of high output: if a boom is expected to last indefinitely, then saving for a rainy day is unnecessary. Many believe that better fiscal policy can be obtained by means of rules such as ceilings for the deficit. But Frankel (2011a) also finds: (iv) countries subject to a budget rule, in the form of euroland’s Stability and Growth Path, make official forecasts of growth and budget deficits that are even more biased and more correlated with booms than do other countries. This effect may help explain frequent violations of the SGP.",70

149,2,Review of World Economics,13 February 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0147-4,Time zone-related continuity and synchronization effects on bilateral trade flows,June 2013,Rebecca Tomasik,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Recent theoretical and empirical papers in the distance and gravity model literatures have focused on the effect that time zones have on trade and foreign direct investment (FDI). Their results suggest the presence of two conflicting effects of time zones on trade and FDI. The presence of both effects together has never been previously found empirically. This paper provides an industry-level empirical analysis of time zone-related effects on global bilateral trade flows and contributes to the literature by being the first paper to find empirical evidence of the time zone-related continuity effect. The literature on time zone effects on trade and FDI developed from two main branches of the trade literature, namely the distance and the production fragmentation literatures. The distance literature overwhelmingly suggests an inverse relationship between distance and trade. In fact, according to Leamer and Levinsohn (1994, p. 44), the negative effect of distance on trade is one of the “clearest and most robust empirical findings in economics.” Despite its robustness, discussion exists as to how distance should be measured and what exactly distance proxies for. For some, the use of distance in trade models is intended to capture transportation costs of goods (e.g., Obstfeld and Rogoff 2001), but this does not fully explain the negative distance effect. For example, this negative distance effect is still present for services and financial capital trade (Portes et al. 2001) which have no transportation costs. However, papers such as Huang (2007) suggest that distance proxies for unfamiliarity between countries that increases with physical distance. The imprecise nature of any distance measure leads to discussion over more accurate measures. From this literature, the addition of a time zone measure to capture the increased communication costs associated with longitudinal distance was introduced (Stein and Daude 2007). The production fragmentation literature examines outsourcing and the pattern of trade that results from a production process that is spread across countries. There should be a different pattern of trade for these fragmented processes than for market-serving trade (Athukorala and Yamashita 2008). The time zone literature can explain the location choice of some of these fragmented processes, as firms may choose a particular country for part of the production process to avoid (or take advantage of) time zone differences. The theoretical time zone papers (Kikuchi 2006; Marjit 2007; Kikuchi and Van Long 2010) suggest that larger time zone differences give countries a comparative advantage in service trade which results in gains from trade for any company that makes use of the time zone differences. Papers such as Kikuchi and Van Long (2010) and Marjit (2007), employ theoretical models to suggest that there should be a positive and significant time zone difference effect for service trade and service FDI. This is due to what Head et al. (2009) dubbed the “continuity effect.” This is the idea that time zone differences allow a company to work around the clock, but not have to compensate workers for non-ideal work hours. The time zone differences allow everyone to work during standard daytime hours, but for the business to operate 24 h a day. This creates a benefit for companies, especially companies that produce time-sensitive services such as information technology. For example, suppose there are two countries with no overlapping work hours such that one country’s workday begins as the other workday ends and assume the business service has two discrete steps such that the first part must be completely finished before the second step may begin. Without taking advantage of time zone differences, the firm finishes the first part on day one, the second part on day 2, and can sell the product at the start of the 3rd day. If the firm does take advantage of time zone differences, the domestic workers complete the first step of the production process during the day and then the second step is completed during the foreign country’s daytime hours. The firm is able to finish the product an entire day earlier than if they did not take advantage of time zone differences. This positive benefit should only exist for services, as manufactured goods cannot move between continents as easily. Empirical papers such as Stein and Daude (2007) and Hattari and Rajan (2008) employ country-level empirical analysis that finds evidence of a negative time zone difference effect on FDI and trade. Furthermore, Stein and Daude suggest that failing to account for the increased longitudinal costs, as captured by time zone differences, could lead to overestimating the effect of distance. This is due to what Head et al. (2009) call the “synchronization effect.” If there is no overlap in business hours between two offices, in order to communicate between the offices someone needs to either come in early or leave later. This typically results in increased corporate labor costs. As firms in both industries experience these higher costs, negative time zone effect should be present for both manufacturing and service industries. Both Stein and Daude (2007) and Hattari and Rajan (2008) find a negative effect when looking at country-level FDI and trade, which is consistent with the synchronization effect. However, the theoretical models suggest the continuity effect should only be present in service FDI and trade and thus may not be found in a country-level analysis. An industry-level analysis of time zone effects gives a more complete picture of the true effect of time zone differences as it allows this effect to differ between industries. Only one previous paper uses an industry-level analysis when examining the time zones effect on trade. Head et al. (2009) examine goods and service trade separately to explore the changing effect of time zones. They find time zone differences effects on goods trade was positive, while the time zone differences effects on service trade is insignificant. The services result is consistent with two competing effects canceling out, but the goods result is puzzling, as a positive continuity effect should not be present.Footnote 1
 My study contributes to the literature by empirically testing for the both the continuity and synchronization effects. Like Head et al. (2009), my study examines goods and services exports, but unlike previous research, this study includes both goods and service exports in the same model. The addition of an interaction term between an indicator for service trade and the time zone variable allows the two effects to appear separately in the model. The primary time zone variable captures any effect that is common to both goods and services exports (theoretically, the negative synchronization effect). The interaction term picks up any effect that is different between goods and services exports (the continuity effect). Therefore, time zone theory suggests the expected sign for the coefficient on the interaction term should be positive and the expected sign for coefficient on the time zone variable alone should be negative. OECD goods and services export data from 2000 to 2008 is used to empirically examine time zone effects. The results of the analysis agree with the theoretical implications. The time zone variable coefficient is negative and significant, consistent with the synchronization effect. The interaction term coefficient is positive and significant, consistent with the continuity effect. Therefore, this paper finds the first empirical evidence for the presence of the continuity effect and reaffirms the presence of the synchronization effect found in previous literature. The remainder of the paper is organized in the following manner. Section two discusses the data used in the analysis and the empirical methodology. Section three presents the main results of the paper. Section four provides robustness checks of the main results, and section five concludes.",12

Evidence from Denmark,June 2013,Sanne Hiller,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Immigration might increase total factor productivity (Peri 2012), affect the domestic wage structure (Ottaviano and Peri 2012), boost innovation (Gauthier-Loiselle and Hunt 2010) or promote economic growth (Felbermayr et al. 2010). On top of these direct effects, immigration has also been found to lower diverse barriers to trade and thereby bolster engagement in international markets. Foreign immigrants have the potential to lower barriers to trade, as they carry relevant market-specific information, may improve contract enforcement (Rauch 2001) and help firms to discover business opportunities abroad due to their superior knowledge about their home market (Casella and Rauch 2002). This trade-migration nexus has been assessed in theoretical and empirical works, important examples include Peri and Requena (2010), Felbermayr and Jung (2009), White (2007), Combes et al. (2005), Herander and Saavedra (2005), Girma and Yu (2002), Rauch and Trindade (2002), Dunlevy and Hutchinson (1999), Head and Ries (1998) and Gould (1994). These studies are supportive of a trade-promoting effect of immigration, which spurs a question yet unanswered: How can firms access the knowledge embedded in the foreign population? Recent studies highlight the importance of knowledge spillovers by labor mobility: Both, firm productivity and firm internationalization can substantially benefit from the hiring of specific types of workers. Not only does the hiring of technicians and highly educated workers carry the potential to boost firm productivity (Parrotta and Pozzoli 2012) or multinational experience feed back into improved firm performance (Balsvik 2011; Görg and Strobl 2005), but also does managers’ export experience transmit to his new employer (Mion and Opromolla 2011). Do firms have to hire foreigners in order to benefit from immigration? We contribute to the existent literature by disentangling whether foreign employment in the trading firm or the presence of immigrants in the geographical surroundings of the firm exert a trade-cost reducing force, which eventually feeds back into higher export sales.Footnote 1 It adds an additional angle by distinguishing whether foreigners bolster the number of traded products or their average value. In order to address these two questions, our analysis exploits the panel structure of a matched employer-employee data set, which contains information of Danish manufacturing exports for 168 destination markets for the years between 1995 and 2005. Our analysis disentangles how immigration affects the composition of trade within the firm and thereby acknowledges the economic significance of multi-product firms. The economic importance of multi-product firms is reflected in many theoretical and empirical contributions (Bernard et al. 2010, 2011; Eckel and Neary 2010; Goldberg et al. 2010; Nocke and Yeaple 2008; Johnson and Myatt 2003; Eaton and Schmidt 1994; Shaked and Sutton 1990, as well as Brander and Eaton 1984). The recent paper by Bernard et al. (2011) highlights how firms adjust their product coverage at destination markets if trade costs change, and is therefore closest to our current application. The authors show—inter alia—that the within-firm composition of exports is decisively affected by variations in variable and fixed trade costs. Both, the presence of local migrant networks, and the employment of foreigners bear the potential to lower trade costs, and thereby to change the product scale and scope or the products exported by multi-product firms. Our major results are in line with the related literature: Immigration lowers trade barriers, such that upon employment of foreigners from a given country, firms benefit in terms of expanded export sales to his country of origin. As a novel insight and in close connection to the literature on multi-product firms, we confirm that immigration changes the within-firm export composition, which is consistent with a trade-cost reducing impact of immigration. Our results are qualitatively and quantitatively robust to several variations of the empirical specification, which—among other things—suggest that foreign employment does not divert trade from countries other than the migrant’s origin. Moreover, we account for reverse causality of foreign employment and sample selection. Section 2 provides a theoretical motivation and a brief literature review. Section 3 presents the data. The empirical strategy is described in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents and discusses the results. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",38

This is surprising particularly in the European context where public concerns about globalization widening the income gap between rich and poor segments of the population figure prominently in current political and economic discourse. Furthermore, previous studies typically analyze either inward FDI or outward FDI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical evaluation taking a broader perspective by assessing the causal links between both inward and outward FDI and different measures of inequality. We argue in Sect. 2 that the effects of inward and outward FDI on income inequality in relatively advanced countries are theoretically ambiguous. Against this background, we empirically explore the relationship between FDI stocks and income inequality for a sample of eight European countries over the period from 1980 to 2000. We employ panel cointegration techniques as well as unbalanced panel regressions (Sect. 3). Our results reported in Sect. 4 reveal that both inward and outward FDI reduce income inequality, though only in the long run and not necessarily in all European countries. At the same time, less income inequality leads to more (inward and outward) FDI. Our results are robust to using different measures of FDI and inequality. For instance, replacing income inequality with wage inequality does not alter our main findings. Moreover, we show that our estimates are robust to using a variety of different econometric procedures and to controlling for potential outliers.",35

Many studies have documented the overwhelming role of multinational firms in international trade. According to UNCTAD (2002), one-third of world trade is intra-firm, and another third involves the participation of multinational firms. Kiyota and Urata (2005) report that in 2000, 95 % of Japanese exports and 85.5 % of Japanese imports were carried out by multinational firms and that half of the trade of Japanese firms took place within their boundaries. Clausing (2000) reports a similar intra-firm trade share for trade between the EU and the US. Such intra-firm trade includes trade in intermediate goods among different units of multinational firms. However, intra-firm trade in final goods from the parent firm to wholesale trade affiliates accounts for the largest fraction. The business literature has long recognized the important role of multinationals’ distribution networks (Caves 1971; Dunning 1993; Hirsch 1993; Gray 1999). According to Daniels (2000), the rapid expansion of foreign direct investment (FDI) mostly relied on the growth of multinational activities in downstream activities such as wholesale trade and after-sales services. In the international economics literature, the empirical analysis of distribution-oriented FDI has received less attention, which is at least partly due to the lack of appropriate data. Using data from US affiliates of Japanese firms, Zeile (1997) reports the important role of wholesale trade affiliates in intra-firm trade. Looking at this intra-firm trade from a different angle, Greaney (2005) reports that in 1997, the export activities of Japanese wholesale trade affiliates represent 66.7 % of total Japanese exports.
Footnote 1
 Wholesale trade accounts not only for an important share of foreign trade but also makes up for an important share of foreign affiliate sales. Fontagné and Toubal (2010) use data for France and report that wholesale trade affiliates account for almost 15 % of total foreign affiliates’ sales and for 20 % of French multinational firms’ total foreign employment. They also show that nearly 10 % of the total number of subsidiaries abroad are active in the foreign wholesale sector. Fryges (2007) reports that German wholesale trade affiliates account for about 50 % of German multinational firms’ foreign sales in 2003. Using data for US firms for 1998, Hanson et al. (2005) report that the share of sales by foreign wholesale trade affiliates in total foreign sales by US firms ranges from 9.7 % for U.S. parents in transportation equipment to 37 % for parents in industrial machinery. Anderson (2008) confirms the importance of foreign wholesale trade affiliates in the U.S. but notes that their importance has somewhat declined and argues that this is because “some wholesale trade affiliates [reoriented] from importing manufactured goods for sale in the United States to manufacturing goods at US facilities” (Anderson 2008: 196, footnote 9). This paper analyzes the foreign sales strategies of multinational firms. Our theoretical framework is related to the work of Helpman et al. (2004), who introduce firm-level heterogeneity in a proximity-concentration model of the multinational firm. Our model differs from theirs in that we model explicitly the option of a multinational firm to export through its wholesale trade affiliate. We assume that multinational firms can produce goods abroad or sell their goods through their wholesale affiliates. In contrast to the previous literature, we analyze multinational firms’ choice between foreign production and foreign distribution. We assume that markets are segmented by trade costs that increase the price of goods shipped to a foreign country. Trade costs affect the sales of wholesale trade affiliates negatively, but they do not affect the sales of production affiliates. Yet, the fixed costs necessary to maintain production in a foreign production plant are higher than the fixed costs necessary to maintain a wholesale affiliate. Moreover, the fixed costs necessary to produce abroad are higher than the fixed costs of wholesale trade. Exporting through wholesale trade affiliates and producing abroad yield different prices and quantities and, thus, different profits. The resulting equilibrium strategy arises endogenously from the comparison of the expected profits. Thus, trade costs affect the relative profits of producing abroad positively, whereas fixed costs affect it negatively. There is nothing conceptually new about the introduction of the wholesale affiliate. We think in the contrary it is the great strength of the analysis that it might be extended to the (pure) export-production decision easily if appropriate data is available. We do not have export data at the firm-level but we can work with the whole population of multinational firms. We use detailed data on multinational firms’ foreign activities. The data provide a geographical breakdown of foreign affiliates of German multinational firms and comprise panel information from 1996 to 2003 that allows us to distinguish between wholesale trade affiliates and production affiliates. The data support the discrete choice approach in that there are only a few firm-country combinations for which we observe both a wholesale affiliate and a production unit.
Footnote 2 The data are supplemented with sector- and host-country-specific variables. The empirical analysis uses the discrete choice methodology in different econometric models. We use different specifications and report estimation results for different sub-samples of multinational firms. We also consider more complex foreign sales strategies and correct for the sample selection bias that arises because we only observe firms that have foreign affiliates. In addition, we use the panel structure of the data to estimate a fixed effects model which controls for unobserved heterogeneity. Our main results are robust to changes in the sample and the econometric specification. We find that trade costs have the expected positive effect on the likelihood to produce abroad, while plant-level fixed costs reduce the likelihood to produce abroad. A larger foreign market size and lower sector-specific production costs increase the probability of setting up production affiliates. Finally, as predicted by our heterogenous firm model, the size of the parent firm increases the probability of producing abroad. The paper is related to the recent strand of literature studying the role of wholesalers in international trade (Yamawaki 1991), focusing on their role in trade intermediation (Blum et al. 2010; Bernard et al. 2010).
Footnote 3 Wholesale trade affiliates in our study are not intermediaries but integrated units of a manufacturing firm that operate in a foreign market. We examine the decision of multinational firms to serve the foreign market through wholesale trade or to produce there. Our paper is, therefore, also related to a broader literature that examines the relationship between foreign production and export (Brainard 1997; Markusen and Venables 1998, 2000; Helpman et al. 2004). A recent paper by Krautheim (2009) presents the theory that we sketch in a more detailed and comprehensive way. He derives predictions at aggregated levels for the country-specific share of export-supporting FDI, i.e., the share of German foreign wholesale affiliate’s sales on total foreign affiliate sales in each country. The key prediction of his work relates the share of export-supporting FDI to trade costs approximated by distance costs. Our paper differs from Krautheim (2009) strongly in the empirical analysis. We bring the micro-level prediction of the model directly to the micro-level data when analyzing the decision to set a production plant or a distribution affiliate at the firm level. Bilateral distance plays an important role in the choice of the foreign sales strategies of German multinational enterprises (MNEs), but other variables do also affect the decision. We show that next to gravity forces fixed branch-plant fixed costs and the wage differences also matter. The empirical literature relying on aggregate data gives support to the model of horizontal multinationals in which outward FDI substitutes for exports (Brainard 1997; Blonigen et al. 2003; Buch et al. 2005; Carr et al. 2001; Kleinert and Toubal 2010).
Footnote 4 However, empirical studies that use firm-level data find mixed evidence (Hanson et al. 2005; Blonigen 2001). In our paper, multinationals face a decision between foreign production and foreign distribution. This choice slightly deviates from the export versus affiliate production which is assumed in most of the models in the literature. As mentioned above, data availability imposes this deviation from the usual approach. For our sample, we find support for the discrete choice between the two alternative strategies to supply the foreign market as it is assumed in the theory. The paper is divided into six sections. In the following section, we derive a simple version of the proximity-concentration model. Thereby, we focus explicitly on the decision made by the firm. We present our estimation strategy in Sect. 3 and explain how we apply the model to the data. In Sect. 4, we give detailed information on our firm-level database. We present the empirical results in Sect. 5 We summarize and conclude in Sect. 6.",8
149,3,Review of World Economics,30 May 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0160-7,Trade protection and market power: evidence from US antidumping and countervailing duties,September 2013,Laura Rovegno,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"As the use of traditional forms of import protection has been limited by multilateral negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/World Trade Organization (WTO), governments have turned to alternative means of restricting trade. Particularly relevant among these are contingent protection measures such as antidumping (AD) and countervailing (CV) duties. Originally, AD/CV measures were conceived as instruments to protect domestic producers against competition from what was deemed as “unfairly” cheap imports, either because foreign firms were “dumping” their products in the domestic market or because they were being subsidised by foreign governments. However, given the way in which these policies are designed and implemented, the trade literature tends to view them mostly as industry-policy tools aimed at protecting domestic producers in the face of increasing import competition (Blonigen and Prusa 2003; Konings and Vandenbussche 2005). For this reason, it is crucial to evaluate their effects on domestic markets, particularly on competition. This paper contributes to the debate by studying the impact of AD/CV duties on domestic producers’ market power. In particular, it analyses the changes in observable price-cost margins (PCM) in industries receiving AD/CV duty protection. At first glance, AD/CV duties are just another form of import tariffs. The effect of tariffs on domestic prices has been widely studied by trade theorists: import tariffs increase domestic prices (Helpman and Krugman 1989). Under general assumptions, in imperfectly competitive markets the same can be said about markups. A tariff on imports has an anticompetitive effect on the market, which decreases the elasticity of demand for the domestic product, allowing domestic firms to raise markups.
Footnote 1 Therefore, we might expect to observe an increase in PCM following the imposition of AD/CV duties. However, there are opposing forces that can offset these effects. Firstly, unlike other forms of trade restrictions, AD/CV duties are imposed against particular importing countries. Therefore, duties may lead not only to a switch between imports and domestic production but also to trade diversion among import sources, limiting the ability of domestic producers to increase markups. Moreover, even if duties allow for large increases in domestic prices, effects on markups may be smaller if suppliers of protected sectors are able to capture part of these rents through increases in input prices (Pierce 2011). Additionally, as is the case with any form of import restriction, the effects of AD/CV duties on competition depend on the degree of contestability of the import competing industries. If the imposition of trade barriers increases entry by new domestic firms or through foreign direct investment (FDI; tariff jumping) this will also limit the ability of incumbent firms to raise markups (Konings and Vandenbussche 2005). This is not the first attempt to analyse empirically the impact of contingent protection on market power. Previous studies have examined this phenomenon using a variety of methods and data, but the evidence remains mixed. Nieberding (1999) is an early reference providing some evidence of increased market power of protected firms. The author tests the single difference change in PCM of nine US firms involved in four AD petitions. He finds that protected firms present higher market power after the imposition of AD duties. Konings and Vandenbussche (2005) study the change in EU firms’ markups receiving AD duty protection. They use a panel of firms operating in sectors that received AD protection as well as a randomly drawn control group of firms in sectors not involved in AD. They find a positive effect of AD duties on protected firms’ markups. Blonigen et al. (2007) study the impact of different trade measures on market power in the US steel industry using product data. In their study only voluntary restraint agreements increase markups while tariffs, including AD and CV duties, have little effect on market power. Finally, Pierce (2011) studies the impact of AD on US producers using a difference-in-difference approach and census plant-level data. He finds that markups increase with the rate of protection, but does not find a statistically significant average effect from the mere presence of AD duties. The analysis presented in this paper differs from previous studies in several ways. It uses information on AD/CV petitions filed in the United States between 1980 and 2005, coming from the World Bank’s Temporary Trade Barriers Database (Bown 2010). Crucially, this sample covers two major reforms to AD/CV rules, the 1984 US Trade and Tariff Act and the Uruguay Round (UR) 1995 reform, allowing for a comparison of the effect of AD/CV measures under the different regimes. The length and coverage of the data also give the result more generality by considering all cases affecting manufacturing industries (95 % of total AD/CV cases) in a period of 26 years, therefore, covering a wider spectrum of AD/CV activity in terms of products, periods and targeted countries. Also, while most previous studies focus on AD, here CV duties are taken into account as well. Markups are approximated by means of observed PCM as discussed by Tybout (2003), using data from 375 manufacturing industries, 176 of which were involved in AD/CV filings. An important advantage of these industry data is that they are annual, allowing the analysis of the changes in markups in a dynamic setting and the use econometric techniques that take advantage of these dynamics. In order to measure the level of AD/CV protection at the industry level, AD/CV duties are weighted by the share of the imports directly concerned by the measures (product and source) on total imports competing with the corresponding industries. This allows consideration of the relative importance of targeted sources on imports of the product, as well as the relevance of the affected product. In order to control for potential endogeneity in AD/CV duties two methods are used, instrumental variables and propensity score matching. The empirical analysis finds evidence of a positive effect of AD/CV duties on PCM for the period prior to the UR reform. However, it fails to find a statistically significant effect from the post-1995 period. This suggests that the changes introduced to the law following the UR have had important consequences in terms of the use and effect of contingent protection measures. Although it is not possible to test with the data at hand which particular aspect of the reform may be causing this result, it is likely that the limitation in the duration of AD/CV measures to a maximum of 5 years may have affected the ability of domestic producers to use these measures as a means of protecting monopolistic rents. The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a brief description of US legislation on AD and CV measures, as well as the reforms to the rules during the period of analysis. The data and empirical methodology are described in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents the results and Sect. 5 concludes.",8
149,3,Review of World Economics,18 May 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0156-3,The two-sided effect of financial globalization on output volatility,September 2013,Barbara Meller,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Much research has been conducted on the issue of economic growth. However, as important as economic growth is its volatility. High output volatility discourages investment into a country and it increases the risk premiums and thereby the cost of capital in and of the country; see Jayasuriya (2005). Next to these direct consequences of output volatility, it also has a lasting negative effect on output growth, as was demonstrated by Ramey and Ramey (1995) and others. After a crisis, which is nothing else than very high output volatility, there is almost always a drop in growth and a slowdown of the economy (Caprio 1997). The resulting high unemployment has a disproportionate impact on the poorest; see Stiglitz (2000). This might increase social inequality and even foster political unrest as can currently be observed in some European countries. Therefore, it is important to understand how the gross domestic product (GDP) volatility can be reduced. With output volatility in mind, countries have to decide on the extent of their financial integration. Experience from the past 25 years has led to uncertainty regarding the effect of financial openness on output volatility. On the one hand, the financially deeply integrated United States had, from the 1980s until recently, been experiencing declining output volatility, termed the Great Moderation. On the other hand, some developing countries that had opened up their financial markets, i.e. Argentina, experienced deep economic crises in the 1980s or 1990s. Most recently, the financially integrated countries of the European Union were affected differently by the global financial crises. While the shock was exacerbated in some countries leading to a severe economic crisis as in Greece, Portugal or Spain, other countries, such as Germany, seem to recover quickly from a less severe economic downturn. With those different experiences we are left to wonder whether financial openness leads to a decline in output volatility or to economic crises. The lack of generally accepted criteria make the decision on the degree of openness with respect to international financial markets difficult. No consensus has been reached yet on the question of whether financial openness reduces or increases output volatility. On the one hand, researchers expect financial openness to stabilize the economy. This is because financial openness allows investments and savings to be efficiently allocated across geographic areas; see Fischer (1998). Especially in recessions, greater access to (international) capital, and thus borrowing, decreases economic volatility by reducing the sensitivity of consumption and investments to negative income shocks. Since domestic output, in turn, depends on consumption and investment, there are fewer second-round effects on output. In other words, the “traditional multiplier” response is decreased; see Dynan et al. (2006). On the other hand, financial openness might increase output volatility due to movements of “hot money”. Kim and Singal (2000) argue that international money is withdrawn if there is a deterioration in expectations about interest rates or economic growth. The real economy is not sufficiently supplied with credits and is hit harder by an economic downturn. Easterly et al. (2001) and Stiglitz (2000) therefore characterize international capital flows as potentially pro-cyclical and as inducing or amplifying output fluctuations. As theory is inconclusive, empirical research should shed light on the relation between financial openness and output volatility. However, empirical evidence is rather mixed and does not resolve the issue. Owing to the inconclusiveness of past research, Rogoff et al. (2009) hypothesize, without testing, that this relation might depend on a threshold level of one or several variable(s). This paper develops the idea of a threshold effect further. We hypothesize that the effect of financial openness on output volatility can be positive or negative depending on how financially risky the country is perceived by investors. In order to capture investors’ believes of financial risk, we choose the financial risk indicator of the international country risk guide (ICRG). It combines the information of five financial risk measures: Foreign debt as a percentage of GDP, foreign debt service as a percentage of exports of goods and services, current account as a percentage of exports of good and services, net international liquidity as months of import cover and exchange rate stability. The ICRG advertises that this indicator assesses the ability of a country to pay its official, commercial and trade debts. The indicator, inter alia, is used by investors to asses the risk of a country before investing into this country. If a country bears more financial risk than a certain threshold level, financial openness increases output volatility. In those countries, investors withdraw their capital in times of recessions because they fear, e.g. a sovereign default or an exchange rate collapse. Thereby they deepen the recession. By contrast, countries which bear less financial risk than this threshold level attract new capital in times of recessions because investors are confident that their investment is repaid and even obtains a good yield due to better profit prospects. In this paper we empirically test for the significance of these two opposing effects of financial openness on output volatility by using Hansen’s (1999) panel threshold model. The model determines data-driven thresholds and classifies countries as bearing different levels of financial risk. In line with the hypothesis, we find that financial openness increases output volatility in the high-risk classes, while it decreases output volatility in the low-risk class. This relation between financial openness, financial risk and output volatility is very robust as it is invulnerable to modifications to the operating definition of the variables, the sample size and the functional form of the model. The results of this paper can contribute to the decision-making process of policy makers that (re)consider the financial integration of their country. The paper is organized as follows. The next section embeds the paper into the empirical literature and describes the threshold model. Section 3 describes the choice of variables and the data. Section 4 reports the estimation results of a linear model, a model with interaction term and the panel threshold model. Section 5 demonstrates the robustness of the results. Section 6 illustrates the effect of financial openness on Argentina and briefly discusses the policy implication of this paper. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes.",7
149,3,Review of World Economics,05 May 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0155-4,Does foreign aid promote recipient exports to donor countries?,September 2013,Felicitas Nowak-Lehmann,Inmaculada Martínez-Zarzoso,Adriana Cardozo,Female,Female,Female,Female,"The aid literature has shown that foreign aid is promoting exports from donor to recipient countries, with effects varying by donor and over time.Footnote 1 While there are many reasons that could account for such an effect, one is that aid promotes overall bilateral trade between donor and recipient. In that case, the logical next question to ask is whether aid is indeed promoting the other side of that bilateral trade, i.e. exports from recipients to donors. That is the subject of this paper. This is all the more important as promoting developing country exports is seen as one of the main ways for poor countries to grow and develop faster. Both the Doha Development Round and the UN declaration on the Millennium Development Goals emphasise the importance of improving trade in developing countries, especially in the least developed countries. More specifically, Millennium Development Goal 8 (“Develop a global partnership for development”) is concerned with promoting a better participation of developing countries in international trade through improved access to developed countries’ markets and an active improvement in production and export capabilities in developing countries by means of official development assistance (ODA), especially aid for trade (AfT) measures.Footnote 2 In this context, foreign aid is also seen as a means to alleviate the lack of net capital inflows to the least developed countries and to overcome severe supply-side constraints (physical and social infrastructure, insufficient capabilities in agriculture, manufacturing and services). It is therefore important to analyse whether aid is an appropriate means to promote the production of export goods and thus enhance export-led development, which in turn could decrease the aid-dependency of developing countries. As we will argue in Sect. 2, development aid may have both positive and negative effects on recipient countries’ exports and it is up to empirical research to determine which prevail. Last but not least, this issue is important because donors are becoming increasingly interested in aid effectiveness, having agreed on an increase in their aid-to-GDP ratio to 0.7 % by 2015; if it served to actually promote the exports of recipient countries, aid would appear to be effective in this respect and the increase would be warranted. All the more, it is surprising that empirical evidence on this issue is rather limited and has produced conflicting results. Most of the literature is actually focused on examining whether aid can promote overall exports of recipients. For example, Munemo et al. (2007) apply fixed-effect instrumental variable (FE-IV) estimators to a sample of 84 developing countries (unbalanced panel) and find a positive and significant relationship between aid and exports. However, in a sample of 72 recipient countries (balanced panel), this relationship becomes statistically insignificant. Kang et al. (2010) present results for 30 recipient countries utilising data for the period 1966–2002. Using a heterogeneous panel vector autoregression model, they find a positive relationship between aid and exports for 13 countries and a negative relationship for 17 countries. Brenton and von Uexkull (2009) study the effectiveness of export development programs by applying a difference-in-difference approach. They find evidence of a positive relationship between technical assistance for trade and developing countries’ exports in the sense that trade assistance performs better if export activity is already strong, or that aid precedes or is correlated with a better export performance. Ferro et al. (2011) find aid has a positive effect on services, in general, on downstream manufacturing exports of developing countries across regions and income-level groups. More related to our work, Helble et al. (2012) examine the link between specific types of aid and bilateral trade flows, focusing on the link between aid spent on trade facilitation and recipients’ exports to and imports from their trading partners using a gravity model. They find mixed evidence for aid effectiveness indicating that in general AfT facilitation is generally more related to higher exports and only weakly related to higher imports. With regard to other aid flows (different from AfT), Helble et al. (2012) find that this variable is negatively associated with recipients’ exports and positively associated to their imports. Johansson and Pettersson (2009) and Pettersson and Johansson (2012) also use a gravity model and find a positive relationship between aid and recipient countries’ exports. These authors use country fixed effects (importer-specific and exporter-specific effects) to control for unobserved heterogeneity and time fixed effects. Non-stationarity and autocorrelation are not taken into account, and endogeneity of aid is controlled for with instruments. Our econometric analysis is also based on the gravity model. We use the usual control variables (Bergstrand 1985, 1989, 1990; Anderson and van Wincoop 2003; Nelson and Juhasz Silva 2012; Pettersson and Johansson 2012), but augment the model by bilateral exchange rates and three different types of foreign aid that are all measured on a bilateral level. The bilateral exchange rate is added to take changes in competitiveness between trading partners into account and the different types of aid are included to control for crowding-out effects between donors. The most important difference in regard to previous studies is our endeavour to study the link between bilateral aid and bilateral trade more rigorously by accounting for unobserved heterogeneity more carefully. Our first and main contribution is thus to assure that changes in recipients’ bilateral trade can in fact be traced back to changes in bilateral aid. This is achieved by accounting for the role played by unobservable or unquantifiable characteristics that affect donor-recipient relations (bilateral relations). These bilateral relations can be more or less visible and form the foundation of or become the catalyst for trade: bilateral aid can enhance bilateral trade not only through reputation, mutual trust and support, goodwill and familiarity between trading partners of the North and the South (Arvin and Baum 1997; Arvin and Choudry 1997; Pettersson and Johansson 2012, Nowak-Lehmann et al. 2012; Martínez-Zarzoso et al. 2009), but also through more visible outcomes, such as the creation of customer relations, distribution channels and a better adaptation to the formal and informal market environment. We account for these unobservable or unquantifiable characteristics (i) by utilising country-pair-specific effects (dyadic effects) and (ii) by using panel cointegration techniques that control for omitted variables and endogeneity biases (see Sects. 2.2, 4.1).Footnote 3 The dyadic effects contain not only the information inherent in the country-specific characteristics, but also information with respect to the importance of bilateral ties between donors and recipients that do not change over time. As bilateral aid varies over time, what we are able to identify with our estimation strategy is the effect of the within variation of aid on trade over time for each pair of countries. The second contribution is to use panel time series estimation techniques that are based on the concept of cointegration. The cointegration technique addresses the spurious regression problem associated with the non-stationarity of many economic variables.Footnote 4 In addition, and equally important, cointegration estimators are robust to potential endogeneity or reverse causality problems and can account for autocorrelation. In fact, Granger causality tests indicate that, in the long run, aid stands in a bi-directional relationship with donors’ exports, while it has a unidirectional relationship with recipient countries’ exports. However, recipient countries’ exports generate feed-back on other right-hand side variables other than aid (such as donors’ income, recipients’ income, recipients’ per capita income) thus creating an endogeneity problem. By taking the time series properties into account and by applying the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) technique to our cointegrated series, we are able to “exogenise” all right-hand side variables. Control for omitted variable and endogeneity bias plus autocorrelation is achieved through the dynamic feasible generalised least squares (DFGLS) procedure (see Sect. 4.1). Our third contribution is to examine crowding-out effects of aid from different donors. More specifically, we investigate whether aid only promotes trade with a given donor at the expense of other donors, or whether it promotes overall trade with all donors. This is done by considering three different types of aid: first, the bilateral aid of a single donor-recipient pair with a supposedly very high positive impact on bilateral trade relations; second, bilateral aid from all other donors to a single recipient with a possibly trade-diverting (negative) impact on an existing bilateral trade relation, and third, multilateral aid to a single recipient with presumably no impact on existing bilateral trade relations. Using panel cointegration techniques that account for unobserved heterogeneity and control for endogeneity as well as for autocorrelation, we find that the effect of aid on recipient countries’ exports is insignificant. We therefore conclude that after controlling for country-pair unobserved heterogeneity aid has no observable (net) effect on recipients’ exports, at least during the sample period (1988–2007). Any positive effect of increased aid is apparently countered by negative effects related to the macro impact of aid on the recipient country. Further results are that aid impacts weakly, but positively on investment, negatively on domestic savings (crowding-out effect) and negatively on the real exchange rate (appreciation of the real exchange rate). The remainder of this paper is organised into five sections. Section 2 discusses the model specification and the transmission channels related to the aid-export link. Section 3 presents a description of the data. Section 4 explains the estimation technique and discusses the results. Section 5 presents a number of robustness checks. Finally, Sect. 6 outlines some conclusions.",29

In March 2005 donors agreed not only to better align foreign aid flows with priorities of the recipient country and to harmonize procedural issues of aid delivery. They also promised to render aid more effective by “eliminating duplication of efforts and rationalising donor activities to make them as cost-effective as possible” (OECD 2005: paragraph 3). Donors “commit to make full use of their respective comparative advantage at sector or country level” (paragraph 35), acknowledging that aid fragmentation impairs effectiveness while “a pragmatic approach to the division of labour … can reduce transaction costs” (paragraph 33).Footnote 1
 Yet, as stressed by Chandy and Laurence (2011), “commitments are regularly professed but rarely fulfilled” in international development cooperation. It seems that donors want to “plant their flags” almost everywhere (World Bank 1998: 26), even though Knack and Rahman (2007) show theoretically and empirically that aid fragmentation impairs bureaucratic quality in highly aid dependent countries. According to Easterly (2007: 639–640), the inclination of donors “to give to all sectors in all countries” causes severe coordination problems and “huge administrative costs for both recipients and donors.” Indeed, descriptive statistics suggest that aid fragmentation and duplication persisted (Aldasoro et al. 2010). The largely qualitative evidence presented in various monitoring reports of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) (e.g. OECD 2011a) points to a lack of progress also in the most recent period after the Paris Declaration. More systematic quantitative analyses controlling for the heterogeneity of donors and other confounding factors are scarce, however. The subsequent analysis contributes to filling the wide gaps that remain. We attempt to isolate the effects of the Paris Declaration on aid fragmentation and donor coordination by performing multivariate regression analyses. In particular, we quantify the degree of donor coordination by employing an innovate measure of aid overlaps. Our analysis accounts for the allocation of aid by 19 donors across 140 recipient countries and 24 aid sectors before and after the Paris Declaration. Our regression results corroborate that aid fragmentation persisted after the Paris declaration, and coordination among donors has even weakened. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we review the previous literature and identify remaining research gaps. Section 3 introduces the methodology and the variables employed in the empirical analysis, while Sect. 4 presents the results. Section 5 briefly summarizes the main findings and provides some concluding remarks.",44

The growth of Chinese exports in world trade,September 2013,Steven Husted,Shuichiro Nishioka,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over the past two decades the Chinese economy has grown at a remarkable pace. Between 1995 and 2007 Chinese real GDP grew at an average annual rate of more than 10 %. Per capita real GDP rose by 250 % over this period.Footnote 1 One of the leading factors driving this economic growth has been the extraordinary performance of Chinese exports. According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), in 2010 China ranked first in exports to the world market with merchandise export sales of more than $1.5 trillion and a world market share of 10.4 %. In 1998, China had less than 2 % of the world market. Twenty years earlier, China’s share was essentially zero. As China’s share of world exports has grown, it has come under increasing pressure to allow its currency to appreciate; often the criticism of its exchange rate practices includes charges that other developing and emerging market economies have borne the brunt in terms of lost export markets.Footnote 2
 The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of Chinese export growth over the period when its share of world exports rose most rapidly, the years 1995–2010. We provide detail on the commodity composition of Chinese exports and how this composition has changed. We also discuss some aspects of the geographic pattern and commodity composition of Chinese trade. In addition, a fundamental contribution of this paper is that we provide considerable evidence that the principal exporting countries that have lost market share to China are developed countries, especially Japan and the United States. We use Constant Market Share (CMS) analysis (i.e., Fagerberg and Sollie 1987) to determine which of five factors (i.e., market share, commodity composition, commodity adaptation, market composition, and market adaptation) are responsible for the rise of Chinese share. During the period we consider, the market share effect is the critical factor to explain the share change in the world trade. This element of trade growth captures the extent to which an exporter gains or loses market share against other exporters independent of changes in the product and destination pattern of world imports. In particular, almost all share gains of China over the period 1995–2010 (i.e., the market share effect accounts for 11.6 of 12.9 percentage points (pp.) of Chinese share gains) stem from the market share effects.Footnote 3
 We also apply CMS analysis to the sub-periods of 1995–2000, 2000–2005, and 2005–2010. In the period of 1995–2000, the share gain of China was relatively moderate (2.9 pp.) and Japan and Germany lost market share in roughly equal amounts (2.4 and 2.2 pp., respectively). The United States also saw its world export market share rise during this period, due primarily to the commodity composition effect. That is, the United States gained market share because the structure of world import demand changed toward the types of goods that the United States exports. During the period 2000–2005, Chinese market share increased by 5.8 pp. and the majority of Chinese share gains were accompanied by the significant market share loss of the United States (−4.0 pp.). Finally, over the sub-period (2005–2010) that included the great trade collapse of 2008–2009, China’s share increased by 4.2 pp. and the market share and commodity adaptation effects both explain the share changes. While developed countries’ demands for manufacturing goods had slowed due to the financial crisis, developing countries’ demands for foreign manufacturing goods were relatively strong. China had increased its world market share by exporting intensively to emerging developing countries.Footnote 4
 The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 we present an overview of Chinese trade expansion. In Sect. 3 we discuss CMS analysis, an empirical technique that provides a method for studying changes in export market shares. In Sect. 4, we apply CMS to study trade patterns among a sample of 94 countries over the period 1995–2010 in commodity trade disaggregated at the 5-digit SITC level. We also apply CMS to study the periods to 1995–2000, 2000–2005, and 2005–2010. In Sect. 5, we expand our analysis by focusing on export behavior across industries and in individual export markets. Section 6 offers our conclusions.",17
149,3,Review of World Economics,19 June 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0159-0,Trade effects of alternative carbon border-tax schemes,September 2013,Aaditya Mattoo,Arvind Subramanian,Jianwu He,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In industrial countries contemplating emissions reductions, there have been calls for additional border taxes on imports from countries with lower carbon prices. Countries with higher carbon prices may seek to impose additional border taxes for two reasons: to offset the competitiveness disadvantage to their firms, and to prevent the “leakage” of carbon emissions in the form of increased production in countries with lower carbon prices. A key issue is therefore the scope for trade policy actions in any climate change agreement. US Senators Kerry and Graham wrote in the New York Times that, … we cannot sacrifice another job to competitors overseas. China and India are among the many countries investing heavily in clean-energy technologies that will produce millions of jobs. There is no reason we should surrender our marketplace to countries that do not accept environmental standards. For this reason, we should consider a border tax on items produced in countries that avoid these standards. This is consistent with our obligations under the World Trade Organization and creates strong incentives for other countries to adopt tough environmental protections.Footnote 1
 The eponymous legislation that these two senators had proposed provided for such trade actions, as did a subsequent incarnation proposed by Senators Kerry and Lieberman. President Nicholas Sarkozy of France joined the charge when he said, “We need to impose a carbon tax at [Europe’s] borders. I will lead that battle.”Footnote 2 Nobel-prize winning trade economist, Paul Krugman issued his own endorsement, arguing that carbon taxes at the border are “a matter of leveling the playing field, not protectionism.”Footnote 3 And the World Trade Organization (WTO) itself has given a cautious nod: “Rules permit, under certain conditions, the use of border tax adjustments on imported and exported products,” says an appropriately guarded report, jointly issued by the trade body and the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP and WTO, 2009). What is the likely impact of these border tax adjustments (BTAs)? And how should they be optimally designed? These are the questions addressed in this paper. Consider first the alternative rationales for BTAs. From a trade perspective, BTAs applied symmetrically to imports and exports essentially transform production-based taxes into consumption-based taxes (Grossman 1980). Such adjustments do not alter the incentives within a country to produce exports or importables. From an environmental perspective, BTAs are aimed at ensuring that the emissions reductions achieved within a country through a tax (production tax) are not totally offset by the increase in emissions that occurs in partner countries by virtue of expanded trade. That is, BTAs attempt to tax the emissions in trade. One difference between the efficiency and environmental motivations for BTAs is that with the former, a country would apply BTAs regardless of what partner countries do. In contrast, with the latter, BTAs are typically aimed only at countries that do not take some or comparable action on emissions reductions. Most of the existing literature focuses on the consequences for the industrial countries of unilateral emissions reductions and/or offsetting trade actions. The studies on the United States (Fisher and Fox 2009; Ho et al. 2008; Houser et al. 2008), the European UnionFootnote 4 and industrial countries in general (Burniaux et al. 2010) typically examine two outcomes: the overall emissions reductions—the so-called leakage issue; and the impact on producers of energy-intensive goods in rich countries—the so-called competitiveness issue. The broad findings are that unilateral actions lead to relatively small leakage in terms of aggregate emissions, but there can be larger emissions and competitiveness effects in some sectors, for example, cement, steel, and aluminum, which can be partially offset through trade actions. However, these papers do not quantify the impact of these trade actions on developing countries. In contrast, Atkinson et al. (2010) adopt a more global approach and calculate the effective tariff that exporting countries would face on their goods if all importing countries placed a small domestic emissions tax. However, even this study does not measure the resulting trade and output consequences. In a study subsequent to ours, Dong and Whalley (2009) consider broader implications but focus only on border tax adjustment based on the carbon content in domestic production, and therefore cannot show the implications of alternative approaches to BTA. The main contribution of our study is to quantify the effects of alternative approaches to BTA on emissions, as well as on sectoral exports and output of all countries, industrial and developing. Hence, for many of the vital policy questions that are the subject of this paper, there are today no good answers based on empirical research. An econometric approach seems handicapped by the absence of past events, and our inability to construct experiments, which are comparable with the policy changes of greatest interest. We therefore use a multi-country, multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to derive our quantitative estimates. In situations of simultaneous climate and trade policy changes of the kind that we consider in this paper, in which there could be significant interaction among the policies of different countries, and where we are interested in quantifying the effects of policy change on output and trade in different sectors of the economy, a CGE approach seems appropriate (Kehoe et al. 2005). This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe some recent initiatives on trade actions in the context of climate change legislation and the WTO status of such actions. In Sect. 3, we spell out the scenarios that underlie our empirical analysis. In Sect. 4, we present the results of our quantitative analysis. In Sect. 5, we discuss the implications of our results for the optimal design of international rules on trade actions. Section 6 provides a concluding assessment.",15
149,4,Review of World Economics,27 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0166-1,"Domestic multinationals, foreign affiliates, and labour demand elasticities",December 2013,Olivier N. Godart,Holger Görg,David Greenaway,Male,Male,Male,Male,"A general concern about multinational firms in developed countries is that they export activities abroad and substitute employees even in response to small labour cost changes (Horst 1978; Barba-Navaretti et al. 2003). In other words, their operations may be regarded as highly footloose. Such a link between multinational firms and highly wage elastic labour demand is said to contribute to labour market instability (Rodrik 1997; Scheve and Slaughter 2004; Andrews et al. 2012). This argument, however, has been criticized because multinationals possess extensive skill-intensive activities in domestic headquarters which shape multinationals’ competitive advantage (Markusen 1995; Hanson et al. 2005) and arguably also the elasticity of their labour demand. Thus far, however no empirical analysis has looked at the potential protecting role of headquarter activities for labour demand elasticity estimations, despite the evidence that skill intensity reduces the wage elasticity of labour demand (Hamermesh 1993). This paper presents a first attempt to close this gap in the literature. More specifically, we investigate differences in labour demand adjustment in domestic multinationals compared to affiliates of foreign firms, using firm level data for the United Kingdom. We attribute any differences in labour demand elasticities between the two groups of firms to the role of headquarter activities in domestic multinationals. Indeed, although domestic and foreign multinationals have many characteristics in common—they are both located in the same country, and both have access to some firm-specific asset—domestic multinational firms by definition have their headquarters in the domestic economy. By contrast, foreign owned multinational firms are generally affiliates, with headquarters located abroad. This may have important implications for labour demand adjustments. Headquarter services are intangible inputs which are characterized by tradability and some aspects of public goods, and they are the most skill-intensive activities of a multinational (Markusen 2002). They might be used by foreign affiliates but are generally assumed to be generated in the home country of a multinational (Davies 2005). Foreign affiliates use these skill-intensive inputs generated in the home country and combine them with local factors of production.Footnote 1 Hence, we may expect that the headquarter activities of domestic multinationals are related to labour demand that is less responsive to changes in wage rates, i.e., their wage elasticity of labour demand is lower than in affiliates of foreign firms. There are a number of papers that look at differences in labour demand elasticities between multinationals and non-multinationals or in foreign and domestic firms. In a recent contribution, Nilsson Hakkala et al. (2010) look at such differences between multinationals and non-multinationals using firm level data for Sweden. They find that wage elasticities are higher in multinationals than in domestic firms, in line with the perception that multinationals are more footloose. However, as they do not distinguish foreign and domestic multinationals but only estimate an average wage elasticity for all multinationals, they may overstate the wage elasticity for domestic multinationals and understate that for foreign firms. Nilsson Hakkala et al. (2010) define a multinational firm as domestic firms with affiliates abroad (domestic multinational) or foreign affiliates of multinationals headquartered abroad (foreign multinational). This is in contrast to a number of earlier studies, which only consider differences in wage elasticities of labour demand between foreign multinationals and domestic firms and that do not distinguish domestic multinationals from purely domestic firms (e.g., Barba-Navaretti et al. 2003; Görg et al. 2009). Barba-Navaretti et al. (2003) hypothesize that foreign firms may be more volatile employers and hence they should be less rigid in their labour demand elasticity when compared to the average domestic firm. They find mixed results. In some countries the hypothesis holds but in others the opposite is true. This may be partly explained by the fact that they compare foreign firms with all domestic firms, and do not distinguish the latter into multinationals and non-multinationals. Görg et al. (2009) in a study using firm level data for Ireland find clear evidence that labour demand elasticity is higher in foreign than in domestic firms, a finding in line with Nilsson Hakkala et al. (2010). However, Görg et al. (2009) can also not say anything about labour demand elasticities in domestic multinationals vis-à-vis that of foreign firms. In sum, none of these firm level studies allow for the fact that domestic multinationals may adjust labour demand quite differently from affiliates of foreign firms due to their headquarter activities. However, this is an important issue from a policy point of view. As Criscuolo and Martin (2009) show, the number of plants belonging to foreign and domestic multinationals is roughly similar in the United Kingdom. They each account for about 2 % of plants, 21 % of employment and just over a quarter of value added in the population of manufacturing plants in the UK.Footnote 2 Hence, investigating whether these types of firms adjust labour demand differently is an empirically important question. This is the issue we address in this paper using firm level data for the UK. By doing so, our study adds to the existing literature in a number of ways: Firstly, our data allows us to distinguish foreign multinationals from domestic multinationals. Using firm level data for the UK manufacturing sector from 1996 to 2005 we are, thus able to explore differences in labour demand elasticities between foreign and domestic multinationals. We find that labour demand elasticity in domestic multinationals is significantly lower (in absolute terms) than in foreign multinationals, as expected. Secondly, we investigate whether this difference in the wage elasticity is driven by differences in measurable firm level skill intensities. Whereas we find that skill intensity is negatively associated with wage elasticity (in absolute terms), it is also the case that even when controlling for firm level skill differences in two different ways, labour demand in domestic multinationals is still less wage sensitive than in foreign multinational firms. Thirdly, this difference in wage elasticity is also robust to the inclusion of the share of intangible assets in total sales. This variable is by nature strongly related to headquarter services and skill intensity. Our econometric results are economically significant. On average, labour demand elasticities are about 40 % lower in domestic multinationals than in affiliates of foreign-owned firms based in the UK. This finding is consistent with the view that the presence of headquarter services reduces substantially the exposure of labour demand to own labour cost shocks. In the following section, we discuss the background to our analysis. In Sect. 3, we specify our empirical strategy and then introduce our data in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5, our results are presented and in the last section we provide conclusions.",2
149,4,Review of World Economics,18 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0163-4,Offshoring and the skill structure of labour demand,December 2013,Neil Foster-McGregor,Robert Stehrer,Gaaitzen J. de Vries,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the most pervasive features of the labour market in recent times has been the rising demand for skilled workers relative to unskilled workers in Europe and the United States (Autor and Dorn 2009; Goos et al. 2011; Du Caju et al. 2012; Kemeny and Rigby 2012; Michaels et al. 2013). Despite a concomitant increase in the supply of skilled workers, relative wages of skilled workers have risen in almost all industries. As a result, the wage share of skilled workers in manufacturing value added has increased in OECD countries. Timmer et al. (2012) for example measure the value added shares of production factors in global value chains and find that the value added share of high-skilled workers in global manufacturing by the United States and Europe has been increasing, while that of low- and medium-skilled workers has fallen. At the same time as these changes have been witnessed in the labour market, the ongoing globalisation process has seen the increasing frequency of international outsourcing—or offshoring—of production, involving the contracting out of activities that were previously performed within a production unit to foreign subcontractors. An important ongoing research question of direct policy relevance is the issue of whether increased offshoring is a cause of the rising demand for skilled workers in advanced countries. The establishment of international production networks associated with off-shoring generates trade in intermediates, as has been shown by Campa and Goldberg (1997), Hummels et al. (2001) and Yeats (2001). While this would be expected to affect the composition of international trade it may also change the pattern of trade, as firms look to source intermediates from low cost suppliers. In the international trade literature one of the main driving forces behind production offshoring is the existence of differences in factor prices across national borders (e.g. Feenstra and Hanson 1996; Kohler 2004). Offshoring differs importantly from import penetration in final goods in the sense that it explicitly takes into account the extent to which firms move production (and service) activities abroad. Labour demand is therefore likely to be affected not only in import-competing industries, but also in all industries that use foreign inputs and services. The impact of offshoring on the labour market may not be limited to changing labour demands between industries therefore, but may also affect the relative demand for labour within industries. In particular, unskilled labour-intensive stages of production tend to be shifted to unskilled labour-abundant developing countries, while more technologically advanced stages remain in skilled labour-abundant developed countries. This has led to the fear in developed countries especially that offshoring will tend to reduce the demand for relatively unskilled workers therefore, resulting in either falling wages of unskilled labour and/or increased unemployment of unskilled labour. From a theoretical perspective however, it is by no means clear that this will be the case in a general equilibrium setting, with the overall effect depending on a number of factors (e.g. Jones and Kierzkowski 2001; Kohler 2004). It remains an open and empirical question therefore as to whether outsourcing is a large enough activity to have an adverse effect on labour market outcomes. There are a number of empirical studies examining the impact of production offshoring on the demand for unskilled labour in developed countries, examples including Feenstra and Hanson (1996) for the United States, Falk and Koebel (2002) for Germany, Strauss-Kahn (2003) for France and Hijzen et al. (2005) for the United Kingdom. The results tend to indicate that offshoring has had a negative impact on the demand for unskilled labour, with one or two exceptions. Feenstra and Hanson (1996) for example consider the case of the United States, regressing the change in the non-production wage share on the change in the log capital-output ratio, the change in log output and the change in offshoring. They find for the later period in their data set (i.e. 1979–1990) that offshoring contributed around 31 % of the increase in the nonproduction wage that occurred in the 1980s. Falk and Koebel (2002) use data for 26 German industries over the period 1978–1990. With their data they estimate a system of seven equations, one for each type of variable cost (different types of labour and materials). Their results provide little support for substitution effects between different types of labour and imported materials, with the increase in imported materials being driven by higher output growth rather than input substitution. Hijzen et al. (2005) also estimate a system of regressions for three different types of labour and materials using data on UK manufacturing industries over the period 1982–1986. Their results indicate a large negative effect of outsourcing on the demand for unskilled labour. Similar results to those of Hijzen et al. (2005) are presented by Strauss-Kahn (2003) for France. Despite these results the consensus view of empirical economists is that trade was not the major reason for rising wage inequality in the 1980s and early 1990s. This view is based upon a number of factors. Firstly, the share of skilled workers increased within most industries, which contrasts with the predictions of the basic Heckscher–Ohlin theory if one ignores trade in intermediate inputs (Feenstra 2010). Secondly, the demand for skilled workers was closely related to various measures of technology such as R&D, but not with measures of trade (Autor et al. 1998). Thirdly, calibrated general equilibrium models found only a small quantitative role of trade (Borjas et al. 1997). Recent research suggests that skill-biased technological change (SBTC) is still the main determinant of the rising demand for skilled workers. In particular, Michaels et al. (2013) examine skill demand related to investment in information and communication technologies (ICT) for a cross-section including the United States, Japan, and nine European countries. They find that changes in skill demand away from medium-skilled workers towards high-skilled workers are explained by changes in ICT capital inputs. The effects of trade openness are positive but insignificant when proxies for ICT are included in the model. However, Michaels et al. (2013) consider gross trade statistics that are increasingly unreliable measures of trade due to the rapid expansion of global production networks. Nowadays, two-thirds of all trade is in intermediates and (partly) as a result, gross exports have been growing much faster than GDP (Johnson and Noguera 2012). Krugman (2008) argues further that trade with emerging markets might have become much more important in driving the demand for skilled workers in recent years due to the fast growth in imports from low-skill abundant countries, notably China. In this paper, we extend and update earlier empirical results on the relationship between offshoring and relative skill demand. Our approach complements the analysis in Michaels et al. (2013) by refining and updating measures on the effects of trade. In particular, we use data from the recently compiled World Input–Output Database (WIOD) to examine the relationship between measures of offshoring and relative labour demand for 40 countries over the period 1995–2009. We develop and test an empirical model linking the cost shares of variable inputs (i.e. materials and different types of labour). The equations for the different cost shares are estimated using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), with the model being estimated separately for six different industry types. The current paper updates some of the earlier papers mentioned above to a more recent time period where relative wages and employment have been shown to behave differently to earlier periods (see Feenstra 2010, p. 31). The data set also allows us to consider a panel of data, with data compiled over the period 1995–2009, and allows us to consider a relatively large number of countries when compared with the above mentioned studies that often focus on a single country or a small sample. Our results indicate that while offshoring has impacted negatively upon all skill levels the largest impacts have been observed for medium-skilled (and to a lesser extent high-skilled) workers. Such results are consistent with recent evidence indicating that medium-skilled workers have suffered to a greater extent than other skill types in recent years (see for example Autor et al. (2006); Michaels et al. 2013). The remainder of the paper is set out as follows: Sect. 2 presents a simple model to be empirically implemented and discusses the econometric approach; Sect. 3 describes the data used in the later analysis and presents some data on trends in labour markets and offshoring activities; Sect. 4 describes our main results.

A multivariate probit approach,December 2013,Pinuccia Calia,Maria Rosaria Ferrante,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In the last decade, international trade has become one of the fastest growing economic activities worldwide. This remarkable expansion of firms across national borders has stimulated new theoretical developments and a considerable amount of empirical literature, emphasising the role of firm heterogeneity in decisions relating to the internationalisation process (for a review, see Greenaway and Kneller 2007, and Wagner 2007, 2012). The literature mainly focuses on forms of internationalisation such as export and foreign direct investments (FDI) but, in the last decades, offshoring (for a review see Wagner 2011) and non-equity forms of internationalisation have experienced a rapid growth (Chen 2003; Palmberg and Pajarinen 2005). Besides it has been observed that industrialised countries, in addition to the offshoring of materials, also engage in the international outsourcing of services (Amiti and Wei 2005, 2006). In other words, alongside the more traditional forms of internationalisation, a firm deciding on its internationalisation process may adopt other forms of international activity, such as strategic alliances, commercial penetration, cooperative agreements and service outsourcing. Despite the complexity of firm internationalisation patterns in the age of globalization, in the literature on internationalisation we find a limited number of empirical studies that have attempted to jointly consider a broader set of forms of internationalisation beyond export.Footnote 1
 In terms of the econometric tools used to jointly model firm internationalisation choices, multiple-choice models (ordered or unordered) have generally been used. Benfratello and Razzolini (2009) adopt a multinomial logit model for the categories of “no internationalisation”, “only export” and “export plus horizontal FDI” so they accumulate two categories by excluding the “only horizontal FDI” one. Also Bougheas and Görg (2008) estimate a multinomial logit model for the categories of “export”, “international outsourcing of production” and “ownership of foreign plant” by excluding some combination of them from the analysis. Basile et al. (2003) consider the categories “export”, “export and penetration operations”, and “export, penetration operations and FDI”, by modelling them with a univariate ordered probit, thereby assuming that the three categories are ordered and that the internationalisation process is cumulative. Recently, Oberhofer and Pfaffermayr (2012) use a bivariate probit to model the choice between export and FDI. In the real world, the set of choices available to a firm consist of “no internationalisation” and of all the possible combinations of different internationalisation modes (where combinations can be defined by considering two modes, three modes, and so on). For example, if we consider modes as being export, penetration operations and FDI, and for each mode we denote the “absence”/“presence” categories respectively with 0 and 1 codes, a firm can choose the following patterns: (a) (0,0,0), indicating a domestic firm, (b) (1,0,0) denoting firms performing only export, (c) (1,1,0) characterising firms jointly performing export and penetration operations, and so on until the category (1,1,1) that denotes firms performing all the modes considered. In this context, choices are exhaustive and mutually exclusive and the firm chooses only one combination of the whole set of modes available: the one that maximises its profit function. Multiple-choice models as multinomial logit or probit become cumbersome when a large number of forms of internationalisation is considered, because the different forms can be combined and each combination defines a choice representing a category of the outcome variable. Note that the number of possible combinations to be modelled for the example presented above is equal to 9, but this number quickly increases with the number of internationalisation modes considered (i.e. 4 modes results in 16 choices). The solution adopted in the above-mentioned empirical literature in order to limit the number of choices to be modelled, consists in disregarding the information about some forms of internationalisation, or in formulating an a priori selection of the combination of forms to be considered. The only exception is Oberhofer and Pfaffermayr (2012): the bivariate probit can predict all patterns of internationalisation that arise from export and FDI. Turning to the dimensions defining the heterogeneity of firms, the literature has largely focused on productivity. Recently, the role of other characteristics of firms besides productivity have been stressed, including innovative behaviour, proprietary assets, skill composition, organisational choices, accumulation of technology (Helpman 2006). This paper contributes to explanations of the nature of firm internationalisation processes and of their connection to firm heterogeneity in two ways. Firstly, to better represent the behaviour of firms, we consider a wide range of forms of internationalisation, adding to the more traditional export modes such as commercial penetration operations and agreements, the offshoring of production and the outsourcing of services abroad. In this framework, we illustrate the relevance of considering a pattern of choices that is as wide as possible in the study of firm internationalisation strategy. We show that neglecting some choices can lead to a partial description. Secondly, in order to take into account the entire set of available combinations of different forms of internationalisation and the relationships between them, we analyse the complexity of internationalisation processes in a multivariate framework. To this end, we use a multivariate probit model (MVP) that provides us with some advantages compared to other discrete choice models already used in the literature. In this light, our approach is similar to that taken by Oberhofer and Pfaffermayr (2012). These authors consider two forms of internationalisation and the resulting model is estimated with standard techniques. In the MVP model, every internationalisation mode corresponds to a binary choice (yes/no) and an equation is specified for each of them. In this way the number of outcome variables considered corresponds to the number of modes, and the simultaneous choice of some modes can be addressed through joint probabilities. At the same time, we do not need to establish an order within the patterns of internationalisation or to exclude some patterns from the analysis in order to limit the number of choices to be modelled. We draw directly from predictions about how different internationalisation options are associated and how these patterns combine with the various dimensions of firm heterogeneity. Besides, different binary choices are modelled jointly through correlations between disturbances, and this improves model estimates when correlations are significantly different from zero. In addition, we highlight how predictions are sensitive to the set of forms of internationalisation included in the estimated model. By exploiting the output produced by the estimation of the MVP model, which includes the estimated joint and conditional probabilities and their connection with the covariates, we can address the question of complementarity versus substitutability relationships between internationalisation modes, even if we are limited to a simplified setting where the host market features are overcome. We can also highlight which types of firm are more prone to choosing one type of strategy over another. For our analysis, we rely on data for years 2001–2003 provided by a sample survey on Italian manufacturing firms with more than ten employees conducted every 3 years by Capitalia Observatory,Footnote 2 a very rich micro-level dataset that includes information about various forms of international involvement. We use a large range of covariates besides productivity to describe the heterogeneity of firms. The paper is organised as follows: in Sect. 2 we provide a review of the literature on the international involvement of firms; Sect. 3 presents the MVP model; Sect. 4 contains a description of the data and some descriptive statistics; Sect. 5 describes the model specification; in Sect. 6, we present the model estimates and the results concerning the relationship between heterogeneity and internationalisation patterns; and Sect. 7 concludes.",9

149,4,Review of World Economics,25 August 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0169-y,Foreign aid and domestic output in the long run,December 2013,Dierk Herzer,Oliver Morrissey,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Aid financing, and the policy reform conditions typically associated with aid, is the cornerstone of international development strategies. The poorest developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), have insufficient domestic resources to finance their investment and development needs, while rich countries have a desire to assist countries that are less well off; aid serves these purposes as rich donors provide concessional finance to poor countries. The core premise is that such aid is effective in contributing to economic growth and development. This premise appears to be accepted at a global political level. The 2002 Financing for Development Conference in Monterrey, Mexico, and the 2005 G-8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, endorsed commitments by rich countries to increase the amount of foreign aid significantly, especially to Africa. In the same vein, the Report of the Commission for Africa (2005) advocated a doubling of aid to Africa. These commitments are often reiterated, such as at the L’Aquila Summit in 2009. There appears to be a political belief in the effectiveness of aid, although sceptics could counter that it is merely rhetoric as the commitments have not been fully met. This suggests a prior question to investigate: is there evidence that aid is related to output (thus growth) over time on average? This is the basic question addressed here, employing a different econometric methodology than in the existing literature. A large literature on aid effectiveness has attempted to provide empirical evidence without reaching any consensus. The initial division in the literature is captured by Burnside and Dollar (2000), who found that aid is effective in contributing to growth only conditional on policy, compared to Hansen and Tarp (2001) who found a positive effect of aid on growth independent of policy. This was reiterated later: Collier and Dollar (2004) support the aid conditional on policy argument whereas Dalgaard et al. (2004) support the dissenting view. ‘The debate is not without a certain amount of heat and passion… and there are still substantial differences’ (Hudson 2004: F189). A recent survey concludes that ‘the available evidence is generally too fragile to bear much weight, even though it has improved over time’ (Temple 2010: 4445). The empirical methodology employed in this literature contributes to the absence of robust results for at least two reasons. First, the reliance on cross-country panel growth regressions suffers from many limitations: failure to fully account for cross-country heterogeneity in aid effects; using growth as the dependent variable but levels as independent variables; and the endogeneity problem of weak instruments. Our methodology addresses these by starting with time series estimates of long run aid-output (and investment-output) coefficients across the sample (the average) and for each country. We find that heterogeneity is important as the estimated coefficients depend on a country specific trade-off (a possibility neglected in most of the literature) between a potentially negative association of aid and output through productivity and a positive effect through investment. These coefficients are not interpreted as measures of the effect of aid on growth (as the estimation does not account for adjustment factors) but do capture heterogeneity in the long run association of aid with output. Researchers have begun to avail of (panel) time series techniques to address heterogeneity concerns in cross-country growth regressions (e.g. Eberhardt and Teal, 2013). The only paper we are aware of that does this in the context of aid and growth is Juselius et al. (2011) who focus on a large sample of SSA countries; using cointegrated VAR methods they find evidence for a positive long run effect of aid on growth, corroborating the findings of Gomanee, Girma and Morrissey (2005) using conventional panel regressions (restricted to SSA only). Second, it is unclear which factors among the potentially important determinants of growth (explanatory or control variables), or more strictly factors that help explain cross-country differences in growth, are really important for the long run aid-output coefficients. Studies often include different variables but there have been few rigorous attempts to test which variables act robustly as empirically important conditioning variables for the association between aid and output. We address this problem by applying a general to specific method. This paper offers a different empirical approach comprising a two-step estimation procedure that combines time series and panel methods. The first step involves estimating the long run aid-output coefficients, on average and for each country; in contrast to previous studies, the level of output rather than the growth rate of output is used as the dependent variable. The second step involves estimating the determinants or correlates of these coefficients using cross-section regressions. The paper makes three contributions: Heterogeneous panel cointegration techniques, robust to omitted variables and endogenous regressors, are employed to estimate the ‘average’ long run aid-output and investment-output coefficient for 59 developing countries for 1971–2003. This provides an estimate for the sample as a whole that allows for heterogeneity and the trade-off between the direct (investment) and indirect (productivity) effects of aid on output. Time series cointegration methods, also robust to omitted variables and endogenous regressors, are employed to estimate long run aid-output and investment-output coefficients for each of the 59 countries. In this way heterogeneity is explicitly addressed. Having estimated the long run aid-output coefficients for each country, a variable selection approach (based on a general-to-specific methodology to identify from a large number of potentially relevant variables those that are the important factors) is employed to explain the cross-country differences in the coefficients (the sample here comprises 45 of the 59 countries). The purpose is to identify the primary correlates of country coefficients rather than specifically to explain the long run coefficient. The aim is to identify which country specific factors are empirically important determinants of (differences in) the long run aid-output coefficients. This focus is valuable as ‘it is hard to draw conclusions (from the cross-country literature) when the distinction between short-run and long run effects is so rarely made’ (Temple 2010: 4448). The paper contributes to understanding the determinants of aid effectiveness whilst avoiding many of the specification and estimation debates that plague the existing literature. A specific advantage of the first-stage method is that a regression consisting of cointegrated variables has a stationary error term, implying that no relevant integrated variables are omitted (any omitted non-stationary variable that is part of the cointegrating relationship would enter the error term, thereby producing non-stationary residuals and failure to detect cointegration). Thus, an important implication of finding cointegration is that no relevant integrated variables in the cointegrating vector are omitted. There are now numerous studies of aid effectiveness with conflicting results; the majority of studies find that aid has a small, conditional positive effect on growth, but there is considerable disagreement on which conditional factors are most important (Morrissey 2006). As these studies are based on cross-country econometric growth regressions, it should not be surprising that they yield mixed results. Growth is a complex process that is difficult to explain and aid is only one of many factors that may influence growth; many other factors are potentially important (hence candidates as conditioning variables) for some, but not necessarily all, countries and cross-country studies are far from consistent in the variable set included. Furthermore, aid can take many different forms, some of which (e.g. financing for investment) are more likely to have a medium term impact on growth than others, such as technical assistance and humanitarian relief.Footnote 1 More importantly, although the empirical aid literature has provided valuable insights into whether and how aid may promote growth, it suffers from the limitations inherent in cross-country growth regressions. Cross-country panel regression models, by definition, are not able to capture the heterogeneity in the relationship between aid and growth across countries, and the estimates may be seriously biased in the presence of such heterogeneity. Several country specific factors may induce apparent differences in the effect of aid on growth, but these factors cannot be fully controlled for in cross-country regressions; the classical omitted variables problem. Panel estimation can account for unobserved country specific effects, but the homogeneous panel estimators used in the aid literature produce inconsistent and potentially misleading estimates of the average values of the parameters in dynamic models when the slope coefficients differ across cross-section units (Pesaran and Smith 1995). Another (closely related) problem with the cross-country approach used in the majority of studies is the potential endogeneity of aid. The recent literature attempts to control for this endogeneity problem through instrumental variable methods. It is well known that instrumental variables regressions may lead to spurious results when the instruments are weak or invalid and that it is difficult (sometimes even impossible) to find variables that qualify as valid instruments (Temple 1999). This does not mean one must reject the empirical results (it does help to explain the mixed evidence), but implies that results must be interpreted with caution. A further methodological problem with both cross-country and panel studies is the use of the growth rate of output as the dependent variable while the level of the aid/GDP ratio of the recipient country is used as the explanatory variable. Growth rates show, in general, little persistence over time, whereas the aid/GDP ratio has exhibited persistent movements with positive and/or negative trends for most developing countries since the 1960s. The empirical implication is that there cannot be a long run relationship between the growth rate of output and the level of the aid/GDP ratio over time (e.g., Nowak-Lehmann et al. 2012); such unbalanced regressions (with stationary and nonstationary variables) can, even in cross-country analyses, lead to misleading results (Ericsson et al. 2001). In addition, several recent contributions to the theoretical growth literature focus on levels instead of growth rates (e.g., Acemoglu and Ventura 2002). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review to identify the potential ways in which foreign aid can affect domestic output. Section 3 sets out the empirical specification to estimate the long run aid-output coefficients and discusses the data. Section 4 presents the estimates of the long run coefficients, for the sample and individual countries. Section 5 contains the empirical analysis of the determinants of the estimated long run aid-output coefficients. Section 6 concludes with a discussion of the results.",24
149,4,Review of World Economics,20 June 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0161-6,Equipping immigrants: migration flows and capital movements in small open economies,December 2013,Douglas Gollin,Fabian Lange,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Economists who study how production inputs flow across borders tend to be divided into two groups: those that study the flows of physical and financial capital and those that study human migrations. This paper argues that it is important to recognize that international capital flows and cross-border labor movements are related. Both capital flows and labor migrations represent movements of production inputs, and both are affected by changing production conditions. In addition, the productivity of capital is at least partially determined by the labor supply in a location; thus migrations can cause capital flows. Conversely, the supply of capital determines the productivity of labor, and exogenous increases in capital can raise the incentives to migrate. In this paper, we argue that the link between migrations and capital flows (and therefore trade balances) is quantitatively important. Neglecting this link, researchers will omit an empirically relevant factor that helps explain observed movements of labor and capital across countries and over time. The recent experience of Spain illustrates this point in a simple way. Figure 1 shows how the share of investment in GDP, the current account deficit, and the migration rate in Spain evolved since the early 1990s. It is evident from the figure that beginning in the mid-1990s, fixed investment and the current account deficit rose at the same time that net migration rates climbed to unprecedented levels. A researcher who ignores the interactions between capital and labor flows will omit a crucial component of the recent Spanish experience. Capital flows and migration to Spain, 1991–2007 The Spanish experience suggests that capital flows and migrations may be connected in an important way—although at this stage we are not making any claims about the direction of causation. It is not clear, however, whether we can generalize from the experience of this particular country to a more general relationship between capital and labor flows. To what extent is the link between capital and labor flows a general property of small open economies? We answer this question in the context of a simple overlapping generations (OLG) model of capital flows and migrations. Our analysis is similar to that done previously in the context of the links between demographic changes and their effects on capital flows. Most of the previous analysis looks at the relationships between fertility behavior and capital movements. This literature can be dated at least to the work of Coale and Hoover (1958); some of the issues were discussed in the development literature through the 1980s and 1990s (e.g., Mason 1988; Collins 1991). The topic received considerably more attention with a growing awareness of the links between demographic patterns—such as the varying age structures in different countries—and the international flow of capital. Noteworthy papers in this literature include Taylor and Williamson (1994), Kelley and Schmidt (1996), Higgins (1998), Higgins and Williamson (2001), Bloom and Williamson (1998), Violante and Attanasio (2000), Helliwell (2004), and Kogel (2005). In contrast to the earlier literature, our paper focuses on migration rates rather than fertility behavior. The primary reason for this shift in focus is that the short-run changes in the size of the population induced by changing migration rates are much larger than those induced by variations in fertility rates or mortality. Surges in migration rates can lead population sizes to increase rapidly and therefore lend themselves to empirically investigate the impact of demographic changes on capital needs and consequently the current account balance. We base the analysis on a simple general equilibrium model of a small open economy, with an OLG structure. Our OLG economy is built around a simple, parsimonious set of standard assumptions. For this reason, the basic forces at play in the model are extremely transparent. Furthermore, the predictions of the model will likely be similar to those generated by more complex and comprehensive representations of the economy.
Footnote 1
 In the model economy, we are primarily interested in how exogenous changes in the supply of migrant labor affect the demand for capital in an economy. This is not to suggest that we believe that real-world migration flows are exogenous; but in a model economy, we can run the “experiment” of injecting migrants into the labor force, holding everything else constant. The model predicts that exogenous increases in the supply of migrants and total factor productivity (TFP) growth will both raise investment and generate capital inflows (implying current account deficits). The model generates predictions not only for the sign, but also for the magnitude of this relation. We find considerable support, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for these predictions of the model using ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions of the investment rates and current accounts on the migration and TFP growth rates. However, in the data, we are concerned that both labor and capital flows respond to variation over time in production conditions, so that labor flows (and hence migration) are endogenous. If they are, then the regressions described above are flawed. To address this problem, we first model what we perceive to be the main source of endogeneity: the possibility that economic conditions in the receiving country draw in new migrants. We therefore explicitly allow exogenous variations in production conditions to affect both the demand for capital and labor. In this model, both investment and labor are endogenous. We derive expressions that relate the variances and covariances of TFP growth, investment rates, and migration rates to the main parameters of the model. We proceed to estimate the crucial parameters of the model allowing for the endogeneity of labor and capital flows. We are able to derive estimates for: (i) the elasticity of the supply of migrant labor, (ii) the variation in TFP growth, (iii) the exogenous variation in net migration rates and (iv) the exogenous variation in domestic labor supply. We find that net migrations are very inelastic: temporary variations in production conditions do not induce large contemporaneous flows of migrant labor. We also find that the exogenous variation in the supply of migrant labor to OECD countries over time is large. Within countries over time, the standard deviation  in the exogenous component of migration is about 0.6 % of the resident population, almost twice as large as the net migration rate into the United States of 0.34 % in the year 2000. Finally, we find that the variation in TFP across time within countries has a standard deviation of about 0.5 % annually. Our results indicate that for most OECD countries, migration rates vary primarily because of changes in exogenous factors, rather than because of variation in local production conditions in the receiving countries.
Footnote 2 Although this may seem at first glance to be counter-intuitive, the point is simply that international migration flows tend to be primarily driven by differences in income levels (and geographic proximity), rather than by short-run fluctuations in growth rates.
Footnote 3 Investment rates, by contrast, are determined above all by variation in production conditions. The exogenous variation in migration rates contributes only 10–20 % to the overall time-variation in investment rates. However, we also find that exogenous changes in migration rates can have a large impact on investment rates. A 0.1 % increase in net migration rates does generate an increase in investment as a fraction of GDP of about 0.25 %. If this additional capital is not financed through local savings, then the current account will decline by a similar amount. To complement this analysis, we examine the specific case of the United States during the last half-century.
Footnote 4 The evolution of the US current account balance has been widely discussed in the press and in policy circles, both nationally and globally. We ask how much of the observed increase in the current account balance over the last fifty years can plausibly be explained by migration during the same period. For this purpose we treat the observed increase in net migration rates as exogenous. We then simulate the counterfactual current account deficit that would have been observed if net migration rates had remained constant. We find that up to 20 % of the increase in the current account deficit can be explained by the increase in migration rates. Overall, we believe that this study further strengthens the case to consider demographic factors in the study of investment needs and current account balances. The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we provide an analytic framework to guide the empirical work. Section 3 presents the empirical analysis. Section 4 examines the US experience over the last 50 years in light of the analysis and results presented in Sects. 2 and 3. Section 5 concludes.",6

Wallace,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The hypothesis of purchasing power parity (PPP) has been the focus of much empirical work. Simply stated, PPP says that the price of a market basket of (traded) goods is the same everywhere when priced in terms of a common currency. The concept is important, in part, because theories in open economy macroeconomics imply PPP as a long run equilibrium condition. Underlying the PPP hypothesis is the law of one price (LOOP), which indicates that the price of a (traded) good is the same in all locations in terms of a common currency. Rather than focus directly on PPP, numerous studies have examined the LOOP with the idea that support for the LOOP also suggests support for PPP. In addition to its macroeconomic implications, testing for PPP or LOOP involves the basic question of whether markets work well. Does arbitrage eliminate price differentials across space within a reasonable amount of time so that the LOOP holds for each traded good and PPP holds for the basket of trade goods and services? Failure to find evidence of either LOOP or PPP raises the obvious question of why goods arbitrage fails to eliminate price differentials across space. Indeed, such considerations apparently lead Parikh and Wakerly (2000) to suggest that economic theory virtually compels stationarity of the real rate. A partial list of techniques used in testing for PPP includes single equation unit root tests, cointegration studies, variance ratio tests, vector error correction models, and panel unit root tests. Some of these methodologies have been adapted for use as nonlinear procedures. Sarno and Taylor (2002) provide a thorough, albeit somewhat dated, review of the PPP and LOOP literature. The purpose of this paper is to test for PPP using an error correction model (ECM) and an autoregressive distributed lag model (ADL), standard estimation approaches to study cointegration; and compare the results from these standard methods with those from an alternative methodology using instrumental variables recently developed by Im et al. (2008). Cointegration methods are applicable to study PPP since the nominal exchange rate and price levels in many countries appear to be integrated of order one. Consequently, if PPP holds a linear combination of these variables must be I(0). Gubitz (1988) is an early example applying cointegration to PPP. Most of her results are not supportive of PPP although she does find evidence of PPP among countries in the European Monetary System. Subsequent research has shown that the asymptotic distributions of standard cointegration test statistics can be affected by a nuisance parameter (see Pesavento 2004, 2007) making inference problematic. A compelling feature of the Im et al. (2008) method is that it eliminates the nuisance parameter problem of the standard approaches thus avoids the need for bootstrapping to calculate test critical values. A data set on annual nominal exchange rates and price levels for twenty-three countries constructed by Taylor (2002) and updated with more recent data is used in the study.Footnote 1
 The remainder of the paper is organized into five additional sections. Section 2 is a review of the empirical literature on PPP focused on other studies using the Taylor data set. The Im et al. (2008) methodology is described in Sect. 3. The updated Taylor data set and time series properties of the data are set forth in Sect. 4. Section 5 includes the empirical results and a comparison of the standard and Im et al. (2008) approaches. Conclusions are contained in Sect. 6.",3

On the input side, the ratio of bought-into value added services has increased since 1995 across all manufacturing industries (Nordås 2010), and in-house services production has also expanded (Pilat and Wölfl 2005; Lodefalk 2013). The manufacturing sector increasingly employs mathematicians, engineers, computing professionals and business professionals (Pilat and Wölfl 2005). Services used or produced by manufacturing firms include research and development (R&D) services but also extend to knowledge or intangible capital services more generally, as well as to services such as telecommunication and transport. On the output side, the share of services in total turnover also has grown since the mid 1990s for some countries (Pilat and Wölfl 2005). Regarding export, Lodefalk (2013) studies Sweden and finds that manufacturing’s service exports have more than doubled between 1998 and 2006. There are arguments for the ability of services to support exports in manufacturing. Services may help firms to overcome costly informal barriers, such as asymmetric information, in international trade. Changes on the demand side in industrialised countries are also likely to favour manufacturing firms that increase the services content of their offerings (Schettkat and Yocarini 2006). Finally, there may also be a link between services and exports through productivity, as will be explained in the course of this paper. Empirically, knowledge on exporters’ buying-in, production and sales of services is limited, and the relation between services and exports has been only partially explored. This study adds to the empirical literature on export determinants by analysing the role of services inputs for manufacturing firm competitiveness abroad, using a rich panel of manufacturing firms in Sweden in the period 2001–2007. The specification is estimated using a fractional maximum-likelihood estimator, while controlling for the usual covariates that have been found to be associated with export performance and firm heterogeneity. The outline of the rest of the paper is as follows: in Sect. 2, the conceptual framework is developed and previous literature is briefly reviewed. Data and descriptive statistics are presented in Sect. 3. The specification and estimation strategy is discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 analyses the relation between services and exports econometrically. Section 6 concludes the paper.",63

150,1,Review of World Economics,15 August 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0170-5,Chinese contractors in developing countries,February 2014,Catherine Yap Co,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"One aspect of China’s “Go Global” strategy that has received much negative reception in the popular press is the willingness of Chinese officials and businesses to deal with autocratic and corrupt African regimes to gain access to the continent’s oil and other natural resources. Chinese presence in the Sudan is usually used as prime example of China’s misguided Africa strategy. Resources-for-infrastructure deals characterize this strategy: Chinese infrastructure projects in Africa pay for access to the continent’s natural resources. Although resources-for-infrastructure deals are primarily observed in Africa, the presence of Chinese contractors in other oil-rich countries with weak political rights regimes (e.g., Iran) or mineral-rich countries with weak institutions (e.g., Mongolia) add to the West’s concern that China is not being a responsible global citizen. This paper studies whether Chinese contracted (construction) projects are principally in natural-resource-rich countries with weak political rights regimes and/or where corruption is pervasive. Understanding what drives Chinese contractors is crucial given their considerable global presence. According to Engineering News-Record (2010), 54 Chinese companies are among the Top 225 international contractors in the world with combined international revenues of US$50.6 billion (about a fifth of their global revenues of US$295.1 billion) in 2009.Footnote 1 Chinese contractors account for about 13.2 % of the international revenues of the Top 225 international contractors but their combined global market share is 30 %. Four of the largest Chinese construction and engineering firms on Fortune’s (2011) Global 500 are more than 50 % owned by the state government.Footnote 2 Thus, although these firms have operational independence and might primarily be motivated by profit, it is not unlikely that their activities will also support their majority owner’s priorities of securing long-term sources of oil and minerals.Footnote 3
 The data used in this paper are turnover (revenues) from construction projects, such as the building of roads or railways, completed by Chinese contractors. In 2009, turnover from contracted projects reached US$77.7 billion. Although this is dwarfed by China’s US$1,201.6 billion exports in 2009, it is larger than China’s net overseas direct investment flows of US$56.5 billion.Footnote 4 Turnover data with source country details are available starting 1998. About half of the revenues in 1998 are from low and lower middle income countries. By 2009, two-thirds of revenues originate from this group.Footnote 5 Resources-for-infrastructure deals are primarily expected to be between China and other developing countries; thus, the analysis is limited to low and lower middle income countries. Infrastructure in these countries also tends to be less well-developed, and competition from local or Western contractors is either weak or none existent. Special attention is devoted to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as it is stated Chinese government policy that “[i]t will vigorously encourage Chinese enterprises to participate in the building of infrastructure in African countries, scale up their contracts, and gradually establish multilateral and bilateral mechanisms on contractual projects.” (China Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2006). Do Chinese infrastructure projects in Africa pay for access to the continent’s natural resources, especially in countries with weak institutions? To be clear, the data used are not China’s aid to other developing countries though some contracted projects might have been financed by Chinese state aid (i.e., grants, interest-free loans, or concessional loans).Footnote 6 Although some projects receive no explicit Chinese state support, because these projects are highly visible and provide long-term economic benefits, they generate goodwill and enhance China’s stature, and could therefore be regarded as part of Chinese engagement with the community of nations. Viewed positively, these projects may help advance Chinese commercial interests abroad. Likewise, projects that displace large populations and cause environmental harm have negative reputational effects, and may undermine Chinese commercial interests abroad. Chinese contractor activities in other developing countries can then be viewed as one component of China’s south–south economic cooperation strategy. This paper complements recent (but limited) literature on Chinese outward foreign direct investment (ODI) such as Buckley et al. (2007) and Kolstad and Wiig (2012). Buckley et al. (2007) find no evidence that political stability and natural resource endowment are determinants of Chinese ODI into non-OECD countries in 1984–2001. Kolstad and Wiig (2012), on the other hand, find that Chinese ODI to a cross-section of 79 non-OECD countries in the 2003–2006 period increase with natural resource endowment among countries with bad institutions. The paper also builds on Bhaumik and Co’s (2011) early contribution on this topic. Using a three-period pseudo panel (1998–2000; 2001–2003; 2004–2006) for as many as 118 countries, they find some evidence that Chinese contracted projects are higher in countries with good institutions, but mixed evidence on how project activities are associated with countries’ resource endowments. Their results may be an artifact of pooling developed and developing countries in the analysis. This limitation is addressed by the current paper. Before discussing the empirical methodology used, a short history of Chinese contractor presence abroad is provided in the next section. Section 3 discusses the empirical methodology and data used; the empirical results are discussed in Sect. 4. Finally, concluding remarks are provided in the last section.",7

150,1,Review of World Economics,21 August 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0168-z,Financial remoteness and the net external position,February 2014,Martin Schmitz,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper integrates two major research areas—the analysis of external imbalances and studies of the geographical determinants of cross-border investment. We investigate if a country’s geographical location affects its ability to raise net external funding. The net external position of a country is an important steady-state variable which is crucial in order to understand short-term capital flows. As shown by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2001a, b, 2002), long-term fundamentals such as GDP per capita, the demographic structure, the level of public debt, and country size are important determinants in explaining the level of a country’s net external position. These fundamentals help explain why countries are persistent net creditors or net debtors. Theoretically, net external positions ensure that capital is allocated to the most productive nations. Moreover, intertemporal consumption smoothing works through this channel internationally.Footnote 1
 The role of geographical and bilateral factors for a country’s net external position is largely unexplored. In the literature on bilateral asset trade, it is well established that geography matters. For example, Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2008) and Portes and Rey (2005) show that bilateral distance and other proxies for informational asymmetries such as common language, colonial ties, and currency unions are crucial in explaining bilateral asset holdings and flows, respectively. Daude and Stein (2007) find that the difference in time zones is also important for bilateral (foreign direct) investments. Thus, asset trade can be explained by gravity models that are very similar to models of bilateral trade, implying a home bias or rather a proximity bias. There is evidence for a proximity bias in the financial sector due to differences in access to financial services and information asymmetries that are increasing in distance. Coval and Moskowitz (1999, 2001) show that returns of fund managers in the United States are higher from investing in firms in close proximity. Also financial analysts tend to be more accurate in their assessments the closer they are located to a firm (Malloy 2005). Petersen and Rajan (2002) find that borrower quality increases with distance, as banks are unwilling to lend at great distances to problem borrowers whose loans would require more active monitoring.Footnote 2
 We build on the literature above by investigating how geographic and bilateral factors influence the net external position of a country. The determinants of bilateral holdings can affect gross aggregate positions: as we expect a financially remote country to be less integrated with the rest of the world, it might receive less inward capital flows which could translate into problems in generating net external funding. Based on the idea of increasing financial intermediation costs with distance, Rose and Spiegel (2009) introduce a unilateral concept of distance, namely international financial remoteness. They find that countries that are remote from financial activity (defined by the closest distance to one of the world’s major financial centres—London, New York, and Tokyo) are systemically more volatile in terms of output and consumption growth. We use a similar concept in order to obtain remoteness measures for each country, namely the minimum distance and minimum time zone difference to one of the eight largest creditor countries that are consequently the major providers of external funding. We include these financial remoteness measures in standard net external position estimations. Going beyond measures of distance there are more bilateral concepts potentially affecting net external positions. As we carry out our analysis in a unilateral framework, we apply Baicker’s (2005) notion of neighbourliness which she uses to examine spillovers of fiscal policy among US states. We apply her idea of geographic contiguity and use further concepts from the bilateral asset trade literature in a unilateral framework. Starting from bilateral datasets, we construct composite measures of—for instance—financial openness of neighbour countries and test their relevance for the net external position. Countries might also be able to participate in world financial or goods markets by being integrated with a ‘core’ country. This notion, dating back to Baumol (1986), postulates that specific convergence clubs of a core (leader) and a periphery (converging countries) exhibit spillovers from the core to the periphery via extensive trade and financial linkages. We apply the concepts of bilateral financial and trade linkages by identifying a core country and the level of integration with this core country for each economy in our sample and investigate if integration with the core has an impact on net external funding. The theoretical framework of this paper is shaped by the models of Obstfeld and Rogoff (2001) and Martin and Rey (2004). In both models, (asset) trade costs induce home bias in financial holdings. Trade costs in the models represent transaction and information costs in a broader sense. Fazio et al. (2008) find strong empirical support for Obstfeld’s and Rogoff’s hypothesis that trade costs are the key to explaining the Feldstein–Horioka puzzle. They find this to be consistent with persistent net external positions and trade balances as observed by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2002). There are no strong theoretical or empirical priors about the role of financial remoteness and other bilateral factors for net external positions. From the findings by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2008), Portes and Rey (2005), and Daude and Stein (2007) we know that geographic factors are important for bilateral asset trade. Consequently, it is of high interest to analyse the impact of these factors for a country’s net external wealth. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: in Sect. 2 theoretical issues are raised, followed by the empirical strategy in Sect. 3 The empirical results are presented in Sects. 4 and 5 concludes.",3

150,2,Review of World Economics,29 October 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0175-0,Does importing more inputs raise exports? Firm-level evidence from France,May 2014,Maria Bas,Vanessa Strauss-Kahn,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The endogenous-growth literature has long emphasized the role of foreign inputs in enhancing efficiency and economic growth (e.g., Romer 1987 and Rivera-Batiz and Romer 1991). The recent increase in imported intermediate goods has been well-documented (e.g., Hummels et al. 2001; Yi 2003; Strauss-Kahn 2004), and micro-level analysis has found a positive effect of imported intermediate goods on firm productivity.
Footnote 1 A number of key questions regarding the mechanisms through which imported inputs affect firms’ productivity, the impact of greater productivity on export behavior, and the direct role of imported inputs on export scope remain however unanswered. In a context of fierce political debate over jobs lost through outsourcing (i.e., greater imported inputs), the evaluation of the affect of foreign intermediate goods on firm productivity and export behavior is not without economic and political interest.
Footnote 2
 This paper investigates the role of imported inputs in enhancing firm productivity and export scope using a firm-level database of imports at the product (HS6) level provided by French customs over the 1996–2005 period. Varieties of inputs are commonly defined as a product-country pair. In order to address the simultaneity bias in the estimation of firm production functions, we appeal to semi-parametric estimation based on Olley and Pakes’ (1996) methodology augmented by Ackerberg et al.’s (2007) non-collinearity strategy. We also face endogeneity issues related to potential reverse causality between imported inputs and exports when estimating the impact of imported inputs on export scope, and rely on input tariffs as an instrumental variable. We limit our sample to imported inputs from non-EU countries and exports towards EU countries. Our analysis is thus free of any endogeneity issues resulting from importer-exporter relationships. We aim to disentangle the different channels through which imported inputs affect firm productivity and exports. The literature provides a theoretical basis. Early work by Ethier (1982) and Markusen (1989) provides a theoretical analysis of the gains obtained from imported inputs. Combining differentiated inputs results in productivity gains that are more than the ""sum of the parts""; these complementarity gains result from imperfect substitution across intermediate inputs. Kasahara and Lapham (2013) recently developed a heterogeneous firms trade model also showing that importing more varieties of intermediate inputs raises firms’ factor productivity. A second mechanism is related to technology transfer: international trade promotes economic growth through the diffusion of modern technologies embodied in imported intermediate inputs. Empirical work on aggregate cross-country data has emphasized this effect (e.g., Coe and Helpman 1995; Coe et al. 1997; Keller 2002). Technology transfer cannot however be disentangled from quality transfer, via which imports of high-quality intermediate inputs enhance productivity and lead to the export of high-quality goods at higher prices (see e.g., Kugler and Verhoogen 2012). Our paper tests for these complementarity and technology/quality channels on firms’ total factor productivity (TFP). We then explore indirect (through improved TFP) and direct channels through which imported inputs may shape export performance. If foreign inputs only affect export scope via TFP, intermediate goods should not affect export scope once we control for firm productivity. We thus investigate various direct channels conditional on TFP: (1) a price effect, whereby low-price inputs boost expected export revenue and so expand export scope; and (2) reduced export fixed costs induced by imported inputs providing the quality/technology required in export markets. We distinguish these channels via imported inputs from different countries of origin: the most developed countries produce goods with a high technology/quality content, whereas developing countries provide low-price inputs. We find strong empirical evidence of a positive effect of imported inputs on firm productivity, with support for both the complementarity and technology channels. The average firm adds four varieties of imported inputs over the period leading to TFP 2.5 % higher. More imported input varieties also raises firm export scope. As they enhance productivity, more imported inputs make the firm more likely to bear the export fixed costs and survive in competitive export markets. Direct channels are also at play. Controlling for TFP, a 10 % increase in the number of imported inputs varieties raises export scope by 10.5 %. The average firm by importing four additional varieties of inputs increases its exports by 2.7 varieties. Both inputs from the most advanced economies and developing countries have a positive effect on the number of export varieties. We thus find evidence for the quality/technology (directly and via improved TFP) and price channels. Our findings continue to hold in a number of robustness checks. We successively consider alternative instrumental variables, definitions of imported inputs, sample selection and econometric methods. This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. Empirical work has emphasized the positive effect of imported inputs on firm productivity (e.g., Pavcnik 2002; Schor 2004; Amiti and Konings 2007; Kasahara and Rodrigue 2008; Topalova and Khandelwal 2011). Few papers however explore the channels via which this effect pertains. Halpern et al. (2009) examine the quality and complementarity channels in a panel of Hungarian firms from 1992 to 2003. Imports are shown to lead to significant productivity gains, two thirds of which are attributed to complementarity and the remainder to quality. Using 1998–2003 Danish micro-level data, Smeets and Warzynski (2010) distinguish the cost and quality/technology effects of importing inputs on productivity by differentiating the import origin. They find that both inputs from OECD and low-wage countries yield productivity improvements. In the same spirit, Lööf and Andersson (2010) consider Swedish manufacturing firms over the period 1997–2004, and find that the distribution of imports across origin countries matters (labor productivity increases in the G7-share of total imports). We contribute to this growing literature by examining the transmission channels between imported inputs and TFP for France. We also extend the analysis by considering the impact of importing inputs on firm export patterns. Recent papers explore the effects of an increase in imported intermediate goods on firm attributes other than TFP. Goldberg et al. (2010) examine the role of India’s 1991 trade liberalization on the number of varieties produced by the firm, and find that lower input tariffs help expand the firm’s product scope. Evidence is provided that the growth in the number of domestic varieties results from the improved availability of imported inputs rather than lower imported inputs prices. Similarly, using a product-level database for 25 EU countries, Colantone and Crino (2011) evaluate the impact of new imported inputs on the production of new domestic products. They find a significant positive relationship between imported inputs and product scope, stemming from the increased availability of high-quality and/or low-price imports. We depart from the above work by distinguishing the origin of imports and focusing on firms’ export scope. Damijan et al. (2012) study the role of imported inputs on export performances using Slovenian firm-level data from 1994 to 2008 but focuses on imports churning. Aristei et al. (2013) show that importing firms are more likely to export. They rely on firm-level data from 27 Eastern Europe countries and interestingly find that the reverse (exporters likelihood to become importers) is not true. Bas (2012) analyzes the effects of input-trade liberalization on firm export decisions. Using firm-level data for Argentina between 1992 and 1996, reduced input tariffs are shown to lead to entry in export markets. Our work goes one step further by disentangling the channels through which imported inputs directly and indirectly (via TFP) affect export scope. The paper is organized as follow. Section 2 presents the theoretical channels through which imported inputs might affect firm productivity and export scope. Section 3 presents the data and discusses the empirical strategy. Section 4 reports the results regarding the impact of imported inputs on firms’ TFP and export scope. This focuses on the transmission channels and distinguishes the different arguments for improved export scope: enhanced productivity, price effects and technology/quality transfers. Section 5 then presents some robustness checks, and Sect. 6 concludes.",146
150,2,Review of World Economics,10 December 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0181-2,Dynamic effects of institutions on firm-level exports,May 2014,Bengt Söderlund,Patrik Gustavsson Tingvall,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Once a marginal topic, institutions have become a vibrant area of economic research. Previous research on trade and investments has shown that weak domestic institutions increase the cost of doing business, hamper investments and alter trade patterns. Recent research has shown that the impact of institutions on international trade can be even greater than the impact of tariffs (Chang 2010; Belloc 2006; Anderson and Marcouiller 2002; Márquez-Ramos et al. 2012; Levchenko 2007). One explanation for the increased interest in the link between trade and institutions can be attributed to Trefler (1995), who showed that traditional theories of international trade fail in some areas. For example, real world trade volumes are smaller than theoretical predictions. Moreover, despite increased economic integration and small formal trade barriers, national borders still have a significant negative effect on trade (McCallum 1995). Hence, the case of missing trade, noted by Trefler (1995), and the significant border effects noted by McCallum (1995) suggest that substantial trade barriers still remain. In this paper, we suggest that institutions can be an important factor in the formation of global trade patterns. Intuitively, institutions have an impact on trade because international exchange does not occur without costs. For trade to occur, agents from different jurisdictions must agree on a contract (Nunn 2007). Because perfect contracts cannot be achieved, agents are left with imperfect realizations. By reducing the risk of opportunistic behavior, enhancing law enforcement, securing property rights, reducing corruption and clarifying labor market regulations, efficient institutions can significantly reduce contract costs.Footnote 1 Institutions can also affect the costs of monitoring and control. North (1991) proposes that effective institutions reduce the risk of contract defection, enhance interpersonal exchanges and allow for more complex and efficient ways of organizing production and trade. Given that contract costs can determine whether a cross-border relationship will be established, effective institutions are central to facilitating trade. As the interest in institutions has increased, so has the availability of data that measure institutional quality. Metrics of institutional quality are now gathered by a wide range of organizations, including the World Bank, the Freedom House, the PRS Group, the Fraser Institute, the United Nations, the Center for International Comparisons of Production and the Heritage Foundation. A growing body of empirical research has accompanied the increased data availability. Although much attention has been devoted to the relationship between institutions and economic growth, the link between institutions and foreign trade is receiving increased attention. Anderson and Marcouiller (2002) and Ranjan and Lee (2007) adopt a gravity model to assess how institutions affect bilateral trade flows. Turrini and Ypersele (2010) find that differences in legal systems reduce trade flows. Using Kaufmann’s (1999) data on institutions, Méon and Sekkat (2006) show that corruption, rule of law, government effectiveness and lack of political violence are positively correlated with exports in manufactured goods. Awokuse and Yin (2010) show that in China, strengthened intellectual property rights have had a particularly strong impact on imports of knowledge-intensive products. Finally, Depken and Sonora (2005) present evidence that US exports are positively correlated with economic freedom in the rest of the world. However, institutional quality does not only have static effects on trade but also dynamic effects. This is a relatively new strand of literature where little research has been conducted. Araujo et al. (2012) find evidence that institutional quality affects the growth of exports and that global firms are less affected by institutional quality than smaller firms. Aeberhaedt et al. (2011) analyze French exporting firms and find that trade with countries with well-developed institutions was characterized by a low hazard rate and that hazard rates decline with relation age, as unreliable partners are combed out.Footnote 2
 The present study adds to the literature on institutions and trade in several ways. First, institutions are a broad concept, incorporating topics such as political freedom, rule of law, property rights and freedom to trade. Although these measures are correlated, different measures of institutional quality can yield different results. Most research on institutions focuses on one or a few institutional variables such as rule of law, freedom to trade and corruption. In this study, we show that the impact of different institutional variables can vary and that conclusions on the impact of institutions depend on what measure of institutional quality is used. We propose that to deepen the understanding of institutions, the impact of a large number of institutional measures should be considered. Second, we use factor analysis to address the underlying structure of variation in our set of institutional variables. Although factor analysis is a suitable technique for this analysis, it has to our knowledge rarely been used in previous related research. Third, we explore, (i) how institutional quality in target economies affects firms’ selection of export destination, (ii) what kind of firms are able to maintain long-term contracts, (iii) explore learning processes related to both property rights the general business climate in target economies and, (iv) analyze the interplay between institutional quality and the duration of trade flows. Finally, our analysis is based on detailed firm-level data, combined with macro data for countries. The detailed micro data include information on exports at the firm-country level. In addition, we apply several different econometric approaches, thus reducing the risk that our results are driven by the methodological approach. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a theoretical overview. Our empirical approach is presented in Sect. 3. Section 4 describes the data and presents the descriptive statistics. The results are presented in Sects. 5 and 6 concludes.",19
150,2,Review of World Economics,06 November 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0177-y,"Importing, exporting and performance in sub-Saharan African manufacturing firms",May 2014,Neil Foster-McGregor,Anders Isaksson,Florian Kaulich,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Since the seminal study of Bernard and Jensen (1995) there has been a large volume of research considering the relationship between exporting and firm-level performance. These papers consider data on a large number of developed, developing and transition economies. Despite differences in methodology and country samples the results tend to be fairly consistent, and point to the conclusion that productivity is higher for exporters (see Wagner (2007, 2012) for recent surveys and Martins and Yang (2009) for a meta-analysis of existing studies).Footnote 1 There are two alternative—though not necessarily mutually exclusive—explanations as to why exporters may be more productive than non-exporters. Self-selection of more productive firms into export markets may occur because there are additional costs associated with selling goods abroad that may include transport, distribution and marketing costs, the cost of personnel with skills to manage foreign networks, or production costs from modifying domestic products for foreign consumption (Fryges and Wagner 2008). Exporting may also be a source of learning however, resulting in an improvement in post-entry performance. Exporting can be an important channel of information flows with overseas buyers sharing knowledge of the latest design specifications and production techniques that might otherwise be unavailable, as well as providing a competitive environment in which efficiency advantages can be obtained. The majority of existing studies conclude in favour of self-selection and against the learning-by-exporting hypothesis, with only a few studies reaching the opposite conclusion (for example Kraay 2002; Bigsten et al. 2004; Aw et al. 2000). In general, evidence in favour of learning effects tends to be stronger in developing countries, which has been attributed to the fact that emerging and developing economies’ exporters often trade with relatively skilled and advanced countries where they can benefit from customer’s technical assistance, new managerial practices, market information, information systems and supply chain networks for example. While the focus of the empirical firm-level literature has been on the relationship between exports and productivity there are good reasons to believe that imports could also be a significant source of productivity benefits. Krugman (1993) for example states that “What a country really gains from trade is the ability to import things it wants. Exports are not an objective in and of themselves; the need to export is a burden that a country must bear because its import suppliers are crass enough to demand payment.” Capital and intermediate goods imports for example that embody new technologies would be expected to bring in new knowledge that may ultimately enhance a country’s—or firm’s—productivity. Imported intermediates may also affect productivity through the use of imported inputs that are of a better quality than domestic counterparts and through complementarity, whereby combining different intermediates creates gains that are more than the sum of their parts, which could be due to imperfect substitution across goods as in love-of-variety models as well as learning spillovers between foreign and domestic goods.Footnote 2 Cheaper imports may allow firms to produce existing goods using the same inputs as before, but at a lower cost. They could also open up new ways of producing existing goods, and even allow entirely new goods to be made. In response to these arguments and the increasing availability of firm-level data with information on importing, a small empirical literature has considered the relationship between importing and firm-level performance.Footnote 3 Empirical studies of importing and performance now exist for a number of developed countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the USA). There remain relatively few studies of the importer-productivity relationship for transition and developing countries however (see Table 2 of Wagner 2012). The results of studies of the importer premium tend to indicate that importers perform better than non-importers. A number of such studies combine the impact of importing and exporting by allowing the impact of international trade to differ depending upon whether firms are exporters only, importers only or two-way traders (see for example Muûls and Pisu 2009; Andersson et al. 2008; Castellani et al. 2010; Vogel and Wagner 2010). The results from such studies indicate that the impact of trade on performance tends to be stronger for two-way traders followed by importers, followed by exporters, with all groups performing better than firms not engaged in international trade. When considering the relationship between firm level performance and importing the issue of self-selection versus learning again arises. We would expect there to be fixed costs associated with importing which would support the view that firms self-select into importing,Footnote 4 with high-productivity firms offshoring their production and low-productivity firms limiting themselves to domestic sourcing.Footnote 5 Andersson et al. (2008) argue however that there are strong arguments in favour of a causal impact of importing on productivity. In particular, by importing, a firm can exploit global specialization and use inputs from the technology frontier. Importing intermediates also allows firms to specialize on activities where it has particular strengths. Castellani et al. (2010) argue that importers may improve productivity by using higher quality foreign inputs or by extracting technology embodied in imported intermediates and capital goods. A small number of studies test for self-selection versus learning by importing effects (for example Vogel and Wagner 2010), with the results tending to support the self-selection hypothesis. In this paper we employ a variety of parametric and non-parametric tests to consider differences in firm-level performance between firms engaged in international trade and those that are domestically oriented for a large sample of manufacturing firms in 19 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries.Footnote 6 The paper makes a number of contributions to the literature on international trade and performance at the firm level. Firstly, the paper introduces a new and current firm-level database that covers 19 SSA firms (see UNIDO 2012).Footnote 7 Secondly, the dataset covers a larger number of SSA countries and a larger number of SSA firms than any other database we are aware of. To date there has been relatively little empirical work using firm-level data on African firms and these tend to be concentrated in a small number of countries. Examples include Mengistae and Pattillo (2004) for Ethiopia, Ghana and Kenya; Van Biesebroeck (2005) for Burundi, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe; Bigsten et al. (2004) for Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya and Zimbabwe; and Bigsten and Gebreeyesus (2009) for Ethiopia. Interestingly, while all of these studies find that exporters perform better than non-exporters (often across a number of performance measures) they all also present at least some evidence consistent with the learning-by-exporting hypothesis. Thirdly, the paper presents the first evidence on the importer premium for SSA firms that we are aware of, with the paper considering differences in performance between exporters, importers, two-way traders and domestically oriented firms. Our results indicate that exporters, importers and two-way traders perform better than non-exporters, non-importers and non-two-way traders. We further find that two-way traders perform better than importers only and exporters only. We further present evidence indicating that there is no significant difference in performance between export starters and export continuers. The remainder of the paper is set out as follows.

It is well known that geographical distance reduces trade: this has been shown by the results of nearly 1,500 gravity models from over 100 research papers (Disdier and Head 2008).Footnote 1 But in comparison with the large literature on the effects of distance, it is only recently that economists have begun to explore the effects of time differences on trade (e.g. Marjit 2007; Stein and Daude 2007; Head et al. 2009; Kikuchi and Long 2010; Tomasik 2013). Time differences might affect trade for two reasons. On the one hand, time differences raise the non-pecuniary costs of travel and communication, by causing jet lag among travellers and by reducing the amount of time in the normal working day in which simultaneous communication (e.g. telephone conversations, video-conferencing) can take place. If travel and simultaneous communication are important for trade—for example, by helping to establish and maintain trust, by spreading information about trading opportunities, or by facilitating the flow of complex, tacit know-how among vertically disintegrated production networks—greater time differences should lead to less trade. On the other hand, time differences promote opportunities for trade in business services (Gupta and Seshasai 2004; Marjit 2007; Kikuchi and Long 2010). For example, by employing teams in different time zones, firms can work on product design and development around the clock, thereby reducing product turnaround times. Thus the impact of time differences could be positive or negative, depending on the sector: for example, positive for trade in business services, but negative for merchandise trade in sectors where travel and simultaneous communication are important. The empirical evidence on time differences includes studies which look at merchandise trade (Stein and Daude 2007), and those which look at trade in services (e.g. Head et al. 2009; Dettmer 2011). Both use the well-known gravity model framework; the basic approach is to augment the standard set of explanatory variables included in the gravity model (e.g. geographical distance, a common currency) to include the time difference between trading partners. The aim of this paper is to extend the results of Stein and Daude (2007) for merchandise trade, in four main ways. First, we control for certain variables not included by Stein and Daude (2007) but which might bias the estimated impact of time differences on trade. Second, our sample spans the period 1950–2006, in contrast to Stein and Daude (2007) who focus on data for 1999 only. This makes it possible to determine whether the impact of time differences has changed in recent decades. Third, the paper tests a series of additional hypotheses. The first is that any negative effect of time differences on trade is greater where formal mechanisms of contract enforcement in each trading partner are weaker, and where co-ethnic networks in each trading partner are less prevalent. The reasoning is that travel and simultaneous communication are more important in such cases—either as a means of establishing and maintaining trust, or of acquiring information about foreign markets—so that trade becomes more sensitive to the costs of travel and communication. The paper also examines the relationship between time differences and international communication flows, as measured by bilateral telephone traffic. To give a flavour of the main results, the paper finds that time differences have a negative and statistically significant impact on bilateral merchandise trade, across a range of samples and estimation methods. For pooled samples across years, each hour of time difference is found to reduce trade by between 2 and 7 %. This is smaller than the range of 7–11 % reported by Stein and Daude (2007) but economically significant nonetheless. For example, the effect of a 5 h time difference (e.g. that between London and New York) is equivalent to a rise in geographical distance of between 18 and 42 %. The negative impact of time differences has however fallen in size over recent decades, which may be due to the emergence of new communication technologies. There is also evidence that the negative impact of time differences is smaller where mechanisms of formal contract enforcement, as measured by the Kaufmann et al. (2009) rule of law index, are stronger, and co-ethnic networks, as measured by the size of the bilateral migrant population, are more prevalent. Time differences also have a negative and statistically significant impact on bilateral telephone traffic, with each hour of time difference reducing traffic by between 3 and 5 %. The results in this paper are consistent with the hypothesis that time differences reduce merchandise trade by raising the non-pecuniary costs of travel and communication. This of course does not deny that time differences can promote trade in business services, as suggested by Gupta and Seshasai (2004), Marjit (2007) and Kikuchi and Long (2010). For example, Head et al. (2009) find that time differences do have a positive effect on certain categories of services trade, in particular financial services and miscellaneous business services; similar results are also reported by Dettmer (2011). Nevertheless, the results do suggest that, when considering overall bilateral trade, the positive effect of time differences on trade in business services may be outweighed by their negative effect on merchandise trade. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the existing literature relating to the possible effect of time differences on trade. Section 3 then outlines the methods and variables used in the econometric analysis, while Sect. 4 presents the main results.

Holloway,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The movie industry makes an interesting laboratory for studying quality and trade patterns. Rather than quality being reflected in unit prices, as is often assumed for manufactured goods, movies tend to be priced identically within a geographic market, regardless of demand. Hundreds of viewers express their opinions on the quality of movies on web sites every week. Furthermore, financial data on box-office sales and production budget are readily available. I make use of these direct and indirect measures of quality to study the foreign entry decisions of individual movies and the degree to which foreign markets appear to agree on quality.Footnote 1 The study is conducted at the product level. When a movie is released in an international market, we know that it is the exact same product, dubbing or subtitling notwithstanding. It is rare for firms to make a single product, and most firm-level measures of quality likely reflect a mix of the product line. Rather than adopting the standard Melitz (2003) type model of heterogeneous firms, characterized by constant-elasticity of substitution preferences and monopolistic competition, I model demand in a discrete choice framework. Like the Melitz model, however, the simplest version predicts a double hierarchy, whereby if a movie of a given quality is distributed in some market, d, it will go to all markets that are at least as attractive as d; and if a country of a given attractiveness imports a movie, m, it will import all movies that are at least as high quality as m. Eaton et al. (2011) investigate this type of hierarchy for French exporters and note that it fails to hold in the data. They introduce destination-firm-specific demand shocks to account for the discrepancy. Bernard et al. (2011) similarly argue strongly for inclusion of idiosyncratic shocks. I study the extent to which the movies data conforms to the hierarchy and compare the “pure sorting” hypothesis to that of random entry. I use a simulation technique to graphically contrast predictions from the two models, which are nested in the theoretical framework. I further investigate the role of quality in export decisions with regression analysis. The model predicts that a movie will be released in a given market if the expected revenue obtained would be sufficient to overcome the fixed cost of distribution. Revenue is increasing in quality, cultural affinity and market size and wealth. Probability regressions confirm important roles for quality and market attractiveness in the international pattern of movie releases. This paper is related to the literature on trade in cultural goods, and the measurement of cultural distance. Attempts to measure differences in culture have often relied on analysis of questionnaires.Footnote 2 This paper develops a measure of revealed cultural distance by analyzing the pattern of trade in the motion picture industry. A movie is an example of a “cultural product”, the trade of which not only spreads ideas and values, but reflects the current state of shared preferences. Producers face extra costs to serving additional markets, including adapting to market, advertising campaigns, and distribution. Because viewers may discount the quality of a foreign cultural product, the potential size of the importing market is determined not only by destination-specific factors, such as population and wealth, but also by the bilateral cultural affinity between the origin and destination countries. I exploit data on movie genre to back out a cultural component from destination fixed effects. The procedure relies on the fact that the movie quality for some genres—such as comedy and drama—is discounted more heavily by foreign cultures than for other genres, like action or thriller. The cultural distance measure captures the extent to which the propensity to import diverges between the two genre types. I am not the first to look at trade patterns as a measure of cultural distance. Disdier et al. (2010) use a gravity framework to estimate the “extra” aggregate bilateral trade in sectors that UNESCO deems to be cultural industries. They interpret bilateral excess trade as cultural affinity and find that it has explanatory power in a gravity equation for all merchandise trade. I use product-level data and a heterogeneous quality framework. This allows me to control for product quality in the empirical analysis. For example, the fact that a given country imported blockbusters like Titanic and Harry Potter is less likely to point to cultural affinity than if the country imported more obscure (less appealing) titles. My analysis also exploits variation in the extensive margin of trade—whether a title is released in a given country—rather than the intensive volume of bilateral trade. There are existing industry-specific studies of the trade patterns of cultural goods. Hanson and Xiang (2011) develop a heterogeneous firms model of trade for the motion picture industry, and estimate using aggregate sales data by foreign market. Abramitzky and Sin (2012) use data on international book translations from UNESCO’s Index Translationum, and the “natural experiment” of the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, to estimate the extent to which communism slowed the trade in book translations—and hence information flows. Ferreira and Waldfogel (2013) study the international trade in popular music and find that trade volumes are higher between countries that are geographically proximate and those that share a common language. Ferreira et al. (2012) develop a structural econometric model of the global movie market and investigate how consumer welfare is affected by investments in movie quality. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 I provide a theoretical model of the international trade in a unit-demand product of which varieties are heterogeneous in quality. I present an overview of the movies data in Sect. 3, while in Sect. 4 I present the results of three exercises. In Sect. 4.1, I compare key statistics of the data to predictions from hierarchy and random entry models. In Sect. 4.2, I estimate the average effect of quality on the propensity to enter foreign markets. In Sect. 4.3, I estimate a measure of cultural distance and investigate its properties.

150,2,Review of World Economics,18 January 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-013-0184-z,Financial constraints and foreign direct investment: firm-level evidence,May 2014,Claudia M. Buch,Iris Kesternich,Monika Schnitzer,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Multinational firms are larger than their domestic counterparts. For European firms, Mayer and Ottaviano (2008) show that multinational firms are also more productive, generate higher value added, pay higher wages, employ more capital per worker, and they employ a larger number of skilled workers. In the theoretical literature, the characteristic size patterns of multinational firms are explained mainly by differences in productivity. According to this explanation, observed internationalization patterns reflect real constraints because only the more productive firms can afford to shoulder the fixed costs of market entry. These stylized facts are confirmed by our data for German companies, where firms owning foreign affiliates are indeed substantially larger than purely domestic firms (see Sect. 3.3). Yet, the two groups of firms also differ in a number of other respects. Multinational firms, for instance, have lower debt ratios and higher cash flows. This suggests difficulties in obtaining external finance as an additional impediment to foreign expansions.
Footnote 1 However, most of the theoretical literature considers the impact of financial constraints to be of lesser importance, arguing that foreign direct investment (FDI) and the associated financing decisions can largely be treated separately.
Footnote 2
 The purpose of this paper is to assess the importance of real and financial barriers for the cross-border expansion of firms, both theoretically and empirically. We focus on the decision to enter a foreign market, i.e., the extensive margin. Our model features limited contract enforceability and liquidation costs as two sources of inefficiencies in financial contracting that are particularly relevant for foreign investments. Our research is motivated by recent theoretical work stressing the importance of productivity for firms’ international expansions. Seminal papers focusing on firms’ export decisions are Bernard et al. (2003) and Melitz (2003). Helpman et al. (2004) extend the Melitz model to account for multinational firms. The key to these models is that, ex ante, firms do not know their productivity. Upon entry, firms draw their productivity from a commonly known productivity distribution, and the level of productivity becomes common knowledge as well. Depending on the level of productivity, firms exit the market, they produce only for the domestic market, they become exporters, or they set up affiliates abroad. The implicit assumption of these models is that firms can finance foreign operations internally and/or without incurring an external finance premium. Recent papers introduce financial constraints into the Melitz model. The focus of these models is on firms’ decisions to export. Chaney (2005) predicts that financially constrained firms are less likely to be able to cover the fixed costs of exporting. Manova (2013) examines the impact of productivity and credit constraints on exports. While the previous empirical literature analyzing the probability of exporting has focused on productivity and other real determinants (Bernard and Jensen 2004; Wagner 2012) recent empirical work shows that financial frictions affect export behavior. Using panel data on bilateral exports at the country level, Manova (2013) finds that financially more developed countries are more likely to export, and that the effect is more pronounced in financially vulnerable sectors. Firm-level studies show that firms enjoying better financial conditions are more likely to start exporting (Bellone et al. 2010) and that financial constraints matter more for the extensive margin than for the intensive margin of exports (Berman and Héricourt 2010). A study for Chile by Alvarez and Lopez (2013) arrives at the result that an improvement in financial development increases the probability of exporting of more productive plants and those with foreign ownership operating in manufacturing sectors that are more dependent on external finance. Stiebale (2011), in contrast, finds no effect of financial constraints on a firm’s export decision once observed and unobserved firm heterogeneity is accounted for. Evidence on a possible reverse causality from exporting to financial conditions is mixed. Greenaway et al. (2007) establish that exporting firms are more likely to be financially healthy, whereas Bellone et al. (2010) and Forlani (2010) find no such evidence. As FDI decisions involve higher fixed costs than export decisions, financial constraints are likely to matter even more. Yet surprisingly little research has been done on the impact of financial frictions in the context of multinational firm investment. Our contribution to the literature is thus theoretical and empirical. We theoretically analyze how productivity and financial constraints affect a firm’s choice to become a multinational firm under conditions of limited internal funds and the need to obtain external debt finance, thus extending the current literature on export decisions. If firms finance investments that facilitate exporting, contractual frictions occur at the home country level (Manova 2013). In contrast, when financing foreign investments, contractual frictions occur at the level of the host country as well because this is where the assets to be used as collaterals are located. Our model thus predicts that difficulties with contract enforcement at the host country level impede FDIs.
Footnote 3
 Furthermore, we extend existing models by endogenizing the optimal choice of costly collateral which has implications for the impact of financial constraints. Finally, by allowing firm-level productivity and financial resources to be imperfectly correlated, we can separate a firm’s motivation to invest abroad as a function of its productivity, and its ability to invest abroad as a function of its financial resources. Our model predicts that, if financial resources play a role, financial constraints are more strongly felt by large firms, as these firms are more likely to consider expanding abroad. This prediction differs from conventional models of investment under financial constraints. In this literature, large firms are assumed to be less financially constrained than small firms. But, because small firms are insufficiently productive, they do no consider expanding internationally in the first place. Furthermore, in standard models investment choices are assumed to be continuous, so that, independent of firm size, each firm wants to do some investment. In our model, instead, we consider investments that require large fixed costs. Thus, only the most productive firms are willing to shoulder these fixed costs and hence are likely to suffer from being financially constrained. For our empirical analysis, we use a detailed firm-level dataset which allows testing the predictions of our model.
Footnote 4 Our data allow measuring financial constraints for purely domestic firms and for multinational parents. Note that a particularly interesting feature of our dataset on FDI is that we can actually observe the firms that do not invest and enter a foreign market.
Footnote 5 In the context of domestic investment, in contrast, firms that do not cross the productivity threshold for entry are typically not observed. As predicted by our model, we find that productivity and financial constraints have a significant impact on German firms’ internationalization decision. Economically, productivity and financial constraints are of similar importance, but financial constraints matter most to the subset of firms that consider investing abroad. Like our model suggests, our empirical analysis shows that financial constraints at the parent level have indeed a negative impact on the extensive margin of FDI. From the Direct Investment Micro-Database (MiDi) provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank, we also obtain detailed information on the location of foreign affiliates, which allows testing the impact of host country conditions like weak contract enforcement. We confirm our prediction that FDI increases if contract enforcement improves.
Footnote 6 In addition, we have information on the number of foreign affiliates a parent holds. This information is particularly interesting because we would expect that the more financially constrained firms are, the less they should be able to shoulder the fixed investment costs involved in multiple affiliates. In contrast to earlier work focusing on manufacturing firms, our sample also contains service firms. Comparing the two samples, we find that manufacturing firms are more likely to suffer from financial constraints in their foreign expansion strategy. In Sect. 2, we present our model of multinational firms. In Sect. 3, we describe our data, report descriptive statistics, and provide empirical evidence. Section 4 concludes.",46

Evidence from industry-level data,May 2014,Filomena Pietrovito,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Economists have long been interested in the relationship between financial development and efficient resource allocation. An influential strand of the empirical literature tests the capital allocation hypothesis by using industry-level data and shows that some countries are able to experience faster aggregate growth than others because their high degree of financial development allows them to allocate capital to industries facing higher growth opportunities (Rajan and Zingales 1998; Wurgler 2000; Fisman and Love 2004a, b; Bekaert et al. 2007; Pang and Wu 2009).Footnote 1 Among the ample empirical studies, the work by Fisman and Love (2004a), henceforth FL, is particularly relevant to this paper. FL, in a cross-section framework, analyze the role of financial development in reallocating resources in favor of sectors experiencing positive shocks to growth opportunities. The industries in a country are subject to two sources of shocks to growth opportunities: one is global and industry-specific, affecting each industry equally across countries (we can think of it as depending on technological innovation and factor price shocks); the other is local and country-specific, affecting all industries within the same country equally (we can think of it as depending on country’s specific characteristics). As argued by FL, this exercise is not straightforward since growth opportunities are not generally observable by the econometrician. For this reason, FL develop a new methodology based on the correlation of industry growth rates between each pair of countries in the sample and propose two new indirect tests that avoid to measure these opportunities directly. In the case of global shocks, well-developed financial institutions might help countries to implement technological innovations and to respond to factor price shocks.Footnote 2 In this case, the test is whether two countries show similar patterns of growth rates (i.e. we observe highly correlated growth rates) across sectors when both have well-developed financial markets. On the other hand, local growth opportunities depend on country characteristics and, in particular, on the level of real per-capita GDP. The use of this indicator, proposed by Chenery (1960), is based on the intuitive idea that “countries at similar levels of income experience demand-driven similarities in industrial growth rates” (Fisman and Love 2004a, p. 2786). In this case, the test is whether financial development leads to more correlated patterns of growth rates across industries for pairs of countries that have more similar income per capita. By adopting this methodology, FL find that countries have more highly correlated growth rates across sectors when both have well-developed financial institutions. This effect is stronger among countries at a similar level of economic development. FL posit that this approach allows them to “test the finance and growth hypothesis by looking at commonalities and differences in growth opportunities across countries” (Fisman and Love 2004a, p. 2805), without measuring growth opportunities directly. However, as argued by Bekaert et al. (2007), an exogenous and forward-looking measure of growth opportunities can be obtained by interacting the country’s pattern of industrial specialization with industry-level price-earnings ratios.Footnote 3
 Therefore, this paper incorporates into the methodology developed by FL two direct measures of growth opportunities calculated by considering price-earnings ratios, as in Bekaert et al. (2007). In particular, such measures are based on information contained in financial indicators and rely on two assumptions: first, “the growth potential of a country is largely reflected in the growth potential of its mix of industries” and second, “price-earnings ratios, contain information about growth opportunities” (Bekaert et al. 2007, p. 1082). Given these assumptions, global growth opportunities are the weighted average of world industry price-earnings ratios and local growth opportunities are the weighted average of country-specific industry price-earnings ratios. In both cases, the weights are the relative market capitalizations of industries. The main advantage of using the price-earnings ratio as an indicator of growth opportunities relies on the fact that it reflects the expected value of the firm’s future profits in an industry relative to actual earnings. This implies that when prices are high relative to earnings, investors are willing to pay a large multiple of actual earnings to buy a firm’s shares because they expect profits to rise in the future. The price-earnings ratio is related to the net present value of growth opportunities. In this case, the market’s prices are anticipating the future growth opportunities and the stock market is capitalizing on their present value; in this sense the price-earnings ratio can be considered a forward-looking measure. Therefore, the price-earnings ratio contains information on the future growth perspectives of the composing industries in a country. The present work embeds the resource allocation hypothesis in an international cross-section framework and tests three main hypotheses by using manufacturing industry data for (a sample of) 37 developed and developing countries over the period 1992–2006. The first hypothesis is that similarities between two countries in global and local growth opportunities are likely to translate into highly correlated patterns of industry growth. The second hypothesis is that two countries have highly correlated growth rates across their composing industries if both are financially developed. The third hypothesis is that a given industry, operating in two different countries, can take advantage of positive shocks in global and local growth opportunities only if both countries are financially developed. This implies that two countries are expected to grow in similar industries only if both financial systems are able to channel financial resources toward the most productive uses. The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical approach adopted to test the implications of the capital allocation hypothesis on growth. Section 3 describes the data used in the empirical analysis and their sources. Section 4 presents summary statistics and the correlations among variables. Section 5 presents the empirical results and Sect. 6 concludes.",1
150,3,Review of World Economics,01 March 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-014-0188-3,Do we really know that trade agreements increase trade?,August 2014,Tristan Kohl,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The global economy has witnessed a remarkable proliferation of economic integration agreements (EIAs) in the past two decades. In the empirical literature, which uses the gravity equation to model determinants of world trade, it is not uncommon to find studies indicating that EIAs promote their members’ trade by as much as 420 % (see, e.g., Subramanian and Wei 2007). As the gravity equation has recently witnessed several improvements both to its theoretical foundation and empirical applications, the purpose of this study is to show how these developments, in turn, have important ramifications for regionalism’s estimated impact on international trade. Moreover, we identify three issues in the applied international trade literature that warrant further inspection. First, the prevalent approach assumes that trade agreements bring about trade liberalisation that will change the amount of cross-border trade (henceforth called the “EIA effect”). But what if the reverse is true? If governments sign EIAs only after substantial changes in their trade levels have already materialised, then factors other than trade policy are affecting trade and possibly the decision to sign trade agreements in the first place. The result is that conventional EIA effects may suffer from endogeneity bias. With only the exception of a few studies that will be noted below, it is a relatively unexplored problem in the literature. The present study aims to provide new, unbiased estimates of regionalism’s effect on trade. Second, when it comes to empirical evidence on EIA effects, a trade-off is usually made between a “generalist” and a “specialist” approach. The former involves aggregation of numerous EIAs in large datasets to measure the impact of economic integration on world trade at large (see, e.g., Rose 2004; Baier and Bergstrand 2007). The empirical outcome of the generalist strategy usually is that regionalism promotes world trade, ceteris paribus. While these studies have the appeal of generalisability, not much else can or is normally said about the agreement-specific economic consequences of the individual, underlying EIAs. As such, the insightfulness of empirical findings based on this approach for trade policy specialists is limited. In contrast, a large literature pursues a specialist approach in which the effects of individual agreements are examined. Its advantage is that it goes beyond generalising statements about trade policy. In acknowledging that EIAs are different in nature, their heterogeneous effects on international trade flows may be explored in greater detail. Consider, for example, the European Economic Area (EEA) and the Israel-US Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The former is far more extensive in terms of trade liberalisation than the latter, and incorporates many more policy domains that are legally enforceable to foster economic integration (Horn et al. 2010). It could be argued that they differ in economic and political motive, with the emphasis of the EEA being on regional integration in Europe. The main objective of the Israel–US FTA, however, is to serve the US as an instrument to pursue foreign policy goals in the Middle East rather than stimulate free trade (Rosen 2004). Using a categorical variable to distinguish between preferential tariff agreements, free trade areas, customs unions, common markets and monetary unions, Ghosh and Yamarik (2004a) find that agreements proposing a higher degree of integration are associated with higher levels of trade, ceteris paribus. Kohl et al. (2013) take stock of the provisions in 296 trade agreements to further illustrate that trade agreements are heterogeneous in their design, institutional quality and the extent to which their provisions are legally enforceable.Footnote 1 Conceptual differences between EIAs lead to different economic outcomes, adding to the relevance of disaggregating regionalism’s overall effect to illustrate agreement-specific outcomes. Unfortunately, studies following the specialist strategy are usually restricted to one geographic area, a small number of EIAs and shorter time horizons. Most importantly, methodological improvements applied at the generalist level do not tend to be systematically applied when investigating heterogeneous EIA effects. So, while the “specialists” certainly provide details on select subsets of EIAs, methodological differences make it challenging to compare findings across studies. Third, most studies are conducted in such as way that they only explore the effect of present trade liberalisation on present trade flows. In doing so, inter-temporal effects are ignored. Baier and Bergstrand (2007)—henceforth B&B—consider the possibility that nations trade more in anticipation of their governments enforcing a new trade agreement. This argument stems from McLaren (1997), who argues that infrastructure and delivery systems involving sunk costs may be redirected to increase trade, in anticipation of an EIA to become effective. This is what is called the “anticipation effect”. Alternatively, trade increases may be (temporarily) delayed while trade liberalisation is gradually enforced. As in B&B, our reading of the trade agreements covered in this study suggests that it is not uncommon for the tariff schedules to specify gradual liberalisation over the course of several years. For example, an agreement may specify tariff cuts of 20 % upon enforcement of the agreement, 50 % after 5 years, 80 % after 7 years and 100 % after 10 years. Clearly, not capturing these potential “phase-in effects” may underestimate the true impact of these trade agreements. The added value of this study is that it addresses the shortcomings of the generalist and specialist approaches by considering both sides of the proverbial coin. Using B&B’s first-differencing technique that controls for endogeneity bias and inter-temporal effects, we estimate the gravity equation for an up-to-date dataset that covers the years 1950–2010 and 150 countries. In addition to providing novel estimates at an aggregate level, a key feature of this study is that it systematically applies the same methodology across a large number of EIAs to obtain agreement-specific average treatment effects. It will be shown that traditional estimates of the EIA effect tend to be exaggerated if the possibility of endogeneity and phase-in effects remains unaccounted for. Surprisingly, estimates of the agreements’ individual effect on trade are often zero when endogeneity bias has been eliminated. Taken together, the results suggest that EIAs tend to be a product, rather than a cause of intensified cross-border activity. Agreement-specific properties such as the year of enforcement, the number of participants, participants’ WTO status, measures of institutional quality and the design of these agreements all help to explain this variation in performance. The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the empirical literature on EIA effects. Section 3 presents the methodology and results. Section 4 discusses the main findings and concludes.",71

The impact of European Union trade preferences on export prices,August 2014,Xavier Cirera,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) have been a central element of trade policy engagement between OECD countries and developing countries. These are tariff concessions granting market access to preferential partners, and in the case of developing countries some of these schemes are unilateral and do not require reciprocity from preference recipient countries. They are based on one principle of the multilateral trading system, the notion of special and differential treatment (SDT), which allows countries, among other things, to discriminate in favour of developing countries in order to provide enhanced market access. This is expected to increase exports, attract investment and enable countries to develop more efficient industries. The EU grants unilateral preferential access to a large number of developing countries since the early 1970s through the generalised system of preferences (GSP), the Cotonou Agreement (until 2008) and the everything but arms (EBA) initiative for less developed countries (LDCs).Footnote 1 Unilateral preferences, and especially its most important scheme, the GSP are a central pillar of the EU’s strategy towards developing countries. While most evaluations of preferential schemes focus on the impact of trade preferences on trade flows, very little is known about a potential additional benefit for preference eligible exporters: the price rent. Preference margins might create a price rent if products using preferences can be sold at the same price than other competitors without paying the tariff. Therefore, a key question is who captures this price rent, exporters or importers. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the existing literature on the analysis of the impact of trade preferences by analysing empirically the extent to which preference margins are transmitted to export prices. In order to do so, we use a highly disaggregated dataset at the product level (Combine Nomenclature CN-10 digits) of imports in the EU for the period from 2002 to 2008. A unique feature of this dataset is the fact that we can identify export flows by preferential scheme. This allows us to establish the effective tariff paid for each export flow (product/country/year), and whether preferences are utilised. This feature is instrumental for the empirical methodology, since observation of both preference utilisation and non-utilisation episodes allow us to compute the price margin and overcome problems from lack of counterfactual prices. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly highlights why preference margins create a price rent. Section 3 briefly describes the existing evidence. Section 4 summarises the data and provides some descriptive statistics about prices and tariffs of preferential regimes in the EU Sect. 5 describes the methodology used and analyses empirically the impact of tariff margins on export prices and price margins. The last section concludes.",10

From 1999 to 2008, the consumer price index increased by 17 % in Germany, compared to 36 % in Greece and Ireland, 34 % in Spain, 30 % in Portugal and 25 % in Italy (Fig. 1). A debate has emerged on the interpretation to be given to this divergence, notably whether the supply side (rising costs) or the demand side (booming credit and consumption, see e.g. Gros 2012; Wyplosz 2013) is the major driver of these inflation trends. Harmonized consumer price index in euro area countries, 1999–2011 (1999 = 100). Source: Ameco Over a longer period, demand factors should normally cancel out. Still, changes in relative prices can take place amongst countries of different levels of development. According to the Balassa–Samuelson effect (BS effect, hereafter, see Balassa 1964; Samuelson 1964), the real exchange rate appreciates during the catch-up process.
Footnote 1 Part of the relative price variations observed in the euro area countries may result from the BS effect. In 1999, however, Ireland had already caught up with Germany in terms of GDP per capita. In the other countries, although part of the price divergence observed during the decade may be explained by the BS effect, the extent of the drift calls for alternative explanations. In this paper, we relax two key assumptions of the BS framework, namely the assumptions of perfect competition in the labor market and in the nontradable sector. This allows us to study the contribution of labor and product market regulations on the evolution of relative prices over time. Our starting point is Fig. 2 which shows the evolution of tradable and nontradable prices from 1999 to 2006 relative to Germany, based on the EU KLEMS database.
Footnote 2 The bulk of price divergences observed between 1999 and 2006 within the euro area seems to be attributable to nontradable sectors. Over this relatively short period, demand-side factors (such as construction bubbles fueled by credit) may have played an important role, for instance in Ireland. Over a longer period, though, our intuition is that any drift in nontradable prices should be related either to the BS effect, or to different paces taken in deregulation.

(1994a), we propose a theoretical model in which market imperfections are allowed to change over time. Our theoretical model predicts that market power in the nontradable sector and employment protection both affect the real exchange rate. Hence, differentiated deregulation across countries will result in relative price variations. Based on econometric estimations for twelve European countries over 1985–2006, we quantify the contributions of the pure BS effect and those of product market regulations and employment protection on real exchange-rate variations. Through a counter-factual analysis, we find that, had product market regulations and employment protection gradually converged to German levels over 1995–2006, then the real exchange-rate appreciation observed in countries such as Greece, Portugal and Italy, would have been muted. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly surveys the literature on the BS effect. In Sect. 3, we present the theoretical framework based on De Gregorio et al. (1994a). The data used in the estimations are described in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents the econometric strategy and reports the empirical estimation results. Section 6 presents a counter-factual exercise.

Similarly, more than 20 % of world production is sent to a different country from the one where it is originated. In dynamic terms, both migration and trade are growing at a very similar rate (Docquier and Rapoport 2012). This paper is about the link between these two flows, the movement of people and the movement of goods. The positive correlation between migration and trade has been widely documented (WTO 2013) and, in the last 20 years, many contributions, starting from the one of Gould (1994), sharpened our knowledge about the interlinkages between these two phenomena. However, the clear identification of the direct causal effect of immigrants on trade flows involving the country of origin and the area of settlement is not as smooth as it might appear. Estimates can be spoiled by the reverse causality inherent to the fact that immigrants generally move to countries where formal or informal links were already established and where trade with their homeland was already preexistent. Common determinants, some of them unobservable, can contemporaneously affect both migration and trade. Specific characteristics at the country of origin level, at the trading-pair level, and at the local level in the host country, if not considered in the analysis can significantly bias the coefficient of interest: the immigration elasticity of trade flows. The paper—that focuses on the case of Italy between 2002 and 2009—is organized as follows. Section 2 acts as a cornerstone and discusses the literature on the pro-trade effects of immigrants, highlighting the traditional mechanisms behind the commonly observed positive effect, the main empirical obstacles to the identification strategy, and the solutions proposed by previous contributions. Section 3 describes the characteristics of the Italian case and discusses the anthropological notion of ‘super-diversity’ in immigration and its applicability to contemporary Italy; points out the great economic and geographical heterogeneity of the country; and presenting and summarizing the data used in the analysis underlines the main advantage of working with two different levels of spatial units, the regional and the provincial level, in order to directly tackle the issue of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and its implications for the empirical analysis. Section 4 includes the benchmark empirical results and stresses the original contributions of the present paper with respect to the existing literature. First, the risk of a spurious correlation between trade and immigration is minimized owing to the very fine geographical scale of the analysis at the provincial level. This also allows us to analyze the implications of the MAUP for the trade-immigration link, to investigate geographical spillovers of immigrants on trade (Sect. 5) and to identify spillover causal effects. Second, the extensive country coverage of our dataset ensures that any sample selection bias stemming from the specific choice of the foreign countries entering the analysis has been minimized. Third, unlike most functional forms estimated in the literature we allow for inter-ethnic spillovers. Our specification (Sect. 5.2) allows for immigrants of other nationalities to affect trade between an Italian province and a specific foreign country. Fourth, to rule out the possibility of an endogeneity bias that could inflate our coefficients of interest, we control for omitted common determinants including time-varying foreign-country-specific, time-varying region-specific and trading-pair fixed effects in the regressions. In Sect. 6, we also make use of an Instrumental Variables (IVs, hereafter) approach à la Altonji and Card (1991), where the geographical distribution of immigrants’ residence permits in 1995 (the earliest year for which comparable geographical data are available) and immigrants’ flows at the nationwide level serve to compute an instrument (the imputed stock of immigrants). Fifth, we bring to the data the two main explanations highlighted in the literature: the business and social network effect
à la Rauch (2001) (i.e., immigrants foster both bilateral imports and exports because of their superior knowledge of, or preferential access to, market opportunities in their home country) and the transplanted home bias effect (Gould 1994; White 2007) (i.e., immigrants promote imports of their home country consumption-goods to satisfy their different consumption tastes) estimating the pro-trade effect of immigrants on both export and import flows. Finally, we give evidence (Sect. 7) of the heterogeneous effects of immigrants on trade according to the level of per capita income of their country of origin, their education level, the timing of arrival (distinguishing between ethnic groups participating to the first or the second wave of immigration) and their geographical location in Italy (distinguishing between Northern and Southern Italy). Section 8 summarizes the paper’s main findings. The Online-Appendices include the full description of the variables used, the list of the foreign countries considered in the analysis, a discussion of the role of fixed effects in saturating the empirical model, a description of the empirical attempts related to the inclusion of zero-trade flows in the analysis, and the discussion of the peculiar role played by large Italian cities such as Rome and Milan.",37

In 2003, Nathan Jensen wrote that “The conventional wisdom is that multinationals prefer to invest in authoritarian regimes” (Jensen 2003, p. 593). If the conventional wisdom were true, then the United Nations Millennium Declaration’s simultaneous advocacy of strengthening democracy and increasing FDI inflows would be contradictory (UN 2000). However, eleven of twelve studies recently surveyed by Asiedu and Lien (2011, footnote 9) find an insignificant or—more often—positive effect of democracy on FDI, while only one study reports a negative effect. Two additional studies confirm the generally positive effect of democracy on FDI (Asiedu and Lien 2011; Vadlamannati 2012). For the most part, though, these studies analyse aggregate FDI data.Footnote 1 This is a serious limitation, for a central tenet of theories of multinational enterprises (MNEs) is that FDI is undertaken in different industries for different reasons. Our approach is to use data on industry-level data on FDI outflows from the United States, which is the largest FDI source country (UNCTAD 2012). More specifically, we evaluate US FDI outflows at the industry-level in a linear dynamic panel-data model incorporating three widely used indexes of democracy. At the aggregate-level, we estimate a positive effect of democracy on FDI, consistent with most prior studies. At the industry-level, we estimate larger positive effects of democracy on FDI for service than manufacturing industries, particularly for finance and insurance and information, and—consistent with Asiedu and Lien (2011)—we find negative effects of democracy only on FDI for mining and oil and gas extraction.",19
150,3,Review of World Economics,12 February 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-014-0187-4,Identifying thresholds in aid effectiveness,August 2014,Laurent Wagner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the seminal work of Burnside and Dollar (2000), the question of the conditions on which aid effectiveness depends has become central in the aid debate. Basically, Burnside and Dollar found that aid is effective only if the quality of the recipient country’s economic policy is good enough. Consequently, in order to maximize aid efficiency, donors have to condition their disbursements following the recipient country’s policy and institution ratings (Collier and Dollar 2002). Today this recommendation is still widely followed by the World Bank as well as by some national aid agencies, although serious doubts have been cast by many authors about the robustness and relevance of its reasoning (see Rajan and Subramanian 2008; Roodman 2007; Easterly et al. 2004; for examples of this critique). Besides countries’ policies or institutions (or instead of them), Guillaumont and Chauvet (2001), Chauvet and Guillaumont (2004), Collier and Dehn (2001), Collier and Goderis (2009), and Guillaumont and Wagner (2012) argue that macroeconomic vulnerability has to be accounted for to identify the effect of aid on growth, because macroeconomic vulnerability is likely to increase the marginal impact of aid on growth. Following similar reasoning, a second branch of research has argued that an important part of the story is ignored by not taking into account the absorptive capacity of aid-receiving countries. This branch of research implies that the aid to growth relationship may show diminishing returns (see Feeny and McGillivray 2011 for an extensive review). A large number of studies have examined this hypothesis and have confirmed, to some extent, the existence of such a relationship between aid and growth.Footnote 1 These studies typically estimate a simple growth equation by introducing aid over GDP and its squared value.Footnote 2 The related coefficients’ signs are found to be respectively positive and negative, implying an inverted-U shape relation between aid and growth, whose upper limit gives the value of the threshold for the maximum contribution of aid to growth. This point represents the maximum level of aid a country can manage efficiently—also known as its absorptive capacity. However, as mentioned in Guillaumont and Guillaumont Jeanneney (2010) and Feeny and de Silva (2013), while it is widely agreed that the marginal returns of aid decrease at the macroeconomic level, numerous and often contradictory hypotheses have been formulated to explain the nature of the capacity constraints—for instance capital, policy, institutional, macroeconomic, social, and cultural constraints, and also donor practices. Whereas diminishing returns imply an inverted U-shape relationship between aid and growth, another part of the literature supports the alternative hypothesis that only large aid inflows could initialize upward paths to economic development, pointing to more complex nonlinearities. This particular view of aid effectiveness, which refers to the “Big Push” concept, is based on the assumption that developing countries are stuck in poverty traps, because they lack the minimum capital needed for making productive investments and that aid can help by closing this financing gap. Thus, the “Big Push” hypothesis refers to aid financed investments that would, if large enough, lead to growth. This concept of “Big Push” implies that the relationship between aid and growth is nonlinear and should display positive returns only if the level of aid is above a minimal threshold. To our knowledge, very few empirical studies provide support for this hypothesis, primarily because of the difficulties to estimate such nonlinearities. For example, Gomanee et al. (2003), after implementing a threshold regression, find a nonlinear impact of aid. They argue that aid raises growth positively and significantly only if the official development assistance (ODA) to GDP ratio is above 2 %. So in order to effectively stimulate growth the amount of aid has to reach a critical level. Alternatively, if aid flows are too low, aid is unlikely to foster economic development. Thus, two opposing concepts—of capacity constraint and Big Push—dominate the present aid debate. On one hand, there is the United Nations objective of doubling aid to reduce poverty by half, and on the other hand, the scepticism that aid will not be absorbed usefully. While apparently contradictory, these views of aid effectiveness are not really new and paradoxically have common roots (Rosenstein-Rodan 1943; Millikan and Rostow 1957; Chenery and Strout 1966). Both concepts are founded on the idea that low-income countries face structural problems to growth, which are reflected in their absorptive capacity and which require massive investment in inter-dependent sectors—the so-called “Big Push”—to be resolved. The amount invested has to reach a critical amount to tackle key bottlenecks simultaneously in order to initiate growth. Thus, the relationship between aid and growth should be significant only if the amount of aid disbursed is above a certain threshold. This requirement is behind the argument for doubling aid in order to fill the financial gap but also to lift countries out of a stagnation trap which would be impossible to escape otherwise (Sachs 2005). These arguments have been strongly criticized notably in Easterly (2006) in an attack against the very idea of the existence of traps and its Big Push corollary. Other critical opinions have pointed to the capacity issue, and highlighted the fact that an unconsidered increase in aid disbursement is likely to be partially wasted (Collier 2006). More recently, Feeny and de Silva (2013), in line with Feeny and McGillivray (2011), show that it is possible to estimate individual countries’ own capacity thresholds and that a significant number of developing countries receive more aid than they can manage. According to their estimates, doubling aid indiscriminately would provide inefficient levels of aid to many countries. However, they show that the majority of developing countries are far from receiving the amount of aid that maximizes growth, and would benefit from a targeted increase in their aid allocation. Thus, they argue that a large increase in foreign aid budgets would lead to a significant increase in economic growth, if and only if, the issue of absorptive capacity is taken into account by donors in their allocation frameworks. Examining how to empirically reconcile “Big Push” and “absorptive capacity”, Guillaumont and Guillaumont Jeanneney (2010) suggest the existence of two successive thresholds, a lower one corresponding to the aid level required for a “Big Push”, and an upper one corresponding to absorptive capacity. But they consider that these two thresholds cannot be properly estimated simply by introducing squared and cubed aid terms in the standard growth equation (How to interpret the negative marginal returns below the lower threshold? How to specify null rather than negative returns?), and that it would be difficult to treat simultaneously the possible conditional effects of aid. In this paper we argue that the assumption of two thresholds is logical and that multiple thresholds may characterize the aid to growth relationship as countries overcome or encounter new constraints. Our objective here is to re-address the nonlinearity issue by implementing an econometric strategy which allows us to discover the way growth responds to aid in a more complex, but more understandable, way than in the studies mentioned above. The semi-parametric model that we use is a partially linear model that allows for the nonlinear component to be entered additively. Whereas the traditional semi-parametric partially linear regression treats the variables which are entered into the non-linear part of the model as nuisance variables, the semi-parametric additive model allows for the explicit estimation of the marginal effects of the nonlinear components on the dependent variable. Furthermore, this estimation procedure offers graphical representations which provide a useful way of visualizing the analysis. We find that the aid to growth relationship is highly nonlinear, and that economic vulnerability is a key factor in influencing the level of the aid to growth thresholds. In the next section we present the basic econometric framework that we use to analyse our data. In Sect. 3 we then proceed to discuss our empirical findings. Lastly, in Sect. 4 we offer conclusions.",17
150,4,Review of World Economics,01 June 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-014-0193-6,International environmental outsourcing,November 2014,Matthew A. Cole,Robert J. R. Elliott,Toshihiro Okubo,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The complex relationship between international trade and the environment has been thoroughly investigated in recent years often with differing conclusions (Antweiler et al. 2001; Cole and Elliott 2003; Frankel and Rose 2005; Lovely and Popp 2011). Central to the debate in the popular press is the concern that stringent environmental regulations in developed countries damage the competitiveness of firms. If true, it is claimed that the result will be pollution ‘leakage’ as pollution-intensive firms either physically relocate to low regulation economies or are simply displaced by similar firms in low regulation countries. A large number of studies have examined this proposition, commonly referred to as the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH), either by studying foreign direct investment (FDI) patterns (see e.g. Eskeland and Harrison 2003; Cole et al. 2006) or net trade patterns (see e.g. Ederington et al. 2005). The findings of this literature are decidedly mixed.Footnote 1
 In this paper we address an aspect of the PHH that has been ignored within the trade-environment literature to date, the notion of outsourcing; that is the increasing tendency of firms to subcontract parts of their production process to other firms that are often based overseas. Outsourcing has received considerable attention in the trade literature with studies such as Feenstra and Hanson (1999, 2006), Grossman and Helpman (2005), Grossman et al. (2005), Hsieh and Woo (2005), Tomiura (2007) and Schwörer (2013) typically focusing on the potential positive impact of outsourcing on domestic firm productivity. However, neither this literature, nor the trade-environment literature, has made reference to the possibility that firms may outsource the pollution-intensive parts of their production process as a means of avoiding stringent domestic regulations.Footnote 2
 There are several reasons why it may be helpful to examine the impact of regulation costs on international outsourcing as opposed to net trade or FDI patterns. First, with regard to net trade patterns, it is clear that the output from international outsourcing influences, and is included within, net trade figures (usually examined at the industry level in the previous literature including for example Ederington et al. (2005). The problem is that the impact of the extent of outsourcing by any individual firm would be highly diluted within the overall net export figures for a particular industry. If outsourcing turns out to be a direct mechanism through which firms respond to changes in regulation costs then this may be missed if the focus is on overall trade patterns at the level of the industry, perhaps explaining the relatively weak evidence of pollution have effects provided by the net trade literature. With regards to FDI, a number of attempts have been made to explain theoretically the various factors that firms consider when making a choice between outsourcing and FDI. Attention has typically focused on the role played by incomplete contracts, the thickness of markets, the cost base of the firm and strategic considerations more generally (Grossman and Helpman 2002; Spencer 2005). Regarding the latter, Leahy and Montagna (2009) go as far as to argue that ex ante identical firms may choose different internationalization options (i.e. FDI or outsourcing) purely as a result of strategic considerations (see also Calia and Ferrante 2013). More recently, these issues have been considered theoretically in an environmental context by Dijkstra et al. (2011), Sanna-Randaccio and Sestini (2012) and Elliott and Zhou (2013). However, this literature is in its infancy, with little by way of strong empirical evidence to support the various assertions as to how firms choose between these different avenues of internationalization. Given this uncertainty, and the presence of increasing trends of both FDI and outsourcing, there seems no reason to necessarily assume that firms’ environmental regulation costs will necessarily affect their decisions whether or not to undertake FDI in the same way as the decision to undertake international outsourcing. While several studies have examined the impact of such costs on FDI flows, none has yet examined the impact on outsourcing. The specific focus in this paper is therefore on firm-level international outsourcing and the theoretical and empirical mechanisms through which it may be influenced by environmental regulation costs. We therefore believe this to be the first paper to consider the link between outsourcing and the environment and believe it provides one of the cleanest mechanisms for indentifying pollution haven consistent effects. To introduce the concept of environmental outsourcing we first build a model of outsourcing with heterogeneous firms that concentrates on the roles played by firm size and productivity, transport costs and environmental regulations. We then test the model’s predictions using Japanese firm-level data. Japan provides an excellent setting in which to test our model given the considerable levels of outsourcing and FDI undertaken by Japan in recent years. Significant parts of the Japanese supply chain are located overseas, particularly in China and other developing Asian economies such as Malaysia and especially Thailand and is open referred to as the flying geese model. As a result the Japanese economy is increasingly dependent on imports of intermediate goods as well as energy imports. It is worth emphasising here that to a large extent the originality of this paper is derived from access to the unique Japanese data. As a rule it is rare to find a large firm-level dataset that includes environmental behaviour questions and equally rare to find a dataset that includes detailed information on outsourcing which tends to be peripheral to the core questions usually included in firm-level datasets. The combination of outsourcing and environmental questions is what allows us to investigate this issue for the first time.Footnote 3
 Our results show that in an analysis of over 12,000 Japanese firms, that there is evidence of Japanese environmental outsourcing which is consistent with a pollution haven effect. We find transport costs to be a significant deterrent to this process which is consistent with the traditional gravity models of FDI and trade. Our results are robust to different econometrics specifications and reassuringly we find regulations have no effect on domestic outsourcing as expected. This paper has potentially important policy implications. First, as a rule the net effect of international environmental outsourcing is more than likely to be detrimental to the global environment if production that formerly occurred within a highly regulated economy now takes place in countries with less stringent regulations where production technologies are less clean. However, even with identical technologies which means that environmental costs and benefits home and abroad cancel out, international outsourcing is still likely to lead to a net increase in pollution due to the increase in transport related pollution from the movement of intermediate goods between the home and host countries.Footnote 4
 It is clear that any equitable climate change policy will need to address international outsourcing as a possible transmission mechanism for pollution ‘leakage’. For example, the Chinese or Russian government may object to pressure from the West to reduce emissions if a significant proportion of these emissions are as a result of supplying dirty (carbon-intensive) intermediate goods back to Western firms especially if the final product is then exported back to China, Russia or elsewhere. The design of climate change policy needs to take into account these potentially complex trading relationships. Such complexities are likely to be part of the explanation for a relative lack of progress at conferences to discuss environmental policy agreements such as those at Copenhagen and Rio 20 + 20. There are also implications for border carbon adjustment mechanisms (Mattoo et al. 2013) as the outsourcer may object to paying tax on the intermediate imports as it would increase costs. More positively, the implications for a country of increasing environmental regulations may be less severe than first thought. Instead of firms relocating or closing down in light of an increase in environmental regulations and a loss of competitiveness firms may simply adjust to a change in their cost structure and outsource the dirtiest part of the production process and hence most costly in terms of regulations. Whilst job would be lost in that part of their production process outsourced it might result in more high-skilled jobs being created elsewhere in the firm (in design or research and development) as abatement savings improve profits at home as a result of abatement cost free inputs. Indirectly, these new jobs could be considered as part of the much heralded ‘green jobs’ revolution. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 provides some theoretical considerations and presents our model. Section 3 outlines our empirical methodology and data while Sects. 4 and 5 provide empirical results and conclusions respectively.",35
150,4,Review of World Economics,01 June 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-014-0196-3,How does taste and quality impact on import prices?,November 2014,Konstantins Benkovskis,Julia Wörz,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Developments of import prices are important in many respects for open economies. In the presence of imports in the consumption bundle, the average price of imported goods affects consumer price index and consumer welfare. The measurement of import price developments is not straightforward, however. Differences in quality and tastes influence unit values of internationally traded goods. For that reason statistical offices mostly rely on price surveys of importers, treating the issue of changing quality by the overlap method (see Eurostat 2011). Although this is a clear improvement over the simple aggregation of changes in unit values, many problems still remain. Indeed, if consumer welfare is the subject of the analysis, one cannot ignore quality, tastes and variety issues. Reported import prices, even when partially adjusted for quality, measure changes in the price for one unit of a product, while the welfare analysis requires price per unit of unobserved utility. The literature on the role of variety, quality and taste in international trade is numerous and expanding. As to variety, monopolistic competition models, like the one developed by Krugman (1979, 1980), put emphasis on the role of extensive margin, maintaining that greater variety of products can boost trade. The seminal paper of Feenstra (1994) shows how to incorporate new product varieties into a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregate of import prices. His approach also allows for taste and quality change in existing varieties by treating it as a specific case of variety changes. The most famous empirical application of Feenstra’s (1994) approach was performed by Broda and Weinstein (2006), who include a proxy for unobservable growth in product variety in their calculations of import price index and evaluate gains from variety in the US. According to their results, ignoring changes in variety accounted for a significant upward bias in the estimates of US import prices. The welfare gains of US consumers from a broader range of variety accounted for about 0.1 % of GDP every year. However, these calculations are based on the rather restrictive assumption that consumer tastes and product quality are constant over time for all import varieties existing in both periods. Vertical product differentiation, emphasized by Flam and Helpman (1987), is to a large extent ignored in the exact import price index of Broda and Weinstein (2006). In view of rapid technological change in many sectors and possible shifts in consumer preferences this assumption may become increasingly problematic. While Feenstra’s (1994) framework allows for taste and quality change in existing varieties, it requires to make a prior distinction between varieties with constant and altered quality. Many attempts were recently made to evaluate quality from unit value data. Hallak and Schott (2011) decompose export prices into quality versus quality-adjusted components using information on the trade balance, Khandelwal (2010) and Amiti and Khandelwal (2013) exploit price and quantity information to estimate the quality of products, Di Comite et al. (2012) use unique firm-product-country data to capture quality of products and consumer tastes. The paper by Feenstra and Romalis (2012) considers supply and demand side, which allows for the construction of quality-adjusted price indices of exports and imports. Alternatively, quality and quality-adjusted prices can be derived from data on imported product physical characteristics, like in Sheu (2011). We contribute to the existing literature on adjusted trade prices by suggesting an alternative derivation of exact import price index. We use the framework of Broda and Weinstein (2006) and relax the assumption of unchanged taste and quality parameter for all varieties existing in both periods. We show that it is in fact possible to evaluate the unobservable taste and quality parameter within the same theoretical framework using less restrictive assumptions. After solving the optimisation problem, changes in relative taste and quality could be defined as a function of observable unit values and volumes of imports as well as unobservable elasticities of substitution between varieties and between products. Thus, we follow Hummels and Klenow (2005) and Khandelwal (2010) in spirit. The methodology we propose has its advantages and limitations. A major advantage is the relaxation of the assumption of unchanged tastes and quality for all varieties existing in both periods, which allows us to assess the impact of changes in tastes and quality on import prices and consumer welfare. Our methodology only requires to define a benchmark product category with no major shifts in consumer preferences and physical quality over time. Comparing with Feenstra’s (1994) framework that requires unchanged quality and taste for all varieties in benchmark set, our approach is more flexible. We can allow for unchanged average taste and quality for a broad benchmark product category (e.g. food products), while taste and quality of individual varieties within benchmark category can vary. A similar price index is proposed by Sheu (2011), however her method uses characteristics for a specific product derived from micro-data, and does not allow for evaluations of price and welfare effects on the macro level. Moreover, data on product characteristics contain information on physical quality but not on taste. Our approach takes into account both, taste and quality. One drawback of our methodology stems from traditional Armington’s (1969) definition of variety we utilise here—imports are differentiated across countries of supply.Footnote 1 As a result, any change in the number of varieties within an exporting country will be classified as change in taste and quality in our framework. The potential bias is high. Mohler (2011) reports a sixfold increase in gains from variety under the assumption of no intensive margin (this measurement can serve as an upper bound for gains in variety), while the analysis by Bloningen and Soderbery (2010) reveals a 70 % increase in gains from variety when shifting to firm-level data. Unfortunately, we are not able to disentangle taste and quality from within-country variety due to lack of firm-level data. The other limitation of our method is that we are unable to separate taste from quality. Di Comite et al. (2012) argued that this task is hard to achieve in a framework based on consumers’ utility alone and looking only at prices and quantities sold. The approach of Feenstra and Romalis (2012) is an excellent example of how the inclusion of the firms’ optimization problem into this analysis allows to distinguish between quality and taste. This requires a more complicated modelling framework, which in turn stresses another advantage of our method—its comparative ease of implementation and considerably lower data requirements. Our goal is to evaluate the exact import price index of four European countries (Germany, France, Italy and the UK)Footnote 2 taking into account changes in variety, product set, taste and quality of imports. This is done by using highly disaggregated import data (eight-digit CN classification level from Eurostat Comext database) from 50 major trading partners between 1995 and 2012. In this paper we lay out our proposed methodology, estimate an import price index which corrects for changes in variety, the set of products, as well as tastes and quality and calculate welfare gains. The article is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical framework based on the consumer’s utility maximization problem, outlines the main assumptions behind the conventional methodology and shows the way in which we propose to relax some of these assumptions. Section 3 briefly describes the database and reports some stylized facts. Section 4 is devoted to the estimation of substitution elasticities. In Sect. 5 we discuss the choice of a benchmark product group and calculate an exact import price index and related welfare gains. It also includes an assessment of the importance of taste for import prices. Section 6 concludes.",8

First, FDI has a complementary or crowding-in effect when it increases the stock of physical capital and provides superior technology that improves the productivity of domestic firms. Furthermore, the positive externalities from FDI that result from transmission of new ideas, entrepreneurial skills, and other knowledge transfers can also crowd in domestic investment by improving the productivity of existing domestic establishments and encouraging the entry of new local firms. These positive spillover effects can either be horizontal (when they benefit domestic firms within the same industry) or vertical (when they benefit local input suppliers). Second, FDI substitutes or crowds out domestic investment when it competes with domestic producers, increases average fixed costs of entry, or does not generate any positive technological and knowledge spillovers, either horizontally or vertically. The empirical literature has found evidence which supports both outcomes in the developed and developing countries. Agosin and Machado (2005) found that over the period 1971–2000, FDI displaced domestic investment in Latin America but not in Africa and Asia regions. However their results for different sub-samples do show significant crowding out in Latin America in the 1970s and in Africa in the 1990s. Their results for the Asian countries are supported by Kim and Seo (2003) who find that FDI does not crowd out domestic investment in Korea. Evidence from Borensztein et al. (1998) supports the positive effect of FDI on domestic investment in developing countries. De Mello (1999) finds a positive impact of FDI on domestic investment in the OECD countries over the period 1970–1990, while Lipsey (2000) finds evidence of a mostly negative relationship between inward FDI and domestic investment in OECD countries over the period 1975–1995. Why does the effect of FDI on domestic investment differ across countries and even within countries at different time periods? This paper posits that differences in the investment climate are crucial for explaining the effect of FDI, both within and across host country economies. A good investment climate plays a crucial role in driving economic growth and reducing poverty by fostering productive private investment (World Bank 2004a). The prospects for increasing the volume and efficiency of FDI can however be hampered by serious distortions in the investment climate as pointed out by Borensztein et al. (1998) and others. In addition, we cannot rule out the possibility that weaknesses in the investment climate can also induce crowding out of domestic investment by the FDI through the channels discussed above. This implies therefore that the interaction of FDI with the investment climate is important for understanding its impact on domestic investment. Sound business regulations are a basic foundation of a good investment climate and this paper considers official regulations required to start a new domestically owned limited liability business (business entry regulations). There are two main channels through which business entry regulations can potentially affect the relationship between FDI and domestic investment. The first is the impact of entry regulations on the investment by new firms. Bureaucratic entry regulations that are costly impede new firm creation, and as such any technology and knowledge spillovers from FDI that would otherwise crowd in domestic investment by encouraging the entry of new firms will not be realized, and the crowding-in effect of FDI will be reduced. The second is the impact of entry regulations on investment by existing firms. Since small young firms are the source of Schumpeterian forces of creative destruction which are essential for economic dynamism, higher bureaucratic barriers to entry reduce productivity growth of existing firms because the disciplinary effects of competition are inhibited. As pointed out by Klapper et al. (2006) and Aghion et al. (2009), entry barriers reduce incentives to innovate and prevent incumbent firms from moving closer to the technological frontier, and this in turn reduces future productivity. As a result, incumbent firms are most likely to become far too reliant on incumbency rents than on productivity gains offered by superior technology and the knowledge transfers from FDI. This reduces the crowding-in effect of FDI on the investment of incumbent firms. Data for a sample of 138 countries over the period 2000–2010 were used to empirically analyze the effects of business entry regulations and FDI on domestic investment, and the manner in which the effect of FDI on domestic investment is impacted by business entry regulations. The paper finds robust evidence that domestic investment is significantly lower in countries with more costly entry regulation. More specifically, the effect of FDI on domestic investment evaluated at the mean cost of business start-up is estimated to be −0.09 %. This implies that a 10 % increase in FDI reduces domestic investment by 0.9 % at the mean cost of business start-up. The poorest group of countries (those that are in the bottom quartile of income per capita), have the highest cost of entry regulation averaging 219.39 % of GNI per capita. There are 35 countries in this group, and the cost of entry regulation ranges from 12 % in Kyrgyz Republic to 1515.9 % of GNI per capita in Sierra Leone. More than half of the countries within the group have entry regulation cost that is above the overall sample average of 89.5 % of GNI per capita. Based on the estimation results, entry regulation cost in excess of 107 % of GNI per capita causes FDI to crowd out domestic investment, and 57 % of countries in the bottom quartile of GDP per capita have entry cost above this figure. In contrast, entry regulation is only 11.25 % of GNI per capita on average in the rich countries (those in the top quartile of income per capita), and it ranges from zero percent in Denmark to 67.25 % in Saudi Arabia, which is below both the overall sample average and the estimated threshold where FDI crowds out domestic investment. Clearly, reforms to make entry regulation less costly are much more important in the lowest- income countries. These reforms will accelerate new business creation (a salient feature of the entrepreneurial process (Naude 2010; Gough 1969)), and enhance the positive impact of FDI on domestic capital formation. This study and its findings relate to studies that examine the influence of FDI on domestic investment discussed above and to a growing strand of literature which finds that entry deregulation is generally associated with superior economic outcomes such as higher per capita income, reduction in the size of the unofficial economy, less corruption, and improvement in productivity (Xu 2011; Freund and Bolaky 2008; Djankov et al. 2002; and World Bank 2004b). The central contribution of this paper is its focus on business entry regulations and how they impact the relationship between FDI and domestic investment. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the variables, empirical model, and data are discussed in Sect. 2, the estimation results are presented in Sect. 3, and finally Sect. 4 concludes.",23

Footnote 1 and the Micro-econometrics of International Firm Activities.Footnote 2 An emerging literature on international activities of heterogeneous firms argues that productivity is a crucial determinant of export activities. Following Melitz (2003), a large number of theoretical models show that, under certain conditions, firms below a certain cut-off point in the productivity distribution serve the national market only, while firms above it serve both national and foreign markets. This role of productivity as a driver of exports is due to fixed export costs (i.e., costs for learning about a foreign market, setting up a distribution network, adopting products to tastes of consumers and to technical standards demanded in a foreign country, etc.), because only firms with a productivity above a certain threshold can make a profit from serving a foreign market after paying these extra costs of exporting (see Helpman 2006, p. 592ff.). In support of these theoretical models, empirical studies document that exporting firms are more productive than firms that sell on the national market only [see Wagner (2007) and Wagner (2012) for surveys]. This positive exporter productivity premium is robust to controlling for observed firm characteristics and firm fixed effects in regression models.Footnote 3 A vast majority of this empirical support is based on a positive exporter premium at the conditional mean of the productivity distribution. However, it is unclear how relevant the conditional mean is in a Melitz-style model. The Melitz model has implications for the distribution of productivity of firms that export versus those that do not. A positive mean premium is one consequence of the Melitz model, but insufficient for determining its accuracy. The implications for such models would be very different if, for example, a few very productive exporting firms are responsible for the positive mean exporter premium. Consequently, the mean estimates in the literature provide little information about the relevance of the Melitz model. In our analysis of firm-level microdata, we find that both exporters and non-exporters tend to be highly heterogeneous. There are low productivity exporters and high productivity non-exporters. This points to the existence of other factors that foster exporting besides productivity and that are absent from the Melitz model. We believe this supports the necessity of conditioning on firm fixed effects to account for these other sources of heterogeneity. While the Melitz model predicts a clear dividing line between exporting and non-exporting firms, this standard is too high for an empirical test. Our methodology allows us to estimate the exporter premium at different points in the distribution to understand the accuracy of the Melitz model. This paper contributes to the literature by using comprehensive firm level data for manufacturing enterprises in Germany, one of the leading actors on the world markets for goods, to investigate productivity differences between exporting and non-exporting firms over the whole productivity distribution. We use a quantile framework to characterize the entire productivity distribution for both exporting and non-exporting firms. The literature has previously recognized that quantile estimates are interesting in this context. Furthermore, many papers in the literature have understood the potential importance of conditioning on enterprise fixed effects to account for unobserved firm-level characteristics. We also believe that accounting for firm-level fixed effects is potentially important and employ a newly developed quantile regression estimator for panel data models (QRPD). This QRPD estimator, introduced in Powell (2014), conditions on firm-level fixed effects for identification purposes—identification originates solely from firm-level changes in exporter status. Unlike many quantile panel data estimators which include an additive fixed effect, QRPD includes a nonseparable fixed effect term, allowing the estimates to be interpreted in the same manner as traditional cross-sectional quantile estimates. We condition on firm fixed effects because there may be unobserved factors outside of the Melitz model that impact productivity but correlate with exporter status. Furthermore, the cross-sectional productivity differences at any point in time are uninformative of the potential ramifications of trade liberalization which would result in firms changing export status. Instead, we are interested in the productivity increases associated with changes in firm exporting status, implying that it is essential to condition on firm fixed effects. This is the first paper in the literature to simultaneously emphasize the importance of quantile estimation and firm-level fixed effects. Consequently, we believe it offers crucial evidence concerning the impact of trade liberalization and the utility of existing trade models. A major contribution of this paper is the methodology, which can be extended to other data sources and outcomes in the literature. To preview our results, we find that the exporter premium is positive over the whole productivity distribution even when unobserved firm heterogeneity is controlled for. Importantly, we find the largest premium at the bottom of the distribution, suggesting that there is a meaningful productivity division between exporters and non-exporters. This implies that the central policy implication of the Melitz model is still valid in a world with more than one driver of exports: a reduction in trade barriers leads to exit of low-productive firms and reallocation of output and employment towards higher-productivity firms. We also verify that this positive exporter premium is not simply a by-product of cross-industry differences in exporting behavior. We examine the exporter premium for the three largest industries in our data and find supporting evidence of a positive premium throughout the distribution in each industry. The implications would be very different if the premium was driven primarily by cross-industry comparisons. We interpret the positive within-industry premia as further support of the Melitz model. The magnitudes of our results are economically meaningful, but it is also important to note that conditioning on firm fixed effects significantly decreases our estimates of the exporter premium, implying that estimates in the literature are biased by confounding factors. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in this study. Section 3 reports descriptive results on productivity differences between and among exporters and non-exporters inside narrowly defined industries and shows that there are many low productivity exporters and high productivity non-exporters. Section 4 introduces our empirical strategy. Section 5 presents our results. Section 6 concludes.",40
150,4,Review of World Economics,25 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-014-0198-1,Elasticity of substitution and anti-dumping decisions,November 2014,Jørgen Drud Hansen,Philipp Meinen,Jørgen Ulff-Møller Nielsen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The theory on optimal tariffs developed by Johnson (1953–1954) shows in a neoclassical trade model that welfare-maximizing governments have an incentive to impose a tariff equal to the inverse of the export supply elasticity. By imposing such a tariff and assuming that the exporting country does not retaliate, a country maximizes welfare by balancing the terms of trade gain to the importer against the costs of import protection. This theory has recently been examined empirically. Broda et al. (2008) show that countries which are not subject to WTO constraints set higher tariffs on goods with lower export supply elasticities. Analyzing the question from a different angle, Bagwell and Staiger (2011) conclude that acceding countries to the WTO commit to reduce the tariffs most for products with high export supply elasticities. These analyses are all based on the assumption of perfect competition. Gros (1987) analyzes theoretically the case of optimal tariffs on markets with imperfect competition and shows in a Krugman type of monopolistic competition model that a welfare-maximizing positive optimal tariff exists, even for a small economy where no terms of trade gain may be obtainable. The optimal tariff in his analysis ensures that the consumer prices of imported product variants exceed the import price by the same mark-up as the mark-up of domestically produced variants, and the level of the optimal tariff is therefore an increasing function of the degree of product differentiation, i.e. it varies inversely with the elasticity of substitution. Chang (2005) broadens the analysis of Gros (1987) by including lobby activities together with the elasticity of substitution as determinants of the size of the tariffs. The above-mentioned literature on optimal tariffs deals with cases in which countries exercise autonomy in imposing tariffs. Most countries in the world economy are members of the WTO, which nowadays commits member countries to keep most favored nation tariffs at a quite low level. For that reason, the tariffs in the various industries are probably below the levels of tariffs the governments would have imposed without WTO commitments. The empirical studies of Broda et al. (2008) and Bagwell and Staiger (2011) include data for tariffs for countries outside the WTO or for changes in tariffs for acceding countries to the WTO, and presumably these data provide information about the preferred tariffs for countries uncommitted by trade agreements. The essential idea in this paper is that information about preferred tariffs for WTO countries is assumed to be revealed in the countries’ administration of the WTO contingency measures. The WTO trade agreements to bind the tariffs are associated with ‘flexibility rules’, which in special circumstances allow member countries to impose protection in cases where imports have caused problems for specific industries. Most notably, if a country has been exposed to dumping from foreign producers, anti-dumping protective measures may be imposed temporarily to protect the injured industry. In such cases the member states of the WTO gain some autonomy in trade policy for the specific industry, and we may therefore expect that the country’s administration of this limited autonomy provides information about its preferred level of tariffs. In recent years, the use of anti-dumping measures has become more widespread. Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand, and the United States were the traditional users of this type of contingency measure compatible with the WTO, but as shown, among others by Prusa (2005), Vandenbussche and Zanardi (2008), and Bown (2011), many more countries have sought refuge in this instrument over the last three decades. The issue dealt with in this paper is therefore highly relevant in trade policy. The basic conditions for the use of anti-dumping measures are given in Article VI in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994b),  (GATT 1994a). Three conditions have to be fulfilled before an importing country can implement anti-dumping measures towards a foreign firm. First, the importing country must demonstrate that its industry has been exposed to dumping, which in the general case means that the foreign firm price discriminates by selling its product in the importing country at a price below the price charged in its own domestic market, or because of pricing below cost. Second, the complaining country must demonstrate injury caused by the dumping behaviour, i.e. that a loss has been inflicted on the import-competing industry due to the dumping. Third, both dumping and injury must be non-negligible. This follows from the so-called ‘de minimis rule’, according to which weak indications of dumping with small injury effects do not authorize the use of anti-dumping measures; see Articles 5 and 9 in the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of GATT (1994b). The most widely used anti-dumping measure is duties. The general principle in setting the size of the duties is that they should not exceed the dumping margin which measures the difference between the normal value of the dumper’s product (typically the home market price) and his export price, both measured at firm gate. The competence to investigate petitions on dumping, and to impose anti-dumping measures, lies at the national level (or EU level), and as the GATT conditions listed above are vague, a quite large leeway exists for the dumping authorities to apply different interpretations and practices. The aim of this paper is to examine the role of the elasticity of substitution for the outcome of anti-dumping investigations. Two lines of reasoning from economic theory point to the relevance of the elasticity of substitution for the anti-dumping policy. First, the theory on optimal tariffs, or endogenous tariff formation, shows that the preferred tariff from a welfare point of view varies inversely with the elasticity of substitution as in Gros (1987). Second, as appears from the theoretical model in the present paper, the dumping margin and, hence, the maximum size of an anti-dumping duty, which may be imposed in accordance with the WTO commitments, also vary inversely with the elasticity of substitution. To the best of our knowledge, previous studies have not dealt specifically with the role of the elasticity of substitution for the anti-dumping policy within the framework of imperfect competition. The issue of the role of import demand and export supply elasticities for tariff formation in cases of dumping for the United States has been analyzed in the paper by Bown and Crowley (2013) based on the perfect competition model by Bagwell and Staiger (1990). The analysis we develop below differs from the paper by Bown and Crowley in two ways. First, our model is based on monopolistic competition instead of perfect competition. The model, which is only used as a general framework for the empirical analysis, predicts that the dumping margin varies inversely with the elasticity of substitution. The elasticity of substitution is therefore an important determinant of the outcome of anti-dumping petitions for countries which commit themselves strongly to rules prescribing mechanically from observable variables how the anti-dumping duty should be determined. Second, our investigation is a multi-country study allowing for country-specific differences in anti-dumping policies. We investigate the role of the elasticity of substitution for the outcome of anti-dumping petitions on data of anti-dumping cases for 19 countries and find the predicted inverse relation between the elasticity of substitution and the final anti-dumping duties. This result is robust to allowing for political economy considerations in the explanation of anti-dumping duties and alternative measures for the elasticity of substitution. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the basic theoretical model, which predicts a negative relationship between the elasticity of substitution and the dumping margin. The model will not be tested directly, but serves only as motivation for the empirical analysis. Section 3 provides information on the data. In the estimations we combine data on anti-dumping measures from 19 countries from Bown (2010) with data on the elasticity of substitution from Broda and Weinstein (2006). Section 4 outlines the empirical model. The empirical results follow in Sect. 5, where the dependent variable is the level of final ad valorem anti-dumping duties. Section 6 concludes.",2
151,1,Review of World Economics,03 August 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-014-0201-x,What is really puzzling about the “distance puzzle”,February 2015,Clément Bosquet,Hervé Boulhol,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"How distance between partner countries shapes trade flows is an important question in international economics. How globalisation has changed the impact of distance on the world trade structure has also attracted wide interest. Previous research, mostly based on a log-specification of trade flows estimated by ordinary least squares (log-OLS), has led to the so called “distance puzzle”, i.e. the idea that despite globalisation the elasticity of trade to distance is generally found to have increased over time. In order to simplify the text, this elasticity is discussed herein in absolute values since there is no ambiguity about its sign. This paper first argues that a non-decreasing distance elasticity is not necessarily puzzling, even though the magnitude of the increase computed by log-OLS seems to be unrealistic. Second, in our baseline specification, the distance elasticity of trade is estimated to have been broadly stable when the analysis is run separately for each single year. This result is established based on the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) estimator of the gravity equation specified in levels which was suggested by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006, SST hereafter) and has become a standard specification in the field. Third, not only the level but also the change in the distance elasticity through time is severely biased with log-OLS, and we show that this bias is related to the increase in the heterogeneity of trade flows over the past decades and the induced growing heteroskedasticity. Finally, the difference between the estimated elasticity by PPML and gamma pseudo-maximal likehood (GPML), which like log-OLS puts more emphasis on small flows, has also dramatically increased and both estimates are significantly different. This last result is puzzling because the choice between the estimators that rely on the proportionality of the conditional variance to a power of the conditional mean [PPML, GPML, non-linear least squares (NLS)] of the nonlinear model specified in levels is supposed to be driven by efficiency considerations only. In particular, all these estimators are supposed to be consistent and that choice guided by testing the relationship between the residuals and the estimated flows. We show, however, that the test used in previous research to help identify the most efficient estimator is weak: its inferences depend upon which estimator is selected in a first step to compute the estimated trade flows and the estimated residuals. The differences across non-linear estimators might point to a misspecification in the standard gravity equations, possibly linked to different distance effects across countries, as suggested by Head and Mayer (2013). Indeed, we present some evidence that the distance parameter might be heterogeneous across sub-samples, although such an heterogeneity does not seem to account for the full story. When estimates are computed in panel, which is likely to better control for the impact of free trade agreements, there is a slight upward trend in the elasticity with PPML and a somewhat smaller one than in cross sections with GPML. As a result, while the differences between both estimates remain highly significant, their magnitude is about halved. Finally, we show based on simulations that, despite the large size of our sample, finite-sample biases due to the large number of fixed effects could contribute to the differences between PPML and GPML. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses how puzzling the “distance puzzle” is and Sect. 3 introduces the main methodological and empirical issues when estimating gravity equations to analyse the “distance puzzle”. Section 4 presents the data and the specifications, while results are presented in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes.",10

151,1,Review of World Economics,20 September 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-014-0203-8,How trade credits foster exporting,February 2015,Katharina Eck,Martina Engemann,Monika Schnitzer,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Aggravated trade finance conditions have been suggested as one of the reasons why trade flows collapsed in the wake of the 20080–2009 financial crisis.Footnote 1 Indeed, a great part of all trade transactions are supported by some form of trade finance (Auboin 2009). Surprisingly, though, the main part of trade finance takes the form of inter-firm credits, also called trade credits: according to a survey by the IMF, about 60 % of all trade transactions are financed via trade credits (IMF 2009). Trade credits are extended bilaterally between firms and exist in the form of supplier credits and cash-in-advance. Cash-in-advance (CIA) refers to payments made in advance by the buyer of a good to the seller. In contrast, a supplier credit is granted from the seller of a good to the buyer such that the payment of the purchasing price can be delayed for a certain period of time.Footnote 2 The intensive use of trade credits is surprising since they are considered a particularly expensive form of financing: implicit annual trade credit interest rates can amount to up to 40 % (Petersen and Rajan 1997). Why trade credits are so prevalent in international trade, despite their high cost, has been little studied so far. This paper aims at closing this gap. We argue that international transactions are inherently subject to more uncertainty than domestic transactions and that trade credits serve as a quality signal that helps reduce this high uncertainty. In our analysis, we focus on CIA financing and provide a rationale for the use of expensive trade credits to finance international trade. For this purpose, we develop a model of internationally active firms that need outside finance to be able to export. In our model, asymmetric information problems deter less productive firms from exporting if only bank financing is available. Access to CIA reduces the asymmetric information problem and thus promotes the export participation of firms that are not able to export with traditional bank financing. We test our prediction with data from the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS) for German firms in 2004. This dataset is ideal for our purposes since it contains data on the use of CIA and the export activity of firms. Accounting for endogeneity, we find that firms that receive CIA from their trading partners have on average a 25 % higher probability to export than firms that do not receive CIA financing. Likewise, a 1 % increase in CIA financing increases the export probability of firms on average by 15 %. We find that the export fostering effect of CIA is particularly strong for less productive firms and firms that experience difficulties in accessing bank finance. Our analysis is the first to explicitly analyze the effects of CIA financing on the export participation of firms. In our model, we show that the productivity threshold to profitably export is lower if a firm is provided with CIA by its foreign trading partner. Using survey data, we can provide direct evidence of the beneficial effects of CIA financing on exporting. In the survey, firms report how much of their sales are paid in advance by customers. Thus, we need not rely on proxies for CIA availability such as trade accounts receivable from balance sheet data. Since the use of CIA by firms is very likely related to unobserved firm characteristics we apply an instrumental variable approach. Accounting for endogeneity, we find that CIA availability strongly fosters the export participation of firms. In addition, we analyze the differential impact of CIA financing on exporting for less productive firms and firms that experience difficulties in accessing bank finance. We find that these firms more strongly benefit from CIA financing in terms of their export participation which supports the signalling function of CIA. Our analysis is related to two different strands of literature. First, it builds on the literature on trade credits. In Lee and Stowe (1993), firms extend a trade credit to signal product quality to their (domestic) customers. Another paper on the warranty by quality hypothesis was simultaneously developed by Long et al. (1993). In a more recent paper, Klapper et al. (2012) provide empirical evidence on the quality signalling motive for a small sample of US and European firms. They find that less trustworthy suppliers offer longer payment periods to their buyers. Moreover, suppliers offer prepayment discounts to less trustworthy buyers in order to minimize payment risk. This signalling motive should hold a fortiori for international transactions that suffer from an even higher degree of uncertainty. As we show in our model, even though trade credits are intrinsically more costly than bank credits, this disadvantage is more than compensated for by the reduction of uncertainty, so less productive firms benefit from access to trade credits. Biais and Gollier (1997) develop a model where the firm that extends the trade credit signals its belief in the creditworthiness of the firm it provides with trade credit. Their argument requires that the trade partner has an information advantage relative to the bank. Giannetti et al. (2011), however, find that trading partners have no persistent informational advantage. Burkart and Ellingsen (2004) derive that trade credit financing can improve access to bank credit financing for firms. Their main argument is that trade credits are less prone to diversion than cash. This implies that firms that receive trade credits are less likely to commit moral hazard and banks are more willing to lend additional credit to these firms.Footnote 3 We, in contrast, assume that the firm extending CIA signals its own quality, which seems to be a more natural and realistic assumption. Moreover, we explicitly consider international transactions which are inherently prone to aggravated information asymmetries and differ in the choice of the financing mode from domestic transactions. Our model shows how trade credits can alleviate asymmetric information problems with regard to foreign trading partners and thus promote trade. Furthermore, the trade credit literature mainly focusses on the use of supplier credits. The only exception is Mateut (2012) who investigates the determinants of CIA financing by French firms. We examine the effect that CIA financing has on the export participation of firms. This is especially interesting for two reasons. First, prepayment financing is also intensively used by firms and thus provides a relevant alternative to supplier credit financing.Footnote 4 Second, CIA should have a stronger signalling function than supplier credits. The reason is that a supplier credit can be extorted by simply overstretching the payment period. In contrast, CIA needs to be actively given by the trading partner. Second, we relate to the literature on trade credit financing in international trade. Only recently has the literature on trade credits taken international transactions into its focus, investigating the optimal choice of trade credit. In Schmidt-Eisenlohr (2013), financial market characteristics and the contractual environment of both the foreign and domestic market influence the choice of trade credit by firms. Hoefele et al. (2013) test these predictions and find empirical support that financing costs and the strength of contract enforcement determine the choice of trade credit contracts for international transactions. Similarly, Antràs and Foley (2011) study how a firm’s choice of using CIA versus supplier credit depends on the extent of contractual frictions in the foreign trading partner’s country. The authors confirm their predictions using data from a large US exporting firm. Ahn (2011) investigates which side of the transaction should provide a trade credit and finds that it should be the trade partner that possesses the larger amount of collateral. Furthermore, he provides an explanation for how a lack of trade finance could have contributed to the drop in global trade during the financial crisis. Using Berne Union data on export credit insurance, Auboin and Engemann (2014) analyse the effect of trade credit on trade on a macro level through a whole cycle. They find a positive effect of export credit insurance, as a proxy for trade credits, on trade, not varying between crisis and non-crisis periods. Olsen (2011) focuses on the role of banks in international trade. He shows that by issuing letters of credit, banks can help to overcome enforcement problems between exporters and importers. Glady and Potin (2011) provide empirical evidence on the importance of letters of credit when country default risk is high. While the focus of these papers is primarily on the choice of the trade credit form as a function of the level of uncertainty, we focus instead on the rationale for using CIA as an alternative or as a complement to cheaper bank financing. We show how CIA solves both a moral hazard and an adverse selection problem for an exporter. Hence, we find that CIA fosters international trade.Footnote 5
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we develop a model for an exporter receiving CIA. Section 3 introduces the dataset and provides summary statistics. In Sect. 4, we set out the empirical strategy to test our model predictions and present our results. Section 5 concludes.",24

For example, Alesina et al. (2005) show that regulatory reform of product markets, particularly entry liberalization, leads to an increase in investment in a sample of OECD countries. Using an early version of the entry costs component of the Doing Business data that we use in this paper, Klapper et al. (2006) find that costly entry regulations reduce the number of new firms created. Similarly, Barseghyan (2008) finds that higher entry costs as measured by the Doing Business data reduce output per worker via a reduction in total factor productivity. Finally, Bruhn (2011) shows that a reform of entry regulation in Mexico led to an increase in the number of businesses registered. In this paper we add to this literature by examining the effect that favourable business regulation in general, and in the realm of international trade in particular, has on how much foreign direct investment (FDI) a country attracts. Our key questions are simple. Firstly, is the ease of doing business in a country associated with more FDI for that country? Further, can we point to a particular set or sets of regulations as being key? While entry costs may be an extremely important factor for domestic firms, foreign investors may care more about the ease of trading across borders as foreign companies tend to be large and more focused on exporting as opposed to domestic firms. Our paper uses the World Bank’s Doing Business data to capture the business environment. As we explain below, this data covers a wide range of topics capturing the regulatory and other burdens faced by firms. Researchers have found benefits associated with improvements in both the overall ease of doing business and its components. For example, Djankov et al. (2006) and Gillanders and Whelan (2010) present evidence that the ease of doing business is good for growth and development while Djankov et al. (2010) find a significant effect of time delays on trade. 
Lucas (1993) is the earliest attempt to examine the effects of the business environment on FDI that we are aware of. He finds that dummy variables capturing large changes in a country’s organisation are significant but acknowledges that it is difficult to know exactly what such variables are capturing. Gastanaga et al. (1998) use a 0–4 index of bureaucratic delay and find some evidence that it matters. However, their measure is only available for 22 countries and does not take account of the range of factors that the Doing Business variable does. The later critique can also be leveled at the finding of Busse and Hefeker (2007) of a significant coefficient on a 0–12 index that measures the institutional strength and quality of the bureaucracy. The Doing Business data has been used to look at the effect of the business environment and regulation on FDI. Lawless (2009) finds that the tax complexity components of doing business have a significant effect on the existence of FDI but little effect on the level. Blonigen and Piger (2011) employ Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to sift through the mass of potential FDI determinants. They find that the four Doing Business variables that they include have a low inclusion probability. These four variables are the time it takes to enforce contracts, register property, start a business and resolve insolvency. As we will see, they do not employ the vast majority of the business environment information available to them and the indicators that they do use are not those that one might expect to influence FDI the most, those pertaining to international trade. The finding of a similar BMA study, Eicher et al. (2011), that a generic host bureaucratic quality variable is a robust determinant gives us further reason to believe that the measures used in Blonigen and Piger (2011) are too restrictive a subset. Our paper therefore can be seen as building on these studies in that we use a richer measure of the regulatory environment and separate the effect of the ease of trading across borders from the general ease of doing business. Another recent paper with relevance to our work is Jayasuriya (2011). Jayasuriya’s work, which is concurrent with our own, establishes that higher Doing Business rankings attract more FDI and provides some evidence that some of the indicators matter while others do not. While our finding that a country’s Doing Business rank influences the FDI it receives agrees with Jayasuriya (2011), we present evidence that this effect is driven by the trade rank (TR) component. Our paper differs in approach as we will outline below and we also consider the role that other countries’ business environments play. We find that in terms of the total FDI that a country attracts it is a country’s ease of trading across borders that matters but that US FDI seems to respond to the business environment neighbourhood that a country finds itself in. Thus our work is related to a long standing line of research in the empirical FDI literature that has seen a recent resurgence in interest. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section outlines our data and empirical strategy. Section 3 presents the results and Sect. 4 concludes.",84

151,1,Review of World Economics,16 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-014-0199-0,Regional export promotion offices and trade margins,February 2015,Salvador Gil-Pareja,Rafael Llorca-Vivero,Francisco Requena-Silvente,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Over the last two decades a growing number of Spanish regional governments have established a network of regional export promotion offices (REPOs) abroad, with the aim of providing qualified support, information and advice to regional companies wishing to introduce their products in foreign markets or to expand their customer base abroad. Catalonia and Valencia were the first two regions that opened trade offices abroad in 1987 and in 1990, respectively, and since the mid 1990s other Spanish regions (starting by Basque Country, Region of Murcia, and Aragon) followed their footsteps to such an extent that, nowadays, REPOs have become a popular instrument to boost Spanish regional exports. The economic justification for public intervention in export promotion is based on the existence of market failures, such as asymmetric information or externalities. Nowadays, there is an intense public debate in policy making circles in Spain about the convenience of maintaining regional offices abroad. This debate is motivated by the necessity of reducing public expenditure given the large fiscal deficit and the negative or low growth rates of the Spanish economy over the last years. In recent years there has been a revived interest in the study of the impact of export promotion activities on trade. This renewed branch of research has shown that diplomatic representations, state visits, export credit agencies and export promotion agencies have a positive effect on bilateral trade. In the context of this literature, providing evidence about the impact of Spanish REPOs on exports and trade margins is of interest for at least two reasons. Firstly, given that since the mid-nineties there has been a proliferation of Spanish REPOs all over the world, the evaluation of its impact on exports and the margins of trade can be considered both of interest for academics and very useful for policy makers. Secondly, whereas the available empirical evidence mainly focuses on the impact of export promotion agencies from developing countries at a national level, our paper examines the case of export promotion organizations from a developed country at a regional level. Until recently, the specialised literature made no distinction between the effect of export promotion institutions on the extensive margin (i.e., the introduction of new goods, the access to new markets or the emergence of new trading relationships) and the effect on the intensive margin (i.e., the increase of exports in existing trade relationships). The lack of bilateral trade data at the firm level has been the main difficulty in identifying effects on these two margins empirically. Since data at the firm level are usually not available, some researchers have used the total number of bilateral traded products to proxy the extensive margin of trade and the value per traded product to proxy for the intensive margin of trade (Volpe-Martincus et al. 2010a, 2011). While insightful, the decomposition made with this kind of data overestimates the impact on exports that takes place through the intensive margin, since it masks (inside the intensive margin) a potentially important channel through which export promotion institutions may affect trade, that is, the number of firm transactions per product. Insofar promotion institutions help to the establishment of new trade relationships, it can be expected that a part of the total effect on exports takes place through an increase in the number of firms’ transaction per product. Such increase captures two elements that cannot be considered part of the intensive margin but of the extensive margin when we measure trade flows at firm-product level: The emergence of new exporting firms and the appearance of new trading partners of existing firms. In fact, the aim of REPOs, as declared in their statements of intents, is to support regional firms in the processes of both entering in export markets and expanding their product portfolio or their customer base in foreign markets. Our proposed estimation procedure attempts to solve that problem by using firm transaction data per product. It is possible that changes over time in the number of transactions among firms that were already trading with each other account for a part of the change in the number of transactions per product and this component would be part of the intensive margin. We assume that the impact of REPOs through this component is not as important as the effect that takes place through the emergence of new exporting firms and the appearance of new trading partners of existing firms. At this point it is worth noting that, asked about the relative importance of promotion activities in helping firms to sell more to the same trading partners or to establish new trade relationships, the staff of the Spanish REPOs answered unanimously that their activity is directed exclusively to new trade relationships and in rare case to reinforce established relationships. The aim of this paper is fourfold. Firstly, in addition to provide new evidence on the effect of REPOs on exports, we examine the channels through which the foreign network of REPOs affects bilateral trade. To this end, we decompose the total impact of REPOs on exports into three margins: The number of exported products, the number of firm transactions per product, and the average value of exports per firm transaction. Secondly, we investigate these impacts across destination markets and over time. Thirdly, we examine whether REPOs impact on the trade margins of exports varies based on the degree of product differentiation. Finally, we explore the effect of REPOs on the trade margins of exports by industries and regions. To preview our results, using data over the period 1995–2011, we find that REPOs have a significant effect on aggregate exports and that this effect takes place along the three margins but mainly through the increase in both the number of products and the average number of firm transactions per product. Moreover, we find that the magnitude of the effect of REPOs on exports is larger when offices are located outside the European Economic Area and that their effects on trade increase with time. Additionally, we find that REPOs seem to favor an increase in trade margins of exports in differentiated goods, which is consistent with the idea that REPOs help to reduce informational problems and that information-related impediments to trade are larger for differentiated goods. Finally, the results show a large heterogeneity across industries and regions. REPOs have a clear positive impact on almost all sectors but the positive effect of REPOs along the pure intensive margin takes place in less than half of them. Across regions, those with longer experience in export promotion and with a wider foreign network tend to exhibit larger effects. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 offers a review of the literature about the impact of export promotion institutions on trade. Section 3 presents the empirical methodology. Section 4 describes the data, Sect. 5 discusses the estimation results and Sect. 6 provides a robustness analysis. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes the paper.",14

Munch,Jan Rose Skaksen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The empirical literature on international trade and firm productivity has grown rapidly since Bernard and Jensen (1995) documented important within-industry differences between manufacturing exporters and non-exporters; see, e.g., Bernard et al. (2012) for a recent review. The focus on manufacturing exporters in this literature is, however, too narrow if we wish to fully understand the potential importance of international trade for productivity and productivity growth. First, in most—if not in all—developed countries, the service sector has overtaken the manufacturing sector as the most important sector of the economy whether measured in terms of output, value added or employment. Crozet and Milet (2014) thus report that the share of the manufacturing sector in value added has dropped by 10 percentage points in most OECD countries since 1970, and it now constitutes on average less than 20 %. Second, the exporting activities of the service sector have also gained in importance and are becoming increasingly important (e.g., Lipsey 2009; Francois and Hoekman 2010; Haller et al. 2014; Lodefalk 2014). Trade in services constitute a large (roughly 20 %) and growing share of world trade, but trade in goods by service-sector firms also play an important role (e.g., Bernard et al. 2010), and the contribution to productivity growth by these firms has so far remained undocumented. Third, exports constitute only one side of the coin. Imports of goods and services at the firm level are likely to be equally important for productivity, but have—due to data limitations—often been ignored in the empirical literature (Bernard et al. 2007).Footnote 1
 In this paper, we therefore analyze and compare the role of international trade for both firm productivity and aggregate productivity growth within the service and the manufacturing sector. Furthermore, within both sectors, we distinguish between trade in services and trade in goods, and between exports and imports. This provides the most comprehensive treatment to date of the relationship between international trade and firm productivity. As mentioned above, there exists a voluminous empirical literature about manufacturing firms that export. It is now well established that these firms are more productive than other firms (e.g., Bernard and Jensen 1995, 1999). Most research ascribe this to selection into exporting by more productive manufacturers, but some studies (e.g., Van Biesebroeck 2005; De Loecker 2007, 2013; Manjon et al. 2013) also find a causal learning effect on performance from exporting. A related line of research has shown that the productivity advantage of exporting manufacturers also matters significantly for aggregate productivity growth both through higher within-firm productivity growth of exporting firms and through reallocations of resources from less productive non-exporting firms to more productive exporting firms. Bernard and Jensen (2004) find that up to 65 % of aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) growth in US manufacturing between 1983 and 1992 can be attributed to foreign shipments. On a more causal note, Bernard et al. (2006) find relatively high gains in productivity at the industry level for US industries experiencing large reductions in tariff rates between 1977 and 2001. See also Bernard et al. (2012) for other studies documenting positive aggregate productivity effects. An obvious question to ask is therefore whether the observed relationship between export activity and firm productivity and between export activity and aggregate productivity growth within manufacturing can be “transferred” to (a) the service sector, (b) exports of services, and (c) import activities. While a recent literature surveyed by Wagner (2012) has shown that manufacturing firms that import enjoy a productivity advantage similar to (or even greater than) that of manufacturing firms that export, we still know very little about the productivity advantages of exporters and importers in the service sector and even less about their potential aggregate effects. The few existing studies at the firm level seem to indicate that the picture resembles that in manufacturing. Thus, Breinlich and Criscuolo (2011) using data on British firms find that the relationship between productivity and exports of producer services is very similar to the relationship between productivity and goods exports. Temouri et al. (2013) focus on business services firms using enterprise data from the United Kingdom, France and Germany, and find that firms that export are more productive (measured as value added per employee) and pay higher (average) wages than non-exporting firms.Footnote 2
 To understand the relationship between trade and productivity, we need to consider not just exports of producer services or business services firms, but the full spectrum of firms and trading activities. Furthermore, we shall argue that, it is important and empirically relevant to distinguish between both the type of trade (goods or services), the direction of trade (exports or imports), and the type of firm (manufacturing or service). Thus, goods traders in the service sector (e.g., wholesale firms) are likely to be different from goods traders in the manufacturing sector (e.g., pharmaceutical firms) and services traders in the service sector (e.g., consultancy firms), and there is no a priori reason to expect that the trade productivity premium is the same for these types of firms. Both the production process and the costs and gains of engaging in international trade are likely to differ across such firms. The purpose of the present analysis is two-fold. First, using Danish register data for the period 2002–2008, we provide a comprehensive analysis at the firm level of the relationship between international trade and firm productivity. We estimate models of the relationship between within-firm changes in productivity and a range of trade variables akin to specifications employed in the early literature on firm heterogeneity and exporting (e.g. Bernard and Jensen 1999). As we control for changes in factor use, we are implicitly focusing on the pure learning effects of trade. Compared with previous studies, we cover almost the entire private sector, and we distinguish between manufacturing firms and service firms, between trade in goods and trade in services, and between exports and imports. In that sense, it is the most comprehensive treatment of this issue to date. Still, the nature of our analysis is descriptive, as the relationship between firm productivity and trade is inherently endogenous. Firms that for unobserved reasons become more productive may also start to trade more. Therefore, we do not attach a causal interpretation to our results. Instead, our advantage is that we can assess the relative importance of the full range of trade activities across firms and across private sector industries. This approach is also dictated by the scarcity of exogenous variation in the data explaining trade in services (Francois and Hoekman 2010).Footnote 3 In contrast, several studies have documented causal effects of goods-trade liberalizations using observed tariff cuts as a source of exogenous change (e.g., Pavcnik 2002; Bernard et al. 2006; Trefler 2004), but such data are unavailable for services-trade liberalizations.Footnote 4
 Second, we ask whether any firm-level differences in productivity carry over to the aggregate level, and thus whether the various types of international trade play a different role for aggregate productivity growth within the service sector than within manufacturing. In order to quantify the potential importance of exports and imports for productivity growth, we apply a recent decomposition technique developed by Melitz and Polanec (2012). This method allows us to decompose aggregate productivity growth into contributions from within-firm productivity growth and from reallocations. Using our firm-level estimates, we then do a counterfactual exercise to determine how much of the aggregate productivity growth that can be attributed to international trade. This approach allows us to identify the trade activities (goods trade, services trade, importing, exporting) by firm type (manufacturing or service) that play the potentially most important roles for productivity growth. At the firm level, we find that in particular firms that start to export or import goods enjoy increases in productivity and size. The effects are sizeable and surprisingly similar across sectors. The picture is different when it comes to trade in services. Here we also find positive productivity and size effects of starting to export, but the effects are smaller, and size effects are confined to the service sector. Productivity and size effects of services imports, on the other hand, are largely absent. At the aggregate level, we find that international trade plays a potentially larger role for the productivity development within the service sector than within the manufacturing sector, but it is trade in goods not trade in services that matters most for the productivity development within this sector. More specifically, productivity growth seems largely to have been driven by the wholesale and the retail industries. This finding is related to an emerging literature examining various aspects of intermediaries in international trade (Ahn et al. 2011; Akerman 2012; Bernard et al. 2010, 2011). This line of research uses firm-level data from a number of countries to provide evidence for the importance of wholesalers and retailers in trade flows and to determine the factors that give rise to trade by intermediaries. In contrast to this literature we are the first to show the role played by wholesalers and retailers in aggregate productivity growth. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the data. In Sect. 3, we consider the firm-level evidence, while Sect. 4 considers the potential effects on aggregate productivity growth. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",14

151,2,Review of World Economics,04 March 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-015-0214-0,The effect of communication costs on trade in headquarter services,May 2015,Anca D. Cristea,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Developments in communication and transportation technologies are often cited as the catalyst for global production networks.Footnote 1 Increasingly, firms establish new facilities in foreign markets or relocate divisions of their production chain abroad. But as production networks expand across national borders, multinational corporations (MNC) must account for new costs arising from managing, coordinating and monitoring foreign operations. Information transmission costs represent such an example. Recent evidence on the sensitivity of foreign investments to geographic distance suggests that MNCs respond to the cost of transferring intangible assets when making location decisions.Footnote 2 Yet less is known about the ways in which parent firms can minimize the cost of knowledge transfers to distant affiliates. How do MNCs organize foreign production operations in the presence of costly communication? One possibility is to transfer complex technologies embodied in intermediate inputs in order to avoid communicating them directly (Keller and Yeaple 2013).Footnote 3
 In this paper, I examine empirically an alternative channel through which multinational firms economize on the cost of cross-border knowledge transfers: by hiring skilled workers to execute the assigned activities. A well-trained production team substantially reduces the interventions by the headquarters in the ordinary production problems of that foreign affiliate. The implicit tradeoff comes from the fact that high ability workers are relatively more expensive, so paying the skill premium becomes optimal only when the savings from monitoring efforts and cross-border communication outweigh the costs with skilled labor. The goal of this paper is to test this hypothesis and investigate the extent to which knowledge transfers within multinational firms respond to communication barriers in a way that is systematically related to foreign workers’ ability level. The insight that the availability of talent in the foreign market substitutes for the knowledge inputs provided by the headquarters, saving on frequent communication, has been emphasized in theoretical models of firm organization (Antras et al. 2006; Grossman 2013). However, the empirical work in support of it is sparse. We know little about how communication barriers interact with the skill endowment of host countries in determining the production activity of multinational firms. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap in the literature. To quantify the involvement of the headquarters in the production operations of foreign affiliates through the provision of knowledge inputs and other intangible assets, I use aggregate data on related-party exports of services by parents of U.S. multinationals. Headquarter services are particularly appealing to analyze empirically. Services are the fastest growing component of world trade, accounting for 20 % of international transactions by value, and multinational firms play a large role in their growth. For example, in the U.S., almost 40 % of services trade happens within the boundaries of multinational firms (Bureau of Economic Analysis 2010). However, in spite of this observed growth, services face significant trade barriers. As intangible, knowledge-intensive activities, the cost of information transmission represents a large barrier to their trade. So, understanding the extent to which foreign assets such as workers’ skills represent a substitute for headquarter services is important because it sheds light on the strategies employed by MNCs to mitigate the impact of communication costs. It also raises important policy debates about the role of infrastructure spending aimed at reducing communication costs—particularly in the context of developing countries, where human capital accumulation is achieved at a relatively slower pace. For the econometric analysis, I combine public data on service exports by parents of U.S. multinationals to their foreign affiliates, with information on international communication costs, and with data on the average educational attainment of the labor force in foreign countries. The resulting dataset covers 32 countries over the period 1993–2008. I estimate an econometric model of intra-firm services trade adapted from the knowledge-capital model of FDI (Markusen 2002). I find that while difficulties in cross-border communication affect negatively the export of headquarter services by U.S. multinationals relative to the total U.S. exports of service, this reduction in the fraction of intra-firm service exports is attenuated by the average education level of the workforce in the host country. The opposing effect of the interaction term between communication and skill level points to the substitution between the knowledge held by the foreign workers and the knowledge inputs transferred from the firm headquarters. This evidence brings support to the insight that an efficient way to organize multinational production across locations linked by costly or inefficient communication networks is to hire talented workers who are able to carry out production activities with very little supervision. These findings are robust to controlling for typical determinants of FDI such as economic size and bilateral trade costs, policies of economic integration, or differences in corporate tax rates. This study contributes to the international trade literature in several ways. First, it adds to the limited research analyzing the determinants of services trade. Although the recent growth in services trade has been unexpected by economists (Blinder 2006), and has brought challenges to policy makers (Economic Report of the President 2014),Footnote 4 services remain overlooked in the international trade literature.Footnote 5 This study mitigates this shortage by shedding light on some of the factors that affect trade in headquarter services. Second, this paper adds to the recent empirical work examining the organization and growth of multinational production in the face of barriers to information transmission (Keller and Yeaple 2013; Oldensky 2012; Liu et al. 2011). The closest papers to this one are Antras et al. (2006, 2008), who model multinational production as resulting from the efficient organization of knowledge flows in the presence of heterogeneous workers. In their empirical work, Antras et al. (2008) provide first evidence that the positive effect of a country’s skill endowment on inbound FDI flows decreases in the development of intra-national communication technology. This paper takes the theoretical foundations in Antras et al. (2006) and complements the empirical work in Antras et al. (2008) in several ways: (1) by focusing on intra-firm export of services rather than total FDI flows in order to capture more directly the extent of headquarters’ involvement in the production operations of foreign affiliates; (2) by using measures of cross-border rather than intra-national communication barriers; and (3) by exploiting panel rather than cross-sectional data, which allows the use of fixed effects to control for unobservable country-specific factors. Ultimately, understanding how communication barriers affect the organization of production is important, since part of the success of global production networks stems from managing knowledge flows efficiently. The findings here could also provide policy makers in less skill endowed countries with the necessary tools to support developments in communication infrastructure as a way to increase foreign investments. Lastly, this paper is related to the recent work on the role and determinants of intra-firm trade.Footnote 6 Of particular interest for this study is the work of Irarrazabal et al. (2013), who emphasize two conditions necessary to rationalize the decline of multinational activity over distance: (1) affiliate production relies on headquarter inputs, which implicitly generates intra-firm trade; and, (2) intra-firm trade is subject to geographic frictions. Rodriguez-Clare et al. (2012) also build a model of multinational production where intra-firm transfers of intangible assets occur with a loss in their efficiency. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the theoretical set-up based on Antras et al. (2006), which motivates the interdependence between communication costs and average skill level of the foreign labor force in determining the exports of headquarter services. Section 3 presents the estimation strategy, while the data sources are provided in Sect. 4. Section 5 discusses the estimation results, including the robustness checks. Section 6 concludes.",9

Chief among them is the long-standing “sanctuary market” hypothesis. The basic idea is that formal and informal barriers to competition in the home market will result in excessive profits that in turn allow an exporting firm to price “unfairly” in foreign markets and thereby lead to material injury to domestic firms in the importing country. This argument is often heard in the United States where support for antidumping procedures traditionally has been very strong.Footnote 1 A U.S. government formally submitted a paper to the WTO on the “basic concepts” of antidumping that encapsulates this view: [K]ey aspects of the economic system supported by government inaction can enable injurious dumping to take place…For instance, these policies may allow producers to earn high profits in a home “sanctuary market,” which may in turn allow them to sell abroad at an artificially low price. Such practices can result in injury in the importing country since domestic firms may not be able to match the artificially low prices from producers in the sanctuary market. (United States 2002, p. 4) Despite the frequency of such arguments, no formal econometric analysis exists that evaluates whether exporters benefiting from sanctuary markets are more likely to face dumping allegations under the trade remedy laws. This research will take preliminary steps to fill that gap. I will use a reduced form analysis to investigate whether industry level characteristics of those facing dumping allegations are consistent with expectations of the market sanctuary hypothesis. Ideally, one would examine this by collecting detailed industry level data for all countries. Unfortunately, countries often use distinct domestic classification systems rendering sufficiently disaggregated data incompatible across jurisdictions. As a consequence, the approach taken here is to focus exclusively on U.S. exporters. This approach has a number of advantages. The first is that examining only one exporting country will assure a consistent methodology for any official statistics used in the study. The second is that most analysts consider official U.S. data to be reasonably reliable or at least not systematically biased. The third is that the results of the study may have particular relevance to antidumping proponents in the United States who would be familiar with industrial structure and government policy in their own market. Finally, the now widely acknowledged spread of antidumping actions to many jurisdictions means that understanding the determinants of antidumping petitions against U.S. exporters will have particular relevance to U.S. policy-makers. The basic approach of this study is to combine variables identified in the existing literature on determinants of antidumping petitions with regressors consistent with the market sanctuary hypothesis. The econometric model is based on work by Moore and Zanardi (2011), who estimate the probability of observing a new antidumping petition based on country-industry pairs and controls for imports, a number of macroeconomic controls, and reactions against other countries’ antidumping actions. The current work will expand on that study by including detailed industry information available from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Census of Manufacturing, which is conducted every 5 years. These latter variables [all at the 6-digit North American Industrial Classification Schedule (NAICS) code level] will include standard measures of industrial concentration, measures of high entry and exit costs in the industry, and U.S. sectoral tariffs. The time period analyzed in the formal empirical work will be from 1994 through 2007. This beginning date coincides the start of WTO antidumping rules as part of the Uruguay Round negotiations. The latter date reflects a decision not to include the impact of the financial crisis that began in 2008. Note that the analyzed period will include a large majority of cases brought against the United States as well as the actions of some of the new users of antidumping. The null hypothesis is that trade flows and macroeconomic conditions will play an important role in explaining filings against U.S. exporters and that variables consistent with the sanctuary market argument (e.g., U.S. applied tariffs that restrict foreign imports, high entry costs, and measures of sectoral competitiveness) will also help predict antidumping petitions. Econometric evidence consistent with this hypothesis would be supportive of the view that antidumping procedures were working as intended by U.S. supporters. We will see that there is little evidence that U.S. exporters facing antidumping actions fit expectations of the market sanctuary story. However, it is important to note that the results of this study only offer insights into the experience of U.S. exporters; evidence from U.S. experience does not tell us whether other countries’ firms benefit from such advantages. But if U.S. firms systematically face antidumping actions despite the absence of market sanctuary benefits, one can ask whether WTO antidumping disciplines are inadequate for safeguarding “fairly” traded goods. 
The rest of the paper is organized in the following way. Section 2 includes a brief literature review and a short analysis of the market sanctuary argument. Section 3 lays out some of the basic statistics and patterns of antidumping actions taken against U.S. exporters. Section 4 includes a brief discussion about econometric methodology and construction of the data. I will discuss the econometric results in Sect. 5 and offer some policy implications and suggestions for further research in the conclusion.",2

151,2,Review of World Economics,27 February 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-015-0213-1,Globalization and social justice in OECD countries,May 2015,Björn Kauder,Niklas Potrafke,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"For social scientists, social justice is a topic of prime concern, because of the quest for social justice in itself and because of the trade-off between efficiency and social justice (e.g., Hillman 2009: chapter 7). Social justice is also a prominent topic in public discourse and political attention: politicians promise to achieve social justice when elected to office. Political parties use the term justice frequently in their party platforms. Globalization has been a much studied phenomenon and there have been concerns whether globalization is consistent with social justice. The debate has been controversial (for an overview of the debate see Hillman 2008). We examine the relationship between globalization and social justice as measured by a new social justice indicator. John Rawls’ “Theory of justice” in 1971 viewed social justice in terms of a social contract chosen behind a veil of ignorance when individuals do not yet know the positions they will have in society. The citizens thus decide from a neutral perspective. Rawls endorses equal rights “to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others” and inequalities that are “to be of the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society” while “offices and positions must be open to everyone under conditions of fair equality of opportunity”. Rawls thus considers both procedural and distributive aspects of social justice.Footnote 1
 In response to Rawls’ egalitarian position Robert Nozick took a libertarian view of social justice (“Anarchy, state and utopia” 1974). Starting from a state of nature, a “dominant protection agency” emerges based on voluntary contracts. This dominant protection agency is the minimal state. Nozick thus considers an allocation as fair when the allocation is based on free and mutual exchange, even if large inequalities result. Nozick thus views social justice as procedural justice.Footnote 2
 Friedrich August von Hayek took the position that only procedural justice is possible in a market economy (“The mirage of social justice” 1976). A fair distribution is not achievable as in a market economy no one distributes income. Social justice is thus a superstition that has to be opposed when the term is used to justify coercion of some by others. Amartya Sen (“Equality of what?” 1980 and “Development as freedom” 2000) suggests basic capability equality. The capability approach focuses on what individuals are capable of and thus includes for example political freedom and social opportunities rather than solely income. The different concepts of social justice show that social justice is difficult to define and consequently difficult to measure unambiguously. Moreover, social justice ex post is multifaceted. The Bertelsmann Stiftung has compiled new data on social justice in OECD countries. The data include quantitative and qualitative indicators based on expert opinions. The social justice indicator of the Bertelsmann Stiftung received prominent attention in the public debate on social justice.Footnote 3
 An important question concerns what gives rise to or impedes social justice. We focus on how globalization is associated with social justice. Advocates of the dark side of globalization believe that globalization exerts negative effects on social justice. Joseph Stiglitz, for example, proposes that poor people are left behind and so disadvantaged in the course of globalization. “Also in industrialized countries unskilled workers learn what is going on.”Footnote 4 Paul Krugman, by contrast, does not hold globalization responsible for social injustice in the United States, but claims that, for example, tax cuts increased inequality: “Growing international trade plays some role in growing inequality, but it is, literally, a fraction of a fraction of the story.”Footnote 5 Indeed, income inequality is often used as synonym for social injustice. We elaborate on theoretical predictions and empirical findings on why globalization is expected to threaten or promote social justice in Sect. 2. Social justice encompasses sub-dimensions such as distributive justice and procedural justice. Poverty prevention, access to education, or intergenerational justice are also sub-dimensions of social justice. Globalization may well influence sub-dimensions of social justice differently. By using the KOF index of globalization and the social justice indicators of the Bertelsmann Stiftung, we examine how globalization is associated with different dimensions of social justice.",12

A cross-country inquiry on globalisation, financialisation and employment at the industry level",August 2015,Cédric Durand,Sébastien Miroudot,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Financialisation and globalisation are two buzzwords whose definitions are not always clear. But they capture key dimensions of economic change in the past decades. On the one hand, diminishing trade barriers and improved communication and transport infrastructure have led to a strong rise in trade and the expansion of global value chains (Bair 2009; Cattaneo et al. 2010; Gereffi 2014). On the other hand, financial markets liberalisation has changed the relationship between financial institutions and the non-financial sector (Palley 2007). Both of these trends have important implications for the functioning of economies and, in particular, for wages and employment. However, their impact on labour market dynamics has not been sufficiently analysed. The aim of this article is to contribute to fill this gap in the literature with a cross-country analysis at the industry level. Macroeconomic research focusing on financialisation looks at the changing relationship between financial markets and non-financial firms and stresses its potential negative impact on investment. According to this literature, financial liberalisation in high-income economies in the 1980s has led to a shift in power in favour of shareholders, refocusing management priorities and reducing firms’ propensity to invest (Stockhammer 2004, 2005; Lazonick and O’Sullivan 2000; Orhangazi 2008; Aglietta and Berrebi 2007; Krippner 2005). More precisely, it is argued that this stylized fact results from the combination of two mechanisms. First, increased financial investment opportunities have crowded out real investment. Second, the increased payments required by financial markets have decreased internal funds available for investment and shortened the planning horizon of firms’ management. Under the pull and push pressures from financial markets, non-financial firms have become less keen on investing. Sluggish growth and poor employment performance could then be related to this financialisation. On the other hand, there has been a huge amount of theoretical and empirical research dedicated to the effects of trade on labour, generally concluding that the reallocation of resources in response to freer trade is favourable to productivity, growth and employment (for example Dutt et al. 2009). The literature on offshoring suggests that this relationship is less straightforward, pointing out a greater volatility in employment (for a survey, see Crinò 2009). The idea that imports represent necessarily a loss of employment has been dismissed as competitive gains from lower input prices can foster exports (Bas and Strauss-Kahn 2014). However, there is mounting evidence that the adjustment costs related to trade in final and intermediate goods could be substantial, resulting in growing inequalities and leaving the net effect on employment ambiguous (Egger and Kreickemeier 2009; Stone 2013). Following Rodrik’s (1997) insight about the effect of globalisation on wages and employment, recent research suggests that the rise in offshoring and the development of international production networks could explain the significant increase in labour elasticity in developed economies and the subsequent reduction in job security and workers’ bargaining power (Hijzen and Swaim 2010; Senses 2010). Pointing in the same direction, Foster-McGregor et al. (2013) have shown that, at the industry level, offshoring has negatively impacted labour demand for all skill levels, an effect especially strong for medium-skilled workers. But, so far, the literature on financialisation and the literature on the effects of globalisation on labour have been rarely linked. Notable exceptions are Palpacuer (2008) and the work conducted by Milberg and Winkler. In particular, the latter focuses on the combined effects of globalisation and financialisation to explain poor wage and employment performance in developed countries (Milberg 2008; Milberg and Winkler 2010, 2013). One of their core arguments is that the effects of offshoring on labour demand are mitigated by a mark-up effect (Milberg and Winkler 2010). In competitive markets, the direct substitution of domestic labour with foreign labour through offshoring and the productivity effect resulting from specialization have a negative impact on labour demand. However, this negative impact can be offset by a scale effect as lower prices increase demand for output and then labour demand. But in the context of global value chains driven by lead oligopoly firms, the effects of offshoring on labour demand could differ substantially. If firms are not able to pass the gains from diminishing input prices to consumers, the scale effect disappears. It is replaced by a mark-up effect where firms improve their profits. There is still the possibility for labour demand to increase if these additional profits are invested and if the resulting increase in productivity benefits consumers and increase their demand. But if offshoring allows firms to limit investment, to reduce the scope of their activities and to increasingly dedicate their profits to payments to financial markets in the form of dividends and share buybacks, the overall impact on labour demand may be dominated by the substitution effect, leading to decreasing domestic employment and depressed wages. Against this backdrop, the aim of the paper is to introduce new empirical evidence in the policy debate on globalisation, financialisation and employment by bringing some insights from industry-level data. As suggested by the above analysis, the competitive or oligopolistic nature of industries matters for the expected impact of globalisation and financialisation on employment. In the rest of the paper, we define financialisation restrictively as a process of diminishing reinvested profits. We try to asses to what extent, as suggested by Milberg and Winkler, financialisation is preventing potential dynamic gains from globalisation to materialize or, alternatively, whether financialisation is merely a symptom in the of process of reallocation of capital in the context of moving comparative advantage and structural changes in consumption patterns. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 explains our analytical framework with four industry dynamics of employment and financialisation and links them to several economic determinants, including offshoring and value added imports. Section 3 describes the data and the econometric methodology used to test the hypothesis presented in Sect. 2. Section 4 provides the main econometric results with regressions on labour demand and the investment-to-profit ratio (IPR). Section 5 discusses these results and presents additional results within the four industry dynamics. Section 6 concludes.",10

Instead, the recent wave of globalization is characterized by the strong emergence of vertical specialization and the offshoring of parts of the production (see Yi 2003). The labour market consequences of this offshoring of production are debated in the media as well as among policy makers and academic economists. At least since Feenstra and Hanson (1999) trade economists have concerned themselves with investigating the impact of offshoring on labour markets. While Feenstra and Hanson (1999) and many papers since investigate this issue using industry or country level data (e.g. Foster-McGregor et al. 2013), recent research tends to use individual level data in order to examine whether offshoring has any impact on an individual’s job security or wage. Using micro data has the advantage that it allows to focus on the level of the individual where one can control for observable and unobservable characteristics that may play a role for transitions in employment status or wages, but that cannot be controlled for in firm or industry data (e.g. age, tenure or marital status of a worker). It also provides information on the various aspects of skills of an individual, which can be exploited in the estimations. Moreover, unobserved time-invariant characteristics can be controlled for by using panel data methods. A number of recent studies have investigated the effects of offshoring using individual level data. Baumgarten et al. (2013), Ebenstein et al. (2014), Liu and Trefler (2008) and Geishecker and Görg (2008, 2013) use individual level data for the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, respectively, to study the impact of offshoring on individual wages. Liu and Trefler (2008), Geishecker (2008), Bachmann and Braun (2011) and Pfaffermayr et al. (2007) also use individual level data for the US, Germany and Austria, respectively, to investigate whether offshoring has any implications for job security, measured in terms of whether an individual switches jobs or moves into unemployment. Overall, it seems from this literature that, in general, offshoring may have some effects on employment and wages in line with expectations, where low-skilled workers may be more likely to lose and high-skilled workers more likely to benefit in terms of job security and wages. What has, to the best of our knowledge, been neglected in this literature thus far is the question as to how workers with different types of contracts fare in this wave of offshoring. This is the focus of this paper, where we particularly consider whether workers on temporary contracts experience different labour market effects of offshoring than their peers on permanent contracts. This is an important issue, given that temporary contracts are an important mode of employment today (see Table 1). In Germany, the country studied in this paper, the share of temporary contracts in the group of workers aged 25–49 years increased slightly from 7.4 % in 1999 to 9.8 % in 2011 (according to Eurostat statistics, not shown).Footnote 1 Having been well below the European average, Germany has now almost caught up with the European average (see Fig. 1). Share of workers holding a temporary contract in total employment. Source Eurostat The share of temporary contracts is particularly high among younger workers and low-skilled workers (see Table 2). According to Eurostat data in Table 2, almost one-third of workers with primary education hold a temporary contract in 2007 (up from one-fourth in 1999). Among workers with secondary or tertiary education, only 10 or 8 % hold a temporary contract, respectively. Negative economic shocks such as a recession with many jobs being shed, can cause high levels of unemployment among groups with a high prevalence of temporary contracts (cf. Blanchard and Landier 2002; Cahuc and Postel-Vinay 2002; Boeri and Garibaldi 2007). Yet, the possibility to use temporary contracts should also increase overall employment as employers may be more willing to create jobs given the lower cost of eliminating jobs. Moreover, the use of temporary contracts by employers also enhances employment stability for regular core employees who hold permanent contracts (Gramm and Schnell 2001). While, in principle, all workers in an industry are equally likely to be affected by the pressures on labour brought about by offshoring, there are several reasons to believe that workers on temporary contracts are affected differently than workers on permanent contracts. Booth et al. (2002a) characterize temporary labour under fixed-term contracts as “a buffer stock that allows firms to adjust to changes in the business environment due to seasonal or other transitory causes” (p. F182). Accordingly, if firms and industries adjust to offshoring, this may lead to a stronger adjustment among temporary workers; both positively and negatively. In terms of wages, temporary workers might be particularly affected because they supposedly have a weaker bargaining position than permanent workers. They might also be represented less well in collective wage bargaining processes. Moreover, they have possibly obtained less on-the-job training or job-specific human capital, making their bargaining position even weaker. Hence, they might incur stronger wage reductions in case employers adjust to globalization pressure at the intensive margin. In terms of job security, temporary workers might, on the one hand, have a stronger propensity to lose their job due to international competition because their contracts have a natural termination date after which employers might not renew it. Moreover, they have typically obtained less firm-specific human capital, making them less attractive for employers to keep them. On the other hand, when firms expand due to offshoring-induced cost savings or productivity improvements, temporary workers might benefit from renewed contracts or conversion to a permanent contract. Indeed, there is some evidence that temporary contracts can serve as a stepping-stone to regular employment (e.g. Holmlund and Storrie 2002; Booth et al. 2002b). We address the question of whether employees on temporary contracts are differently affected by offshoring by looking at individual wages and the risk of becoming unemployed. The sample consists of male workers between 18 and 64 years in manufacturing industries between 1999 and 2007. Data are taken from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), an annual, representative, and widely used individual level panel data set for Germany (see Wagner et al. 2007, for a description of the SOEP). In order to integrate offshoring into the data, we link the SOEP with industry level data on offshoring, specifically the share of imported value added in industry production, which we calculate from the world input–output database (WIOD). In the regressions, we interact offshoring intensities with contract type and can thus infer the potentially differential impact of offshoring on permanent and temporary workers. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes our measure for offshoring and gives an overview about the evolution of offshoring. Section 3 introduces the other data and presents our methodological approach. In Sect. 4 we discuss our empirical results. Section 5 concludes.",20

In Germany, one of the largest trading nations of the world, the exports-to-GDP ratio (imports-to-GDP ratio) rose from 22.2 % (21.5 %) in 1991 to 39.7 % (31.7 %) in the pre-crisis year 2007.Footnote 1 Against this backdrop, fears of massive labour market adjustment needs have also been on the rise. Indeed, the link between trade integration and labour reallocation is at the core of international trade theories. Whereas classic (Ricardian and Heckscher–Ohlin type) trade theory predicts that workers move across sectors according to comparative advantage, the so-called new, new (heterogeneous-firm) trade theory, pioneered by Melitz (2003) and Bernard et al. (2003), emphasizes the reallocation of resources within industries from purely domestic firms towards more productive exporters. While academics point out that this reshuffling of jobs leads to important gains from trade since resources are brought to their most productive uses, the affected firms and workers have more cause for concern. This is due to potentially important adjustment costs arising in this process. For example, firms might incur firing, hiring, and (re-)training costs, while workers may lose specific human capital and, potentially, experience periods of frictional non-employment. Thus, obtaining a proper understanding of labour market adjustment dynamics in response to increased exposure to international trade is not only of academic interest, it also addresses growing public concerns in industrialized countries about the costs and benefits associated with an accelerated globalization. Previous empirical work (see below) has shown that—consistent with heterogeneous-firm trade theory—net job flows are indeed associated with the export and import activities of the firm, thus suggesting that international trade may be an important factor behind the simultaneous occurrence of job creation and job destruction that Davis and Haltiwanger (1992) documented even for narrowly defined industries. However, net job flows provide only very limited insight into the adjustment dynamics. In particular, they do not contain information on how the employment change is brought about and how many and in what way both workers of the existing workforce and job seekers are affected. Do firms grow faster because they separate from less or because they hire more workers? Do these transitions mainly include job-to-job movements or do they primarily affect movements in and out of non-employment? Moreover, international trade may affect worker turnover even if it is not associated with net employment changes.Footnote 2 For instance, adjustments to new production patterns may induce a change in the required qualification set of the workers, leading to a (partial) replacement of the existing workforce. Also, worker turnover can be affected if a firm’s engagement in international trade leads to a change in the volatility of labour demand (Rodrik 1997).Footnote 3
 This paper takes these issues seriously and examines in detail the trade-related employment adjustment process in Germany. For this purpose, it makes use of a rich linked employer–employee data set that follows both establishments and individual workers over time. In addition to net job flows, it quantifies accessions, separations, and churning flows at the establishment level and relates them to the establishments’ exporting and importing activities. It moreover examines whether occupations characterized by different skill levels are affected differently in this respect and makes further distinctions concerning the origin states of the accessions and the destination states of the separations. The empirical analysis covers the years 1999–2003 and restricts attention to the manufacturing sector. The main findings are the following. Trading plants have lower worker turnover rates than non-traders, suggesting a higher degree of employment stability. The multivariate regression analysis further reveals a statistically significant and positive association between the export status and the net job flow rate, which is primarily driven by a lower separation rate. The latter is mainly due to less separations of high-skilled workers and into non-employment. In contrast, both an increase and a decrease in import intensity are (weakly) associated with a lower accession rate. These results, however, are predominantly driven by small establishments, and they partly lose statistical significance once unobservable establishment characteristics are taken into account. The explicit focus on the link between worker flows and international trade at the firm or establishment level is still scant in the existing empirical literature. Coşar et al. (2013) structurally estimate a extended Melitz (2003) model of trade-related transition patterns using Colombian data.Footnote 4 Muendler (2008) and Menezes Filho and Muendler (2011) adopt a reduced-form approach, using linked employer-employee data for Brazil in the time period 1986–2001. They unexpectedly find that there are significantly fewer accessions and more displacements—thus, lower job growth—in comparative-advantaged industries and at exporters, although product-market shares are reallocated in the opposite direction. The authors suggest that this result can arise in a setting where factor productivity grows faster than output. The present paper also relies on reduced-form regressions. It complements the analysis of Muendler (2008) and Menezes Filho and Muendler (2011) not only by providing evidence on Germany, a case quite different from Brazil, as it is an industrialized country, abundant in skilled labour and capital. In addition, it also uses (qualitative) information on the import behaviour of establishments, next to exports. More generally, this paper is also related to several studies that have analysed the connection between exporting at the firm or establishment level and (net) job growth in industrialized countries (cf. for example Bernard and Jensen 1999; Wagner 2002; Bernard et al. 2009). Footnote 5 Most of them yield conclusions that are quite different from the ones reported for Brazil. In general, exporters are found to be larger than non-exporters and also to experience faster employment growth. On the other hand, evidence on the connection between importing and employment is less conclusive.Footnote 6 Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) use data on the French manufacturing sector for the years 1986–1992 and analyse how employment growth and skill structure correlate with imports and exports of goods. They find a strong correlation between imports (particularly imports of finished goods) and job destruction, primarily the destruction of production jobs. In contrast, Bernard et al. (2009) find a positive association between importing (or starting to import) and job growth in the US.Footnote 7
 The plan of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the linked employer–employee data set used for the analysis. Section 3 contains details on the methodology and the empirical strategy. Regression results are presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 extends the analysis by distinguishing different worker categories as well as different origin and destination states, respectively. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the main findings and concludes.",7
151,4,Review of World Economics,17 April 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-015-0218-9,Pass-through of trade costs to U.S. import prices,November 2015,Hakan Yilmazkuday,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Trade costs are partly determined by trade policy, and, thus, their reflection in the welfare of economic agents through prices (i.e., the pass-through of trade costs) is of political interest. Accordingly, the empirical literature on international trade has focused on the effects of changes in trade costs on export prices (of firms or source countries), referring to the gains from trade through export-oriented growth, especially by relying on dramatic liberalizations of trade for identification purposes.Footnote 1 Nevertheless, evidence on pass-through of trade costs to import prices is limited, which is important for import competition as well as household welfare in the destination country.Footnote 2
 Although calculating the pass-through of trade costs into import prices is straightforward when the corresponding data are available, calculating the underlying details is the key to form trade policy, because, other than the direct effects of trade costs on import prices, one has to consider their indirect effects through other components of prices, namely markups and marginal costs, where the latter also includes information on quality and productivity (in the source country). As a simple example, if more liberal trade leads to an increase in import prices due to an increase in quality, this may be welfare improving in the importer country (depending on the trade-off between increased prices and quality), while an increase in import prices due to a reduction in productivity (with no quality effects) would be welfare worsening. Therefore, in a typical welfare analysis of an importer country, the pass-through of trade costs to prices should be controlled for markup effects as well as quality and productivity effects. This paper achieves such an investigation by decomposing the U.S. import prices (measured at the U.S. dock) into marginal costs, markups and trade costs at the HTS 10-digit good level. Marginal costs are further decomposed into quality, productivity, and other factors. Using a demand-side model, for robustness, we consider both variable and constant markups in our investigation. After controlling for several fixed effects, we estimate the pass-through of trade costs to prices, markups, marginal costs, quality, and productivity. We also distinguish between the effects of duties and freight-related costs. Moreover, we use actual data on duties and freight-related costs to construct multiplicative trade costs; hence, our results are robust to alternative specifications of trade costs (such as additive trade costs). When data for prices and trade costs are available (as in this paper), the main issue is the measurement of variables such as markups and marginal costs of production where the latter can further be decomposed into quality, productivity, and other factors (e.g., other local production costs). This paper introduces a new methodology for the identification of all of these variables. In particular, first, the price elasticity of demand is estimated using data on quantities and prices, where the estimation methodology of Feenstra (1994), which is robust to simultaneity bias, is used. Second, the estimated price elasticities are used to calculate markups, where we consider the cases of both variable markups (due to constant absolute risk aversion utility function of importers) and constant markups (due to constant relative risk aversion utility function of importers). Third, marginal costs of production are identified by using the data on prices and trade costs together with estimated markups. Fourth, quality measures are identified as the importer preference parameters (i.e., demand shifters) that are calculated by controlling the quantities traded for the effects of prices and other control variables (i.e., good-and-time fixed effects). Fifth, since measures of quality and marginal costs of production are shown to be positively related in the literature (as in a study by Crozet et al. 2012 who use pure data on quality), the relationship between the estimated measures of quality and marginal costs of production is tested by running a regression where all other factors are controlled for; the part of the marginal costs of production that cannot be explained either by quality or other factors is defined as the inverse of productivity. Once these variables are identified, we continue with investigating their interaction with trade costs. The results of pass-through analyses show that the elasticity of U.S. import prices with respect to overall trade costs (i.e., duties/tariffs plus freight-related costs) is about \(-0.90\,\%\). During an episode of reducing trade costs, under the assumptions of variable (constant) markups, this elasticity of \(-0.90\,\%\) would correspond to a \(0.90\,\%\) increase in prices that is decomposed into \(1.74\,\% \left( 1.90\,\% \right) \) of an increase in marginal costs of production, \(0.16\,\% \left( 0.00\,\% \right) \) of an increase in markups and \(1.00\,\% \left( 1.00\,\% \right) \) of a reduction in trade costs (i.e., defined as direct effects of trade costs). The increase in the marginal costs of production \(1.74\,\% \left( 1.90\,\% \right) \) is further decomposed into \(1.10\,\% \left( 1.20\,\% \right) \) of an increase in quality, and \(0.63\,\% \left( 0.70\,\% \right) \) of a decrease in productivity for the cases of variable (constant) markups. Therefore, the contribution of quality has the lion’s share in explaining the effects of trade costs on prices, followed by productivity effects and markups. Considering import competition and/or household utility, if we accept the inverse of import prices controlled for quality as a rough measure of welfare, \(1\,\%\) of a reduction in trade costs would result in \(0.20\,\% \left( 0.30\,\% \right) \) of an increase in welfare under the assumption of variable (constant) markups. When we decompose trade costs into duties/tariffs and freight-related costs, such values change as \(-0.21 \left( 0.75\right) \) for duties/tariffs and \(0.25 \left( 0.22\right) \) for freight-related costs, under the assumption of variable (constant) markups. These results show the importance of considering alternative measures of trade costs in pass-through calculations where freight-related costs play an important role, which is mostly ignored in the corresponding literature focusing on duties/tariffs. The empirical results of this paper regarding the positive relation between tariffs and productivity are consistent with the existing literature (e.g., see Pavcnik 2002; Amiti and Konings 2007; Topalova and Khandelwal 2011, for firm-level studies within countries, and Romalis 2007, for a cross-country analysis). In terms of the data set and control variables employed, this paper has similarities with a study by Amiti and Khandelwal (2013) who find that lower trade costs are associated with quality upgrading for products close to the world quality frontier, whereas lower trade costs discourage quality upgrading for products distant from the frontier. In this paper, when the effects of overall trade costs (i.e., duties/tariffs plus freight-related costs) are considered, in the case of a reduction in trade costs, the results are in line with quality upgrading on average across products, which is consistent with studies such as by Hart (1983) who argues that competition will reduce managerial slack. However, when the effects of only duties/tariffs are considered (in this paper), in the case of a reduction in trade costs, the results are in line with quality downgrading on average across products, which is consistent with studies such as by Schumpeter (1943) who suggests that the appropriability effect would reduce incentives to innovate. Despite the consistency of the empirical results of this paper with the existing literature, however, none of the mentioned papers have considered the separate effects of duties/tariffs and freight-related costs on prices. Most importantly, these papers have not decomposed the effects of trade costs (on prices) into the effects on markups, quality and productivity while measuring/interpreting the pass-through of trade costs into welfare. This paper bridges these gaps. In the following section, we introduce the data and estimate the tariff pass-through into prices; this section will also motivate the rest of the paper. In Sect. 3, we introduce the model that distinguishes between variable and constant markups. The implications of the model are estimated in Sect. 4 to identify markups, marginal costs, quality, and productivity. The pass-through of tariffs to the components of prices is depicted in Sect. 5. Concluding remarks are provided in Sect. 6.",9

Previous studies have identified international trade as a major channel of technology spillovers (Acharya and Keller 2009; Coe and Helpman 1995; Xu and Wang 1999). For example, firms can obtain information on advanced technology by reverse engineering imported goods. Trade also provides channels of cross-border communication that facilitate the learning of production and organizational methods and market conditions (Grossman and Helpman 1991).Footnote 1 However, few studies have paid attention to the relationship between bilateral trade patterns and technology spillovers. Of this scarce literature, Haruna et al. (2010) investigate whether trade structure plays an important role in knowledge spillovers between Asian economies (Korea, Taiwan, China and India) and G7 countries, including the United States (US) and Japan. By using a modified version of the Balassa index of Revealed Comparative Advantage, they find that trade specialization, especially import specialization, has a direct effect on knowledge spillovers. The present study expands the body of knowledge on this topic by analyzing the relationship between bilateral trade patterns and international technology spillovers from an empirical perspective. Here, by the term “technology spillovers” we refer to “the process by which one inventor learns from the research outcomes of others’ research projects and is able to enhance her own research productivity with this knowledge without fully compensating the other inventors for the value of this learning” (Branstetter 2006: 327–328). Thus, we distinguish technology spillovers from imitation or technology adoption.Footnote 2
 It is common to categorize bilateral trade patterns into three types, namely inter-industry trade [or one-way trade (OWT)], horizontal intra-industry trade (HIIT) and vertical intra-industry trade (VIIT). The difference between HIIT and VIIT reflects the differences in the quality of products in the same category traded between two countries. In HIIT, horizontally differentiated products (i.e. products with similar quality but different varieties) are traded, whereas vertically differentiated products (i.e. products with different qualities) are traded in VIIT.Footnote 3 Empirical studies divide intra-industry trade (IIT) into HIIT and VIIT by setting certain thresholds based on the ratio of unit values (i.e. the total value of imports or exports in one product category divided by the quantity of imports or exports in the product category) under the assumption that increasing unit values mirror an increase in product quality (Fontagné and Freudenberg 1997; Greenaway et al. 1995; Fukao et al. 2003). Further, the size of international technology spillovers may differ according to not only trade volume but also trade patterns. If knowledge is transmitted through international trade, the flow of knowledge would depend on whether the same good is either imported or exported (i.e. OWT), or both imported and exported (i.e. IIT). The knowledge flow may also rest on the distribution of the quality of imported and exported goods. However, it is not clear how the knowledge flow is related to trade patterns. Thus, we empirically investigate this issue in the present study. It is not easy to measure technology spillovers. We use patent citation data as a proxy for spillovers of technological knowledge. This approach was pioneered by Jaffe et al. (1993) and it has been widely used in the literature (e.g. Jaffe and Trajtenberg 1999; MacGarvie 2006; Maurseth and Verspagen 2002; Malerba et al. 2013). Patent documents include references to existing patents (i.e. patent citations). The main legal purpose of these references is to delimit the scope of contributions by the present patent and by previous patents. However, citations of previous patents can be interpreted to indicate that the knowledge in the cited patents was “in some way useful for developing the new knowledge described in the citing patent” (Maurseth and Verspagen 2002: 534). In other words, “a citation of Patent X by Patent Y means that X represents a piece of previously existing knowledge upon which Y builds” (Jaffe et al. 1993: 580). Thus, patent citations can be used as a direct measure of knowledge flows (Hall et al. 2001).Footnote 4
 In our study, we combine patent data with bilateral trade data. We employ patent data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for the years 1995–2006. Our sample consists of 55 countries, which include advanced, emerging and developing economies. Data on bilateral trade are taken from the International Trade Database at the Product-Level (BACI) provided by the Centre d’Etudes Prospectives et d’Informations Internationales (CEPII) for the years 1995–2007. Employing information on the values and quantities of imports and exports recorded at the six-digit level of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS6), trade patterns are categorized as OWT, HIIT or VIIT.Footnote 5 Both OWT and VIIT are subdivided into two categories according to the trade direction. We then calculate the share of each trade pattern at the 13 aggregated sector levels. The relationship between trade patterns and international technology spillovers is examined by regressing the number of patent citations on the shares of trade patterns. The model is estimated by using negative binomial (NB) regression and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZNB) regression, which are both standard estimation techniques for models with count data as the dependent variable (Cameron and Trivedi 1998). Our main findings are as follows. We find that an increase in the share of IIT in bilateral trade is significantly associated with more patent citations between two countries. In particular, an increase in the share of HIIT contributes to patent citations more than does VIIT, whereas the effect of OWT on the number of citations is much weaker than that of IIT. We also find that, with regard to VIIT, whether the citing country exports or imports higher quality products on average has no significant difference on the effect on its patent citations. Moreover, the estimated coefficient of the share of one-way exportation is significantly higher than that of the share of one-way importation, but this result is not robust. Thus, in the case of OWT, there may not be a significant difference in the relationship with patent citations, depending on the trade direction. These findings are consistent with the predictions derived from the model of monopolistic competition with quality differentiation presented by Jinji et al. (2014). They extend the model developed by Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) and introduce technology spillovers into the model. In the model, bilateral trade patterns and the degree of international technology spillovers are both endogenously determined. Then, they derive a number of theoretical predictions from the model, which are consistent with the empirical findings presented in this paper. This paper contributes to the empirical literature on this topic by providing new evidence that international technology spillovers differ according to trade patterns. Our findings suggest a new reason why differences in international technology spillovers are observed, even among developed countries. Indeed, even developed countries engage in various bilateral trade patterns. Moreover, some countries engage in a higher share of HIIT and others in a higher share of VIIT.Footnote 6 These differences in trade patterns may cause differences in technology spillovers across countries. Our findings also have an important implication. The estimated results imply that countries benefit from international technology spillovers more when they engage in HIIT than in the other trade patterns. Since trade between technologically advanced countries has a higher share of HIIT than trade between other combinations of countries, this finding implies that trade facilitates technology spillovers more among technologically advanced countries than between technologically advanced and less-advanced countries. Thus, international trade may enlarge, rather than narrow, the technology gap between technologically advanced and less-advanced countries. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the method of categorizing trade patterns. Section 3 describes our data and explains how we selected our sample. Section 4 discusses our estimation framework. Section 5 reports and discusses the estimation results. Section 6 concludes the paper.",9

According to the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database, during that period the value of total world trade (imports, nominal US dollars) doubled from US $5 to US $10 trillion. While much of the increase in the value of trade was due to a rise in trade of existing products with existing trading partners [see, for example, Husted and Nishioka (2013)], it is interesting to note that an increasing number of developing countries became involved in global trade both in terms of the goods they export and their export partners (see also Cheptea et al. 2014). For instance, the value of differentiated goods exported from developing countries more than tripled over the years 1995–2005 (see Table 1) while the number of their importer-product combinations almost doubled.Footnote 1
 Growth in trade at the extensive margin has been a recent focus of study in many papers. Using disaggregated commodity level data on trade for 1913 bilateral country pairs, Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) report a “significant and robust connection between the extensive margin and total trade growth”. In this paper, we are interested in the factors that determine whether or not a country enters the export market, and, in particular, how these factors influence firms in developing countries to choose to export. We estimate a logit model that is based on the firm-level decision to export (Helpman et al. (2008); hereafter HMR) and study the causes of the increasing involvement of developing countries in global trade at the product level.Footnote 2
 Our empirical analysis uses data on exports of 144 differentiated products (measured at the 3-digit SITC level) among pairs of 129 countries for the years 1995 and 2005.Footnote 3 We compare the estimation results across exporters, products, and years and find evidence that the success of those countries that have seen major growth at the extensive margin over this period is due to a broad-based rise in productivity levels for exporting firms in these countries. In particular, we find that the countries who have been most successful in adding new markets have done so not only because of high growth rates of industry productivity levels but also because they enjoyed not-too-low initial levels of productivities. Our results indicate the important roles played by self-selection into export markets due to productivity growth of potential export industries, which is probably engendered by firm level technological advance and/or the contribution of technology from foreign firms that have begun to produce in- and export from these countries. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 we present an overview of the expansion in global trade, focusing on market access at the product level. In Sect. 3, we estimate our industry-level version of the HMR model and show that our results can be used to quantify productivity growth in the export sector for each of the countries in our sample. The last section offers our conclusions.",
151,4,Review of World Economics,11 July 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-015-0227-8,Institutional distance and foreign direct investment,November 2015,Rafael Cezar,Octavio R. Escobar,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Developing and transition economies increasingly attract foreign direct investment (FDI) flows (UNCTAD 2012). Three important patterns, observable in UNCTAD (2012) data, are helpful in understanding this trend. First, most FDI outflows are from developed economies, but their share in total FDI outflows is decreasing over time. Since 2003, the share of FDI outflows of developing and transition economies has consistently increased, reducing the share of FDI from developed economies to approximately 75 % in 2011. Second, firms primarily invest in countries with similar levels of development as their own. More than 70 % of outward FDI from developing and transition economies goes to other developing and transition economies, and approximately 50 % of this outward FDI goes to economies located in the source economy’s region. Developed economies also locate most of their operations in other developed economies. Third, developed economies have a greater capacity to diversify their operations than developing and transition economies. Approximately 45 % of outward FDI from developed economies goes to developing and transition economies. Moreover, developed economies are the main source of FDI in developing and transition economies. Differences in the quality of institutions across countries are the main determinant of differences in economic development (Acemoglu and Robinson 2010); we thus expect that institutional distance is an important determinant of FDI and that it helps explain recent FDI patterns. We develop a theoretical model, using a heterogeneous firms framework, to explain how institutional distance influences decisions to invest in a country and the volume of investment undertaken. According to the heterogeneous firms literature (Helpman et al. 2008; Yeaple 2009), a productivity threshold must be overcome to make FDI profitable. Thus, only the most productive firms, mainly from developed countries, can invest abroad. When entering foreign markets, multinational enterprises (MNEs) must adapt their strategies to the requirements of local institutions, which may differ from the institutions of their home countries. Our model suggests that MNEs face an adaptation cost in adjusting to the institutional environments of host countries. As adaptation costs increase with institutional distance, institutional distance determines the productivity threshold at which FDI is more profitable than exporting as a means of accessing foreign markets. Thus, increasing institutional distance reduces the number of firms that undertake FDI. In addition, adaptation costs reduce firm profits and the profitability of FDI. Accordingly, firms’ FDI declines with institutional distance. Firms perform better in foreign markets similar to their home markets than in markets that are dissimilar, as similarities are easier for firms to manage (Johanson and Vahlne 2009). In addition to institutional similarities, development, geographical and cultural proximity are important determinants of FDI (Head and Ries 2008; Helpman et al. 2008; Guiso et al. 2009). To control for differences in all of these factors across countries, when studying the determinants of FDI, the empirical literature uses gravity equations. Studies show that institutional distance matters for bilateral FDI. Differences between host and source countries in terms of corruption (Habib and Zurawicki 2002), legal rules (Guiso et al. 2009), credit market regulations, legal constraints in recruiting and firing, and decentralisation of wage bargaining (Bénassy-Quéré et al. 2007) reduce bilateral FDI flows. However, the costs of institutional distance may differ for firms from developed and developing countries, owing to firm heterogeneity. Firms from developed countries may have more experience and better networks, which reduce the cost of institutional distance, than firms from developing countries (Johanson and Vahlne 2009). We proceed to an empirical validation of our model. Using alternative indicators of institutional distance, the results suggest that FDI activity declines as institutional distance increases. When investing in countries with weak institutions, firms from countries with weak institutions face lower costs than firms from countries with strong institutions. The results also suggest that institutional distance more strongly influences firms’ decisions to invest in developing than in developed economies. Once an investment decision is made, institutional distance equally affects the amount of investment from developed and developing economies. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical model. Section 3 describes the empirical specification of the model and the estimation strategy. Section 4 describes the data and the measures of institutional distance used. The empirical results are presented in Sect. 5, and robustness tests are presented in Sect. 6. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes.",44
151,4,Review of World Economics,04 August 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-015-0228-7,Is offshoring linked to offshoring potential? Evidence from German linked employer–employee data,November 2015,Tobias Brändle,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The last decades have seen an extraordinary rise in international trade. Nowadays, the term “trade” does not only refer to trade in final products, but increasingly includes trade in intermediate inputs along the production chain. Typically, labour intensive inputs are imported from low-wage countries, a process typically referred to as offshoring.Footnote 1 In addition, the process of offshoring increasingly happens for smaller and smaller parts of the production process, i.e. single tasks instead of whole goods, production chains or even plants (so called trade in tasks, see Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2008; Acemoglu and Autor 2011; Autor 2013 or Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud 2014). On the one hand, the literature on offshoring typically identifies the determinants of offshoring behaviour of firms, or the effects of offshoring on firm performance (see Wagner 2011, for an overview). Typical questions are: Why do firms offshore? Which firms engage in offshoring? On the other hand, there is a discussion on what type of jobs are being offshored and how many may be offshored in the future. Not all jobs are equally tradable, and the economic literature has identified a set of characteristics that may allow the estimation of the offshoring potential of jobs. Earlier studies have used only subjective measures or a selective number of characteristics to estimate the extent of job offshoreability (see, e.g. Blinder 2009 for the US or Schrader and Laaser 2009 for Germany). More recent studies focus on different, maybe more objective measures (Becker and Muendler 2015; Blinder and Krueger 2013), or a larger set of characteristics (Brändle and Koch 2014). There are several studies trying to quantify the potential for offshoring (e.g. Blinder 2009). What is missing is an analysis of the link between the offshoring potential of jobs and actual offshoring behaviour of firms. The main contribution of the present work is to complement existing lines of research by linking actual offshoring behaviour to offshoring potential. If offshoring potential is a predictor for future offshoring, we would expect plants with a high offshoring potential to relocate those tasks in the future and having done so less in the past. However, it may be the case that offshoring plants have a more offshoreable task set in general. Then, the relationship between offshoring potential and actual offshoring would be positive. We analyse this relationship empirically by combining information on the offshoring potential of the employees of a plant with plant-level determinants of actual offshoring behaviour. The main dataset for our analysis is the German LIAB, a linked employer–employee dataset. It combines a representative panel survey of German plants with information on the employees working in them. In the LIAB, different information on offshoring behaviour is selectively included in several waves of the data (see, Addison et al. 2011 or Sirries et al. 2012). We match information on offshoring potential based on a large set of characteristics drawn from the German BIBB/BAuA employment survey. The information is differentiated between the outsourcing potential and the offshoring potential of jobs, aggregated, and then linked to the LIAB on a 3-digit level of occupations. Using this approach we can estimate a plant-level offshoreability index, depending on the occupations of the employees working in a plant. We take a retrospective approach because we fully observe the offshoreability of the current workforce, but only whether offshoring has happened during the last or last 2 years, depending on the measure. Our investigation proceeds in analysing whether plants with higher offshoring potential have a higher probability to having offshored parts of their production processes, after controlling for relevant firm characteristics. The empirical results of the paper reveal that, in addition to the usually applied determinants of offshoring behaviour of firms, the two indicators of offshoring and outsourcing potential significantly affect the probability of having outsourced or offshored. The average outsourcing potential of jobs in a plant decreases the likelihood that a plant engages in (international) outsourcing, depending on the measure used. As regards the offshoring potential of the employee stock in a plant, we find that this measure is also negatively linked to actual offshoring behaviour of German plants, especially for those measures, where we know for sure that outsourcing has taken place internationally.Footnote 2 Therefore, we think that the information on offshoring behaviour in the LIAB is well suited to investigate the topic: offshoring potential has a stronger influence in plants that are internationally active. We conclude that we can interpret offshoring potential as not-yet realised offshoring, or offshoring that cannot be undertaken, e.g. because of trade barriers. Section 2 gives a short summary of the relevant strands of the literature and shows the missing link between offshoring potential and actual offshoring. The data is described in Sect. 3 along with a documentation of the matching process between the BIBB/BAuA and the LIAB data and the empirical method. Section 4 displays the main empirical results concerning the determinants of offshoring behaviour as well as some robustness checks. Section 5 concludes.",1
151,4,Review of World Economics,23 August 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-015-0229-6,Benchmark averaging and the measurement of changes in international income inequality,November 2015,Robert J. Hill,Daniel Melser,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The question of whether per capita income levels are converging or diverging over time is an important one that has attracted considerable attention in recent years. International comparisons of inequality and how it changes over time are useful for testing and refining growth models, and for predicting the allocation of global income in the future. The findings have implications for poverty reduction programs, as well as for international relations and the environment. It is now generally accepted that comparisons of per capita income across countries should be made at purchasing power parity (PPP) rather than market exchange rates.Footnote 1 This is for two reasons. First, market exchange rates are typically volatile with short-term movements driven largely by speculative trading (see for example Rogoff 2009). Second, nontraded goods and services tend to be cheaper in poorer countries, and hence market exchange rates systematically overestimate differences in per capita income across countries. This finding, which has been shown to be robust over different vintages of the Penn World Table (PWT), is know as the Penn (or Balassa–Samuelson) effect (see Balassa 1964; Samuelson 1964; Kravis and Lipsey 1983; Bhagwati 1984). The PWT is indeed the main source of PPP-exchange rates at a global level. The PWT is constructed by combining detailed spatial benchmarks from the international comparisons program (ICP) and other sources such as the OECD with data on real national growth rates (which are used to extrapolate to non-benchmark years). Researchers in the field tend to take the PWT data unquestioningly and make their comparisons without pausing to consider the robustness of their results. We have two main objectives here. The first is to demonstrate how sensitive measured changes in international income inequality can be to three decisions that are typically made implicitly. Our second objective is to provide guidance to researchers on how these decisions should be made. The first decision we consider is the choice of multilateral price index formula for converting per capita incomes across countries for each benchmark year into units of the same currency. A number of such formulas have been proposed in the literature. Here we consider three of these formulas. These are Geary (1958) and Khamis (1972) used by the PWT, GEKS (see Gini 1931; Eltetö and Köves 1964; Szulc 1964) used by the OECD and ICP, and ECLAC which has been used by the UN (see Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 1978). We evaluate the sensitivity of the spatial benchmarks to the choice between these three price index formulas, as well as comparing them with benchmarks obtained using market exchange rates (MER). The Penn effect in the MER benchmarks (i.e., overestimation of differences in per capita income between richer and poorer countries) is clearly discernible in our results. Also, a systematic pattern emerges in our PPP-exchange-rate based results. Geary–Khamis generates the smallest differences in per capita income across countries, and ECLAC the largest, with GEKS lying somewhere in between. This finding is consistent with Geary–Khamis and ECLAC being affected by substitution bias (in opposite directions). From the perspective of convergence studies, the problem is not so much substitution bias itself, but changes over time in the magnitude of the substitution bias. Such changes can bias the results towards finding either convergence or divergence. Our findings provide evidence of such distortions in both the ECLAC and Geary–Khamis results. These distortions can be avoided by using the GEKS method. The second decision arises from inconsistencies between a new spatial benchmark and the implied benchmark obtained by extrapolating from an earlier spatial benchmark using national growth rate data. These inconsistencies arise from two sources. First, there are methodological differences in the way each benchmark is calculated, such as changes in the precision of the product specifications or in the inclusion of productivity adjustments for government services (see Deaton and Heston 2010). Second, budget shares across expenditure categories differ significantly across countries (especially between rich and poor countries). National growth rates are calculated using national budget shares, while spatial comparisons use average budget shares. Inconsistencies of this latter type can be significantly reduced by extrapolating benchmarks at a disaggregated level (e.g., at the basic heading level). However, we are unable to implement such an approach here since the headings do not match from one spatial benchmark to the next. Nor do the headings in the national growth rate data match those in any of the spatial benchmarks. The PWT has generally avoided the spatiotemporal inconsistency problem by discarding all but the most recent spatial benchmark and then using the national growth rate data to extrapolate forwards and backwards.Footnote 2 The traditional PWT approach is problematic for two reasons. First, whenever a new spatial benchmark becomes available, this can lead to significant changes in the PWT. Johnson et al. (2013) show how these changes can overturn the results of some convergence and growth studies. Second, ignoring all but the most recent spatial benchmark wastes useful information. The problem then is how best to combine two or more spatial benchmarks with national growth rate data? We consider different ways of doing this, and in particular develop a weighted solution to this problem that makes full use of all the available data. We implement this approach here at the aggregate level. However, the same approach could also be implemented at basic heading level if the heading mismatch problem could be resolved. The third decision relates to the way that dispersion is measured. A number of alternative dispersion measures have been proposed in the literature. We show that some well known measures (notably the standard deviation of log per capita income, the coefficient of variation of per capita income, the generalized entropy index with \(\alpha =2\), and the Gini coefficient) can be derived from bilateral dissimilarity indexes [in the sense defined by Diewert (2002, 2009)].Footnote 3 We then compare the axiomatic properties of a number of dissimilarity indexes. In particular, we find that the dissimilarity indexes underlying the coefficient of variation, generalized entropy index with \(\alpha =2\), and Gini coefficient violate some important axioms. We illustrate some of the problems that can arise when a dissimilarity index with poor axiomatic properties is used. We conclude therefore that if a dispersion measure derivable from dissimilarity indexes is used, it should be one that satisfies our seven axioms. Empirically we find that such dispersion measures seem to generate similar results. Using a sample of 113 countries over the period 1980–2005, we demonstrate the empirical relevance of these three decisions: (i) the choice of multilateral price index formula, (ii) the way spatial benchmarks and national growth rates are combined, and (iii) the way inequality is measured. Each can very significantly affect how changes in international income inequality are measured, sometimes even to the point of reversing a finding of convergence to one of divergence or vice versa. It is important that researchers in the field face up to these problems and how they affect the robustness of their results. Based on our preferred methods we find convergence between each pair of spatial benchmarks when the countries are population weighted and divergence when they are not. The difference in this case is caused by the pivotal role played by China and India in the population weighted comparisons.",2

Helpman et al. (2010), henceforth HIR, recently proposed a framework—an extension of the Melitz (2003) model to Diamond–Mortensen–Pissarides search and matching frictions—linking sectoral wage inequality and trade openness. We provide empirical evidence in support of their key theoretical prediction that wage inequality first increases and then decreases with gradual trade liberalization. A hump-shaped relationship between trade openness and wage inequality that was incidentally also derived in Egger and Kreickemeier (2009). In contrast to the predictions of neoclassical trade theory, empirical findings, see e.g., Verhoogen (2008), show that trade can lead to wage inequality within sectors. While other models in this line of research use workers’ fair wage preferences, see e.g., Egger and Kreickemeier (2009), or efficiency wages, see e.g., Davis and Harrigan (2011), as a source of labor market imperfections to explain these findings, HIR developed a framework in which heterogeneous firms and workers bargain over the surplus from production in a Stole and Zwiebel (1996) setting, thereby allowing for workers with similar characteristics to be paid differently. Since only the most productive firms start exporting, the induced search and matching frictions are not only able to explain sectoral wage inequality but are also able to link it to trade. Our aim is to provide empirical evidence in favor of the model’s prediction that a rise in the extensive margin of trade openness first increases and then subsequently decreases wage inequality to its original level for a classic developed country like Germany. We like to think of German data to be particularly suitable for this purpose, as Germany is not only one of the world’s major exporting countries, but was able due to the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 and the entailed trade liberalization to increase its exports to the ten new member countries in the four ensuing years by about 70 %. Furthermore, Dustmann et al. (2009) have shown that Germany does not—contrary to common perception—have a stable wage distribution, but witnessed a similar rise in wage inequality like the US, the UK, or Canada. Thus, recent findings by Card et al. (2013) suggest that about 21 % of the increase in German wage inequality from 2002 to 2009 can be explained by rising dispersion in wage premiums at the firm level, while another 16 % can be accounted for by the rise in positive assortative matching between workers and firms. While related works by Krishna et al. (2012), Klein et al. (2013), Felbermayr et al. (2014), and Baumgarten (2013) could already provide reduced-form evidence in support of the link between trade openness and wage inequality, we show that this relationship is—as predicted by HIR—of a hump-shaped form. For this purpose, we use the LIAB, a linked employer-employee panel dataset from Germany, to run pooled OLS and fixed effects regressions of different measures of wage inequality on the change in trade openness with and without industry-specific controls. Our results confirm to a large extent the postulated inverted U-shaped relationship between wage inequality and trade openness as well as considerable similarity in wage inequality levels between autarkic and perfectly open industries. Further empirical evidence in support of the model’s prediction via structural estimation comes from work that has recently been conducted by Helpman et al. (2015) with Brazilian data and Egger et al. (2013) with data from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, and France. The schedule of this paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we recite the link between sectoral wage inequality and trade openness, as proposed in the HIR model. Section 3 describes the dataset used and gives insight into recent developments of German exports as well as the role of collective bargaining in Germany. Section 4 presents our empirical results. Section 5 concludes. An Online Appendix gives a review of the HIR framework and reports additional results and summary statistics.",2

152,1,Review of World Economics,28 September 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-015-0230-0,Services versus goods trade: a firm-level comparison,February 2016,Andrea Ariu,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"For a long time, international trade has been solely associated to the commerce of manufactured goods. In fact, services have become increasingly traded over time and today goods and services represent two equally important components of world trade (Francois and Hoeckman 2010). In Belgium, the number of service exporters more than doubled in less than 15 years (Ariu and Mion 2012), both exports and imports tripled and the share of services in total trade increased from 15 to 25 % for exports and from 18 to 22 % for imports.Footnote 1 The same figures for other European countries confirm the recent powerful growth for trade in servicesFootnote 2 and they raise the interest for understanding the features and dynamics of this relatively new form of trade. In this paper, we use a very detailed dataset from the National Bank of Belgium (hereafter NBB) on export and import transactions of Belgian firms to present a descriptive comparison of static and dynamic features of trade in goods and trade in services. First, we focus on the static characteristics of trade and we analyze trade participation, trade contribution, the features of firm-level flows and the characteristics of importers and exporters. Second, we explore trade dynamics, looking at entry, exit and survival in foreign markets, and comparing firms’ growth strategies during their export and import life. From a static perspective, we find that firms trading services are fewer and export and import smaller values than those trading goods. This is because they trade fewer products, with less countries, making fewer transactions and these gaps are only partially counterbalanced by larger transaction values. So, the extensive margins are the main responsible for the smaller size of service traders. Another interesting results of the static analysis comes when focusing on firms that trade both goods and services. Despite being few, (they represent only 8 % of exporters and 12 % of importers), they tend to be very successful in international markets and they account for more than 30 % of total trade. In the time dimension, we find that services’ traders experience higher entry and exit rates and a lower survival probability. However, the surviving firms grow more rapidly than those trading goods thanks to a more important increase in the number of transactions per product-market. So, international markets tend to be riskier for services, but successful firms are able to expand more than those trading goods. At the same time, this result highlights that the expansion of firm exports in a market is likely to be more related to an intensification of the interaction with existing market-products (as in Eaton et al. 2014) than to discovering preferences in new markets (as in Araujo et al. 2012; Albornoz et al. 2012; Buono et al. 2008; Lawless 2009) and to the introduction of new products within existing partner-countries (as in Freund and Pierola 2010). Finally, we observe that new exporters and importers of services tend to add also goods in their export and import basket after the first year. At the same time, new exporters and importers of goods tend to add services. These flows grow rapidly, but even after 10 years they represent only a marginal share of total exports and imports within the firm. However, their importance might not just be related to their size and they could play an important role in determining the success in foreign markets. For example, firms might strategically bundle both of them to decrease the transaction costs for customers. The main contribution of this paper is to provide comparable evidence on trade in services to the literature focusing on the understanding of trade at the firm-level. Most of the existing studies focus on trade in goods,Footnote 3 but in recent years a number of papers focusing on trade in services appeared thanks to the increased availability of micro data.Footnote 4 The limit of these contributions is that they lack information on firms trading goods.Footnote 5 Therefore, any similarity drawn remains qualitative and usually related to evidence on trade in goods in different papers and countries. Moreover, little attention has been provided to the dynamics aspects of trade. This paper complements the available evidence by analyzing quantitative and dynamic aspects of the comparison between services and goods trade at the firm-level. Furthermore, our results show the importance of the transaction margin in understanding the variation of trade both across firms and over time. Finally, this paper offers new insights for including services into the theoretical literature of international trade. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the data. Section 3 is devoted to the static analysis and comparison of trade in goods and trade in services while in Sect. 4 we consider dynamic aspects. Finally Sect. 5 summarizes our findings and suggests future avenues for research.",35

As import prices are a principal channel through which movements in the euro affect domestic prices and hence also the variability of inflation and output, the issue of pass-through has important implications for variations in price level developments within the monetary union. A common exchange rate shock may impact EA member states differently depending on their respective relative patterns of external exposure and openness to trade outside the euro zone. Thus, in achieving its target of medium-term price stability for the whole EA, the single monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) must factor in the extent to which euro exchange rate changes affect import prices. It is of special significance that the continuous depreciation of the euro (about 20 % on a trade-weighted basis in the first two years) since its introduction has raised concerns that it might increase risks to price stability. The weakening of the exchange rate of the euro is likely to put upward pressure on import costs and producer prices, which can lead to higher consumer prices. The concern about single currency depreciation affecting price stability has been clearly expressed by the monetary authority in the EA. In fact, the ECB cited the inflationary effects of a lower value of the euro as a factor behind its tightening of monetary policy in 2000.Footnote 1 This outcome raised important questions regarding the magnitude and stability of ERPT since 1999, and, mainly, whether EA members will be differentially affected or not by changes in the common external exchange rate. There has been a growing interest in European ERPT in recent years. Studies conducted for the case of EA countries include Hüfner and Schröder (2002), Hahn (2003), Anderton (2003), Campa et al. (2005), Campa and González (2006), and Faruqee (2006).Footnote 2 A common drawback of these studies is the short time span available since the adoption of the euro in 1999. Therefore, in our study, we propose an update to ERPT elasticities using a longer time period and more observations for the post-EA era. Another important issue in the literature is the observed decline in the sensitivity of import prices to exchange rate movements in major industrialized countries. Although the creation of the single currency in the EA constituted a shift in both competition conditions and monetary policy, the European ERPT studies, including Campa et al. (2005) and Campa and González (2006), have failed to provide strong evidence of a reduction in pass-through. In fact, there are several factors which may lead to a change in the behavior of ERPT and thus would explain why the responsiveness of import prices has moved down markedly in the last two decades. An intriguing hypothesis was suggested by Taylor (2000), who explains that the shift towards more credible monetary policy and thus a low-inflation regime would reduce the transmission of exchange rate changes. This assumption is very appealing and has received strong empirical support in the recent literature (see e.g. Gagnon and Ihrig 2004; Bailliu and Fujii 2004; Choudhri and Hakura 2006). Nevertheless, the causes of the decline in pass-through are difficult to pin down with certainty, and there is an ongoing debate in this regard. In their sample of 23 OECD countries, Campa and Goldberg (2005) distinguish “micro-economic” from “macro-economic” explanations. The authors suggest that the product composition of a country’s imports is more important by far than macroeconomic factors such as the inflation environment. That is, the shift in the composition of imports towards goods whose prices are less sensitive to exchange rate movements, such as differentiated manufactured products, is the most important driver of the marked fall in pass-through. Given the variability of the empirical findings, we seek here to shed light on some of these issues by revisiting the euro zone case. The purpose of this paper is to provide new up-to-date estimates of ERPT into import prices for 12 EA countries using quarterly data over the 1990–2012 period. First, we begin by estimating a benchmark ERPT equation and analyzing the main properties of the pass-through elasticities in our sample. This enables us to compare our results with those of the existing empirical literature on the EA, such as Campa et al. (2005), Campa and González (2006). These studies used a few observations only for the monetary union period (post-EA era); hence, their results are updated here. Following this individual estimate exercise, we assess the cross-country differences in our EA sample by investigating whether the inflation level and degree of openness of an economy, as potential macro determinants, determine the magnitude of the pass-through. Next, we verify the stability of the sensitivity of import prices to exchange rate movements over time. There are several reasons to believe that the degree of pass-through has changed since the inception of the euro in 1999. Among these explanations are the reduction of shares of imports exposed to exchange rate fluctuations and the increase of the choice of the euro as a currency of denomination. Unlike Gagnon and Ihrig (2004), we formally investigate for the decline of pass-through using structural break tests and rolling window regression approach.Footnote 3 Finally, we estimate our pass-through equation over different time periods and compare results with those obtained over the benchmark period. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 briefly reviews the literature on ERPT. Section 3 provides some theoretical considerations. Section 4 explains the empirical strategy and data sets used. Section 5 reports estimates of ERPT to import prices, discusses the connection with some macroeconomic variables, and investigates the potential decline in pass-through elasticities. Section 6 offers some concluding remarks.",18

Recent years have been characterized by relatively high levels of price fluctuation in commodity markets, financial crises in a number of major economies and the occurrence of natural disasters in major export hubs. Together, these events have increased policy makers’ concerns about the increased exposure to foreign shocks that increased openness entails. This paper intends to provide insights into the mechanisms through which trade transmits external GDP volatility to the home economy. A better understanding of these mechanisms can help policy makers to contain vulnerability to external shocks, while maintaining markets open. Trade is expected to have a positive effect on growth, but this effect may be attenuated if trade significantly increases income volatility (Ramey and Ramey 1995). Income volatility has, for instance, been shown to be bad for growth in the presence of irreversibilities of or diminishing returns to investment in physical or human capital (e.g. Martin and Rogers 2000). In addition, individuals may demand government intervention to protect them against increased risk, in particular against risk originating abroad. Indeed, Rodrik (1998) has shown that more open economies are characterized by higher government expenditure. Increased government intervention in turn may be associated with deadweight losses (Autor et al. 2013) that reduce the growth effects of trade. Increasing government expenditure may not be an option when governments are budget constrained. In particular developing countries with underdeveloped financial markets and weak administrative systems may find it difficult to attenuate impacts of external shocks once they attain the country. It is therefore attractive to think about options that act preventively (Lee et al. 2008) and that limit exposure to volatility abroad. In order to do this, it is important to understand how volatility abroad is transmitted to the home economy. So far, most of the literature looking at the impact of openness on GDP volatility has assumed that sector-specific shocks (hitting a particular sector) are the dominant source of GDP volatility. A common prediction of this literature is that openness increases GDP volatility, because it induces sectoral specialization. This literature has focused on the role of commodity exports in explaining economic fluctuations in developing countries. Early theoretical work on the theme used Markowitz–Tobin theory of portfolio risk to analyse the role of commodity price volatility (Brainard and Cooper 1968) or the role of export diversification (Love 1979) on export earnings. Love (1979) points out that the correlation among commodity prices is likely to matter in order for export diversification to have the potential to reduce earnings volatility. Empirical work confirms the existence of a positive relationship between export concentration and export earnings volatility (Love 1986). Empirical work has also analysed the relationship between sectoral concentration and income volatility, i.e. GDP volatility. Easterly and Kraay (2000) show empirically that reliance on commodity exports positively affects income volatility. More recently, Koren and Tenreyro (2007) focus on the difference in income volatility between poor and rich countries and estimate that the sectoral composition of the economy (with poor countries specialised in fewer and more volatile sectors) explains roughly 50 % of the differences in volatility. Focussing on country-specific productivity shocks, Caselli et al. (2015) show that openness—insofar as it leads to import diversification—can reduce a country’s exposure to domestic shocks. This is because a country experiencing a negative supply shock (productivity or price shock) can redirect the demand for inputs to countries experiencing positive supply shocks. Whether trade has the potential to ensure against domestic shocks depends on the variance–covariance of shocks across countries. In our paper we explore another dimension through which trade can help to reduce GDP volatility. When external country-specific demand shocks rather than supply shocks are the primary driver of a country’s GDP volatility, a country’s export diversification rather than its import diversification will provide the potential to reduce a country’s GDP volatility. We also explore the role of the variance–covariance of shocks across countries to ensure a country from foreign country-specific shocks. There is some evidence on international business cycles synchronization showing that countries that trade more exhibit higher average correlations in their business cycles than countries that trade less (Frankel and Rose 1998; Clark and van Wincoop 2001; Baxter and Kouparitsas 2005), thus supporting the view that shocks do transmit through exports. Economic models attempting to explain this evidence have shown that fluctuations in one economy transmit more to the other one, if countries are more vertically integrated—that is, when their demand for exports is very interlinked (Burstein et al. 2008; Arkolakis and Ramanarayanan 2009). However, many open questions remain about how volatility in trading partners’ economy affects the income volatility of the exporting country. In particular, the economic literature has largely neglected the question of how the geographical patterns (as opposed to sectoral patterns) of exports affect income volatility through demand effects. Yet, the risks associated with overdependence on individual markets have become very tangible during the recent financial crisis, for instance in countries like Mexico—that depends heavily on the US market—or the Ukraine—that depends heavily on the EU for exports. The relative lack of interest in the role of the geographical spread of exports can maybe be explained by the fact that in traditional trade models, it is assumed that exporters can reallocate exports from one importing country to another instantaneously and without cost. However, recent contributions to the theoretical trade literature (Melitz 2003) emphasize the existence of fixed costs to enter new markets. In the presence of such fixed costs, the re-direction of exports is costly and may take time. It may be necessary, for example, to readapt the production chain to a new standard or to learn about the laws and the distribution network in the new selected destination. Such costs may explain the finding reported in Bernard et al. (2007) that most exporting firms only export to one country. To which countries they export and how much, would in such a context matter for the exposure of exporters to economic volatility abroad. In an extreme case, where exporters cannot reallocate exports from one market to the other, the volatility of aggregate exports (and, therefore, the volatility of GDP caused by changes in export demand) depends on the volatility of demand in individual export markets and on the correlation of this volatility across markets. Based on Vannoorenberghe (2012), individual exporters can be expected to adjust exports to individual markets depending on the business cycle in those markets. In such cases, a Markowitz–Tobin approach to portfolio risk can therefore be applied to evaluate the risk inherent to a countries geographical export portfolio where the variance and the covariance in the quantity of sales would depend equally on the variance and covariance of GDP in partner countries. In the real world, exporters can partially reallocate their exports across markets. Evidence suggests that large firms, accounting for the bulk of global exports, serve multiple markets (Bernard et al. 2007)Footnote 1 and that firms can adjust the allocation of sales across markets depending on external shocks (Vannoorenberghe 2012).Footnote 2 This reallocation is easier the less correlated the business cycles across destination markets are. It follows that the volatility of several destination markets combined may affect firms’ sales differently. If the covariance between partners’ business cycles is low, exporters will actively make use of this to reduce the volatility of their overall exports. In other words, the role of the covariance increases in importance as a determinant of the volatility of overall exports. Overall, as long as reallocation across foreign markets is not perfect, the volatility of the export destination markets and their correlation will both matter for GDP volatility.Footnote 3 Using a portfolio specification to measure a country exposure to external shocks, we expect to find that both trading partners’ idiosyncratic shocks and their correlation matter for GDP volatility, but that the latter has a higher weight as a determinant of domestic GDP volatility. Several empirical studies have found that exporters’ GDP volatility is positively correlated with trade weighted GDP volatility of trading partners (see, for example, Ahmed 2003; Calderon et al. 2005; Bacchetta et al. 2009). Using a panel regression on a sample of 77 countries, Haddad et al. (2012), however, find that geographical diversification—measured by the Herfindahl index and the share of major export markets—does not matter for economic volatility in exporting countries. By separating the variance and the covariance components of volatility, our study contributes to explaining these seemingly incompatible results. Firstly, we find that the correlation between individual country shocks, i.e. the covariance component of volatility, is a key determinant of exporters’ income volatility. Our estimates suggest that reducing the covariance component of trading partners’ portfolio from the 75th percentile of the distribution to the 25th percentile reduces the exporting country income volatility by 1.2 %. We do not find, instead, robust significant results for GDP volatility of individual trading partners, i.e. trading partners’ idiosyncratic shocks. The combination of the two findings is in line with the findings in studies looking at GDP volatility in trading partners (Ahmed 2003; Calderon et al. 2005; Bacchetta et al. 2009), while the finding on the variance component is in line with the findings in Haddad et al. (2012), i.e. a study that does not take into account the covariance component. Secondly, our contribution to the literature is that we carefully address endogeneity. In particular, we address the possibility of endogeneity for omitted variable bias by controlling for global and regional shocks and for unobserved country characteristics. To tackle endogeneity for reverse causality, we test the robustness of our results to two sub-samples: a subsample of small countries and a subsample of middle and low income countries. This is because small and developing economies are less likely to affect the volatility of their trading partner than large developed ones. In addition, we use an IV approach. Our instrument for the covariance component of trading partners GDP volatility is the average geographical distance between the three main trading partners. Besides being exogenous, our instrument is likely to be correlated with the covariance component. This is because business cycles are more likely to be correlated the more interactions countries have among themselves -which in turn is a function of their distance. Thirdly, our analysis covers a larger sample of countries than related literature as we include information on up to 163 countries in our empirical work. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides the stylised facts on countries’ exposure to external shocks. Section 3 describes our methodological approach to analyse the relationship between GDP volatility and a country’s degree of exposure to external shocks as well as the data we used for our analysis. Section 4 discusses the results. Section 5 concludes.",7
152,1,Review of World Economics,27 October 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-015-0237-6,Spillovers from agglomerations and inward FDI: a multilevel analysis on sub-Saharan African firms,February 2016,Marco Sanfilippo,Adnan Seric,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Economic activities tend to be unevenly concentrated across space, this being an underlying feature in the process of economic development of nations (World Bank 2009; Fujita and Thisse 2013). Compared to advanced economies, in fact, developing countries share some features, such as unbalanced government spending, variance in the economic structure and, generally, high transaction costs, that make geographic polarization more likely to occur (Farole 2013). In some circumstances, clustering of economic activities can be viewed as a source of competitive advantage for economic agents, including in particular firms. Since the seminal contribution by Marshall (1920), a large strand of literature has demonstrated the advantages of clustering to local firms due to the existence of different forms of externalities, such as localization and urbanization economies. More recently, attention is being given to the role of large cities as engines of economic growth and as sources of external economies due to their productivity advantages (Combes et al. 2012; Duranton 2015; Gill and Goh 2010), factors that go together with the rising interest in urbanization in developing countries (World Bank 2009). This paper tests the existence of such external economies by analysing the agglomeration-productivity nexus for a large sample of domestic firms based in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Our contribution to the existing literature goes in different directions. First of all, this paper brings new evidence on the relation between agglomeration economies and domestic firms’ performance in the context of less developed countries, which so far have received little attention due to the lack of data. Taking advantage of a new and rich database produced by UNIDO, the African Investor Survey (UNIDO 2012), we can extend the analysis of the agglomeration effects on a rich sample of domestic firms from 19 SSA countries. Second, the richness of the data allows us to expand on the existing literature, which has mainly focussed on the performance of manufacturing firms within agglomerations (Ellison et al. 2010), by including also firms in service sectors, which are very likely to benefit from the spatial concentration of economic activities (Gill and Goh 2010). Third, we are also able to distinguish an additional source of agglomeration economies, i.e. the agglomeration with Multinational Enterprises (MNEs), and therefore to test empirically the extent of their spillover effects on domestic firms. This contributes to the large strand of literature on the externalities from FDI in developing countries (Görg and Greenaway 2004; Crespo and Fontoura 2007). Further to this, we are able to analyse potential differences related to the origin of the foreign investors, i.e. by distinguishing whether there is any difference in agglomerating with Northern or Southern MNEs. Finally, our contribution to the study of the nexus between agglomeration economies and productivity is also methodological. Following recent developments in urban economics and organizational studies (van Oort et al. 2012; Alcacer et al. 2013), we adopt multilevel analysis to better account for firms’ heterogeneity and to model the influence of the context in which firms operate on their performance. Our findings provide empirical support to two major hypotheses. The first is that the context in which firms are embedded, including their geographic area and the sectorial specialization, has an important influence on a firm’s performance. We show that, taken together, such contextual factors can explain up to 30 % of the variance in productivity, more than half of which depends on the geographic location. The second hypothesis is that agglomeration economies can result in a mix of positive and negative externalities to African domestic firms. We find robust evidence that firms’ performance is positively related to the existence of agglomerations, especially those with a larger variety of economic activities. Conversely, we provide evidence of a negative relation for firms located close to their main competitors, especially in more concentrated industries. Such results are confirmed when the analysis is run on firms belonging to the service and to the manufacturing sectors separately. In the case of manufacturing firms, however, we find that positive spillovers from agglomeration are more likely to materialize in presence of linkages (backward and forward) with other firms. We confirm therefore the view that linkages act as mediating factors, in line with what has been recently suggested in the literature (Morrisey 2012). Our results also suggest that agglomeration with foreign companies is generally correlated with domestic firms’ performance. Interestingly, the competitive effects are magnified in the case of agglomeration with Southern MNEs. Given that Southern MNEs are likely to provide goods and services that are more accessible to other developing countries (Lipsey and Sjöholm 2011), this contributes to put them in direct competition with domestic firms producing in the same sector. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on agglomeration economies and their impact on local firms. Section 3 introduces the data, together with some descriptive statistics, and presents the methodology adopted, based on the multilevel analysis.

Host country competition for foreign direct investment through international agreements,February 2016,Eric Neumayer,Peter Nunnenkamp,Martin Roy,Male,Male,Male,Male,"While the fundamental purpose of a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) is to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) flows between country pairs (Bergstrand and Egger 2013), the empirical evidence that BITs are effective is ambiguous.Footnote 1 As noted by Swenson (2005), it is therefore not obvious that developing countriesFootnote 2 sign BITs simply because these treaties help increase the inflow of FDI. Yet, the number of BITs and other international investment agreements (IIAs) continues to grow “even in the absence of conclusive evidence as to the effects of BITs … on FDI flows” (Sachs and Sauvant 2009: LX). Furthermore, it appears that ever more developing host countries are accepting stricter FDI-related provisions in BITs and other IIAs, notably with regard to investor-to-state dispute settlement and pre-establishment national treatment of foreign investors. This seems to have resulted in “an unexpectedly large wave of litigation” (Simmons 2014: 13), implying considerable costs and loss of sovereignty of developing host countries. This raises the question of why IIAs continue to be concluded, and what explains the willingness of developing countries to increasingly agree to strict and binding investment rules at the bilateral and plurilateral level. Another element of this puzzle is that developing countries have so far strongly objected to binding multilateral investment rules (Salacuse 2010). As Milner (2014: 7) points out, research on the investment regime has predominantly drawn on theories of competitive diffusion, power politics, and the rational design of institutions. Our contribution is firmly rooted in the first set of theories. We argue that the mushrooming of IIAs and the acceptance of stricter investment rules at the bilateral and plurilateral, as opposed to multilateral, level are mainly defensive moves of developing host countries being concerned about FDI diversion in favor of competing host countries that became parties to IIAs before. Accordingly, the increase in IIAs is fundamentally driven by a self-reinforcing or contagious process: “Governments could be signing these treaties because, as more countries conclude more and more of these agreements, they could be afraid that investors may avoid investing in countries that have not signed such treaties” (Sachs and Sauvant 2009: LX). Importantly, contagion may also help explain the increasing strictness of provisions in BITs and other IIAs: developing countries are caught in a race to conclude not only more such treaties but increasingly more stringent treaties. The argument that competition for FDI among developing countries is a driver of the diffusion of BITs between developed source countries of FDI and developing host countries of FDI is everything but new (see, for example, Guzman 1997; Elkins et al. 2006; Jandhyala et al. 2011). Our original contribution to this literature is that we refine the theoretical argument and provide a superior empirical test for it. In terms of refining the theoretical argument, based on emerging, though as yet still mixed, evidence that BITs and other IIAs with stringent investment provisions increase FDI inflows more than treaties without such provisions (Berger et al. 2011, 2013; Büthe and Milner 2014), we argue that a developing country is most concerned about other developing countries concluding IIAs with major FDI source countries if these IIAs contain strict investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) or pre-establishment national treatment (NT) provisions because these pose the greatest threat in terms of potential FDI diversion away from the country. As a corollary, spatial dependence in the form of FDI-competition-driven pressure on a developing country to sign more stringent IIAs should therefore stem from the existence and diffusion of such IIAs with equally stringent provisions in other developing countries competing with the developing country for FDI from developed source countries. By contrast, the existence and diffusion of IIAs with less stringent or no provisions should not drive the diffusion of IIAs with more stringent provisions. At the same time, though not at the core of our theoretical argument, we control for potential spatial dependence among FDI source countries, too. These are not subject to the same competitive pressure amongst themselves that FDI host countries are. However, since net FDI exporters are always interested in more stringent provisions, their incentive to pressure a host country into providing such provisions for one’s own investors increases if the host is an important location of the source country’s FDI and if it has previously been willing to grant such provisions to other FDI source countries. Having provided stricter provisions to a larger number of other FDI source countries makes it harder to defend a host country’s resistance to extend such provisions to this FDI source country, too. Empirically, we are the first to employ existing bilateral FDI stocks as the most directly relevant measure of what is at stake in terms of potential FDI diversion as weights in the construction of the spatial lags that capture competition among developing countries. Existing FDI stocks track closely the theoretical argument of FDI-competition-driven spatial dependence among developing countries as a major driver of their willingness to sign IIAs and sign increasingly stringent IIAs. Based on estimations from a global sample of 21 developed source countries and 87 developing host countries over the period 1978–2004, we show that the increase in IIAs with stricter provisions on ISDS and pre-establishment NT is a contagious process among FDI host countries. Importantly, however, contagion of IIAs with weak investment provisions exclusively derives from weak IIAs of FDI-competing host countries, while contagion of IIAs with strong provisions stems solely from strong IIAs of competing host countries. Our stringent and conservative research design shields the estimations from finding spurious evidence for competitive diffusion dynamics. At the same time, it renders it harder to find statistically significant evidence for competing theoretical perspectives. We stress that our findings should be interpreted as buttressing competitive diffusion as an important driver of the international investment regime, not as implying that power politics (e.g., Allee and Peinhardt 2014) or efficient institutional design (e.g., Koremenos 2007) cannot additionally play a complementary role. After reviewing the extant literature in Sect. 2, we put forward our theoretical argument that results in three testable hypotheses in Sect. 3. Section 4 describes our research design. We report results from our main estimations in Sect. 5, from robustness tests in Sect. 6, and conclude in Sect. 7.",16
152,1,Review of World Economics,24 October 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-015-0235-8,A survey of empirical studies using transaction level data on exports and imports,February 2016,Joachim Wagner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"When economists discovered that trade is performed by firms, and not by countries or industries, following the pioneering empirical paper by Bernard and Jensen (1995) for the United States, hundreds of studies looked at firm level data from many different countries to investigate “Who trades?” and the closely related question “Who trades how much?”. The focus of the early papers in this literature has been on “Who exports? What distinguishes exporters and non-exporters? How are exports linked to firm performance?” with a special view on the links between exports and productivity [see Wagner (2007) for a survey]. Later the scope of studies on trade that use firm-level data widened to ask “Who imports? What distinguishes importers and non-importers? How are imports linked to firm performance?”, and the links between trade and other dimensions of firm performance besides productivity (including profitability, wages, and firm survival) were investigated [see Wagner (2012b) for a survey]. In this literature a typical data set used is based on either census-type data collected regularly by official statistics or on large comprehensive surveys of firms from other sources. We learned a lot from these empirical studies, and this literature inspired a new branch of theory named the “new new trade theory” with a focus on international activities of heterogeneous firms that was pioneered by Melitz (2003); see Melitz and Redding (2014) for a survey. A new generation of empirical studies on foreign trade goes one step further by asking not only “Who trades how much?” but “Who trades how much of which goods (or services) with whom?” The data used in these studies are based on records of (legal) cross-border transaction regularly collected by the customs. The unit of observation in these data is a single transaction between economic agents located in two countries, e.g. the export of 15.234 tons of good A with a value of 124,756 euro from Germany to China. The record of the transaction usually includes a firm identifier (tax registration number) of the exporting (or importing) firm. Using this identifier information at the transaction level can be aggregated at the level of the trading firm to generate period-firm-product-value-weight-destination (or-origin) data. These data show who trades how much of which good with customers (or suppliers) from which country in a given period (a year, or a month). Products are distinguished according to very detailed classifications, and the recording of value and weight allows the easy calculation of unit values that act as proxy variables for prices or indicators of quality. These transaction data can be linked over time to form panel data. Furthermore, the data can be linked to firm level data that has information on firm characteristics that is not included in the customs data, e.g. balance sheet data and data from regular surveys of the statistical offices. Compared with the census-type data used in the earlier literature these transaction-level-based data allow the researcher to look not only at one extensive margin of trade (participation in exporting, or importing), but at two more extensive margins, the number of goods traded and the number of countries traded with. These margins, and their links with characteristics of the firm and dimensions of firm performance, are investigated in a new and rapidly emerging literature that is surveyed in this paper. Findings of empirical studies are summarized under seven topics that cover the role of “superstars” in trade; the average number of goods traded and countries traded with; the dynamics of trade in the short run; new insights on the links between firm characteristics and the extensive margins of trade; quality of traded goods and the number of goods and partner countries; evidence on hitherto undocumented types of foreign trade activities; and econometric tests of implications of models of multi-product, multi-destination exporters. I hope this survey is useful for readers who want to get an impression of the huge number of different topics that have been investigated with transaction level data for a large number of countries already; who want to learn whether transaction level data have already been used for a particular (maybe, their own) country, by whom they have been used to investigate which topics, and what the important results found are; who have access to transaction level data and an idea how to use them, and who want to find out whether others pursued the same or a similar topic already; who want to compare results from their own study based on transaction level data to results from other (similar, neighbor) countries and who are looking for suitable studies; who have access to transaction level data and who are looking for studies based on data from other countries that they can replicate with their data to uncover and investigate differences across countries, or to contribute to the unravelling of stylized facts that hold across countries (and time). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a tabular synopsis of empirical studies by country, topic, and important findings. Section 3 comments on the lessons we learned from this new literature so far. Section 4 concludes with suggestions for future research.",47
152,2,Review of World Economics,28 January 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-015-0242-9,"Non-tariff measures, preferential trade agreements, and prices: new evidence",May 2016,Olivier Cadot,Julien Gourdon,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since Trefler’s “mystery of the Missing Trade” (Trefler 1995), a number of studies have investigated why world trade is not as large as economic models predict. Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) suggested that large unobserved trade costs might explain most of the discrepancy between model estimates and trade statistics, a conjecture confirmed by Anderson and Van Wincoop (2004) who showed that the costs associated with cross-border trade even between well-integrated countries were well above those that could be explained by geographic distance and traditional trade policies. Since then, work attempting to capture and quantify the impact of hidden trade costs has focused on trade-facilitation issues (Maskus et al. 2005; Djankov et al. 2010; Hoekman and Nicita 2011) and non-tariff measures (NTMs; Feenstra 1984; Deardorff and Stern 1997; Baldwin 1989; Leamer 1990; Anderson and Neary 1994; Kee et al. 2009; Disdier et al. 2015; Carrère and de Melo 2011; Cadot and Gourdon 2014). This paper revisits the effect of NTMs on trade by estimating how they affect the price of imported goods. In doing this, we are agnostic as to whether price rises reflect compliance costs, demand increases due to quality signaling, or any combination of the two. This is important because NTMs have changed in nature over time. For many years, the term “NTMs” designated measures that consisted largely of quantitative restrictions (QR) in the form of quotas, voluntary export restraints and non-automatic licensing. Such measures unambiguously lowered import volumes while having ambiguous effects on trade unit values, depending on the mode of distribution of import licenses (if licenses were sold to exporters, their value would be embodied in trade unit values; if they were given free of charge or sold to domestic importers, trade unit values would be unaffected under a small-country assumption and only domestic wholesale prices would be affected). However, over the last two decades, these measures have largely been phased out. By contrast, technical and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) regulations have proliferated. Focusing on measures that were the object of concerns at the WTO, (Fontagné et al. 2015) show, on the basis of firm-level evidence, that such measures entail compliance costs, raising unit values and inhibiting entry. Interestingly, they show that these effects are not neutral on the distribution of firms, as smaller ones seem to react more strongly. However, SPS measures can also signal quality and improve access to the supply chains of large retailers for imported products; they can also be instrumental in overcoming market failures (see Beghin et al. 2015 for a theoretical and empirical exploration; see Maur and Shepherd 2011 on product standards). Thus, their effects are quite different from those of QRs and can be understood only in a differentiated-products framework. While they unambiguously raise trade unit values (either through compliance costs or through quality signaling/upgrading), their effect on volume and overall value is indeterminate, depending on the relative shifts of the supply and demand curves and on their respective elasticities. While our approach differs from most of the existing literature (except Beghin et al. 2012) in that it does not assume that NTMs reduce trade, our use of prices instead of volumes or values to measure the impact of NTMs is not new. Price-based approaches consist of estimating the ad-valorem equivalent (AVE) of an NTM by comparing directly the price of products in the NTM’s presence with that of similar products on markets without it. It can be applied by simple comparison of averages on a case-by-case basis after correction for transport costs and other observables (see Ferrantino 2006 for examples), or econometrically, as in Andriamanjara et al. (2004). There are several well-known issues with the price-gap approach, discussed in Ferrantino (2006). One key issue is the availability and comparability of price data. Our approach takes advantage of two recent databases that have not yet been used to estimate the effect of NTMs. For trade unit values, we use the database of the Centre d’Etudes Prospectives et d’Informations Internationales (CEPII) which contains unit values (in US dollars per ton) over 2000–2008 for 173 reporters, 255 partners, and over 5000 six-digit product categories. The unit values are provided in Harmonized System 1996 and 2002 revisions, both free on board (FOB) and including cost of insurance and freight (CIF). The CIF unit values rely on importers’ declarations, and include all trade costs except tariffs and domestic taxes after the border. The data is based on comtrade unit values but has undergone a number of consistency checks to reduce the incidence of aberrant and arbitrary values (Berthou and Emlinger 2011). As for NTMs, over the last 2 years, a major effort has been undertaken to replenish the UNCTAD trade analysis information system (TRAINS) database. The effort, which has led to the collection of data in 65 countries with broader coverage of measures than in TRAINS under a common, consistent nomenclature, is underway. The data is based on double-entry coding of regulatory measures, by type of measure (following a new, detailed nomenclature) and by product (following the HS classification at six digits). However, there is only 1 year of data collection so there is no variation in the time dimension, as would be typically the case for a border-effect approach. From TRAINS, CEPII has built the NTM-Map database which contains indicators measuring the incidence of NTMs and we construct dummies capturing the presence of different types of NTMs at the country product level. The present paper is the first attempt to use this data. Combining the two datasets (NTMs from TRAINS and unit values from CEPII), we construct a product-origin–destination panel of 2.311.774 observations. Beyond direct price effects, we explore how regional trade agreements (RTAs) affect the impact of NTMs on prices. Many RTAs encourage their members to coordinate technical and SPS regulations through a variety of approaches that include, inter alia, harmonization or mutual recognition (RTAs may also involve technical consultations between members prior to the issuance of new regulations). Harmonization and mutual recognition can also take place on conformity-assessment procedures, in which case measures can differ but compliance verification can be performed in the exporting country, reducing compliance costs.Footnote 1
 Until recently, the literature on technical regulations and standards paid little attention to how they interact with RTAs (see Bourgeois et al. 2007), focusing instead on their direct effects (see e.g. Czubala et al. 2009; Moenius 2004; Henry de Frahan and Vancauteren 2006). Exceptions include (Chen and Mattoo 2008), who showed that mutual recognition and, to a lesser extent, harmonization raised intra-regional trade between industrial countries. As for North–South trade, the detrimental effect of the North–South “standards divide” on Southern exports was discussed in Otsuki et al. (2001) and Wilson and Abiola (2003). Disdier et al. (2015) showed that premature harmonization on stiff Northern standards in North–South RTAs with harmonization clauses could “price out” the Southern partner from third markets in the South, while failing to improve market access within the bloc. By contrast, (Maertens and Swinnen 2009) documented on the basis of an example from Senegalese agriculture how compliance with Northern standards in an RTA could confer benefits to the Southern partner’s exporters by raising the quality of exported products, encouraging improved management and production processes, and signaling better quality. Lejarraga and Shepherd (2013) find that RTAs with deeper mechanisms for enhancing transparency appear to be more strongly trade-promoting than those with shallower commitments on transparency. Specifically, in their study each additional transparency commitment negotiated in an RTA is associated with an increase in bilateral trade flows of more than 1 %. Thus, the combined effect of regulations and harmonization/mutual recognition is an empirical question. This paper explores whether RTAs with NTM harmonization clauses reduce the price-raising effect of NTMs based on Piermartini and Budetta’s classification of 70 RTAs (Piermartini and Budetta 2009). Empirically, we use two distinct approaches. First, we run within-product regressions with destination and product fixed effects on the whole dataset. Then, we run product-by-product regressions as in Kee et al. (2009). We find substantial price-raising effects. We also find that RTAs with provisions related to standards (harmonization or mutual recognition) dampen the price-raising effect of NTMs, suggesting, indirectly, that some of the price-raising effect is due to compliance costs that harmonization and mutual recognition reduce. Mutual recognition of conformity assessment, the easiest step toward coordination of standard-related measures, seems to have the strongest dampening effect. One reason for this may be that, in the absence of such recognition, exporters must obtain foreign certification from accredited private laboratories charging high fees. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and some stylized facts. Section 3 discusses estimation issues and results for AVE estimations, Sect. 4 shows effects of different integration approach on those AVEs and Sect. 5 concludes.",48

152,2,Review of World Economics,03 March 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-016-0249-x,Are workers more vulnerable in tradable industries?,May 2016,Kent Eliasson,Pär Hansson,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Manufacturing has for a long time been looked upon as a sector exposed to international trade and international trade in merchandise is considerable. In recent years, growing international trade in services, due among other things to falling costs of information and communication, is a salient feature. Some researchers, e.g. Blinder (2006), have argued that this might have painful consequences for a growing number of displaced workers in the service sector owing to the increased internationalization of services. One of the key questions in this paper is therefore to compare the displacement costs of workers in tradable services, manufacturing and, since large parts of the service sector are and will continue to be non-tradable, non-tradable services. A substantial body of literature on the costs of job displacement has emerged over the last 25 years.Footnote 1 Ruhm (1991), Jacobson et al. (1993), Stevens (1997), Kletzer and Fairlie (2003), Couch and Placzek (2010), and Davis and von Wachter (2011) are examples of influential studies focusing on the United States. The literature for European countries is sparser. Important exceptions are Eliason and Storrie (2010), Hijzen et al. (2010), and Huttunen et al. (2011) who, in turn, focus on Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway. The empirical evidence suggests substantial, often long-lasting, negative effects of displacement in terms of, for example wage and earnings losses and joblessness. The costs of job loss in manufacturing industries are particularly well studied, but some of the papers above also focus on displacement in the service sector. To our knowledge, there is no previous paper that, within a regression type framework, explicitly compares the costs of displacement in tradable and non-tradable sectors of the economy. While data on international trade in merchandise is highly disaggregated, data on trade in services is not very detailed.Footnote 2 This makes it hard to identify industries in the service sector that are exposed to international trade. To classify industries into tradable and non-tradable we make use of an approach developed by Jensen and Kletzer (2006). The basic idea here is that the degree of geographical concentration of industries tells us whether the activities within an industry can be expected to be traded domestically and at least potentially to be traded internationally. Regionally concentrated industries are presumed to be tradable because the production in an industry is then localized to particular regions, whereas the consumption of the industry’s output is spread out along with the distribution of incomes over the country. In our analysis we measure regional concentration of all industries in the Swedish economy by calculating locational Ginis. We assume that all industries in manufacturing are tradable and the size of the locational Ginis in manufacturing is used as a benchmark to determine whether industries in the service sector are tradable or not. When we divide the industries in the Swedish economy into tradable and non-tradable services and manufacturing we observe that over the past 20 years the employment share of non-tradable services has been close to constant, whereas the share of tradable services has grown and the share of manufacturing has declined. Actually, the way we measure tradable service the employment there has increased from being less than in manufacturing in the beginning of the studied period to being larger than in manufacturing in the end of the studied period. These shifts within the tradable sector are consistent with that service export in recent years has become more important in Sweden.Footnote 3 A notable difference between tradable service and manufacturing, shown in the paper, is that tradable service is considerably more skill intensive and the heavy reduction in employment in manufacturing is driven by fewer less-skilled workers employed. We use administrative data to identify job displacements. Job displacements are defined as job separations from an establishment that from one year to the next ceased to operate or experienced a large reduction in employment. We estimate the probability of displacement and the probability of re-employment following displacement in Sweden over the period from 2000 to 2009 and compare the probabilities in tradable services, manufacturing and non-tradable services controlling for other factors (individual, establishment and regional) that might affect displacement and re-employment. By using administrative data we have the opportunity to follow displaced individuals before and after displacement and then contrast their development with non-displaced individuals. The most common approach to estimate earnings losses of displacement in this setting was until recently to follow Jacobson et al. (1993) and use some type of fixed-effects model. In this paper, we instead draw on Couch and Placzek (2010) and use conditional difference-in-differences matching as our main estimation strategy and compare the results from matching with those obtained using a standard fixed-effects model. The main contribution of our paper is that we examine in which of the sectors tradable services, manufacturing or non-tradable services the earnings losses after displacement are largest. We also make an attempt to determine whether observed earnings losses mainly are due to lower wages in post-displacement jobs or primarily the result of periods of non-employment following displacement. Previous closely related studies, Jensen and Kletzer (2006, 2008), are based on the Displaced Worker Survey (DWS). The DWS is a survey of a cross-section of individuals who have been involuntary displaced during a preceding three-year period and that is nationally representative of the United States. Jensen and Kletzer (2006) report the incidence, scope and characteristics of job displacement in manufacturing, tradable non-manufacturing and not tradable non-manufacturing from 2001 to 2003, while their 2008 paper is an update for 2003–2005. Jensen and Kletzer present their results as summary statistics for the different sectors, i.e. their analysis is not carried out, as in the present study, within a regression framework. This is important because, as will stand out clearly in the paper, there are considerable variations among the studied sectors in the characteristics of workers, establishments and locations. Another advantage with our study is that we can follow displaced workers for several years before and after displacement as well as compare their development with non-displaced individuals. In the paper we relate our findings for Sweden to Jensen and Kletzer’s results for the United States. Two recent related studies, Autor et al. (2014) and Hummels et al. (2014), use detailed data on individual level to analyze the effect of increased goods import on earnings and employment in manufacturing industries. Autor et al. (2014) examine how exposure of import competition from China has affected the earnings and employment of US workers in manufacturing from 1992 to 2007. They find that there are significant worker-level adjustments to import shocks, e.g. in terms of lower cumulative earnings, and that the shocks had hit workers unevenly; for instance, individuals with low initial wage levels are more severely affected. The other study by Hummels et al. (2014) is based on matched Danish worker-firm data between 1995 and 2006 and they examine the effects on wages of offshoring, i.e. increased imports on firm level of products similar to the goods sold by the firm. Hummels et al. (2014) obtain comparable results from offshoring to that Autor et al. (2014) get from the surge of imports from China, i.e. low-skilled (low-wage) workers are harder hit. A similarity between the two studies is that they carry out analyses on cohorts of workers employed in firms (industries) prior to an offshoring shock (China’s emergence on the world market) and track cohort members over time. The cohort approach includes all individuals in a firm (industry) that are affected by a globalization shock and not just the displaced and consequently does not condition on job separation. By that it is possible to avoid selection problems due to that displaced individuals most likely are not randomly selected.Footnote 4 An advantage is thus that it captures not just earnings losses associated with job loss but also other types of adjustment costs. That could be changes in earnings at the initial employer or changes in earnings associated with moving between employers or industries. Another advantage with the studies by Hummels et al. (2014) and Autor et al. (2014) is that they take into account heterogeneities between firms within industries or between industries within sectors; shocks from the increased globalization, in terms of increased offshoring, import competition and exports, hit firms within an industry (in various industries) differently. However, for our purposes a cohort approach is not useful because it has to be connected with a trade shock that can be measured using trade data. In contrast to the two studies above focusing on manufacturing and the effects of international trade in goods our aim is to analyze the impact of exposure to international trade in services, as well as to international trade in goods. Estimating how changes in import intensities on industry- or firm-level affects earnings and employment, as in the studies above, is due to lack of data on international trade in services on disaggregated level not a worthwhile strategy. Notice also that instead of a cohort-based analysis we examine displacement costs and not only in manufacturing but also in tradable and non-tradable services. Accordingly, a contribution of our study is that we are able to say something about displacement costs in a sector of growing importance that most other similar studies are silent about, namely tradable services. The division into three sectors is admittedly crude, yet we find significant differences in displacement costs among them, and moreover, the reasons behind the displacement costs appear to vary between the sectors. Reasonably, trade exposure increases job churning and the cost of displacement (unemployment and lower wages) is higher in a contracting sector (manufacturing) than in an expanding (tradable services). To preview the results in the paper, our findings are that the probability of displacement is higher in sectors exposed to international trade. However, the prospects for re-employment seem to be brighter for displaced workers in tradable services than in manufacturing. In line with this we also find that the income losses are largest for displaced workers in manufacturing. However, it seems that while the main reason behind the earnings losses of those displaced in manufacturing is difficulties to find new jobs after displacement, lower wages in the new positions than in pre-displacement positions is a factor of greater importance for the earnings losses of those displaced in tradable services. The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 defines important concepts, describes the data sample, and provides some descriptive statistics. In Sect. 3, we study displacement risks and re-employment opportunities. Section 4 contains the econometric analysis of the effects of displacement on earnings. Finally, Sect. 5 summarizes and concludes.",2

Developing countries discover new activities through risky investments and they maintain them when they are profitable (Acemoglu and Zilibotti 1997; Hausmann and Rodrik 2003). Advanced economies diversify through innovation and the creation of new products (Grossman and Helpman 1991, 1993). While not all research efforts lead to profitable inventions, the average arrival rate of breakthroughs is assumed to be constant (e.g. Eaton and Kortum 1999). Surprisingly, empirical studies have revealed a different pattern. For both domestic production and employment, as well as for exports, they claim to identify a non-monotone relationship (Imbs and Wacziarg 2003; Cadot et al. 2011). This relationship is characterized by initial diversification and subsequent re-specialization at high levels of real GDP per capita. Except for some special cases, conventional theories provide no rationalization for such a pattern. Also, the policy implications of a “hump-shaped” diversification path appear to be against the typical free-trade arguments set out by economists (Rodrik 2007). Indeed, some authors question the robustness of this pattern and argue that countries continue to diversify (De Benedictis et al. 2009; Parteka 2010). Abstaining from theoretical guidance, however, the debate focusses mostly on empirical methodology and relies on non-parametric analytical tools. Utilization of a wide range of measures, estimation techniques, and levels of disaggregation in the data makes the individual contributions difficult to compare. The present paper revisits the case of re-specialization starting out from theoretical considerations. In doing so, it contributes to answering a number of open questions. The first question asks whether it is possible to predict alternative diversification patterns. Some studies investigate diversification among 30 sectors or less. Others look at several thousands of different product categories. It is possible that they document different processes of economic development. The second question addresses the derivation of general predictions that feed into a parametric specification. While most studies focus solely on the two variables diversification and GDP per capita, recent evidence suggests that country size and geography are important co-variates (Agosin et al. 2012; Parteka and Tamberi 2013a). These findings can be integrated and analyzed with modern theories of international trade. Finally, the paper addresses the question of causality between export diversification and economic development. This question has remained untouched in previous contributions where GDP per capita is used to explain diversification. However, per capita income is the dependent variable in standard growth and development theories. One could argue that diversification increases the level of GDP per capita by triggering sectorial change, or that no causal link exists at all. In addressing the first question the paper considers the distinction between the “intensive” and the “extensive” product margin. This turns out to be crucial, since either margin leads to a different prediction. The paper shows that a hump-shaped diversification path is a natural outcome in the standard Heckscher–Ohlin (HO) framework. However, it holds only for the intensive margin; i.e., when the range and type of goods is unchanged and relative output and factor allocations vary. Moreover, it requires that all countries reside in the same cone of diversification. At the extensive margin, where the range and types of goods vary, the paper argues that countries continue to diversify as they reside in different cones of diversification.Footnote 1 These results carry over to the consideration of a more realistic model which relaxes the symmetry assumptions of classical trade models. The paper builds on the framework of Eaton and Kortum (2002, henceforth: EK) and shows that it yields a gravity equation for export diversification at the extensive margin. Moreover, it implies that diversification should be measured as the fraction of tradable goods a country actually exports. The EK model predicts that after controlling for factor costs and geography, a country with a higher state of technology exports a wider range of goods. In the empirical application, the paper relies on disaggregated trade data. The baseline dataset distinguishes 4254 manufacturing products and encompasses 110 countries over the years 1998–2009 in a perfectly balanced panel. Because many countries export almost all of these goods in every year, censored samples, alternative data sources, and different benchmarks for counting a good are applied. The baseline estimates, and results based on alternative data sources, confirm the prediction that countries continue to diversify their exports. There is a robust and positive correlation between diversification and the level of GDP per capita, and the case of re-specialization is rejected. Inference of causality provides suggestive evidence that income levels affect the level of export diversification, whereas dynamic panel estimates (system GMM) indicate that causality goes into both directions. Exploiting exogenous variation in countries’ growth performance and interacting with information on the European integration process, provides support for the hypothesis that diversification improves living standards, while the reverse effect materializes with a delay. This suggests that the main driving factor of diversification is a country’s state of technology or, in the case of exports, a dismantlement of trade barriers. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the existing empirical research and illustrates the conceptual problems of approaching the relationship between diversification and economic development. Section 3 discusses the possibilities of alternative diversification paths within classical trade theory. Section 4 presents a modern framework and derives the empirical specifications. Section 5 presents measures, data, and the empirical results. Section 6 concludes.",26

P. Magee,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"On December 31, 1995, a customs union (originally called for in the 1963 Ankara Association Agreement) entered into force between the European Community (EC) and Turkey. As the World Bank (2014) points out, this was the first functioning customs union between the EU and a non-member state. Turkey experienced an initial surge in imports from the EC, which rose from 47.8 % of Turkey’s imports in 1995 to 54.8 % of its imports in 1999. After 1999, however, imports from non-EC countries into Turkey grew at a much faster rate, so the EC share of Turkey’s imports fell to 43.1 % by 2010. The share of Turkey’s exports to the EC also fell over this time period, going from 56 % in 2000 to 47 % in 2011 (Gros et al. 2013). This paper examines the impact of this trade agreement on Turkey’s imports, and it does so in several innovative ways. First, the paper uses trade flows at the industry level to measure the customs union’s impact. While there are a few exceptions such as Clausing (2001) and Romalis (2007), the vast majority of papers estimating the trade effects of regional trade agreements (RTAs) use aggregate trade flows. The empirical strategy employed in this paper is to use detailed information on tariffs and on tariff preferences to estimate how the EC-Turkey customs union affected Turkey’s imports. There are a number of advantages to using trade data at the industry level rather than aggregate trade flows. Industry-level trade data allow this paper to exploit variation in tariff rates and in tariff preferences between RTA and non-RTA trading partners to estimate the impact of the trade agreement directly. In most gravity model specifications, increases in intra-bloc trade and declines in extra-bloc trade are attributed to the regional trade agreement but there is no direct link between a policy change due to the RTA and a change in imports. This paper explores such a direct link by estimating how imports change as bilateral tariff rates are adjusted. A second innovation is the use of importer-year and exporter-year fixed effects. A number of papers studying RTAs include such fixed effects in their estimation, but in doing so they are unable to separate out how much intra-RTA trade has risen because it displaces domestic production, what Viner (1950) called trade creation, and how much intra-RTA trade has risen because it displaces imports from countries outside the regional trading bloc, what Viner called trade diversion. Using industry-level trade flows and tariff rates allows this paper to estimate trade creation and trade diversion while controlling for importer-year and exporter-year fixed effects. That is extremely rare.Footnote 1
 A final innovation of the paper is to present the first estimation separating out the effects of an RTA’s tariff changes from the more general impacts of the regional agreement on the trading environment. The customs union between Turkey and the European Community is an important one to study in part because it provides an example of a country entering into a regional trading agreement with partners who are both nearby and much larger as a group. For most agreements, the unobserved factors affecting a country’s imports tend to overwhelm the impacts of any trade deals the country signs. For the EC-Turkey customs union, however, the effects of the agreement on Turkey’s trade flows should be relatively large and thus they can be distinguished from the other factors that affect Turkey’s imports. Turkey has also been involved for many years in negotiations over accession into the European Union. Because of this possibility, understanding the effects of the intermediate steps taken in that accession process is important for policy makers going forward. The next section of the paper briefly reviews the literature on RTAs and discusses research estimating the effects of the EC-Turkey customs union. Section 3 describes the empirical model used in this paper, and Sect. 4 shows the results of estimating this model. The final section concludes and discusses the policy implications of the results.",16

152,3,Review of World Economics,25 April 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-016-0252-2,Interest rate spreads in the eurozone: Fundamentals or sentiments?,August 2016,Maximilian Gödl,Jörn Kleinert,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008, interest rates on government bonds began to diverge dramatically within the eurozone after they had been converging in the decade before. While some governments (like the German government) are now able to borrow at record low interest rates, governments from other countries (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) experienced a sharp and sudden increase in their borrowing costs bringing them to (and, in the case of Greece, beyond) the brink of default. The eurozone governments together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) responded to this crisis with extensive loans to the troubled governments conditional on a set of fiscal and structural reforms.Footnote 1 The primary goal of these reforms is to rebuild the confidence of creditors in the solvency of the governments by reducing the public debt relative to GDP and to enhance the overall productive potential of the economy. This policy rests on the proposition that the crisis was caused by a deterioration in the fundamental determinants of public sector solvency and that it can be solved only by improving these fundamentals. However, this proposition is cast into doubt by two observations: (1) some of the crisis countries did not feature “bad fundamentals” prior to 2008. Ireland and Spain, in particular, had debt-to-GDP ratios below the eurozone average and were even running primary budget surpluses before 2009. (2) Some countries outside the monetary union that had equally bad fundamentals did not experience a debt crisis. The United Kingdom as well as the United States both have debt levels comparable to the eurozone crisis countries and yet continue to borrow at much lower interest rates. The last point has been made most forcefully by De Grauwe (2012), who argues that the eurozone debt crisis was caused by a self-fulfilling shift in investor sentiments resulting in a run on eurozone government debt. Such a run, De Grauwe argues, is more likely to occur in a monetary union, in which governments cannot rely on their national central banks to act as lenders of last resort. Corsetti and Dedola (2013) underpinned this point by a more rigorous model analysis. Recent work by De Grauwe and Ji (2013) has sought to verify this alternative explanation of the eurozone debt crisis empirically. More generally, the above observations raise the question whether and to what extent government bond yields are driven by fundamentals as opposed to market sentiments. Before answering this question, one first needs to clarify what the fundamental determinants of government solvency are. In the existing empirical studies on the determinants of government bond yields, it is customary to explain the yield spreads by measures of public sector solvency like the debt-to-GDP ratio, as well as measures of ’macroeconomic vulnerability’ such as the current account balance or the size of the banking sector. The choice of explanatory variables is usually not derived from an explicit theoretical model. This paper starts from the well-known intertemporal budget constraint of the government to single out those variables that determine government yield spreads. Using the insights from this theoretical discussion we study the determinants of (long-term) government bond yields of European countries. The existing literature on the issue has relied mainly on panel regression frameworks with low frequency (usually quarterly) data. However, this approach has a number of econometric problems which we discuss in the paper. Most importantly, we doubt that the effects of the explanatory variables of the countries analyzed are homogenous enough to be studied in a panel framework. We therefore employ a random coefficients model using quarterly data for 17 European countries, which allows us to test whether the poolability assumption underlying the panel approach is warranted for our sample. In a second step we look at high-frequency (daily) data to shed more light on the determinants of government borrowing costs. However, the use of daily interest rate data makes a regression approach infeasible, because the required explanatory variables are not observed at this frequency. Hence we rely on event study techniques to investigate what kind of economic and financial market news have a significant impact on government interest rates. We focus on three categories of news, which we interpret as news about underlying fundamentals of public sector solvency: official macroeconomic forecasts, the announcement of intra-governmental fiscal assistance measures and the announcements of fiscal reforms (“austerity packages”). In so far as these news events contain new information on fundamentals for investors, we expect them to change interest rates significantly. A lack of reaction to news thus suggests that interest rates are indeed unrelated to fundamentals. The remainder of the paper is in four sections. The next section looks at the intertemporal budget constraint of the government to derive the fundamentals of government bond yields which we use in our empirical investigation. Section 3 reports and discusses the results of our random coefficient estimation. In Sect. 4, we turn to daily data and conduct the event study. The final section summarizes the main results of the paper.",10
152,3,Review of World Economics,20 April 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-016-0253-1,Do regional trade agreements really boost trade? Evidence from agricultural products,August 2016,Sébastien Jean,Jean-Christophe Bureau,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Gravity models are the most common approach used to measure the impacts of a trade agreement. The basic form of the gravity model is \( X_{ijt} = G_{t} S_{it} M_{jt} \phi_{ijt} \), where the indices i, j and t denote respectively the exporting country, the importing country, and the year, X denotes the value of the trade flow, G is a time-specific constant, S is a variable linked to the exporter’s attributes, and M is a variable linked to the importer’s attributes, and the influence of the determinants of trade specific to each country pair is represented by ϕ. Unit-by-unit division of the basic models for the two exporting countries i and i’ and for a given product k, yields: \( R_{{ii^{\prime } jkt }} = X_{ijkt} /X_{{i^{\prime } jkt}} = \left( {S_{ikt} \phi_{ijkt} } \right)/\left( {S_{{i^{\prime } kt}} \phi_{{i^{{\prime }} jkt}} } \right) \), where R is the ratio of country j’s imports of k from suppliers i and i’. This formulation allows the general term and the importer-specific term to be eliminated. If we let exporter-specific attributes be invariant (or vary at the same relative rate regardless of the sector), this equation allows identification of the evolution over time of the determinants of the bilateral intensity of trade ϕ, provided the bilateral determinants of trade are constant in the case of partner i’. Exporters’ attributes which change over time, can be controlled for by examining the relative volume of imports from suppliers i and i’ on markets j and j’: Since this measure is obtained by dividing unit-by-unit the above-mentioned ratios for market j and j’, we call it a ratio of ratios, or ROR. The ROR depend purely on bilateral trade determinants. Clarifying how these determinants relate to tariffs requires more specific information on demand. A standard assumption consistent with the general equations presented above, is that the elasticity of substitution between imports from different origins is constant. In other words, the bundle of imports for a given product can be represented within consumer preferences through a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function over imports with different origins. In practice, country j’s consumption sub-index specific to good k imports at period t can be written as: where q

ijkt
 refers to the quantity of good k originating in country i consumed in country j at year t, t
0 is the reference year, and σ > 0 is the elasticity of substitution between varieties of good k. Given the calibrated share form used, \( \theta_{ijk} = \frac{{p_{{ijkt_{0} }} q_{{ijkt_{0} }} }}{{\mathop \sum \nolimits_{l \ne j} p_{{ljkt_{0} }} q_{{ljkt_{0} }} }} \), where p

ijkt
 refers to the tax-inclusive price of country j imports of products k from country i at year t. Thus, θ

i
 is the value share of supplier i in country j imports of good k at year t
0. The corresponding dual price index is: Import demand in (tax-inclusive) value can be expressed as (4). Assuming mill pricing, and assuming that bilateral transport costs (as well as regulations that might impact on prices) do not change over time, tariffs are the only source of change in prices, hence (5) holds: where, as before, X refers to tax-exclusive import values. τ

ijkt
 − 1 is the ad valorem customs duty applied by country j to imports of good k from supplier i at time t. It should be noted that the same equation would have been obtained, had CES (constant elasticity of substitution) preferences been defined for a basket that included domestic consumption of good k, in addition to imports. This equation clarifies the link between applied tariffs and bilateral determinants of trade flows. The ROR defined in (1) becomes: Now, let the indices i and j represent two signatory partners to a bilateral trade agreement. Also, let j’ denote a control market, defined for each importer [for the sake of brevity j′ = J(i) is referred to as J in what follows] as a representative set of countries whose trade policy regarding country i has not changed during the period under study \( \left[ {\tau_{iJkt} = \tau_{{iJkt_{0} }} } \right] \).Footnote 3 Finally, let i’ be the exporter control group [i′ = I(j), henceforth I] consisting of trading partners, such that the trade policy of both country j and the control market J toward this group I remains unchanged during the period under examination \( \left[ {\tau_{iJkt} = \tau_{{iJkt_{0} }} ,\tau_{IJkt} = \tau_{{IJkt_{0} }} } \right] \).Footnote 4
 Under these conditions, the ratio of import duties applied by the reference group of importers J to suppliers i and I does not change over time. Equation (6) can then be rewritten as \( ROR_{iIjJkt} = \lambda_{ijk} \left( {\frac{{\tau_{ijkt} }}{{\tau_{Ijkt} }}} \right)^{ - \sigma } \) where \( \lambda_{ijk} = ROR_{{ii^{'} jj^{'} kt_{0} }} \left[ {\left( {\tau_{{ijkt_{0} }} /\tau_{{i^{'} jkt_{0} }} } \right)} \right]^{\sigma } \), I and J are respectively functions of j and i, so that ROR depends only on i, j, and k. Traditionally, this type of equation is estimated in log-linear form: where u is an error term and α

ijk
 = ln(λ

ijk
). This specification includes one fixed effect specific to each exporter–importer-good triplet. This means that the elasticity of substitution between imports from different origins σ is estimated only on changes over time within each triplet. Fixed effects by exporter, importer, or good, or any combination of two of these dimensions, are accounted for implicitly.Footnote 5 Note that Eq. (7) includes an additional variable, RTA

ij
: this dummy variable denotes the existence of an RTA in force between countries i and j. It is included in the estimation equation to account for RTA non-tariff provisions which can reduce the bilateral trade transaction costs. In this specification, the corresponding impact on trade, measured by parameter ζ, is assumed to be constant across agreements. Santos-Silva and Tenreyro (hereafter SS&T) demonstrate the bias inherent in estimating those models in their logarithmic form (SS&T 2006), and argue that gravity equations should be estimated in a multiplicative form, for instance using a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) estimation technique. The arguments related to the standard gravity model apply to the present case which is a DiD of the log-transformed model, or a ratio of ratios of the multiplicative form. Also, no distributional assumption is needed to ensure the consistency of the PPML estimator which requires only correct specification of the conditional mean. SS&T (2011) show the theoretical consistency and good statistical properties of this estimator, and that it performs better than the proposed alternatives (see also Fally 2015; Sun and Reed 2010). They show that Gamma PML is an efficient estimator in this context. However, as discussed in Head and Mayer (2014), these results are based on a data generating process which does not reflect modern theories of international trade. Ultimately, the best estimator depends on the type of heteroskedasticity since PPML is efficient under the assumption of a constant variance-to-mean ratio, while Gamma PML is efficient under the assumption of a constant coefficient of variation. The Manning and Mullahy (2001) test (referred to as the “MaMu” test in Head and Mayer 2014, and the Park-type test in SS&T 2006) allows the corresponding diagnostic to be made by studying the relationship between the empirical counterparts of the error variance and the expected value of the dependant variable.Footnote 6 While this test provides a biased estimate of the corresponding coefficient, Head and Mayer (2014) show that it differentiates between alternative settings. In our case, applying this test to the benchmark estimation presented below delivers an estimated coefficient \( \hat{\lambda } = 1.37 \), with a standard error of 0.26. Accordingly, in what follows, our preferred estimator is the PPML.Footnote 7
 Our estimates are based on fixed-effect PPML estimates of the multiplicative form of the model (8): The dependent variable computation involves control group trade flows: for a given importer, these flows are common to exporters; for a given exporter, they are common to importers. This feature might produce residual correlation across observations for a given exporter, or a given importer in a given year. Therefore, standard errors ideally should be clustered by both importer-year and exporter-year. This is possible for ordinary least square (OLS) estimates based on Cameron et al. (2011), but not for PPML estimates. In the case of PPML estimates, we compute robust standard errors clustered at panel level (i.e., by exporter–importer-product triplet), following Wooldridge (1999). However, to allow us to compute clustered standard errors, we also conduct OLS estimates of the log-transformed model based on (7). As the recent international trade literature demonstrates, it is important to account for trends in existing trade flows—the so-called intensive margin of trade as well as developments in the number of goods traded at the extensive margin (e.g., Chaney 2008; Helpman et al. 2008). The estimates described so far focus on the intensive margin (defined at the country-pair product level) since they deal with changes over time in non-zero trade flows. To complement these, we estimate the export probability. Econometric modeling of this probability requires accounting for the determinants specific to each (potential) exporter–importer-good triplet. Exporter-by-year and importer-by-year fixed effects are also important since the corresponding idiosyncratic shocks are no longer controlled for by transformation of the dependent variable. Given the large size of the sample, accounting for fixed effects by panel unit is possible only by applying a within estimator—explicitly incorporating all the dummies is numerically intractable. Following Frazer and Van Biesebroeck (2010) and Head et al. (2010), we use a linear model to estimate the probability of exporting. The estimation equation is: where w is an error term. Thus, our benchmark estimates, in addition to the panel-specific fixed effects α

ijk
′ (81,570 in the benchmark estimates), include 419 reporter-year fixed effects (35 countries × 12 years, minus 1) and the same number of partner-year fixed effects. Frazer and Van Biesebrock (2010: 132) argue that “the main disadvantage [of the linear probability model]—that predicted values are not restricted to lie on the (0, 1) interval—is unlikely to be much of an issue as all coefficients are identified off the time variation within country-product categories.” In addition, Angrist and Pischke (2009: 107) emphasize that linear estimates, while theoretically less well-suited, are very close in practice to the marginal effects drawn from non-linear models.",16
152,3,Review of World Economics,16 March 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-016-0251-3,Determinants of direct cross-border public procurement in EU Member States,August 2016,Zornitsa Kutlina-Dimitrova,Csilla Lakatos,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Public procurement is gaining importance on the trade negotiation agenda, both under the aegis of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and at bilateral level in various preferential trade agreements. These trends reflect the economic importance of public procurement markets in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) and trade flows, as well as the fact that to date a relatively small part of these markets has been committed internationally, both at bilateral and at multilateral level. In 2013, in GDP terms, government procurement expenditure as measured in national accounts amounted to an average of almost 14 % of GDP in the European Union (EU) and to more than 10 % of GDP in the United States.Footnote 1 But actual public procurement spending may in reality be higher, as these national accounts aggregates do not include the procurement spending of public utility providers. For example, in the EU total public procurement spending (including state-owned enterprises) accounted for €2.4 trillion, corresponding to nearly 19 % of EU GDP in 2011.Footnote 2 In terms of shares, procurement of state-owned utilities accounted for 27 % of total procurement in the EU. These shares exemplify the significance of government procurement expenditure in total demand and its role in shaping the resource allocation and thereby the structure of the economy. In fact, these numbers also imply that a reduction of public procurement spending by 10 % leads to a cost saving in GDP terms of 1.9 % in the EU. Therefore, especially in times where EU governments are being under pressure to cut (unproductive) expenditure, ensuring cost-efficient and qualitative procurement spending on goods and services is of great importance. Moreover, during the global economic crisis of 2008–2009 many governments supported domestic demand by the introduction of fiscal stimulus packages, some of which were subject to explicit ‘buy local’ provisions.Footnote 3 In this context it is of great interest to examine the presence of prevalent domestic preferences, or the so-called ‘home bias’, and to analyse what shapes governments’ decision processes on procuring from domestic versus foreign suppliers, i.e. the need to look closely at the determinants of international government procurement purchases of goods and services. Governments’ preference for domestic suppliers can have non-trivial implications for domestic output and welfare. The presence of ‘home bias’ can furthermore significantly distort trade flows and international specialisation, particularly in sectors characterised by a large share of public spending in total demand and in those affected by monopolistic competition.Footnote 4
 There is theoretical and empirical literature on the effects and occurrence of ‘home-biased’ procurement. From a theoretical point of view, the seminal work of Baldwin (1970) and Baldwin and Richardson (1972) shows that discrimination against foreign bidders affects output, prices and imports only if public demand is larger than domestic supply. Subsequent contributions to this literature by Lowinger (1976), Miyagiwa (1991) and Trionfetti (2001) allow for imperfectly competitive behaviour and provide theoretical proof for 'home-biased' procurement affecting output and imports under different types of imperfectly competitive market structures. McAfee and McMillan (1989) provide further theoretical arguments for discrimination against foreign bidders in a framework of optimal auction theory coupled with information asymmetries. Evenett and Hoekman (2005) extend the work of Baldwin (1970) and Baldwin and Richardson (1972) to consider the implications of firm entry and show that, in a situation where discrimination against foreign bidders limits market access, the long-term impact on national welfare depends on the prevalence of local (natural and policy-induced) barriers to competition, i.e. procurement bans and price preference policies. The empirical/data-driven analysis of ‘home bias’ in government procurement has also evolved. Trionfetti (2000), the European Commission (1997), Brülhart and Trionfetti (2001) and (2004), Shingal (2011) and more recently Rickard and Kono (2014) provide factual evidence for the presence of ‘home bias’ in government procurement spending. This literature, however, deals with the presence of ‘home-biased’ procurement and does not aim at analysing econometrically possible determinants of cross-border public procurement. In this paper, departing from previous work, we aim at explicitly identifying the determinants of international public procurement. The econometric evidence on what drives governments’ decision-making processes on procuring from domestic versus foreign suppliers is scarce and consists of the works by Shingal (2015), Ramboll/HTW Huhr (2011) and PwC, London Economics and Ecorys (2011). Shingal (2015) examines econometrically the determinants of foreign procurement in a dataset consisting of only two countries—Switzerland and Japan. Ramboll/HTW Huhr (2011) and PwC, London Economics and Ecorys (2011) use a Tenders Electronic Daily (TED)Footnote 5 dataset similar to ours, however, their time span is more limited and less recent. Moreover, their dataset includes the year 2007, when data reporting requirements on TED changed and thus there is the potential for some sample inaccuracies and mismatches. Finally, our paper provides econometric evidence for the theoretical predictions in Evenett and Hoekman (2005) on the importance of barriers restricting competition to foreign bidders for government procurement contracts. This model predicts that the impact of government procurement discrimination on prices and domestic welfare is contingent upon national competition policy. In terms of market participation opportunities for foreign suppliers, these depend inter alia on national competition policy regulations and barriers to foreign direct investment.Footnote 6
 To sum up, this paper has two major objectives: (i) to explore the determinants of direct cross-border procurementFootnote 7 in a unique and rich dataset; and (ii) to provide econometric evidence on the impact of competition restraining practices on the probability of a contract to be awarded directly cross-border. The paper uses a unique dataset based on mandatory contract award notice data published in TED. The dataset consists of more than 30 variables and covers a time period of 5 years (2008–2012). The paper also analyses the impact of selected OECD product market regulation indicators on the propensity of a cross-border procurement award. The novelty of the paper is twofold. First, the multivariate logit model estimated here accounts for the influence of product market regulation specificities of the awarding country on the probability of a direct cross-border public procurement award, and thereby provides econometric evidence for the theoretical predictions in Evenett and Hoekman (2005). Second, the dataset underlying the econometric analysis is unique (consisting of panel data for 5 years, 2008–2012) and is used for the first time for the purposes of this paper. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 describes public procurement patterns using descriptive statistics in terms of number and value of contract awards, legal framework, type of contract, level of procurement and procedures, as well as sectoral and regional split; Sect. 3 provides a literature overview, the testable hypotheses, the specification of the econometric model and a description of data sources used; Sect. 4 presents and discusses the results of the econometric estimations; and finally Sect. 5 provides conclusions and policy implications.",26

When exporting to FTA member countries, firms can enjoy the benefit of using FTA tariff rates, which are lower than the general tariff rates (e.g., most favored nation (MFN) rates). However, in general, FTA users need to bear some costs in doing so. FTA users must comply with the rules of origin (RoO) to take advantage of FTA tariff schemes. To certify the “originality” of their products, exporters must submit various documents, including a list of inputs, production flow chart, production instructions, invoices for each input, and contract documents. To handle this documentation work, exporters may establish a division or assign staff to be in charge of FTA utilization. With these documents, exporters apply for certificates of origin (CoO) from the authority to use FTA tariff schemes. Obtaining this type of documentation incurs some costs for FTA utilization. Consequently, even when exporting to FTA member countries, only productive exporters who can earn enough to offset these costs will be able to use FTA schemes.Footnote 1
 Several studies have estimated the costs of FTA utilization. Applying the threshold regression approach to the utilization rate of Cotonou preferences, Francois et al. (2006) found that the tariff-equivalent costs of using the scheme ranged between 4 and 4.5 %. Hayakawa (2011) showed that by employing the threshold regression method, the average tariff equivalent of fixed costs for use of FTA for all existing FTAs in the world is estimated at approximately 3 %. Cadot and de Melo (2007) surveyed this literature, concluding that such fixed costs range between 3 and 5 % of the product price. Some studies estimated the absolute values of FTA utilization costs. Ulloa and Wagner (2013) computed the costs directly by employing the data on FTA utilization for exports from Chile to the United States. They found that the 75th percentile was around US$3000 in the year of entry into force (approximately US$200 for the median) and the costs decreased by 60–80 % in the following one to 2 years. By employing firm-level data from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) utilization for exporting apparel products to Europe from Bangladesh and by developing a theoretical model of firms’ preferential scheme utilization, Cherkashin et al. (2015) structurally estimated the costs (called documentation costs of RoO compliance), which were US$4240.Footnote 2
 In this study, by following the approach adopted in Ulloa and Wagner (2013), we add new evidence to the literature on FTA utilization costs. It theoretically shows that the FTA utilization (fixed) costs are equal to the tariff margin (i.e., the difference between MFN and FTA rates) multiplied by the exports (we call this the saving amount of tariff payments), in situations wherein total profits from FTA use and non-use equalize. A challenging issue is how to obtain such a level of exports, or “cutoff exports.” Ulloa and Wagner (2013) obtained data by estimating the cumulative density of exports. From a theoretical point of view, the cumulative density at cutoff exports becomes equal to the share of exports under MFN schemes. Thus, with the cumulative density of exports for each product and the product-level data for FTA utilization, cutoff exports may be computed. Our detailed data on firms’ FTA utilization enable us to measure FTA utilization costs more directly and simply compared with previous studies. Our data consist in shipment-level customs data for Thai imports. These contain information not only on firms, source countries, and commodities but also on tariff scheme (i.e., FTA or MFN) used for imports. Recently, several empirical papers used shipment-level data (e.g., Amiti et al. 2014; Berman et al. 2012; Eaton et al. 2011). However, no studies have used data that enable identification of the employed tariff scheme.Footnote 3 With this dataset, for example, as the cutoff exports, we can identify the minimum firm-level trade values under FTA schemes or the maximum firm-level trade values under MFN schemes. That is, without imposing any strong assumption on functional form on the distribution of trade values (i.e., productivity), we can compute the costs for FTA utilization. Using the estimates on FTA utilization costs, we also examine the differences in the FTA utilization costs across various dimensions such as industry or RoO.Footnote 4
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains our methodology for measuring FTA utilization costs. Section 3 provides an overview of our dataset. Section 4 reports the estimates for FTA utilization costs and examines their differences across industries and RoO. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes this paper.",7
152,3,Review of World Economics,08 December 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-015-0240-y,"External R&D, productivity, and export: evidence from Japanese firms",August 2016,Banri Ito,Ayumu Tanaka,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Recent seminal theoretical studies in international economics have focused on the role of firm heterogeneity in the internationalization of a firm (Melitz 2003; Helpman et al. 2004; Antras and Helpman 2004). These studies suggest that more productive firms succeed in entering the international market. In other words, less productive firms supply only the domestic market, while only the firms that are relatively more productive export their products through a self-selection mechanism.Footnote 1 However, these prior studies rely on the assumption that firm heterogeneity—the productivity differential—is given from outside the model, because they assume that firms stochastically determine their productivity level. Therefore, the role of investments in increasing a firm’s productivity and propensity to enter the export market has not been analyzed thus far. Recently, several studies have attempted to link productivity-enhancing investments (such as research and development (R&D) investments) to the relationship between productivity and exporting (Yeaple 2005; Lileeva and Trefler 2010; Aw et al. 2007, 2011; Bustos 2011). These studies provide empirical evidence for the complementarity between productivity-enhancing investment activities and exporting. Although these studies examine the link between R&D investments and exporting, they either exclusively focus on a firm’s in-house R&D efforts or do not distinguish between in-house R&D and the acquisition of external R&D resources through technology purchase or R&D outsourcing. Knowledge resources that improve productivity such as expertise, know-how, and intellectual property are widely distributed outside the firm. Incorporating such external knowledge resources into the innovation process of a firm has become important for the growth of firms because of the complexity of technology and increased global competition. When firms enter the international market, they face greater competitive pressure than they do in the domestic market, and technology purchase or R&D outsourcing may be effective in shortening the production period. In addition, customization to the foreign market through their R&D activities in the foreign country is necessary. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in R&D activity, technology purchase, and offshore outsourcing is one of the major customization strategies. Thus, the use of external technology and knowledge resources may be more important for internationalized firms to serve foreign markets. Although the choice of R&D strategy—i.e., whether firms adopt external R&D resources—has not been analyzed in the extant theoretical and empirical research on heterogeneous firms and international trade, the literature on R&D and innovation has paid attention to the acquisition of external R&D resources in the context of how it relates to internal R&D activity. For example, prior studies have found a complementary relationship between internal and external R&D activities. According to Cohen and Levinthal (1989, 1990), a firm that engages in internal R&D activities increases its absorptive capacity, thereby increasing the effectiveness of adopting external knowledge resources for innovation. Cassiman and Veugelers (2006), Lokshin et al. (2008), and Belderbos et al. (2008) empirically examine the impact of internal and external R&D on firm performance and report complementarity between the two R&D strategies. Incorporating this finding into the theory of heterogeneous firms and trade (according to which more productive firms are selected to become exporters through a self-selection mechanism), we predict that firms that use external knowledge resources as well as internal R&D resources succeed in entering foreign markets. This study determines the productivity sorting pattern of the joint decisions related to R&D strategies and exporting status based on a simple theoretical framework that extends the existing model of firm heterogeneity and trade (Melitz 2003; Bustos 2011) to account for both internal (a firm’s own R&D investments) and external (R&D outsourcing or technology purchase) R&D strategies. Further, we empirically examine the sorting pattern using Japanese firm-level data. Instead of a parametric approach, we employ both the nonparametric Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) tests and the semiparametric quantile regressions (QRs), given the nature of data distribution. Both the results are found to be qualitatively similar; i.e., the results are consistent with the theoretical predictions. The results reveal that there is remarkable heterogeneity among exporters in terms of their R&D strategy. Although a large fraction of exporters are non-R&D firms, their productivity is the lowest among the exporters. Exporters with purely internal R&D strategies and exporters with purely external R&D strategies are more productive than non-R&D exporters. The most productive exporters are firms that engage in both internal and external R&D. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework of the study. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy and the results of the nonparametric and semiparametric tests. Section 4 describes the data and presents the descriptive statistics of the key variables. Section 5 concludes the paper with a summary of the main findings and directions for future research.",5

The principle of traditional economics tells us that international trade leads to an increase in mutual benefits between trade partners. However, we observe a lot of conflicts between people with different values and different historical and cultural backgrounds. As a consequence of globalization, frictions and tensions between people can increase, which then acts to reduce any trade benefits. Therefore, an increasing number of studies have investigated international trade by incorporating cultural factors (e.g., Francois and van Ypersele 2002; Bala and van Long 2005; Janeba 2007; Olivier et al. 2008). According to Rauch and Trinidade (2009), people enjoy an intrinsic consumption value of imported cultural goods, which leads to an increase in welfare in the short run. However, the importation of cultural goods leads to cultural stagnation, which results in a decrease in welfare in the long run. Further, globalization increases the anti-foreigner sentiment held by people who compete with immigrants in the labor market (Gang et al. 2013).Footnote 1 That is, globalization seems to cause a negative externality. However, it is not only an increase in competition that affects people’s perceptions toward immigrants; other factors such as social background and identity also play a role in immigration-related issues (Epstein and Gang 2010; Abdulloev et al. 2014). One way to decrease conflict and tension is to reduce the level of information asymmetry among people, as they can be misled by preconceived notions about others, which leads to intolerance. Mutual understanding is important to reduce information asymmetry. According to the contact hypothesis, frequency of contact with a minority is thought to alleviate tension between the minority and majority (Rothbart and John 1993).Footnote 2
 Even in the age of globalization, to gain the mutual benefit of international labor mobility it is important to consider not only the economic condition but also the social and historical backgrounds between countries. People’s attitudes toward immigrants, to a certain extent, depend on the political relationship between countries. In the workplace, whether a migrant’s contribution is equivalent to the level expected of them depends on the relationships and attitudes in the workplace. Even if migrants are sufficiently able and diligent, their contribution is considered below the level expected of them when native co-workers do not cooperate with them. Furthermore, people’s attitudes toward immigrants are reflected in immigration policy and then in the openness of the labor market. Regarding economic factors, education level is considered a critical determinant of people’s attitudes (Mayda 2006). As for non-economic factors, social and cultural prejudices are considered factors that determine the attitude toward immigrants (Dustmann and Preston 2007). Koreans may have anti-Japanese sentiments partly because Korea was annexed to Japan between 1910 and 1945 and endured severe hardship.Footnote 3 Because of this historical background, political conflict exists between Korea and Japan. For instance, there is a territorial dispute over the island of Tokdo (Takeshima). However, the Korean (Japanese) negative attitude toward Japan (Korea) possibly leads to fewer economic benefits. The Japanese (Korean) popular culture industry is commonly called “Cool Japan (Korea)” and has received increasing attention in economic policy. The consumption of cultural goods can influence society’s attitude (Cheng 2006). For example, a Chinese man uses “Cool Japan” to promote friendship between Japan and China. He feels an affinity with Japan through his viewing of Japanese anime although he does not live in Japan. Furthermore, via his business he is connected to Japanese partners (Nihon Keizai Newspaper 2013). Thus, the role of policy regarding “Cool Japan” should be considered from a long-term perspective. First, it is plausible that watching anime teaches foreigners about Japanese society and therefore allows them to understand Japanese people better. That is, the international trade of cultural goods is expected to create a ripple effect between trading partners by enhancing mutual understanding. Fans of Japanese anime feel goodwill toward Japanese people because of the positive association with a product they enjoy. Therefore, a policy of promoting “Cool Japan” encourages foreigners to access entertainment from Japan (e.g., manga and anime), which improves their impression of Japanese people. There are a number of economic studies dealing with modern cultural goods (e.g., Belk 1987; Dewally and Ederington 2006; Wyburn and Roach 2012). From an international economic viewpoint, Disdier et al. (2010b) investigated the international trade of cultural goods. Disdier et al. (2010a) provided empirical evidence that exposure to foreign names through imported cultural goods such as movies, television, and music influences the choice of their baby’s name by parents in France. Maystre et al. (2014) empirically examined how international trade changed subjective values in import and export countries. Based on data on the openness of bilateral trade (Disdier et al. 2010b) and World Value Surveys, Maystre et al. (2014) found that openness of bilateral trade is positively associated with cultural distance between the countries, implying that international trade causes subjective values to become more similar between countries. With respect to international labor mobility, the attitude toward immigrants or foreigners has been increasingly analyzed from an economic viewpoint.Footnote 4 However, no studies have examined how international trade in cultural goods influences people’s attitude toward their trade partners. The value of this paper is that it is the first to investigate how and the extent to which the international trade of modern cultural goods influences people’s perceptions. To this end, we explore the effect of Koreans’ consumption of Japanese anime on their attitude toward Japanese people. The key findings are as follows: Koreans who frequently view Japanese anime are more likely to accept Japanese people as workplace colleagues and neighbors. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an explanation regarding data and the empirical method used. Section 3 presents the estimation results and their interpretation. The final section offers some conclusions.",5

152,4,Review of World Economics,03 May 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-016-0254-0,Temporary expats for exports: micro-level evidence,November 2016,Magnus Lodefalk,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Firms commonly emphasize the importance of face-to-face meetings, in-depth information and personal relations in trade with foreign markets.Footnote 1 People with foreign experience may therefore be instrumental to firms for trade because they may hold superior tacit knowledge of foreign markets and be part of foreign networks. The international movement of persons is key to international production networks, which account for an increasing share of trade (National Board of Trade 2013b). With global business enterprises, it may be important to transfer people between distant operations. Movement may facilitate the exchange of tacit knowledge and information, improve coordination, and promote a common business culture. Corporations may also use intra-corporate transfers to develop the competences of employees and to offer them international careers. Employing foreign talent is also necessary when specific skills are scarce domestically. As one firm puts it, “We work globally – we need people to meet and exchange knowledge. We also need to adapt quickly, or we lose competitive advantages. Mobility is therefore very important to us. Business is better when the right people are at the right place at the right time”.Footnote 2
 In the situations noted above, persons do not need to move permanently across borders to meet the firm’s objective. One advantage of temporary expatriation is that there are fewer restrictions than for immigration. In addition, social network theory indicates that foreignness is advantageous in linking agents to distant networks, although the characteristic of foreignness arguably vanishes over time (Granovetter 1973). Interestingly, temporary movement has increased in recent years prior to the global economic crisis.Footnote 3
 This study contributes to the emerging literature on the temporary movement of people and trade by taking a business perspective, both conceptually and empirically. We begin with a conceptual framework that incorporates aspects of social network theory and arrive at testable conjectures about the effect of firm investment in temporary expats on exports and spillovers. In this framework, we also examine other reasons firms may have for investing in temporary expats, such as the acquisition of scarce competencies to promote efficiency or attunement to customer demand. Empirically, we use rich and comprehensive micro-level panel data for Sweden. Our main identification strategy is to exploit variation in the employment of temporary expats—irrespective of their country of birth, including natives—and export within firm and export destination-country dyads across time. To study the mechanisms at play, we use information on the characteristics of expats, trade in merchandise and services at the product-firm-country level, and formal and informal trade barriers. Previous studies on the nexus of movements of persons and trade have instead mainly focused on the bilateral impact of foreign-born immigrants (e.g., Gould 1994; White 2007; Felbermayr et al. 2010; Egger et al. 2012), with a few exceptions, such as studies on emigrants, temporary skilled worker permits, other foreign visitor policies and travel (e.g., Hiller 2014; Jansen and Piermartini 2009; Yasar and Lisner 2012; Brau and Pinna 2013). Most studies adopt a gravity model of trade, and many employ bilateral panel data on the movement of persons and trade in merchandise of countries.Footnote 4 More recently, studies have emerged that use firm-level data on migrant employees and trade. These studies find the semi-elasticity of firm trade to immigrant employees to be 1–2 % on average (Hatzigeorgiou and Lodefalk 2014, 2016; Hiller 2013). Other studies examine the welfare impact of allowing labor to move internationally, using computable equilibrium models. These studies typically conclude that there would be large welfare gains from labor movement (Walmsley et al. 2011). More closely related to our study, there are papers capturing less permanent movement in their study of the impact of visa policies on the trade of countries (Jansen and Piermartini 2009; Kapelko and Volchkova 2013; Neumayer 2010; Yasar and Lisner 2012). For example, Jansen and Piermartini (2009) exploit data on a skilled labor visa program (H1B) in the Unites States and estimate its impact on US trade with the countries of origin of these workers. The visa program allows qualified workers to stay for as long as 3 years and at most two consecutive periods. The authors find a positive impact on both exports and imports. Yasar and Lisner (2012) argue that bilateral visa waiver programs between the Unites States and certain other countries in the 1950–2003 period promoted US exports. A related study examines the relation between international students and alumni networks on the foreign trade of the United Kingdom and finds positive but heterogeneous impacts (Murat 2014).Footnote 5
 In addition to the discussed literature, our paper is related to the relatively large literature on 
preparations for export and export spillovers, which points to the importance of market-specific knowledge-transfer for firm export.Footnote 6 For example, Labanca et al. (2014) find evidence to suggest that firms successfully prepare for export to a specific destination market by hiring workers from other exporters to those markets, using Brazilian micro-level data. Other micro-level studies confirm a link between hiring of workers with export experience and firm export with respect to white-collar workers or managers in Denmark (Choquette and Meinen 2015); and managers in Spain (Minondo 2011). In a related study, Munch and Skaksen (2008) find an export wage premium for skill-intensive firms in Denmark in export to countries outside the EU and Norway, concluding that the premium is suggestive of firms differentiating their exports to escape competition from low-income countries. Finally, there is evidence to suggest that firms’ export to foreign destinations is facilitated by the transfer of knowledge from existing exporters (e.g., Koenig et al. 2010).Footnote 7
 To sum up, we find that the literature on temporary movement of persons and trade is relatively small and the evidence is limited in several respects. None of the earlier studies use micro-level data, none examine impacts on trade in services, and few include natives who temporarily return home for professional purposes and carry foreign experience. Turning to the literature on export spillovers and preparation, it does neither consider the role of expats in specific, nor consider exports of services, this to the best of our knowledge. In all these regards, we contribute to the literature. There are three reasons we use micro-level instead of macro-level data in this study. First, the confirmed effect of the movement of persons on trade is commonly interpreted as social networks in action, transferring tacit knowledge and matching firms with agents abroad (Aleksynska and Peri 2014). What defines social networks, generally, is that their agents know each other and are socially close to each other (“only a few referrals away”) (Granovetter 1973; Milgram 1967; Podolny and Page 1998). Knowledge and closeness, in turn, build on intensive interaction and social, and possibly spatial, proximity. Therefore, the business network effect on trade would be likely to operate most directly at the micro level, with “movers” affecting firms directly, for example, as employees, consultants or business partners.Footnote 8 A foreign-born person A who is hired by a manufacturing firm in the host country would be expected to facilitate the trade of that firm with his country of origin more than would a fellow countryman B employed in the public sector, another countryman C who is in the same profession but resides in a distant part of the country, or an unemployed countryman D who resides in the same state as the firm. Data at the micro level are therefore useful for identifying persons who are more likely to affect firm trade, as opposed to grouping them together with persons who are unemployed, retired, or employed in non-tradable sectors.Footnote 9
 Second, the use of micro-level data allows us to explore the relation between temporary expats and firm exports in detail and isolation. At this level, the relation can be explored with regard to the character of the expats associated with firms and with firm trade while controlling for confounding factors at more aggregate levels, including expats’ home bias in demand. Third, even when temporary expats may not affect the relative size of industries’ trade, they may affect the trade of firms within industries or even trade within firms, thereby influencing which firms or firm activities expand or contract. This influence may have potential welfare effects, further motivating micro-level analysis. The importance of studying the impact of temporary expats on trade in services is related to the fact that such trade is particularly exposed to trade barriers. Services are typically characterized as intangible, differentiated, and requiring joint production by the producer and consumer. Trade in services is therefore more sensitive to informal trade barriers than trade in goods, while already being burdened by formal barriers to trade (Miroudot et al. 2013).Footnote 10 Temporary expats would therefore seem well suited to assist firms in exports of services because of their networks and general as well as tacit knowledge about their country of emigration. They may help firms in overcoming important barriers to trade in services, which include differences in language, business practices, difficulties in identifying suitable foreign agents, and uncertainty (European Commission 2001). It is therefore somewhat surprising that there are only two previous studies on this subject, and both study migration rather than the temporary movement of persons (Hatzigeorgiou and Lodefalk 2014; Foster-McGregor and Pindyuk 2013).Footnote 11
 Our country of study—Sweden—is a particularly interesting case. It is the paragon of a small open economy in terms of trade and migration, but also an economy that has become more services-intense overall and in trade. The Swedish trade to GDP ratio is 90 % and foreign-born account for 16 % of the total population, more than twice their share in 1970. Sweden is currently the second most important recipient of asylum seekers among EU members, in absolute numbers, while accounting for only 2 % of the EU population. Meanwhile, Sweden has lost world market shares in goods but gained in services in the last decades (Exportutredningen 2008).Footnote 12 Swedish exports of services are dominated by other business services and the group of telecommunication, data and information services—all services where Sweden have revealed comparative advantages (Eliasson et al. 2011; National Board of Trade 2015).Footnote 13 Interestingly, the pharmaceutical and telecom manufacturing industries also account for an important share of Sweden’s export of services.Footnote 14 About three quarters of Swedish exports of services is destined for other European countries (Swedish Trade Council 2010). The composition of Swedish services export is highly heterogeneous across countries, with headquarter services dominating export to, for example, the Netherlands, but leasing of ships and offshore supply dominating export to the United Kingdom, and R&D services dominating export to the United States. In a nutshell, we find that employing temporary expats has a positive and statistically significant impact on the subsequent intensity of exports. The association with export intensity is larger for the export of services than for merchandise. The within-firm-country association with exports is negatively related to the distance to the country of departure of expats: temporary expats from the subsequent export destination are associated with exports there, while expats from elsewhere are not. The results seem to confirm the expectation that firms invest in temporary expats from a foreign country to promote subsequent exports there rather than to access scarce skills in general. As for the channels of mediation, our results suggest that the employment of temporary expats from a specific country enables firms to overcome informal barriers to trade with that country. The results are found to be robust to alternative specifications, estimators, and endogeneity concerns. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sects. 2 and 3, we introduce the conceptual and empirical framework, respectively. In Sect. 4, we then present our data and provide descriptive evidence on the relation between the hiring of temporary expats and subsequent exports. In Sect. 5, we report and discuss our econometric results on the same relation, as well as perform several robustness checks. Finally, in Sect. 6, we conclude and discuss potential policy implications of our findings.",7

While earlier studies used aggregate data (Mankiw et al. 1992; Hall and Jones 1999), Clemens et al. (2008) use individual-level data from 43 countries to estimate the “place premium” for observationally identical workers. Kennan (2013) argues that if these differences are due to productivity then the welfare losses from migration restrictions are very large. On the other hand, neoclassical theory suggests that restrictions on trade (and possibly investment) might also contribute to the place premium. Indeed, part of the motivation developing countries have in pursuing trade agreements is the promise that increased trade will help close the wage gap between developing and developed countries (factor price equalization). The goal of this paper is to evaluate the stability of the place premium over time in an environment of reduced trade restrictions, increased trade, rising foreign investment, and significant migration. Over the last two decades, commercial integration between the United States and Mexico significantly increased. Between 1994 and 2011, trade in goods between the two countries quadrupled in value, increasing from $108.39 billion to $461.24 billion (U.S. Census Bureau 2013). The value of US goods exported to Mexico increased from $50.84 to $198.39 billion, while the value of Mexican goods exported to the United States increased from $49.49 billion to $262.86 billion. In 2011, total exports to Mexico accounted for 13.4 % of overall US exports and total imports from Mexico accounted for 11.9 % of overall US imports (Office of the United States Trade Representative 2013). By 2012, the total value of trade between Mexico and the United States closely approached half a trillion dollars. GDP per capita has also increased in both countries. In constant 2005 US dollars, US. GDP per capita increased from $32,015 to $43,063 between 1992 and 2012. While Mexico has had some macroeconomic setbacks, such as the December 1994 peso crisis, recovery has generally been rapid. In constant 2005 US dollars, Mexican GDP per capita increased from $6628 to $8215 over the same time period.Footnote 1 Rather than converge, however, Mexican GDP per capita and US GDP per capita grew apart. The ratio of Mexican to US GDP per capita fell from 20.7 % of US GDP per capita in 1992 to 19.2 % in 2011. The persistent and seemingly growing GDP per capita gap has been noted in the literature as an important research question (Hanson 2010), partially because it is at odds with neoclassical trade theory, migration theory, and early applied general equilibrium predictions of the effects of NAFTA.Footnote 2 The neoclassical Heckscher–Ohlin–Samuelson (HOS) framework, one of the canonical trade models, predicts that trade liberalization would lead to convergence in the prices of traded goods, which in turn would induce factor price convergence.Footnote 3 In addition to the significant increase in trade noted above, Robertson et al. (2009) find strong support for convergence in goods-level prices between Mexico and the United States, making the lack of convergence in income inconsistent with the prediction of trade models.Footnote 4
 The lack of convergence in GDP per capita is also at odds with some labor-based migration models.Footnote 5 The empirical research on the immigration-wage relationship suggests that immigration into the United States has increased wages (Ottaviano and Peri 2012), lowered wages (Borjas 2003; Revenga 1997), or left wages unaffected (Card 1990, 2001; Hanson et al. 2002). Emerging evidence also suggests that emigration increases wages of workers who stay behind. Mishra (2007) provides evidence that Mexican emigration bids up Mexican wages. Elsner (2013a) finds similar results for Lithuania. Elsner (2013b) finds that emigration’s effects are not uniform throughout the wage distribution. If wages fall or remain constant in the destination country, convergence should be the most prominent for demographic groups with the highest propensity to migrate. Alternatively, migration could increase the differential in the presence of agglomeration effects (Brezis and Krugman 1996; Giovanni et al. 2015), making our application relevant for the debate on migration’s effect on wages as well. Despite the lack of convergence in the per capita GDPs of Mexico and the United States over the past 25 years, there are ample reasons that would point towards increased wage convergence over this period, particularly for demographic groups that are most affected by trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and migration. In this paper, we carefully measure Mexico–United States wage differentials (the place premium) for specific demographic groups and track these over time. We then quantify the extents to which trade, FDI, and migration may have helped to narrow these differentials. While no specific papers have attempted to answer these questions, several related papers focus on within-country convergence or short-run convergence. Some studies have investigated wage convergence within countries and early studies of the Mexican labor market did indeed detect evidence of it (Hanson 1996, 1997; Chiquiar 2005). Robertson (2000) finds a strong, positive correlation between short-run wage growth in the United States and short-run wage growth for Mexican workers who reside on the border with the United States. Hanson (2003) also finds a similar result. Robertson (2005), however, finds no evidence that NAFTA increased the estimated degree of labor market integration between the United States and Mexico as measured by the transmission of short-run shocks. Our paper also relates to, and extends, early studies that examined the short-run wage effects of trade liberalization in Mexico. Cragg and Epelbaum (1996) find the wage growth is the largest for worker with higher occupations during the trade reform period. Revenga (1997) and Hanson and Harrison (1999) draw similar conclusions. Their study suggests that the skilled-unskilled wage gap increased dramatically after trade reform in 1985. The reform affected unskilled labor disproportionately. Our paper differs from these others along a number of dimensions. First, unlike Robertson (2000), we are not concerned with the short-term transmission of wage shocks across national boundaries. Second, we are not concerned with regional convergence within Mexico or short-run wage effects of trade liberalization. Rather, we carefully document the evolution of US–Mexico wage differentials over a long horizon and try and understand the mechanisms behind these movements. So, we provide a more descriptive “bird’s eye” view of the data that is then interpreted through the lens of some workhorse theories (e.g. HOS). We believe this to be an important omission from the literature. We do this by using two complementary methodologies and four data sources. The first approach matches quarterly survey data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) in the United States and the Encuesta Nacional de Ocupacion y Empleo (ENOE) in Mexico.Footnote 6 The second approach employs census data from Mexico and the United States for three different time periods. Clemens et al. (2008) use very similar data and a similar approach. The main difference is that they compare a single cross section for multiple countries; we compare a single country pair and multiple time periods. When using the survey data, we first divide Mexican and US working-age people into 45 age-education cells. Comparing Mexican and US workers in the same education-age cell effectively controls for variation in returns to skill and allows us to use quarterly data to identify time-series patterns. The disadvantage is that it focuses only on workers residing in urban areas in Mexico.Footnote 7
 The second approach overcomes this disadvantage by using census data that include rural workers. These data have the added advantages that the sample sizes are larger, they have more complete information about hours worked and they capture long-run differences. The disadvantage of census data is that the data are observed only once every 10 years. With these data, we first compare mean wage differentials by education and age cell and look at how these have evolved over time. Next, we look deeper into the data and investigate how the relative wage distributions have evolved over time by comparing changes in a given percentile for a given age and education level. On the whole, the results demonstrate that there has been very little, if any, wage convergence between the United States and Mexico over time. While the 1994 peso crisis obviously contributed to the lack of convergence, we find some evidence for divergence even beyond the effects of the peso crisis. Although there is evidence of some convergence in the high-migration groups, this seems to be primarily due to falling US wages at the bottom of the US income distribution, as opposed to rising Mexican wages. While this “bird’s eye” look at the data does not appear to indicate much wage convergence despite large increases in economic integration, a more detailed look at the data does suggest that investment in Mexico and migration may have narrowed the US–Mexico wage gap, but only to a small degree. Indeed, the census data reveal that there was convergence in the border region of Mexico relative to the interior in the 1990s, but divergence in the 2000s. Since FDI in Mexico is mainly concentrated in the border, FDI may indeed have led to some initial wage convergence. We also estimate some common specifications from the literature on migration and wages and find that there is some evidence that increased migration can narrow the place premium. Despite this suggestive evidence that migration, FDI, and trade may arbitrage the US–Mexico wage differential, their effects are very modest when compared to the overall difference. Particularly, even if we adopt methods from the literature that are the most likely to deliver the largest effects of migration on wages, an impossibly high level of migration would be needed to achieve wage equalization. In addition, when we compare the evolution of Mexican wages in its border and its interior, the wage gains in the border during the 1990s are relatively modest when compared to the overall differential. We conclude that the place premium is largely stable, even following large reductions to trade and investment barriers and high migration. This may indicate that the US–Mexico place premium has more to do with productivity differentials than it has to do with trade, FDI, and migration barriers. We begin by laying out a simple theoretical framework in Sect. 2. We then discus the four data sources that we use in Sect. 3. We then present some descriptive empirical results in Sects. 4 and 5 in which we elucidate some of the patterns in the evolution of Mexico–US wage differentials over the past 25 years. We then investigate some of the mechanisms that may be behind what convergence we do see in the previous sections in Sect. 6. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 7.",2
153,1,Review of World Economics,24 September 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-016-0267-8,Out-migration and economic cycles,February 2017,Rémi Bazillier,Francesco Magris,Daniel Mirza,Male,Male,Male,Male,"During recessions, an increase in the votes in favor of anti-immigrant parties in Western Europe becomes a recurrent fact. Citizens thus put pressure on policymakers to limit the entry of new foreigners and encourage the exit of settled migrants. Attitudes towards migrants have become more hostile in most European countries. This can be explained by the changing nature of migration: seasonal and other temporary worker migrants have progressively been replaced by family reunification and permanent settlement since the seventies (Castles 2006). Researchers have shown that European opinions about migrants are shaped more by cultural views than by cost-benefit perceptions (Card et al. 2012). But the perception of costs might have been exacerbated during the Great Recession. Hatton (2014) shows that the change in the opinion towards immigration during this period was more negative in those countries most affected by the crisis. He finds that unemployment has a negative impact on the propensity to think that immigrants are “good for the economy”. It may have put additional pressure on policy makers to implement measures encouraging many categories of migrants (unskilled, unemployed, but also skilled foreign students) to move back home. Among these measures, it has become increasingly difficult to renew one’s residence card and migrants have been encouraged to go back home through attractive financial packages (OECD 2009). This paper shows that an alternative policy of ’laissez-faire’ might also regulate the exit of migrants (i.e. out-migration).Footnote 1 We claim in this paper that a hardening of out-migration policies might not be needed to regulate the number of settled foreigners in a country, as short-run economic forces by themselves might produce similar outcomes. More precisely, we show that settled migrants are encouraged to stay in the host country during periods of low unemployment, while they are encouraged to leave it instead in periods of high unemployment. Notice in passing that such a result weakens the idea that “migrants are stealing the jobs of native workers in bad times”. The paper also shows, although to a lesser extent, that the business cycle in the migrants’ country of origin is also a driving force of return migration. The literature on out-migration (return migration or migration to a third country) is relatively scarce. Borjas and Bratsberg (1996) analyze the determinant of the out-migration of foreign-born individuals in the US. They find that out-migration is negatively selected, which reinforces the positive selection over staying migration. They argue that return migration may have been planned as part of an “optimal life-cycle residential location sequence” or may be explained by erroneous information about opportunities in the US, received prior to deciding to migrate. More recent studies find much mixed evidence regarding the selection of outward migrants. Dustmann and Weiss (2007) put forth a model which synthesizes most of the micro-economic motives for people to go back home (return migration), and provide some evidence at the micro level using UK Labour Force Survey (LFS) data showing that this migration is rather selective.Footnote 2 Analyzing the migration from Eastern Europe, Mayr and Peri (2009) show that the human capital acquired in Western Europe yields higher returns in the home country, which may explain a positive selection in return migration. de Haas et al. (2015) analyze the determinants of return migration to Morocco and find very mixed results regarding whether return migration is a sign of success or failure for the migrant. Dustmann and Görlach (2014) also show that return migration is rather ‘selective’, as it happens to be temporary and more frequent among migrants who are nationals of rich countries than for migrants originating from developing ones. Dustmann and Görlach (2016) summarize the literature on temporary migration and show how temporariness can affect various economic choices. Some papers address the impact of economic cycles on out-migration, but only indirectly, based on micro-data and focusing on the possible influence of employment opportunities, unemployment experience, and income dynamics at the individual level. Aydemir and Robinson (2008) show the effect of the early 1990s recession in Canada on the probability of leaving for different cohorts of migrants. They find that the probability of leaving rose rapidly the closer the cohort’s entry date to this recession. However, this effect was not durable despite the persistence of high unemployment. Bijwaard and Wahba (2014) focus on the effect of income on migration duration in the Netherlands. They show that the intensities of return migration is U-shaped with respect to migrant income. Based on the same data, Bijwaard et al. (2014) find that unemployment shortens immigration duration, while re-employment delays returns. Bellemare (2007) and Constant and Massey (2003) also find a negative selection in terms of employment outcomes in return migration from Germany. Also concerning Germany, Kırdar (2009) shows that immigrants who have been unemployed for less than 3 years are more likely to return, but that long-term unemployed immigrants are more likely to stay. Another strand of the literature looks, however, at short-run business cycle determinants of emigration or immigration. In particular, Beine et al. (2013) use bilateral migration data to show that it is driven by relative differences in business cycles or employment prospects, along with some long-run determinants (wage differences). Docquier et al. (2014) find that economic growth in destination countries is the main economic generator of economic opportunities. These results appear to be relatively consistent with other prior studies that were generally based on one country at a time (Coulombe 2006; Bertoli et al. 2013; McKenzie et al. 2014). Our paper departs from the rest of the literature by studying the link between short-run macroeconomic factors and out-migration specifically. To some extent, our work is relatively close to that of Beine et al. (2013). However, they focus on all migrants from one country to another, thus using data which includes and probably represents mainly natives. Their work cannot tell specifically how non-native residents (whom we refer to as out-migrants in our study) behave when faced with economic shocks. As mentioned above, this neglected issue is very important with regard to policy, as policymakers in some host countries would be interested in knowing how foreigners per se behave when faced with a shock, as this would enable them to adjust their exit-policies accordingly. We use out-migration data from the OECD IMS database. The data have a bilateral dimension as they represent the OECD host countries’ declarations of out-migrations by nationality of origin. OECD Data on migration outflows have been overlooked so far because of the heterogeneity of the country sources registering these flows. To account for this caveat, we rely systematically on within-reporting-country variations. Now, one expects migration flows to usually be driven by three types of factors: short-run factors, long-run determinants, and policy factors. Since we aim in particular to measure the effects of short-run factors on out-migration, we concentrate on Schengen and EU countries. By doing so, we select a dataset of countries where long-run factors (differences in wages, benefits, cultural differences, etc...) should not play a major role and where the movement of people is free from binding policy measures. We show in particular that out-migration is counter-cyclical in the case of the host country: more precisely, a 10-%-point increase in unemployment in some resident countries appears to increase outflows by around 5.5 % points. Since this result holds within the Schengen area where no barriers are set against the movement of EU citizens, it cannot be due to a hardening of migration policies. It arises from the migrant’s willingness to exit a country in a crisis. Furthermore, to the extent that out-migration is also representative of return migration, we find it to be pro-cyclical for the country of origin: low unemployment at home encourages nationals residing in foreign countries to move back home. In Sect. 2, we describe the data. Section 3 presents some stylized facts and the empirical strategy used. The results are detailed in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",5
153,1,Review of World Economics,09 November 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-016-0271-z,Modelling the volatility of commodities prices using a stochastic volatility model with random level shifts,February 2017,Dennis Alvaro,Ángel Guillén,Gabriel Rodríguez,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The volatility of commodity prices such as oil or minerals is an important issue for small open economies that depend on raw materials. For example, in many Latin American countries, the volatility of commodities can affect the operating costs or investment schedules of businesses in the primary sector. At the macroeconomic level, high volatility in these markets can produce changes in the current account and in capital inflows, or, on the side of importers, increase uncertainty regarding production costs and inflation. Therefore, modeling volatility of commodity prices would be useful for private agents and policy makers. For the former, it gives valuable information for better options contracts that allow hedging under great uncertainty, while for the latter, it can aid in a better understanding of business cycles given the correlation between mineral price fluctuations, capital inflows, and investment expectations. The empirical literature on the volatility of commodities has been extended as a result of its implications for the real economy, especially in those small open economies that depend heavily on the fluctuations of their terms of trade, such as the case of Latin American countries. Thus, studies like Ferderer (1997) find evidence of how oil price volatility affects economic growth through a general increase in uncertainty, which is a mechanism additional to the effect of an oil price increase on inflation. In that vein, Guo and Kliesen (2005) and Jacks et al. (2011) find that an increase in the volatility of commodities has a significant negative impact on economic growth, particularly in countries with a strong dependence on commodities in their export basket. This is important especially in Latin America where commodities represent a significant share of exports in the region. Thus, the volatility of commodities affects the terms of trade, which account for a significant portion of the variance of GDP in small open economies.Footnote 1 For instance, Cavalcanti et al. (2015) find negative effects of the volatility of commodities terms of trade on economic growth, that is explained by lower accumulation of human and physical capital given the increased uncertainty. An important aspect of the commodities market is its similarity to the financial markets. There exist commodity stocks markets and commodity future markets where a high degree of speculation mixes with fundamentals. Thus, the pioneering work of Brennan and Schwartz (1985) analyzes the stochastic nature of natural resources prices and applies stochastic optimal control to the valuation of investment projects such as they were financial assets. Since then, a lot of work has been deployed using a financial approach to evaluate the behavior of commodity prices and in particular its volatility. Some relevant empirical works are Jaffe (1989), which highlights the role of gold or precious metals in diversified portfolios and Ankrim and Hensel (1993), which focuses on the similarities between commodity and real estate investment as inflation hedges. Moreover, Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2006) describe the financial properties of commodity-based financial instruments such as futures and find similar behavior to an equity risk premium and a negative correlation with other instruments. All these financial studies evaluate volatility dynamics as crucial for their results. Also, evaluation of volatility behavior alone is found in different studies such as that of Askari and Krichene (2008), who find that oil price is very volatile and sensitive to small shocks even though assumptions about market fundamentals hold. Further, Brunetti and Gilbert (1995) study the volatility of industrial metals from 1972 to 1995 and find that volatility does not increase during that period, which runs contrary to common opinion. All these findings suggest that commodity prices evolve quite similarly to other financial series. One of the most important stylized facts in the study of volatility is the presence of persistence; namely, unforeseen shocks in these markets have long memory and end up being important many periods later. Therefore, a high volatility persistence generates a distortion in the perceptions of the agents and the pricing of commodity contingent claims. On the other hand, the level of uncertainty is amplified as well as the negative impacts on aggregate output, specially in those economies with a strong dependence on raw materials. However, there is evidence that long-memory volatility of commodities can be affected if one takes into account structural breaks, as revealed by the work of Ewing and Malik (2010) and Vivian and Wohar (2012). In both cases, the authors apply a GARCH model to high frequency data with an iterated cumulative sums of squares to identify structural breaks in the volatility following the methodology of Inclan and Tiao (1994). The former find a drastic reduction of the volatility persistence of oil prices after including structural breaks. While, in the case of the latter, the results shows a reduction of volatility only for some commodities and the remaining of persistence in the short time for commodities strongly linked to financial markets such as energy or precious metals. From a long-term perspective, Calvo-González et al. (2010) use lower frequency data and find a central role of breaks to explain the increases and declines of commodity prices volatility, which are associated with periods of big crisis, wars or drastic changes in conditions of demand and supply of commodities. Thus, there is interesting evidence in favor of the presence of structural breaks that often have little probability of occurrence but generate a big impact on the volatility of commodity markets. Overall, the study of long memory and structural breaks is not unique to the commodity markets, but extends to various financial markets.Footnote 2 The evidence tends to suggest that the structural breaks, in the form of random level shifts, drive the process of the volatility of prices, while the property of long memory seems a case of spurious identification.Footnote 3
 Our study is related to the literature aforementioned that analyze the volatility of commodity prices considering the existence of structural breaks in the form of random level shifts and long-memory process. We estimate a stochastic volatility (SV) model with random level shifts (RLS) as proposed by Qu and Perron (2013) that allows one to decompose the volatility into two unobservable components: a long-term component, which includes the random level shifts of the commodities markets, and a stationary short-term component modelled as an \(AR\left( 1\right)\) process that decays quickly over time.Footnote 4 Our approach contributes to the literature in several aspects. First, we use a test of spurious long memory proposed by Qu (2011) in order to contrast the presence of a genuine long-memory process in the volatility of commodities. Second, we estimate the two unobserved components as latent variables: a random level shift and a short-term component. Third, we evaluate the relative contribution of each component to the overall volatility and we can determine if the random level shifts are certainly the main source of variation in the commodity price volatility. Finally, having the two unobserved components, we may evaluate their level of correlation with macroeconomic variables in small open (Latin American) economies. Therefore, we can determine the comovements of each component with the business cycle fluctuations. We focus on modeling the volatility of the overall commodities market and some sectors that have huge repercussions on the global economy (e.g. industrial metals, oil, gold). To this end, we study commodity markets indexes, in particular the Standard & Poors Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (hereinafter S&P GSCI). As documented in Indices (2014), the S&P GSCI is a benchmark for investment in the commodity markets and a measure of commodity market performance over time. It is also a tradable index that is readily accessible to market participants, so we take this index as the best approximation of commodity market performance. The composition of this index is dominated by energy commodities, where oil accounts for 66% of the total index. Other commodities make up far less of the total; for instance, industrial metal and precious metals represent only 7 and 3% of the index, respectively. For this reason, we analyze the volatility of the commodity index as a whole, and of certain indexes that compose it, such as the gold, oil, industrial metals, agriculture, and livestock indexes. The estimation of the SV model with RLS produce interesting results respect to the behavior of volatility in commodity markets. First, we found that all series analyzed present an apparent long-memory process in volatility, but disappear after the inclusion of the random level shifts. This result contrasts with the persistence of long memory after structural breaks estimated in Vivian and Wohar (2012). Second, we find that random level shifts contribute in higher proportion to the overall volatility in comparison with the short-term component. Therefore, the estimation and identification of the random level shifts represents a valuable exercise to estimate the proper level of volatility in commodity markets. Third, this long-term component explains by far the transmission of volatility to business-cycle variables in economies with a strong dependence on commodities as the Latin-American countries. Our work seeks to determine whether long memory exists in commodity-return volatility series, or whether a short-memory process with random level shifts applies. Commodity prices and volatilities affect portfolio decisions and business cycles, especially in Latin America countries which have a high dependence on commodities in the trade balance,Footnote 5 but little work has been done on modelling commodity prices series using econometric techniques. There are some studies relating to volatility in stock markets in Latin American countries such as De Santis et al. (1997), Aggarwal et al. (1999) and Abugri (2008). On the other hand, the commodities markets have been studied in the framework of boom and bust cycles like Gruss (2014). Our study is an attempt to fill a gap in this line of research by analyzing commodity volatilities. Our findings are relevant for both private and public agents in the Latin American region. For example, the presence of random level shifts changes the traditional construction of a hedge. In the case of persistence of the volatility, the hedge faces more dispersion, because any shock over the risky commodity asset is expected to affect its future value for a long period. However, the identification of a level shift brings new information that allows adjustment to the expected volatility, while for the rest of the shocks are expected to have a short memory. Therefore, the dispersion is reduced. The remainder of this document is structured as follows. Section 2 characterizes some features of the commodities volatility; Sect. 3 describes the applied methodology; Sect. 4 contains results for the overall index and for each kind of commodity, as well as an analysis of business cycle comovements. Finally, Sect. 5 presents the conclusions. An Online Appendix includes some additional Tables and Figures.",1
153,1,Review of World Economics,26 September 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-016-0268-7,Volatility spillover effects in interbank money markets,February 2017,Pedro Pires Ribeiro,José Dias Curto,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The interbank money market (IMM) is a crucial component of the financial system given its contribution to the market efficiency and market discipline, its significant impact on the financial stability and on financing conditions in the economy and its important role in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy decisions to the real economy. With the financial crisis that erupted in 2007 money markets came under severe stress. It was in the United States subprime market that this crisis had its origins. In fact, the opacity in balance sheets of some banks and the uncertainty about the real value of their assets led to sharp increases in funding costs to unprecedented levels. These tensions spread worldwide since some financial institutions were directly exposed to toxic subprime assets, while others were unable to get liquidity in order to honor committed credit lines. Consequently, first, in August 2007, and later on, in autumn 2008 with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, key indicators of money market stress, such as the differential between 3-month unsecured interbank rates and overnight index swap (OIS) rates as well as the spread between unsecured and secured interbank interest rates, jumped dramatically, signaling concerns over the weakening of the banks’ ability to raise funds at sustainable levels. The United Kingdom faced directly the effects of this financial crisis with the Northern Rock bank, which was the first British large commercial bank requiring emergency government funding as a result of the US subprime mortgage situation that dried up the securitization markets. In turn, aiming to prevent similar liquidity difficulties in the euro area, in October 2008, the Eurosystem introduced a fixed rate full allotment regime in its refinancing operations. Nevertheless, this increase in liquidity did not lead banks to inject more funds into the real economy, since they opted for depositing the excess resources instead of lending them. Accordingly, the turbulence caused by the subprime mortgage business also hit the euro zone money market. Overall, since the onset of the subprime crisis, there was a higher preference for secured rather than unsecured funding. This trend was later exacerbated by the emergence of the euro area sovereign debt crisis that had negative effects on the integration of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), by contributing to the divergent risk perception among euro zone sovereign borrowers and to an increasing fragmentation associated with significant government bond yield differentials. In this period, once again, the different currency spreads between 3-month LIBOR and OIS rates rose as the euro area debt crisis intensified. Actually, the financial distress originating from the subprime crisis and the ensuing European sovereign debt crisis had effects on other regions. For instance, in this period, it was observed an appreciation of the Swiss franc against other important currencies, insofar as this currency has been a safe haven for investors during bouts of risk aversion. In response, from 2011 to 2015, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) implemented an exchange rate peg with the EUR to prevent further appreciations. At the same time, these financial crises as well as specific fragilities also affected the Japanese economy. Therefore, in April 2013, the Bank of Japan announced the largest liquidity operation ever carried out by a Central Bank, aiming to double the monetary base and, consequently, to stimulate the economic growth and to put an end to the long period of deflation. On the whole, while financial markets around the world were in turmoil, the stance of monetary policy was chiefly driven to promote more favorable economic and financial conditions, with consequences not only on local economies, but also abroad since we live in a global marketplace. This is one of the reasons why several agents monitor the authorities’ interventions from different jurisdictions. In effect, among all the situations experienced over the last years, the most interesting fact is the perception that a specific event or action, which took place in a certain region, quickly spilled over to other economies with impacts on the respective money markets. Being aware of the relevance of this phenomenon, it is fundamental to develop efforts in order to explain these possible contagion effects. However, in what concerns the contagion risk across money markets, there is a scant literature produced, which reinforces the importance of exploring this theme. Hence, the ultimate purpose of this paper is to examine the potential for spillovers in IMM. In order to achieve this goal we use the extensive theory of multivariate time series models with special emphasis on Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (MGARCH) models as well as a modified version of the spillover index methodology originally developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012, 2014), hereafter designated by D&Y spillover measure that, in our case, considers as input the conditional variances and covariances estimated from MGARCH models. MGARCH models have great intuitive and empirical appeal since they allow modeling the relationships among different markets and are useful in scenario and sensitivity analyses. In particular, we apply the Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) GARCH model of Bollerslev (1990), the Vector Autoregressive Moving Average (VARMA) GARCH model of Ling and McAleer (2003),Footnote 1 the Asymmetric VARMA-GARCH (VARMA-AGARCH) model of McAleer et al. (2009) and the Asymmetric Generalized Dynamic Conditional Correlation (AG-DCC) GARCH model of Cappiello et al. (2006). As a complementary approach, the D&Y spillover measure is able to capture the linkages across money markets by showing the structure and intensity of the degree of contagion among them and providing valuable information on the direction and extent of their interactions. We focus on some of the most representative IMM, namely on the United States (US), euro area (EUR), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland (SWL) and Japan (JPN) and the variable used to assess the behavior of time-varying risk premia in money markets is the spread between the 3-month unsecured money market rates and OIS rates. The sample period underpinning the empirical analysis spans from 2006 to 2015. Prior to our research, Ebrahim (2000) found evidence of price and volatility spillovers between the foreign exchange and associated money markets, but sustained that correlations are low. Applying vector autoregressive (VAR) models and taking into account data on repo spreads, Abbassi and Schnabel (2009) mention that, from March 2002 to September 2008, shocks to one money market were transmitted to other markets and document that repo differentials decreased in reaction to the Central Banks liquidity provision. Ji (2012) explores the dynamic linkages of money markets from March 2006 to November 2008 and concludes that the subprime financial crisis influenced the degree of money markets integration. Tamakoshi and Hamori (2013) investigate the integration of the LIBOR rates for the three major European currencies and their findings suggest that while the subprime financial crisis increased the degree of integration, the euro zone sovereign debt crisis reduced the dynamic correlations for each pair of LIBOR rates. Additionally, Tamakoshi and Hamori (2014) examine volatility and mean transmissions between US and EUR LIBOR-OIS spreads from January 2005 to June 2011 and do not detect causality-in-mean and causality-in-variance between these differentials. Although few authors have specifically addressed our investigation scope, this research is also related to other literature strands. Firstly, it is associated with studies that test whether contagion actually occurred during financial crises and that analyze through what channels the shocks were propagated to other regions (see, e.g., van Horen et al. 2006; Longstaff 2010 or Haß et al. 2014). By contrast, if we draw attention to investigations about IMM, there are a number of works centered on the economic or financial turmoil in one specific area, striving to explain its causes and consequences (see, e.g., Gefang et al. 2011). Also, other literature identifies the best indicators to capture distress in money markets (Taylor and Williams 2009 or Kliesen et al. 2012). Further, some authors are concerned about the risk breakdown in money market rates, trying to disentangle credit risk from liquidity risk (see, e.g., Brunnermeier 2009). There is another group that has been testing the effectiveness of the measures adopted by Central Banks to cool down the strains in money markets (see, e.g., McAndrews et al. 2008; Sack and Meyer 2008 or Taylor and Williams 2009). Finally, other studies examine the contagion phenomenon among the major banks and between financial institutions and Sovereigns (see, e.g., Memmel and Sachs 2013). All in all, the contribution of this investigation is threefold. First, this paper sheds new light on the vast literature about the contagion phenomenon in financial markets, offering evidence related to spillovers across IMM and discussing the consequences associated with these effects. In fact, taken together, our findings sustain relevant interconnections across the major money markets and point towards the existence of spillovers that tend to be more pronounced in periods of heightened turbulence. In addition, we emphasize the role of dynamic and time-varying linkages and document that conditional variances and correlations exhibit asymmetries. Second, our aim is accomplished by applying alternative MGARCH models and by means of a modified version of the D&Y volatility spillover measure that has as input the conditional variances and covariances estimated from MGARCH models, which constitutes a novelty and a relevant methodological enhancement in the related literature. Undeniably, this strategy stresses the pertinence of covariances in the transmission mechanism of volatility spillover. Also, the connectedness index stemming from this framework can be used as a tool of monetary policy and as an early warning indicator for the implementation of time-varying macro prudential policies, which increases its potential and attractiveness. Third, in a context of a growing trend for the financial markets integration, where a rise in international capital flows implies a higher possibility of shocks transmission, our conclusions have a prominent economic and financial message as well as a practical use, being of particular interest for diverse agents. From a financial stability perspective that should concern policy makers, it is essential to realize how shocks are propagated in order to determine the persistence and magnitude of their effects over time. Moreover, linkages across markets can affect the success with which policies are implemented and underline the importance of tracking the factors that impact the regular functioning of money markets, especially in consequence of systemic events. At the same time, investors may improve their portfolio management and diversification strategies by exploiting the increased knowledge regarding the interactions across the several money markets. The layout of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains the indicator adopted to gauge financial strains in IMM and characterizes its evolution over the sample period.

Umana Dajud (2013) showed that political distance, i.e. the correlation between countries’ voting behavior at the United Nations’ General Assembly, has a negative impact on bilateral trade; Michaels and Zhi (2010) showed that when France and the US disagreed over war in Iraq at the UN, their bilateral trade fell; Fuchs and Klann (2013) showed that countries officially receiving the Dalai Lama at the highest political level see their exports to China fall; and Fisman et al. (2014) that the stock prices of Japanese companies with high China exposure suffer when Sino-Japanese relations suddenly deteriorate, as during the Senkaku Island dispute. Heilmann (2016) showed that consumer boycotts resulting from political events, such as the boycott of Danish goods by Muslim countries following the publication of a Muhammad comic in 2005, have strong negative effects on bilateral trade. One country whose trade is particularly affected by international politics is Israel. According to the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it has diplomatic ties only with 158 out of 192 UN member states. The Arab League, i.e. 22 Middle Eastern and African countries, has maintained a boycott of Israeli companies and goods since the founding of Israel in 1948.Footnote 1 The boycott prohibits citizens from buying from, selling to, or entering into a business contract with either the Israeli government or an Israeli citizen. It is not limited to the Arab League since four Latin-American countries have cut trade ties with Israel due to governments’ political leaning or after conflicts such as the June 2010 Gaza flotilla raid.Footnote 2

Footnote 3
 In theory, the boycott should make trade between Israel and boycott countries nonexistent. Unlike the consumer boycotts examined by Heilmann (2016), the Arab League Boycott is an official government policy. According to Adelman (2008) the boycott has been enforced though instruments such as customs legislation requiring strict certificates of origin, ship regulations, a blacklist of companies, as well as prison sentences for offending businessmen. According to the Jerusalem Post (2006) the Office of the Arab Boycott, based in Damascus, had a blacklist of 8500 companies that were dealing with Israeli companies or trading at the Haifa port. Yet its asymmetry, i.e. Israel being open to trade with boycott countries,Footnote 4 and its geography, i.e. Israel being nearby many boycott countries, make it hard to enforce it completely. Moreover enthusiasm for the boycott and its enforcement have varied over the years. While support decreased with the Oslo peace process in the 1990s, it regained strength during the Second Intifada in the early 2000 s after the failure of the Camp David negotiations (Adelman 2008). Anecdotal evidence suggests that some trade has been taking place. In a 2005 interview, Gil Feiler, director of a Tel Aviv consultancy specializing in Arab markets and economics professor at Bar Ilan University, suggested that the trade was worth around US$400 million a year and that it consisted mostly of agricultural equipment, animal vaccines and technological components (Mortimer 2005). More recently Haaretz (2012) reported that Israel had exported Internet surveillance and monitoring equipment to Iran over five years through a Danish distributor, electricity to Indonesia using Singapore as a business base, shingles to Dubai for its Palm Islands through an Italian roofing tile company, and plastic products such as disposable utensils and food packaging to Saudi Arabia through US-registered subsidiaries (Sadeh 2012). The Associated Press (2005) suggested that exports may be transhipped via Cyprus or the Netherlands, for example, which list the shipments as local exports. It also cites Gil Feiler saying that “Arabs of Lebanese origin in Israel sell counterfeit Lebanese certificates of origin complete with forged government stamps. Some Israeli factories have departments of so-called quality control - where any Hebrew writing or Made in Israel marks are removed from product components.” The Jerusalem Post (2006) suggested that a company provides customers with US mailing addresses where Israeli products can be sent. It then exchanges the Israeli postal stamped packaging for a US-stamped package and sends it on to its Arab destination. Finally, Kleiman (1998) looked into the trade data and concluded that the existence of a substantial clandestine trade by Israel with the Arab countries was doubtful, despite rumors of rerouting via Cyprus, Egypt, and Turkey. In this paper we dig into official trade statistics from UN Comtrade to investigate trade between Israel and its boycott countries. Israel’s export statistics suggest that Israel exported more than $6.4 billion worth of merchandise to boycott countries between 1962 and 2012, or 0.74% of total Israeli exports. The illicit, or boycott-avoiding, nature of the trade is confirmed by the fact that most boycott countries do not to report imports from Israel, creating a gap between the two countries’ trade statistics. We find that electronic exports to Malaysia account for the lion’s share of this gap and can be matched with Malaysia’s official statistics on imports from Unspecified countries, thus highlighting one way by which this trade is kept below the radar. Using data on world input-output production linkages (TiVA), we also show that boycott countries imported Israeli value-added embedded in other countries’ exports at a rate that is no different from that of non-boycott countries, suggesting that international supply chains may render boycotts ineffective. Nonetheless, our estimates suggest that Israeli exports to boycott countries are still about 90% lower than they would be absent the boycott. If Israel had exported to boycott countries proportionally to their GDP in 2012, for example, total Israeli exports would have been $59.8 billion rather than $59 billion, which is an increase worth around 0.3% of GDP. Our paper contributes to the empirical literature on the effectiveness of sanctions in reducing trade. Hufbauer et al. (2007) looked at more than 200 sanction episodes up to 2000 and found that sanctions are less likely to succeed when they are applied by less-important or antagonistic countries. Other studies include Caruso (2003), who showed that comprehensive US sanctions have a negative impact on trade with target countries, Levy (1999) who showed that the sanctions applied in the 1980 s to push for the end of apartheid had little impact on South Africa’s trade, and Haidar et al. (2015) who showed that Iranian exporters have diverted trade from the US and EU to other destinations after sanctions were imposed to deter Iran’s nuclear ambitions. It also contributes to the literature on illicit trade pioneered by Fisman and Wei (2004) who showed that asymmetric trade barriers such as high import tariffs often create a trade gap between imports and exports, as exporters hide or under-invoice their shipments to avoid import tariffs. Other studies have shown that corruption in the trade-barrier country makes illicit trade even more prevalent [e.g. Fisman and Wei (2009)], and it’s also possible to find traces of illicit trade in stock-market reactions to news (DellaVigna and Ferrara 2010). Our paper follows this line of work to uncover and quantify exports from Israel to boycott countries. In doing so it also provides a case study to complement our understanding of the role of politics and foreign policy in international trade. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we describe the data and present descriptive statistics on the boycott-avoiding trade. In Sect. 3 we discuss estimates of the effect of the boycott on Israel’s exports and Sect. 4 concludes.",3

153,2,Review of World Economics,31 January 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0277-1,Export survival and the dynamics of experience,May 2017,Céline Carrère,Vanessa Strauss-Kahn,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Recent studies covering different countries and periods have revealed the short duration of trade flows.Footnote 1 We focus here on exports of 114 developing countries to the OECD market over the 1962–2009 period at the SITC 5-digit level (around 1200 products) and observe similar patterns.Footnote 2 Exports at the product-country level are very short-lived: 56% do not survive the first year in the OECD market, while 84% are dead after five years. The situation is even worse for pioneer exportsFootnote 3: 75% do not survive their first year in OECD markets. Following Besedeš and Prusa (2011), we believe that what matters for the trade deepening and export growth of developing countries is export survival and not just foreign market entry. Our aim is therefore to identify factors that improve the survival of developing countries’ exports in developed economies. Export experience is a likely candidate. Case studies on developing countries’ trade practices identify export experience in regional markets as a way to test products and export capability before reaching and building long term relationships with more demanding markets. For example, in a World Bank survey on African export survival (World bank 2012), most respondents suggested an export strategy where experience matters: products are first tested on the domestic market, then exported to regional markets before reaching more distant markets. Similarly, Artopoulos et al. (2013) explore factors enabling Argentinian firms to export successfully to developed countries. They find that prior export experience is essential to capture export knowledge and build new export business practices.Footnote 4 While the role of experience in the survival of exports has recently been highlighted in the literature (Albornoz et al. 2012, 2016; Araujo et al. 2016), little is known about the specificities of experience in terms of dynamics, timing and location. Moreover, evidence on survival of new pioneer products is lacking. Our aim in this paper is to understand the role and patterns of export experience on long term survival of pioneer export products. We focus on products being exported to the OECD for the first time by a developing country (i.e., pioneer exports at the product-country level) and empirically explore the impact of prior export experience in non-OECD countries on subsequent export survival in the OECD.Footnote 5 We provide evidence on the dynamic of exports and the depreciation of experience. We first rely on the well-known Cox (1972) survival model at the product-country level for 114 developing countries over the 1962–2009 period (e.g. Besedeš and Prusa 2006a, b; Brenton et al. 2010). We also propose an alternative and complementary methodology, a linear model of probability with fixed effects (Araujo et al. 2016). In both models, we discuss identification issues and account for unobserved heterogeneity and potential selection bias. Export experience acquired on foreign markets increases the likelihood of long term export success in subsequent markets because it helps reduce the uncertainty associated with a trade relationship. This occurs through two main channels: learning by exporting (e.g. exporters learn about alternative ways to ship products and deal with distributors, customs regulations, logistics, banking and international laws, international marketing and design) and signaling (e.g., the exporter can comply with foreign demand and be an unfailing supplier). While we do not aim at disentangling these channels, both imply that prior trade experience may enhance survival (see Sect. 2.2 for a further discussion). We find that experience matters—1 year of export experience prior to reaching the OECD drastically decreases the export hazard rate. The experience does not need to last long, however: while acquiring experience for two consecutive years prior to serving the OECD enhances survival, getting more years of experience does not confer any additional benefit. Moreover, the benefit of experience depreciates rapidly with time: a break in export experience prior to entering the OECD lessens the advantage of experience. Whereas export experience acquired two or three years before entering the OECD still matters for survival, years of experience gained further back into the past have no impact on export hazard rates. Finally, the role of prior export experience is particularly relevant for survival in the first two years upon entry into the OECD. Export experience is first acquired in the closest non-OECD market. With time, it occurs in more distant, richer, and less accessible markets. We find, however, that the characteristics of the non-OECD partner do not impact export duration on the OECD market directly. What matters is the experience per se—i.e., to learn and show your export capability at the country of origin-product level. A growing literature investigates the role of export experience on export size and on the probability of export failure. Dutt (2014) focus on country-level data and include a measure of export experience in the gravity equation. They find that having previous export experience leads to a sharp increase in bilateral trade. Albornoz et al. (2016) study the impact of fixed and sunk costs on the probability of a firm’s survival upon entry in a new market and use export experience as a proxy for costs. Araujo et al. (2016) analyze a framework where building reputations as a response to incomplete information is crucial and where export experience (as well as the quality of institutions) alleviates contractual issues. We add to this literature by decomposing the dynamic of experience and investigating the role of prior dynamic experience on survival. We go beyond the idea of having some experience or not prior to entering a new market, and explore the length of experience, the role of breaks in experience and, importantly, the characteristics of the countries in which that experience is acquired. Our work is also related to recent empirical papers on the dynamic of firm’s entry into new foreign markets. These papers shed light on the role of prior export experience in fostering entry into subsequent markets (Eaton et al. 2008; Albornoz et al. 2012; Lawless 2013; Ozler et al. 2009), but do not provide insights into the role of experience on export duration.Footnote 6 The literature on the determinants of export survival has little to say on the topic (Besedeš and Prusa 2006a, b; Nitsch 2009; Volpe and Carballo 2008; Brenton et al. 2010; Fugazza and Molina 2011; Görg et al. 2012; Cadot et al. 2013), as none of the above studies investigates the dynamic of prior export experience. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 exposes the theoretical framework. Section 3 focuses on the empirical strategy. We present both the Cox (1972) survival model and the linear probability model, and discuss identification issues. Section 4 describes data and basic export survival analysis. Section 5 examines the dynamic of experience and shows consistent results across specifications. Section 6 investigates the geographic dynamic of experience and asks whether the characteristics of the countries in which exporters have acquired experience matter for survival. It also proposes several robustness checks. Section 7 concludes.",19
153,2,Review of World Economics,03 October 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-016-0269-6,The reverse home-market effect in exports: a cross-country study of the extensive margin of exports,May 2017,Hege Medin,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"It is a well-known empirical regularity that small countries are more open than large ones in the sense that they export a larger share of their output (Rose 2006; Spolaore and Wacziarg 2005; Snorrason 2012). Therefore, it can appear uncontroversial to hypothesise that the proportion of firms that export (henceforth; the extensive margin of export) in manufacturing industries is higher in small countries than in large ones.Footnote 1 However, very little empirical evidence exists with regards to this hypothesis, and it contrasts predictions from many models advocating the home-market effect (HME)—an influential notion in new trade theory. In this article I argue that an HME in the number of manufacturing firms can coexists with a reverse HME in the number of exporters. As a consequence, in manufacturing industries, small countries will have larger extensive margins of export than large ones—a claim I support empirically. The HME can be described as follows: A country with low domestic demand for manufactured goods will have lower profitability of those goods because, in the presence of trade costs, a small home-market limits the possibility of making use of increasing returns to scale (IRS). In turn, fewer manufacturing firms will locate in a country like that, so the country will get a share of the world’s total number of such firms that is lower than its share of income (Helpman and Krugman 1985, pp. 205–209, henceforth: HK 1985).Footnote 2 The HK 1985 framework has become a widely used benchmark model in international trade theory, and the HME has been found to be robust to many different model specifications (Felbermayr and Jung 2012). One example is the widely used extension of HK 1985 where firm-level differences in marginal costs of the Melitz (2003) type are incorporated. See e.g. Baldwin and Forslid (2010, henceforth: BF 2010) for a model like that. The HME does not only apply to the number of firms, but also to the number of exporters, and the models predict that the extensive margin of export in manufacturing industries is independent of the size of the home- and export-market.Footnote 3
 Ceteris paribus, countries that are small (in terms of GDP) have lower domestic demand for any good, including manufacturing goods. Therefore, the HME hypothesis has led to concern as to whether small countries will have little production and export such goods (or, alternatively, lower GDP per capita). Low production may be worrisome for policymakers in small countries, as industries characterised by IRS, by their nature, are particularly profitable and can be important for long-term growth (see e.g. Romer 1986). Low export can be equally worrisome, as exporting has the potential of creating several positive effects that improve productivity in individual exporters as well as in the economy as a whole (see e.g. Melitz and Redding 2014). However, from all over the world there are small countries whose exports consist of a large share of manufactured goods. Examples include Bangladesh (0.94), Slovenia (0.85), Botswana (0.80), or El Salvador (0.73).Footnote 4 Furthermore, studies show that small countries in general do not have lower GDP per capita or growth than large ones (Easterly and Kraay 2000; Rose 2006; Alesina et al. 2005). Being a small country is perhaps not as great a disadvantage as indicated by the literature on the HME. The theoretical evidence for the HME is indeed ambiguous—several contributions have shown that it does not necessarily arise in models studying IRS industries. One important assumption driving the HME in HK 1985/BF 2010 is that firms can freely establish in both countries. Medin (2003) presented a model akin to HK 1985/BF 2010 where there are de facto restrictions on firm establishment. A reverse HME in the number of exporters appears—the small country gets a share of the world’s number of exporters that is higher than its income share. Another important assumption driving the HME is that consumers don’t care about the country of origin of goods per se. This can e.g. be seen in a model presented in Head et al. (2002), where goods are differentiated by countries. A reverse HME may appear in the number of exporters as well as in the number of firms.Footnote 5
 A problem with the standard models is that they do not distinguish between an HME in the number of firms and in the number of exporters. Whereas an HME in the former may seem reasonable, perhaps more plausible when it comes to the latter is a reverse HME because exporters in small countries benefit from access to a large foreign market—a mechanism that is not taken into account in the standard HME models.Footnote 6 In this article I incorporate this mechanism into a model building on HK 1985/BF 2010. I contribute to new trade theory by showing how an HME in the number of firms can coexist with a reverse HME in the number of exporters. To my knowledge, no other articles discuss this dichotomy. In the model, I combine the idea of free entry, found in e.g. HK 1985/BF 2010, with the idea of restricted entry, found in e.g. Medin (2003). Free entry of firms within industries yields the HME in the number of firms. The reverse HME in the number of exporters is caused by restricted entry of industries, together with two other assumptions similar to those made in Venables (1994): consumers value variety, not only of goods within the same industry as in the standard models, but also of goods from different industries; and industries are differentiated by country of origin. In practice this means that the model incorporates the idea of country-level product differentiation, found in e.g. Head et al. (2002). The coexistence of an HME in the number of firms and a reverse HME in the number of exporters implies that the extensive margin of exports decrease with the size of the home-market relative to that of the export-market—a prediction that contrasts with standard models like HK 1985 and BF 2010. The empirical evidence of the HME is also ambiguous. Early empirical contributions are surveyed in Head and Mayer (2004). They conclude: ‘One can see some support for HMEs in some industries in some specifications. However reverse HMEs … are more frequent.’ (p. 2642). Conclusions vary also in more recent contributions. For example, Crozet and Trionfetti (2008) find some evidence of HMEs, but the economic significance is small: on average, the HME influenced specialization in only about 12.5 % of the 25 countries studied, and in these countries it was found to influence specialization in 62 % of the manufacturing activity. Hanson and Xiang (2004) find strong empirical support for the HME in industries characterised by high transport costs and more differentiated products. However, this has been questioned by Pham et al. (2014), who apply different methodological procedures to the same data and find little evidence of an HME. In this article I contribute to the empirical trade literature by testing the prediction of higher extensive margins of export in relatively small countries.Footnote 7 To my knowledge only one other study has done this. ISGEP (2008) compares firm level data on exporters and non-exporters between 14 countries and finds a negative relationship (p. 604). However, the ISGEP study covers only a small number of countries, and the data are not designed for comparisons among countries. In this article, I use comparable data on firm level exports of manufactured goods for 121 countries. The results are in line with those from ISGEP (2008) and show that the extensive margin is significantly larger in small countries: for the average country, a doubling of the size of the home-market relative to the size of the export-market is associated with a 15.1 % decrease in the extensive margin. The article is organised as follows: Sect. 2 presents the theoretical model and compares it to the standard models, Sect. 3 presents the empirical evidence, and Sect. 4 offers concluding remarks.",3
153,2,Review of World Economics,31 August 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-016-0266-9,Explaining the size differences of exporter premia: theory and evidence,May 2017,Ingo Geishecker,Philipp J. H. Schröder,Allan Sørensen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The existence of persistent productivity dispersion is a vivid research topic in fields ranging from macroeconomics to industrial organization. Maybe the most prominent manifestation of such productivity dispersions stems from the field of international economics, namely the stylized fact of positive exporter premia in terms of productivity or size and sales.Footnote 1 Combined with elegant new theories (e.g. Melitz 2003) exporter productivity premia (EPP)—as well as the closely related exporter firm size or sales premia (ESP)—have intrigued empirical and theoretical researchers in international economics for the past decades; see Greenaway and Kneller (2007), Wagner (2007, 2012), Redding (2011) and Bernard et al. (2012) for surveys. Most recently Mrázová et al. (2015) have been able to map fundamental theoretical conditions under which productivity and sales distributions are linked, this being of particular importance since sales distributions are much easier to observe. Despite the impressive volume of analyses, the central question as to the underlying drivers of the EPP and ESP magnitude remains in fact open. Albeit, as has been pointed out by, inter alia, Syverson (2011), an understanding of the underlying drivers of the dispersion observed in the data is essential for many policy areas such as competition policy or government measures aiming at promoting productivity growth in the economy. In particular, the understanding of the EPP and ESP developed in this paper is an important stepping stone when thinking about effects and effectiveness of trade polices or export promotion policies. For example, larger EPP make it ceteris paribus more attractive in terms of production efficiency to design industrial policies that reallocate production resources (market shares) from non-exporters towards incumbent exporters. Viewed through this lens, optimal industrial policies (say export guarantees vs. general production subsidies) would in fact depend on the magnitude of the EPP.Footnote 2
 What determines the size of such premia and why is it that exporter premia vary so widely in magnitude? Empirically, exporter productivity premia range, for example in Europe, from 7 (0) % in Sweden to 58 (10) % in Belgium for identical pooled (fixed effects) estimation specifications on comparable data (ISGEP 2008; Table 4). At the sectoral level—the perspective taken in the present paper—the issue is even more pronounced.Footnote 3 For Denmark total factor productivity based fixed effects EPP estimates across 89 manufacturing sectors span from \(-38\) to 467 %. Similarly, the exporter sales premia ESP estimates span from \(-22\) to 278 %. On first sight, theory is silent on such differences, thus posing a challenge for the interpretation of empirical results.Footnote 4
 To be fair, short of classifying EPP and ESP differences in magnitude simply as idiosyncratic characteristics of sectors or differences in econometric estimation strategies, a number of renown empirical papers have elaborated on the issue. Typically, papers that report differences in EPP and ESP magnitude have addressed the issue by conducting additional investigation, for example by splitting samples and by providing plausible rationalizations; see e.g. Aw and Hwang (1995), Farinas and Martin-Marcos (2007), or Merino (2004). Similarly, ISGEP (2008) establishes and discusses intensively the identified size differences between country EPP, and Bellone et al. (2014) report larger EPP for Japan than for France.Footnote 5 Recently Powell and Wagner (2014) took a look at the issue of exporter premia size differences by examining the EPP along the productivity distribution via quantile regression. The current paper takes a different direction. We explore the link between a stylized heterogeneous firms trade model and the empirical patterns of EPP and ESP magnitude. In doing so, the paper contributes on three frontiers. First, we provide a theoretical underpinning of why and how sectoral EPP and ESP differ as driven by sector-specific characteristics in an adapted Melitz (2003) model. Previous theoretical literature has—despite of deriving productivity rankings of exporters and non-exporters—not examined the actual premia, i.e. the theoretical EPP or ESP. Second, in our empirical investigation, we construct (i.e. by structural estimation) the deep parameters pinpointed by the model. Obviously, the downside of guiding the empirical investigation within one specific model of firm heterogeniety is that it cannot capture all the empirical variation known to matter in the data. Still, we find considerable heterogeneity in the deep parameters across industries, which in turn results in substantial differences in EPP and ESP. For example, in our data, once the underlying industry characteristics suggested as the drivers of EPP and ESP magnitude by our theory are taken into consideration, then 43 % of the empirically observed cross-sectoral variation in TFP based EPP differences is accounted for. Thirdly, the paper is able to identify new and so far unreported empirical regularities, such as the effects from the underlying variation in productivity dispersion on the EPP and ESP. In sum, our findings offer first explanations for the substantial size differences in EPP and ESP that have been reported in the literature for over two decades. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces and calculates the sectoral EPP and ESP in a two-country symmetric multi-sector Melitz (2003) model augmented with Pareto-distributed productivities. We find that within the model larger sectoral EPP and ESP are linked to a larger degree of heterogeneity in the productivity distribution of a sector, higher trade costs (both fixed and variable), and for the ESP also to a larger within-sector elasticity of demand. Section 3 presents our data and empirical set-up. Based on 18 years of firm-level data for the universe of Danish firms, we provide structural estimates of the deep parameters identified in the theoretical model and subsequently we examine firm-level EPP and ESP estimations across 3-digit level industries. Our results are shown in Sect. 4 and document—in line with the model—the role of the underlying heterogeneity in productivity and the size of fixed export costs (measured relative to domestic production fixed costs) for the ESP and EPP. Moreover, we find a negative relation between the sectoral elasticity of demand and both exporter premia and cannot identify a clear relation between variable trade costs and the EPP and ESP. Section 5 discusses future empirical research and demonstrates that a sizable share of the sectoral EPP and ESP variation found in our data can be accounted for by the underlying industry characteristics suggested by our analysis. Section 6 summarizes.",3

153,2,Review of World Economics,19 January 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-016-0273-x,"Assessing aggregate reallocation effects with heterogeneous inputs, and evidence across countries",May 2017,Jon D. Samuels,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Aggregate productivity (TFP) and aggregate technology may differ due to market imperfections, frictions, and other non-technological factors.Footnote 1 Basu and Fernald (2002) connects aggregate TFP growth to welfare, while technological change corresponds to the more narrow concept of shifts in the economy’s production possibility frontier. Disentangling the two is important, in part, because economic innovation is captured in technology, while aggregate productivity embeds technology and the other non-technological factors. From an economic policy perspective, sluggish aggregate TFP growth due to low innovation rates may have substantially different policy implications than slow TFP growth driven by barriers to resource movement, for example. The purpose of this paper is to develop new estimates of the difference between aggregate productivity and aggregate technology across countries that take input heterogeneity into account. In the model presented below, the difference between TFP and technology is a reallocation effect. The basic role of reallocations in productivity growth has been understood at least since Denison et al. (1967). The intuition for the reallocation effect is that if an input is moved from a producer where the input has a low marginal product to a producer with a high marginal product, aggregate productivity improves without any underlying change in technology. Parsing reallocation effects from aggregate TFP is necessary to understand the sources and impediments to economic growth across countries. The approach developed in this paper starts with the premise that input heterogeneity across producers should be considered when assessing the impact of reallocations on aggregate productivity. The economic intuition for this is that input composition may be very different across producers, thus comparing overall industry wages, for example, may not provide sufficient detail to assess how marginal products compare across producing units. The exercise below gathers price data for detailed inputs across producers and conducts a reallocation exercise to quantify the role of reallocation in aggregate productivity under the assumption of marginal product pricing. The method closely follows that of Jorgenson et al. (1987) which uses detailed prices of labor, cross classified by skill of worker, and capital, classified by detailed asset to study aggregate productivity in the U.S.Footnote 2 The work in this paper builds off Jorgenson et al. (1987) to: 1) demonstrate the importance of accounting for input heterogeneity when measuring reallocation effects, 2) apply the methodology to provide new evidence on reallocation effects across countries, and 3) provide the industry sources of the aggregate reallocation effects across countries. This paper fits in a growing literature on the effects of reallocations and misallocation on aggregate productivity. Basu and Fernald (2002) conducts a reallocation exercise based on U.S. industry-level data and argues that reallocation of inputs accounts for a substantial portion of the difference between aggregate TFP and aggregate technology in the U.S. Their approach involves comparing prices paid for inputs across industries, but does not account for input heterogeneity.Footnote 3 On the other hand, their paper does account for the effects of pure economic profit (markups), which they estimate to be small. Due to the finding that the effect of pure rents on measures of productivity growth in the U.S. appears to be small, and the because the data discussed below is constructed under the assumption of zero pure profits, markups are assumed to be zero in the analysis below. The analysis of reallocation in this paper is complementary to the literature that has studied reallocation by looking at the distribution of firm productivities within narrowly defined industries, such as Foster et al. (2008) and Bartelsman et al. (2013). Unfortunately, detailed data on input heterogeneity is typically not available at the firm level. The observed dispersion in prices paid for inputs across producers is related to the idea in the development accounting literature that dispersion in measured productivities across producers reflects misallocation. For example, Hsieh and Klenow (2010) in their seminal paper comparing China and India infers distortions based on a wedge between marginal products of producers in China, India, and the U.S. and conducts a reallocation exercise that shows that under equalized marginal products there are significant improvements in aggregate TFP, with larger gains in China and India. A major theme of the analysis below is that input heterogeneity should be accounted for in reallocation exercises of this nature. The intuition for the need to account for input heterogeneity in the reallocation exercise and TFP measurement is straight forward. If we observe an establishment with double the productivity of another, we want understand if this productivity difference is due, for example, to significantly higher educational attainment of the workers in the more productive establishment, or a difference in technology. That is, disaggregation (and proper weighting) is necessary to differentiate between substitution of inputs (movements along a production function) and TFP growth (shifts in the production function). This basic premise has been understood by those interested in measuring TFP at least since Jorgenson and Griliches (1967).Footnote 4 By construction, a biased estimate of TFP that excludes the effects of changes in the composition of inputs leads to biased inference in the reallocation exercise. Evidence on reallocation effects across countries has the potential to help us understand cross country differences in growth and productivity. Currently available data is not informative in assessing whether a country’s productivity growth is due to innovation or reallocation of inputs. As an example, if the contribution of reallocation is significantly larger in one country compared to others, then this is evidence that factor movements are functioning differently in the outlying country. Furthermore, evidence at the industry level has the potential to identify the origins of the factor market differences. The analysis in this paper is restricted to the set of countries that have consistent data on industries and input heterogeneity. Thus, the estimates are consistent across countries, but cover only a sample of high income countries. Specifically, the paper presents estimates for Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States. Because the data is constructed within the framework of the official system of national accounts, the reallocation effects can be compared to official measures of GDP growth. While the driving force of the reallocation effects is differences in input pricing across producing units, the underlying the reason for the price differences is an open question. Presumably, differences in factor pricing across producers are related to factor market frictions. In the work of Hsieh and Klenow (2010) this is modeled as an exogenous wedge. To provide insight into the potential reasons for the observed pattern of the reallocation effects across countries, this paper includes a set of panel regressions with country-level explanatory variables. The primary objective of the paper is to assess whether reallocations are an important component of aggregate productivity growth across countries. The paper finds that accounting for input composition is important in measuring reallocation effects. Using an aggregate TFP measure that imposes input homogeneity leads to a significant over estimate of the aggregate reallocation effect in the U.S. Across countries, reallocation effects were a small component of aggregate TFP on average for the countries considered here. For example, reallocation effects were minimal in Denmark, Sweden, the U.K., and the U.S., but sizable in the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Spain. Overall, capital reallocation effects were slightly larger than labor reallocation effects, but the variance of the labor reallocation effect across industries exceeds that of the capital reallocation effect for the majority of countries. Furthermore, capital and labor reallocation effects are positively correlated across industries. Finally, the panel regressions indicate that magnitude of the reallocation effects is related to population distribution and government effectiveness. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the measurement of industry and aggregate technology. Section 3 covers the role of heterogeneous inputs in measures of industry technology and provides a basic discussion of how dispersion in input prices is related to reallocation. Section 4 develops the reallocation measure as the difference between aggregate TFP and aggregate technology and shows how these can be decomposed to the industry level. Section 5 describes the data. The impact of reallocation in the U.S. with and without accounting for input heterogeneity is presented in Sect. 6. This section also presents the reallocation effects by country and industry. The penultimate section conducts a regression analysis to analyze the relationship between the reallocation effects and country-level correlates. Section 8 concludes.",6

153,3,Review of World Economics,11 March 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0281-5,Cross-border mergers & acquisitions with financially constrained owners,August 2017,Aron Berg,Pehr-Johan Norbäck,Lars Persson,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"While many countries abolished restrictions on foreigners’ possibilities to acquire domestic firms during the 1990s and early 2000s, a reversion to a more protectionist view could be observed in the mid 2000s. For instance, in 2005, the rumors about a takeover bid of the French dairy producer Danone by the American company PepsiCo provoked an outcry on the French political arena. A few weeks later, the French government officially proposed to shield ten “strategic” industries, including biotechnologies and secure information systems, from foreign acquisitions. This trend has then continued. In 2010, the Canadian government blocked the mining giant BHP Billiton’s hostile takeover bid for the fertiliser group Potash Corporation with the motivation that it was not convinced that the deal was in the Canadian interest.Footnote 1
 The main economic argument put forward in the policy debate for why countries prefer their firms to be buyers rather than sellers in cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) is that corporate owners have a home country bias in corporate decisions such as production and investment. In fact, a home country bias is observed in various firm activities, such as in production (Delgado 2006), trade (Wolf 2000), and R&D (Belderbos et al. 2013). While the argument for favoring domestic corporate ownership has some economic merits, we show in this paper that the argument is incomplete. Indeed, we show that blocking acquisitions by foreign owners (or stimulating foreign acquisitions by domestic owners) can be counterproductive, leading to less investment in the domestic country since less financial capital becomes available to (home biased) domestic corporate owners. Moreover, blocking foreign acquisitions might also lead to less foreign financial capital being “locked intov domestic firm-specific assets. To this end, we develop a theoretical model where firm-level negotiations determine the buyer and seller identities in a cross-border M&A. Firms, either domestic or foreign, are active in a mature international market and possibly also in a new international growth market, and are assumed to have a home bias in the location of their investments. The novel feature of our model is that it captures the fact that a large share of sellers in cross-border M&As is owners that will use the proceeds to undertake other corporate investments. First, a large share of all sellers is conglomerates that divest affiliates.Footnote 2 Second, in many countries, sellers in cross-border M&As are corporate owner groups (families) that will use the proceeds to fund other corporate investments.Footnote 3 To capture the fact that both buyers and sellers are active in product markets post acquisition, we assume that the two owners (owner groups) are unique in their ability to manage firms and will invest in new assets after the acquisition has taken place. Moreover, we assume that the owners are financially constrained so when they borrow money for new investment, the interest rate becomes higher the more they borrow. We use a Nash bargaining solution to determine the surplus division in an acquisition when the roles of buyer and seller are given. However, this will not suffice to determine the buyer and seller identities in the bargaining game. We solve this by applying the equilibrium ownership-structure model proposed by Horn and Persson (2001a) and find that the direction of the sale is determined by the industry structure that gives the highest aggregate post-acquisition profits. This finding has several implications: (i) an owner may sell corporate assets to a less efficient owner if its use of cash to finance other corporate investments compensates for this loss, and (ii) an improved outside investment opportunity for an owner may trigger a corporate sale and may benefit the acquirer through a lower acquisition price. We then turn to implications for the international investment pattern of the outcome in the acquisition bargaining game. We show that a foreign acquisition increases the domestic firm’s investments in the growth industry, while it decreases the investments of the foreign firm. The reason is that the domestic firm’s owner will become financially stronger due to the sale of its assets in the mature industry, thereby reducing the financial cost when borrowing to invest in the growth industry. In fact, the domestic country may obtain an increased capital stock even if the foreign owner shuts down the domestic production of mature products since the increase in investment in the growth industry may be substantial. The foreign owner, on the other hand, becomes financially weaker since part of her financial capital is “locked in” the mature industry. The foreign owner will therefore reduce her investment in the growth industry, which will reduce the capital stock in her home country. Then, we examine the implications of our results for (international) merger policy. In most countries, an Antitrust Authority (AA) scrutinizes the market for corporate control and has the ability to put restrictions on mergers or outright block them. In most jurisdictions, the AA bases its decision on the assessment of whether the merger-specific efficiency gains are likely to offset the higher market power enjoyed by the merging firms. The typical assumption is that merger-specific efficiencies accrue to the buyer but, as mentioned above, an acquisition can create merger-specific financial efficiencies that the seller exploits in other markets. Then, we establish that a financial efficiency defence in the merger law can improve the efficiency by inducing a more efficient use of ownership skills when owners are financially constrained. An alternative to blocking foreign acquisitions is to put restrictions on shutting down the selling firm’s plant in the mature industry. This would preserve jobs in the mature industry while, at the same time, ensuring a transition to the emerging industry. However, we show that such a policy can be counterproductive. By putting restrictions on the acquiring firm’s use of the mature assets, the government will inadvertently reduce the acquisition price, which reduces investments in the growth industry. The investment strategy of Investor (the largest investment bank in Sweden) in the last decade is an example where the selling of firms in mature industries has led to investments in growth industries in the domestic country. Between 1999 and 2009, Investor almost trebled the share of its portfolio invested in new growth markets, while at the same time scaling back more traditional investments where it controlled a few very large firms. 62% of these new investments went to the Nordic region (Investor Annual Report 2001, 2010). Selling to foreign investors does not seem to have affected the number of Swedish employees in these firms in any remarkable way either. For example, the selling of Scania, the most notable of Investor’s transactions, has not lead to a decrease in the number employed in its Swedish operations; rather this number did somewhat increase over the decade as Investor started to scale down its ownership (Scania Annual Report 2000, 2009).Footnote 4 The view that the selling country can be the winner in a giant cross-border M&A was also put forward when Finnish Nokia sold its devices division to U.S. Microsoft. Finland’s minister for Trade and European Affairs then expressed the view that Finland benefited both from foreign financial capital being locked into Finnish industry-specific capital (the devices division) and Finnish corporate owners (Nokia) getting more financial strength from the deal by saying: “We should look at the silver lining [...] From now on we will have two huge information technology giants in Finland.”Footnote 5
Footnote 6
 Our paper is related to the literature addressing welfare aspects of cross-border mergers in international oligopoly markets. This literature clarifies how cross-border mergers affect profits and welfare, depending on, for example, trade costs and domestic institutions (see e.g. Head and Reis 1997; Horn and Persson 2001b; Lommerud et al. 2004; Neary 2007). Our paper is also related to the literature on cross-border M&As and greenfield investment which emphasizes that greenfield investments and cross-border acquisitions are not perfect substitutes, and have different determinants and welfare effects (see, for instance, Bjorvatn 2004; Nocke and Yeaple 2007, 2008; Mattoo et al. 2004; Norbäck and Persson 2007, 2008; or Raff et al. 2009). We add to this literature by examining how financial restrictions affect cross-border merger activity and subsequent investment. In particular, we show that selling domestic industry-specific assets to foreign owners can increase domestic investment by easing home-biased domestic owners’ investment in new industries, thereby increasing domestic welfare.Footnote 7
 The paper also relates to a small literature on endogenous mergers where “who merges with whom” is the central question and there is an explicit modeling of the acquisition game (see, for instance, Fridolfsson and Stennek 2005; Horn and Persson 2001a; Kamien and Zang 1993). We add to this literature by providing a model where the identity of the acquirer and the seller can be determined in an environment where both the buyer and the seller may make sequential investments. The previous merger literature has shown that access to markets, low production costs, synergies, and market power all drive mergers. We identify another important factor: the seller’s need for financial resources to invest in new growth markets. Moreover, we show that a financial efficiency defence in the merger law can improve the efficiency by inducing a more efficient use of corporate ownership skills. The paper adds to the literature that examines the interaction between financial structures and product markets. For example, Brander and Lewis (1986) demonstrated that limited liability commits a leveraged firm to produce more output in the product market since shareholders care more about positive than negative states of the world. Cestone and Fumagalli (2005) show that business groups with efficient internal capital markets may channel resources to either a more or a less profitable unit. Banal-Estañol and Ottaviani (2006) show that merging firms take both diversification and the strategic effects into account when determining the optimal contractual split of profits. We add to this literature by showing that differences in financial restrictions and abilities affect the allocation of owner-specific ability and industry-specific capital in the product market. Finally, the paper relates to the literature on industrial reorganization in the financial literature that shows that changes in owner productivity and the cost of new capital can trigger M&A activity, causing more productive owners to buy assets from less productive ones (see Jovanovic and Rousseau 2002; Maksimovic and Phillips 2002). We add to this by showing that financial constraints may affect this pattern by triggering mergers where efficient owners sell industry-specific assets to invest in even more productive assets in other industries.",

The so-called Great Trade Collapse of merchandise trade has been the subject of a sizable body of research. Much less attention has been directed to the behavior of world services trade during the 2008–2009 recession. As Borchert and Mattoo (2010) first observed, services trade did not experience the severe contraction that goods trade did, causing them to label services trade “crisis resilient.” Evidence for the US, the world’s largest exporter and importer of services, is consistent with this characterization (Figs. 1 and 2). The aim of this study is to investigate why. Real US exports, indexed (Q1 2008 = 100) Real US imports, indexed (Q1 2008 = 100) Borchert and Mattoo (2010) advanced several possible explanations: compared to goods trade, services trade was (a) less cyclical, (b) less dependent on trade financing, and (c) subject to fewer protectionist responses to the global slowdown. Ariu (2016) explored the first possibility in a microeconometric analysis of Belgian services exports during the Great Trade Collapse, concluding that services trade was more immune than goods trade to the short-run negative demand shock in 2008–2009. Whether or not that immunity was unique to the 2008–2009 collapse remains an open question. To get at that question, this paper investigates the cyclicality of services trade by examining the time-series behavior of US services trade over 1987–2014. This approach has the advantage of offering a temporal context that can help in determining whether the behavior of services trade during the 2008–2009 recession was unusual or simply reflected its usual dynamics. At first glance, existing econometric estimates do not square with the muted response of US services trade to the global recession of 2008–2009. Most estimates for the US find income elasticities for total services trade that are not substantially lower than for goods trade (see, e.g., Ansari 2003; Wren-Lewis and Driver 1998; Chinn 2010; Crane et al. 2007). But much of the empirical evidence for US services trade is based on an analysis of long-run responses. If services trade is less cyclical, that should show up as a small short-run income elasticity. Considerably less is known about the short-run demand response of US services trade. It could be limited, even in the face of a substantial long-run response. A time-series approach can provide a means of investigating these dynamics, potentially contributing to our understanding of the limited services trade response to the 2008–2009 recession. Accordingly, this study analyzes the time-series behavior of US services exports and imports, explicitly paying attention to both the short- and long-run dynamics. It also tests and accounts for structural instability in the estimated equations. The analysis covers total services trade and three broad, disaggregated categories of private services: transport, travel, and business services. While the total estimates can serve as references, the disaggregation can accommodate concerns of aggregation bias in US services trade noted by Marquez (2006). It can also shed light on the differential impact of the global recession across various categories of services trade. This study contextualizes the crisis-resilience of services trade along sectoral and temporal dimensions. Both dimensions turn out to be important. First, disaggregation reveals a wide range of demand responses. In particular, transport and travel services trade exhibit large responses to short-run cyclical fluctuations while the response of business services trade is small, at best. These disparate short-run dynamics place business services at the center of the “crisis-resilience” of US services trade. Second, the time-series results reveal that these characteristics are not unique responses to the 2008–2009 global recession but, rather, prevailing properties of US services trade. The large share of business services in aggregate US services trade and its very limited cyclical response combined to dampen the impact of the 2008–2009 recession on aggregate services trade. The limited response of US services trade to the global recession was consistent with its time-series and compositional characteristics.",2

In global value chains, enterprises exchange intermediate products within and across borders, and their output is a “bundle of many nations’ inputs” (Timmer et al. 2013). There is abundant evidence of the impact of global value chains on trade, the environment and jobs. Obviously, international sales of intermediate inputs involve various trade costs that need to be absorbed in the production process. Legitimate questions than arise: are there trade cost chains, parallel to value chains? is fragmentation of production across borders deterrent or conducive to trade facilitation? The OECD has concluded, “The way in which tariffs and other protective measures at the border affect value chains needs to be taken into account in policy making and negotiations” (OECD 2013, Chap. 3). There has been growing concern that, whereas nominal protection is now relatively low, cumulative protection can still be pervasive as the result of a magnification effect along the entire value chain. As an illustrative example, Ferrantino (2012) calculates that the uniform tariff of 10% is compounded exponentially along the value chain and is reported to reach 34% after five production stages and 75% after ten stages. The OECD (2013, Chap. 3) offers a similar rationale for the “tariff amplification effect:” the uniform tariff of 10% increases to 22 and 60% of the price of the final product after five and ten production stages, respectively. A few authors addressed this issue within theoretical trade models with embedded multi-stage production. Yi (2003) develops a theoretical model that “delivers both magnified and nonlinear trade responses to tariff reductions”. Multi-stage production must therefore inflate the effect of tariffs on trade. Yi (2010) investigates the magnification effect in more detail and attributes it to two forces. The first is multiple border crossings because of vertical specialization. The second is valuation of trade flows: trade costs apply to the gross value of exports rather than to the net value generated by the last producer. Conversly, Johnson and Moxnes (2013) find that fragmentation of production does not play an important role in inflating trade elasticity. Because their estimates of trade costs are relatively high, breaking up the production process is costly, and therefore occurs relatively infrequently. Hence, a given decline in trade costs does not produce amplified cost savings for most goods traded. 
Baldwin and Venables (2013) focus on “unbundling costs” across borders, including the costs of coordination and management as well as direct shipping costs. Their model of production arrangements in global value chain environment builds on the two extremes, characterized as “snakes” and “spiders”. The unbundling costs create centripetal forces binding related stages together, but also centrifugal forces that encourage dispersed production of different stages. Reductions in international frictions facilitate the relocation of production in line with comparative costs, but this relocation is not necessarily continuous or monotonic. Summarizing the recent literature, the WTO (2015) recognizes in the World Trade Report that “Trade costs cumulate and are magnified along the value chain so that inefficient border procedures have a substantial deterrent effect on trade. Conversely, the positive effect of trade facilitation on value chain trade is magnified and will increase specialization in those production stages in which countries have a comparative advantage.” A related, policy-relevant objective is to produce reliable estimates of trade costs that accumulate along global value chains. The few existing investigations are intimately connected with the renewed interest in the input–output framework first pioneered by Leontief (1936) and later adopted in numerous studies for the purpose of holistic value chain analysis. Tamamura (2010) examines the effect of import tariff reduction under China–Japan–ASEAN free trade agreements. He calls it “the repercussion effect” on production costs, resulting from the elimination of tariffs on all imports. Koopman et al. (2010) provide an illustrative calculation of magnified trade costs faced by selected exporting countries. In this exercise, they estimate transportation margins and import tariffs that apply to exports of final goods with a special account of domestic and foreign value added therein. Fally (2012) develops a formula to compute cumulative transport costs and shows that the result has a linear relationship with his index of “embodied production stages”. He, however, does not put this formula to empirical tests. Rouzet and Miroudot (2013) present an elaborate exposition of the concept of the cumulative tariff and the relevant computational method. They provide estimates of bilateral cumulative tariffs for various countries and industries and report the results of a simulation of trade liberalization. Although there are differences in derivations, Tamamura’s, Fally’s and Rouzet and Miroudot’s measures of cumulative tariffs or transportation costs can be addressed in the Leontief price model. Accordingly, these authors treat indirect trade costs that accumulate through the upstream value chain as embodied inputs to production and establish their cost-push effect on the price of outputs including exports. The results indicate a non-negligible additional burden arising from indirect trade costs, but do not confirm the exponential magnification effect or dramatic increase in overall protection. For instance, Rouzet and Miroudot (2013) find that goods and services imported from India into the EU incurred an average cumulative tariff of 3.65% in 2009, of which 1.77% was indirect tariff levied prior to the last production stage in India. Based on 2000 data, Tamamura (2010) shows that the maximum contribution of indirect import tariffs and import commodity taxes to the average unit production cost is in Thailand and the Philippines—1.62 and 1.36%, respectively. There is a subtle feature in the cumulative measures proposed so far: they treat trade costs as production costs and only report the results for a producer without distinguishing its role in the value chain. In pursuit of a method that would count trade costs in a bilateral exporter–partner relationship in global value chains, this article treats these costs as valuation layers in the input–output framework and finds that there is no single appropriate measure. Instead, two measures are proposed, counting indirect costs closer to the origin or destination in the value chain. For the first time in literature, the article juxtaposes overall protection in global value chains with the average number of border crossings a product has to pass from exporter to partner. A key question is then whether exports that now have to virtually cross more borders also face higher cumulative resistance because of sequential trade costs? The proposed measures are empirically tested using data from the World Input–Output Database (WIOD) and the UNCTAD TRAINS database for 2001, 2005 and 2010. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides the reader with an illustrative numerical example for an intuitive understanding of the counting procedures. It also explains the mathematical underpinnings of the existing and new measures of cumulative trade costs in global value chains. Section 3 briefly describes the data used for the experimental computations and discusses the findings. Finally, Sect. 4 provides a summary and suggestions for future research.",8
153,3,Review of World Economics,19 August 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-016-0264-y,Sovereign debt and bank fragility in Spain,August 2017,Christiaan van der Kwaak,Sweder van Wijnbergen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In May 2012 the Spanish government announced a debt-financed recapitalization of the Spanish banking system, after the capital base of Spanish banks had been severely eroded following the end of the housing and construction boom of the 2000s. Conventional theory predicts that such a recapitalization should decrease bank CDS spreads, as happened in the US after the forced recapitalization of the larger US banks under the SCAP program of May 2009 (Hoshi and Kashyap 2014). And since the main risk to the Spanish government at the time seemed to be the risk of having to bail out the banking system, expectations were that CDS spreads on sovereign debt would fall as well. But contrary to predictions and apparently at variance with the US 2009 experience, CDS spreads for the banks, after a short temporary dip immediately following the recap announcement, continued their rise after the announcements, and so did sovereign CDS spreads, as can be seen from Fig. 1. This is remarkable since, under normal circumstances, a recapitalization increases loss absorption capacity of the bank concerned and should result in lower CDS spreads. In turn looser leverage constraints for banks should lead to increased loan supply to non-financial firms, eventually generating higher tax revenues for the government. In addition, better capitalized banks reduce the probability of the need for a fiscally costly bail out. Both factors would lead one to expect lower CDS spreads for sovereigns too. Yet in Spain CDS spreads continued their upward drift with consequent effects on interest rates, deteriorating the fiscal position of the Spanish government further. In June 2012, the Spanish government applied for emergency funding from the EFSF/ESM. 
Source: Datastream, own calculations (color figure online) Figure displaying CDS spreads. The blue slotted line depicts the CDS spread for Spanish sovereign debt with a maturity of 5 years, while the red solid line depicts the average CDS spread for Spanish banks (5 years, fully restructured, senior unsecured). The first vertical line is May 9th, 2012, at which the Spanish government announced the restructuring of the Spanish financial sector, while the second vertical line depicts June 25th, 2012, at which the eurogroup approved financial sector aid to Spain. Banks in the sample include Banco Popolare Espanol, Banco Santander, Caixa Bank and BBVA.  We will argue that the observed response can be explained by a negative feedback loop arising between undercapitalized banks that hold risky sovereign debt on the one hand and weak government finances on the other:Footnote 1 issuing additional risky sovereign debt to fund a government bailout of commercial banks will lead to falling bond prices everything else equal; when commercial banks have a large exposure to this debt, they will therefore incur capital losses on these bonds. So falling bondprices imply that bank capital will take a hit, thereby limiting the headroom for new loans. Credit spreads and interest rates increase, and lead to lower private credit provision. Higher interest rates on government debt further increase the amount of debt the government needs to issue to fund its operations.But higher debt issue leads to a second round of bond price drops, and so on, setting off a vicious cycle whereby weak banks and weak sovereigns get into a negative amplification cycle. In such an environment, the capital losses on existing holdings of sovereign debt can potentially offset the initial increase in bank capital due to the recapitalization by the government. A key feature of this negative feedback loop is the fact that Spanish commercial banks were undercapitalized after the end of the housing and construction boom of the 2000s (International Monetary Fund 2011; Hoshi and Kashyap 2014). We therefore follow Gertler and Karadi (2011) and introduce balance-sheet-constrained financial intermediaries into a standard New-Keynesian DSGE model.Footnote 2 We extend their setup in two directions: The first extension is to allow financial intermediaries to hold sovereign debt in addition to loans to the private sector. To allow for the possibility of capital losses on sovereign debt holdings, we introduce long-term maturity government bonds in a setup which is very similar to Woodford (1998, 2001). Such a setup avoids the escalating dimension of the state space that a less parsimonious approach to lengthening maturity would lead to. The second extension is to introduce endogenous sovereign default risk following Schabert and Van Wijnbergen (2014), which is a second channel that gives rise to potential capital losses on sovereign debt. The resulting default model is also used in Van der Kwaak and Van Wijnbergen (2014). The production sector contains price-stickiness and monopolistic competition to have real effects from monetary policy. Households consume, provide labor and save through deposits placed at financial intermediaries. Because our goal is to investigate whether the negative amplification cycles between weakly capitalized banks and weak sovereign finances can explain the failure of the Spanish government to recapitalize the Spanish financial sector, we calibrate the model to Spanish data by using parameters from the Bayesian estimation results by Burriel et al. (2010) where applicable, using in addition several specific sources for aggregate Spanish data (see the calibration appendix) to match moments in the data. The main contribution of our paper is that we provide an explanation for the inability of the Spanish government to implement a debt-financed recapitalization of the Spanish financial sector in May/June 2012. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first paper to do so within a DSGE framework specifically calibrated to capture the dynamics of the Spanish economy. A second contribution of our paper is to investgiate the effectiveness of alternative recapitalization policies by foreign entities such as the EFSF/ESM. Our first and main result is that we find that the above mentioned negative amplification cycle between undercapitalized banks with large holdings of risky sovereign debt and weak government finances explains the developments in Spanish bond markets in May/June 2012. A second result is that contrary to a debt-financed recapitalization by the sovereign, which is the standard macroeconomic policy prescription to tackle banking problems, an external recap by a foreign entity such as the EFSF/ESM can break the vicious cycle between weak banks and weak sovereigns. In such circumstances, commercial banks obtain the beneficial effects of a recapitalization, without incurring the negative feedback effects on bond prices, since the recapitalization does not add to domestic sovereign debt anymore. Several papers in the literature have paid attention to this two-way feedback loop between undercapitalized banks and weak sovereigns. Empirical studies suggest that distress in financial markets can spill over to the sovereign debt market and vice versa (Acharya et al. 2014; Laeven and Valencia 2013; Haidar 2012; De Bruyckere et al. 2013; Alter and Schüler 2012), while the interdependence of banks and sovereigns has been shown to have grown over time (Alter and Beyer 2012). Models specifically designed to simulate the Spanish economy can be found in Burriel et al. (2010) and Fernandez-Villaverde and Ohanian (2010). Burriel et al. (2010) perform a Bayesian estimation with Spanish data for policy purposes. They do not focus on financial fragility so banks play no role in their set up. Fernandez-Villaverde and Ohanian (2010) do add financial frictions in a similar way as Bernanke et al. (1999) in an otherwise standard New-Keynesian closed economy model, but abstract from fiscal policy and government debt which plays a crucial role in our paper.",1

This is a theoretical challenge to neoclassical growth models and has therefore rightfully been dubbed a puzzle (Gourinchas and Jeanne 2013). China’s surplus is also often seen as the main symptom of a perceived imbalance in international capital flows that could distort exchange rates, interest rates and asset prices at a global level (Bernanke 2007). Considerable research effort has therefore been given to explaining this pattern theoretically (Caballero et al. 2008; Mendoza et al. 2009; Song et al. 2011; Aguiar and Amador 2011) and empirically (Hoffmann 2013). However, so far, we have relatively little evidence about the patterns of intra-national (i.e. regional) capital flows in China. We attempt to fill that gap in this paper. We study empirically the dynamics and determinants of net exports at the level of Chinese provinces. Understanding this “cross-section” of China’s net exports provides a useful disaggregated perspective for at least three reasons: first, given the importance of China for the world economy and given the sheer size of many individual provinces, it is interesting in its own right to check whether we can use standard models to understand intra-national capital flows in this huge country. Our answer to this question is a clear ‘Yes’. Second, China’s persistent external surplus is the sum of net capital flows (net exports) across provinces. Figure 1 shows that the rise and decline of China’s international net export surplus correlates closely with a widening of imbalances in net flows between provinces. Understanding the cross-section of provincial capital flows can therefore shed light on the determinants of global imbalances in ways that a pure time-series analysis of China’s aggregate statistics cannot achieve . Specifically, having decomposed inter-provincial capital flows into different channels suggested by theory allows us to make a third contribution: to correlate the importance of these channels with various province-level characteristics—such as the relative importance of state-owned enterprises in the local economy or demographic factors—that recent theoretical models have put forward as explanations for China’s structural surpluses. In this way, we provide a taxonomy of the extent to which various recent theories contribute to our understanding of China’s current account puzzle. We emphasize that our aim in this context is to provide some first informative correlations for future research, not to document causality. As framework for our analysis we use a stylized intertemporal model of capital flows in which we allow for a simple form of financial frictions in the form of a “savings wedge” in the mould of Gourinchas and Jeanne (2013). Our framework builds on Hoffmann (2013) and nests two broad channels of external adjustment in interprovincial capital flows: the first is variation in intertemporal prices, which we further disaggregate into variation in the domestic real interest rate, the excess return on international assets over the domestic interest rate, and the regional real exchange rate (i.e. the relative price of tradable and non-tradable goods). The second is intertemporal variation in quantities—cash flows of output, investment and government spending. While the intertemporal price channel(s) reflect the impact of intertemporal substitution, we can think of the quantity channel as reflecting ‘rainy-day’ saving. As we show, our simple model accounts for around 80% of the variation in net exports in a panel of 30 provinces over the 1985–2010 period. Most of this is accounted for by rainy day savings. These numbers mask considerable cross-provincial heterogeneity in the importance of adjustment channels, though. We show that heterogeneity in provinces’ external adjustment patterns correlates in particular with two groups of province-level characteristics emphasized by the recent theoretical literature on China’s external surplus: the relative role of private and state-owned enterprises (SOE) in the provincial economy and demographic factors. We have the following main findings. First, rainy-day saving is relatively more important in provinces with many private firms and with unfavorable demographics (either due to distorted sex ratios or high dependency ratios). Second, unfavorable demographics (in the form of distorted sex ratios) seem to make expected price increases for non-tradables more important as a driver of local savings behavior. The first finding seems consistent with the view that private firms have no access to external finance, forcing them to pay for tomorrow’s investments from today’s retained earnings, which contributes to high corporate saving rates today. It is also consistent with the interpretation that China’s private saving rates are high because of weak social safety nets and demographic ageing. The second finding supports the view that adverse demographics exacerbates the role of expected price increases for non-tradables (housing, medical care, schooling) as a savings motive. Third, we find that differences in openness to FDI or trade also affect the patterns of interprovincial capital flows. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces our theoretical and empirical framework. Then, Sect. 3 discusses the data. In a next step, we present our main results in Sect. 4. At last, Sect. 5 concludes.",3
153,3,Review of World Economics,13 March 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0279-z,A tale of two globalizations: gains from trade and openness 1800–2010,August 2017,Giovanni Federico,Antonio Tena-Junguito,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In 2007, world trade was about two times greater than in 1997, six times greater than in 1972 and 32 times greater than in 1950. This was one of the most evident features of the current wave of globalization, which is widely credited to have fostered economic growth. But, as many scholars have pointed out, the world had experienced a similar process, promptly christened the first globalization, in the decades before World War One (Rodrik 1998; O’Rourke and Williamson 1999; Bordo et al. 2003; Collier and Dollar 2002; Findlay and O’Rourke 2007). In those years, trade rose fast, core countries experienced modern economic growth for the first time in history and growth gradually spread to the periphery via trade. The Great Trade Collapse (Baldwin 2009) and the subsequent stagnation, has suggested less uplifting historical comparisons. The first globalization was arrested by the outbreak of World War One, and, after a modest recovery in the 1920s, was definitively killed by the protectionist reactions to the Great Depression (Eichengreen 2015). These historical comparisons are part and parcel of the scholarly discourse on the current globalization. They implicitly focus on openness as the mean measure of globalization, as it captures the additional increase of trade beyond the effect of economic growth, and they explain its movements with changes in international trade costs relative to domestic ones (Sect. 2). This literature is arguably flawed (Sect. 3). First, it uses an imprecise measure of openness and does not exploit the recent advances in trade theory. Second, with the notable exception of Hugot (2014), authors ignore the period before 1870, which featured massive convergence of prices within Europe (Jacks 2005; Federico 2011) and worldwide (Sharp and Weisdorf 2013; Chilosi and Federico 2015), as well as an extensive liberalization of trade (Federico 2012; Tena-Junguito et al. 2012). Third, the conventional wisdom relies on very fragile quantitative evidence. Most estimates of openness refer to a few advanced countries in Europe and the Western offshoots. The available series of world trade, dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, neglect all estimates of trade by country published since then and cover peripheral countries very crudely, if at all. The recent wave in gravity models (Anderson and van Wincoop 2004; Head and Mayer 2014; Meissner 2014) suffers from the same advanced country bias and, on top of this, relies on data on bilateral flows, which are notoriously the least reliable information in historical trade statistics (Federico and Tena-Junguito 1991). This paper aims at putting these historical comparisons on a solid quantitative ground. To this aim, we have estimated yearly series of trade for all polities since 1850, at the latest, to 1938 (Federico and Tena-Junguito 2016a) and we have collected all the available data on historical national accounts for the same period (Appendix C of Electronic Supplementary Material). Extending these series to present with the data from the United Nations, in this paper we make four contributions: We sketch out the growth of world trade since 1800, focusing on the comparison between the two globalizations (Sect. 4). We describe trends in openness, defined as the ratio of exports to GDP at current prices, from 1830 onwards (Sect. 5). We analyze the proximate causes of movements in world openness, distinguishing changes in the distribution of world GDP, changes in the composition of GDP by sector and a residual, which captures changes in trade costs (Sect. 6). We compute the gains from trade using both the statistics by Arkolakis et al. (2012) and the extended version by Felbermayr et al. (2015), and we discuss their possible biases (Sect. 7). Section 8 tests the robustness of our results to different sets of GDP data, different measures of openness and alternative weighting systems of country series, and Sect. 9 concludes.",44

153,4,Review of World Economics,28 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0287-z,Heterogeneous effects of bilateral investment treaties,November 2017,Rod Falvey,Neil Foster-McGregor,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Flows of FDI have increased rapidly—more rapidly than trade flows—over the last three decades. According to the World Investment Report (UNCTAD 2014) FDI inflows were around $400 million in 1995, $1.4 trillion in 2000 and, following slumps in the early 2000s and during the recent global financial crisis, rose to $1.45 trillion in 2013. While many of these flows of FDI have occurred among developed countries, a significant amount of FDI has flowed from developed to developing countries, with developing countries in Asia being important recipients. FDI is thought to benefit host countries through a number of channels. In addition to the inflow of capital, FDI is often accompanied by the movement of firm-specific assets such as technology, managerial ability, corporate governance and access to networks connecting foreign markets. FDI is also expected to encourage competition among domestic firms, hopefully increasing efficiency. Spillovers from FDI may be expected through the leakage of proprietary knowledge (Görg and Greenaway 2004), and there is evidence to suggest the presence of employment and wage benefits (see for example Foster-McGregor et al. 2015). While the causes of the dramatic increase in FDI flows are likely to be broad, this paper focusses on the role of policy, and in particular the role of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs), in impacting upon flows of FDI from the developed to the developing world. Since the first BIT was formed between (West) Germany and Pakistan in 1959 their popularity has increased significantly. At the end of the 1960s there were only 75 BITs in force. This increased to 167 by the end of the 1970s, 389 by the end of the 1980s, and today there are 2954 BITs in existence, with 2319 in force.Footnote 1 Investment agreements have become an important policy tool more generally with many proposed ‘deep’ Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) including an investment chapter (e.g. the now moribund Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), EU-Canada, EU-India). The aim of BITs is to encourage flows of FDI from generally high-income suppliers to lower-income recipients, which they do by guaranteeing certain levels of treatment for foreign investors. These include most-favoured country treatment, fair and equitable treatment for foreign investors, and the free transfer and repatriation of capital and profits (Dolzer and Stevens 1995; UNCTAD 1998). BIT partners also agree to be bound by dispute settlement provisions that are intended to ensure basic requirements of credible protection of property and contract rights, but which can result in foreign investors being granted greater security and better treatment than domestic investors (Vandevelde 1998).Footnote 2 This asymmetric treatment in favour of foreign firms can cause excessive entry and investment by foreign firms relative to domestic firms.Footnote 3 The investor settlement procedure potentially involves considerable interference in domestic policy, with practically any public policy being subject to challenge. By providing a credible commitment to foreign investors, individual host countries may be able to create a competitive advantage as long as not all potential hosts have signed such treaties. The costs of BITs in terms of reduced national sovereignty are generally justified if the competitive advantage developed by BITs encourages FDI inflows, and if these FDI inflows provide the benefits discussed above (Elkins et al. 2004; Guzman 1998; and Neumayer 2005). The extent to which BITs actually encourage inward FDI is an empirical question, however. The majority of the empirical literature testing the relationship between BIT formation and FDI inflows adopts the familiar gravity equation, relating bilateral FDI flows to standard gravity variables (e.g. distance and economic size) and a dummy variable taking the value one if a country-pair have formed a BIT (e.g. Hallward-Driemeier 2003 and Salacuse and Sullivan 2005). A related literature tests whether countries that sign BITs see an increase in aggregate FDI inflows (e.g. Tobin and Rose-Ackerman 2005 and Neumayer and Spess 2005). While, in principle, BITs only protect investors from the signatory states to whom binding commitments have been made, their existence may also signal that this host country protects the interests of foreign investors more generally. If this is the case, then BITs encourage FDI inflows from both BIT partners and non-BIT sources. Whichever approach is adopted, there are a wide range of estimated effects in the literature, including studies which report positive, negative or insignificant effects of BIT formation. This point is emphasised in a recent meta-analysis of the relationship between BITs and FDI by Bellak (2013), who finds that 11% of the estimated coefficients on the BIT dummy are actually negative (2% being significantly so), with 76% of the coefficients being positive and significant. In addition, he finds that more recent studies have been more likely to find a negative coefficient and that the dispersion of the estimated coefficients has tended to increase over time. Bellak (2013) reports an un-weighted mean semi-elasticity of 17.6 per cent in the papers he considers, but the standard deviation is found to be 37.4 with some estimates above 100% and others below −50%. The literature has responded to this ambiguity in several ways. First there have been attempts to deal with the issue of endogeneity. Similar to the case of PTAs, endogeneity is expected due to the self-selection of countries into BITs. The coefficient on the BIT variable is likely to be biased due to omitted (unknown) determinants of bilateral investment costs. These omitted variables are likely to be correlated with the probability of being in a BIT, with BIT formation not being random but instead driven by several factors, including many of the unobserved factors excluded from the gravity equation explaining investment flows (Baldwin and Taglioni 2006). In the context of PTAs a number of approaches have been adopted, including instrumental variables (Baier and Bergstrand 2002), matching estimators (Baier and Bergstrand 2009a) and difference in difference analysis (Egger et al. 2008). Baldwin and Taglioni (2006) amongst many others suggest that in the case of panel data the inclusion of country-pair fixed effects is an appropriate method of dealing with this particular endogeneity problem. In the case of BITs, Aisbett (2009) controls for self-selection in her regression equations using country-pair fixed effects. She finds that the coefficient on her BIT dummy becomes smaller and insignificant as a result, though it should be noted that this study considers positive FDI flows only and is restricted to 28 low- and middle-income FDI host countries. Busse et al. (2010) and Kerner (2009) control for endogeneity using an Instrumental Variables (IV) approach, instrumenting the BIT dummy with the number of BITs ratified by neighbouring countries, the number of BITs ratified by all other developing countries and the lag of the BIT variable. Their results indicate a positive impact of BITs on FDI flows, but using data that is not restricted to positive FDI flows. Second, the apparent sensitivity of the results to whether only positive flows are included has been considered by Falvey and Foster-McGregor (2015). They use a matched difference-in-difference approach to test for the effects of BITs at the intensive (positive and negative separately) and extensive margins of FDI and find significant effects only at the extensive and negative intensive margins.Footnote 4
 Third, Berger et al. (2010) relax the assumption that BITs are homogeneous and conduct a deeper investigation of the provisions of BITs (and PTAs). They focus on two investment provisions: (i) guarantees of market access for foreign investors by means of national treatment and most-favoured-nation treatment in the pre-establishment phase; and (ii) credible commitments against discriminatory and discretionary treatment by means of international dispute settlement mechanisms in the post-establishment phase. They conclude that liberal admission rules promote bilateral FDI, but that dispute settlement provisions play only a minor role. Fourth, the impacts of international investment disputes on BIT-protected and unprotected FDI flows are becoming clearer. Allee and Peinhardt (2011) find that FDI flows to a developing host country decline if it is brought before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), particularly if the decision goes against it. This work is extended by Aisbett et al. (2017) who consider the effects of disputes and arbitration settlements on FDI flows from BIT partner and non-partner countries. They distinguish three functions that a BIT may serve to attract FDI—‘a signal’ that this host is safe (this applies to all investors); ‘a deterrent’ against treaty violations by the host (this applies only to investments from BIT partners); and ‘insurance’ of compensation in the event of a violation (again this applies only to investments from BIT partners). Their results confirm their predictions from the ‘BITs as deterrent’ hypothesis. First, BITs signed before any dispute involving the host country have a positive impact on bilateral FDI flows. Second, bilateral FDI flows from unprotected sources fall less than those from BIT-partners following a dispute. Finally, the FDI boost a host receives from ratifying another BIT is smaller if it has been involved in a dispute. They conclude that BITs have a causal positive impact on FDI flows, but only for hosts who have not had a BIT claim brought to arbitration. Finally, some investigation has been conducted on how the effectiveness of BITs relates to the size of investment projects. Paniagua et al. (2015) decompose bilateral FDI flows into the number and the average size of investments projects in each flow. They apply a quantile regression in a gravity framework to data on bilateral firm-level Greenfield investments from 120 source countries to 161 host countries over the period 2003 to 2012. They conclude that a BIT can have a positive effect but only for average FDI levels above the median. Myburgh and Paniagua (2016) use a similar approach and find a BIT reduces (raises) FDI levels below (above) the median. In this paper we explore whether the effects of BITs are non-linear. Understanding the environment in which BITs are likely to be effective is highly policy relevant, and may help in designing agreements that are more effective instruments for attracting FDI inflows to the developing world. BITs are signed between highly heterogeneous country-pairs, with important differences found in terms of the size (i.e. GDP), the level of development (i.e. per capita GDP) and the institutional constraints of BIT signatories. Our interest is in whether some of these differences could help explain the mixed results of the effects of BITs on FDI flows. We estimate a gravity equation of FDI flows from a sample of 22 OECD source countries to a broader sample of 101 lesser developed host economies. In our analysis we include zero and negative FDI flows (i.e. cases of disinvestment) and add controls for endogeneity and multilateral resistance. To examine the issue of non-linearity in the relationship between BITs and FDI flows we stratify our BIT dummy variable by each of the three characteristics identified above for which we suspect a non-linear relationship may exist, allowing us to estimate separate coefficients on the BIT dummy for the different strata, an approach which allows us to search for non-linearities without imposing any strict functional form on them. Our results indicate that BITs have a positive (linear) effect on FDI flows from the OECD North to the developing South, with the effects found to be larger when zero and negative FDI flows are included. This suggests that at least part of the effect of BITs is to generate new or to renew disintegrating FDI relationships, a result that supports those of Falvey and Foster-McGregor (2015). Results further suggest the presence of non-linearities, with the effects of BITs found to be increasing in differences in the levels of GDP and GDP per capita between source and host country, and decreasing in the differences in political institutions between source and host. The remainder of this paper is set out as follows: Sect. 2 describes the methodology adopted; Sect. 3 discusses the data used and provides initial descriptive statistics; Sect. 4 discusses the results; and Sect. 5 concludes.",8
153,4,Review of World Economics,13 July 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0289-x,South–South FDI: is it really different?,November 2017,Robert Gold,Holger Görg,Adnan Seric,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In the past, foreign direct investment (FDI) was dominated by investment flows between well-developed industrialised countries. This pattern is slowly but steadily changing. Over the last decade, the share of FDI originating from developing countries has increased substantially from 8% of total FDI flows in 2000 to almost 26% in 2015 (UNCTAD 2002, 2016). In absolute terms, multinationals from developing countries invested around USD 378 billion abroad in the year 2015. Developing countries also received 43% of inward FDI in this same period. Much of this investment is between developing countries, leading to so-called “South–South FDI”. While it is difficult to find comprehensive aggregate data on South–South FDI, evidence for single countries or regions may illustrate the importance of this investment flow. For example, data relating to China extracted from the UNCTAD FDI/TNC database reveal that, in 2012, 84% of FDI outflows were channelled to developing countries. For Malaysia and Thailand, the corresponding figures are 56 and 62%, respectively. Lipsey and Sjöholm (2011) provide an overview of South–South investment characteristics for the case of several East- Asian economies. They analyse trends and differences between South–South and North–South investment regarding determinants of FDI, size and productivity of investors. Additionally, they search for evidence of spillovers to local firms. They report that developing country multinationals investing in East Asia tend to establish in more labour intensive industries. They suggest the magnitude and type of spillovers generated from South–South FDI vis-à-vis North–South FDI is arguably less relevant than for researchers to understand the type of domestic firms attracting investment from South and North investors respectively. The focus of this paper is, however, not Asia but Africa, more specifically Sub-Saharan Africa. The African continent has historically received very low levels of FDI, though these have been increasing over time. In 2000, the share of inward FDI flows to Africa was <1% of world-wide FDI, in 2015 it stood at just over 3%. This amounted to USD 54 billion in absolute values. Using UNCTAD data, Perez-Villar et al. (2016) estimate that FDI inflows from all developing countries represent circa one quarter of all inward FDI in Africa over the period 2003–2010. Our data for Sub-Saharan African countries from the Africa Investor Survey 2010 show that among foreign investors in manufacturing, about one-third are from developing countries (see Table 1 below).Footnote 1
 These figures provide some evidence on the importance of South–South FDI for Africa. The questions we pursue in this paper are whether South–South and North–South FDI is similar or different and whether these investment sources offer different development trajectories for recipient firms in Sub-Saharan Africa. Intuitively, South–South FDI may be expected to differ from FDI originating from the North (e.g., UNCTAD 2006). Generally speaking, FDI is assumed to be beneficial for host country development because foreign multinationals have access to superior technology (or “firm specific assets”) allowing them to compete successfully abroad. This implies that these firms are more productive than comparable firms from the local economy. The superior technology they have may disseminate into the local economy, be it through voluntary technology transfer or involuntary technology spillovers, and thus help the development of local firms in the host country (e.g., Görg and Greenaway 2004). While multinationals from the South are also likely to possess some technological advantage vis-à-vis host country firms, their technological lead may be expected to be less than that of a Northern multinational (Lipsey and Sjöholm 2011). Southern firms may not have access to state-of-the-art technology developed in the North. This implies that Southern multinationals may be less productive than Northern multinationals, but still more so than domestic firms in the host country. However, when it comes to dealing with the business environment, Southern firms may be better able to do so than Northern multinationals (e.g., Aykut and Goldstein 2006; Cuervo-Cazurra and Genc 2008; Khanna and Palepu 2006). Developing countries are, in many cases, characterized by institutional problems (be it the legal system, political stability, lack of infrastructure etc.) and Southern firms may be in a better position to deal with these. The reason for this is that they are already familiar with similar problems in their home country. This experience may enable them to better adapt their local business model, skills and technologies to the developing host country’s needs and abilities. This would then give them a productivity advantage compared to Northern multinationals. These arguments are also reflected in the literature on the role of institutional distance for FDI flows (e.g., Aleksynska and Havrylchyk 2012; Benassy-Quere et al. 2007). These papers argue that it is not necessarily the level of institutional development in the host country that affects inward FDI, but the difference in institutional development between the investor’s host and home country. The closer these two countries are (the lower is their “institutional distance”) the easier it is to attract FDI. Our argument mirrors this, but focuses on the performance of the firms receiving FDI from multinationals abroad. The closer is the institutional similarity between home and host country, the better able the multinational may be to implement its technology and production process. Consequently, we anticipate differences between domestic firms that receive investments from North versus South investors. In this paper, we compare the performance of Northern and Southern multinationals in Sub-Saharan African countries. We also contrast their performance to that of local firms in the host country. To do so we use unique firm level data for 19 Sub-Saharan African countries from the Africa Investor Survey 2010 administered by UNIDO. The survey provides us with information for over 5000 firms, of which about one-third are affiliates of foreign owned multinationals. We compare productivity and employment as well as sales across the three groups of firms. Focusing on foreign-owned firms only, we delve deeper into differences between Northern and Southern FDI. Specifically, we investigate differences in the ancillary effects that come with FDI, like technology transfer, use of patents and access to financial networks. A further novelty of our paper is that we use different definitions of ‘South’ to investigate the relationship between investor origin and firm performance. The most stringent definition we apply is to define Southern investors as only those originating from other African countries. We then extend the definition to include all developing countries (based on the World Bank classification of low and low middle income countries). A third classification considers OECD versus non-OECD countries.Footnote 2
 We find that foreign-owned firms, irrespective of whether they are categorised as North or South, are more efficient than local firms in terms of productivity levels and growth. It follows that FDI from both North and South investors offer scope for technology spillovers and productivity improvements for local firms. There are two interesting twists to the general finding that the origin of FDI (North or South) does not really matter for African firms: Firstly, firms receiving investments from OECD countries show higher productivity growth; we observe a productivity mark-up for OECD investors over and above the positive productivity premium shared by all FDI recipients. Secondly, we see that firms receiving investments from other African countries show higher average employment growth. A further interesting aspect of this African FDI is the higher reported collaboration between African investor’s headquarter firms and their foreign affiliates on patents, product upgrading and R&D. Specifically, FDI is viewed by African affiliates as important for facilitating the use of patents, helping with knowledge transfer and skills upgrading, assisting with access to finance and facilitating access to the investor firm’s foreign supplier network—but only if the Southern investor comes from another African country. In an effort to better understand the mechanisms by which FDI from African investors is associated with high employment growth, we additionally look into sources of effect heterogeneity at the country level. For instance, if African investors were seen to invest disproportionately in poorer or otherwise underperforming countries, the positive relationship between African FDI and employment growth might be seen to be an artefact of country level differences. Surprisingly, we find that foreign investment by African firms on the African continent tends, on average, to target Africa’s higher wealth economies (GDP per capita and growth). Moreover, we find that the positive relationship between productivity growth and the receipt of FDI from North economies is reinforced for Africa’s more closed economies (lower trade openness and lower historic FDI flows).

For this reason, policy-makers from emerging and developing countries have adopted policies aimed at attracting FDI. However, the overall opinion on whether or not the host economy always benefits from the presence of foreign firms is not finalised. The extensive microeconomic literature investigating how inward FDI affects domestic firms’ productivity reaches mixed conclusions (Görg and Greenaway 2004). The presence of multinationals (MNEs) within an industry may improve the performance of domestic producers through either competition or learning effects, i.e. local firms might be pushed to increase their efficiency in order to face foreign competition, or adopt better technologies employed by foreign competitors (horizontal or intra-industry spillovers). However, several studies have found that these spillovers might be irrelevant, or even negative, when the spillovers occurring due to buyer/supplier linkages between foreign and domestic firms (vertical or inter-industry spillovers) are taken into consideration. The presence of foreign firms in upstream sectors could positively influence domestic firms’ performance in downstream sectors, by supplying a larger number and/or a higher quality of intermediate inputs (forward spillovers). At the same time, the presence of foreign-owned affiliates in downstream sectors may lead to productivity improvements for local firms in upstream sectors, because the foreign firms can demand higher standards for their intermediate inputs, and therefore push the domestic input suppliers to improve production efficiency and/or the quality of output (backward spillovers).Footnote 1 A recent meta-analysis of these studies shows that vertical spillovers are more important than horizontal ones, while backward spillovers appear to be larger than forward spillovers (Havranek and Irsova 2011). The main purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate whether, and how, inward FDI influences export performance, i.e. firms’ ability to serve international markets via the trade channel (export spillovers from FDI). It has been argued that a large presence of foreign multinationals might positively affect firm level export performance thanks to technological spillovers, as explained above, and information spillovers, via horizontal and vertical linkages. In other words, the presence of multinationals may reduce the costs of production, and/or more specifically the costs related to exporting. The amount of firm level literature on export spillovers from FDI is much smaller than that on productivity spillovers; and mainly focuses on horizontal linkages, providing mixed results.Footnote 2 Only a few studies consider export spillovers through vertical linkages. Using firm level panel data from the UK, Kneller and Pisu (2007) find that domestic firms’ export decisions are only affected by MNEs through positive backward spillovers, whereas domestic firms’ export share in total sales is positively affected by horizontal (export-related) and backward spillovers, but negatively by forward spillovers. Using firm level data from China for the period 2000–2003, Chen et al. (2013) show positive backward technology spillovers on domestic firms’ export value, and positive horizontal export-related information spillovers on the export share of total sales. Using panel data on Bulgarian exports at the firm/product/destination level, this study aims to explore the microeconomic mechanisms behind firm level aggregate export spillovers from FDI, and to provide interesting new insights in the context of an emerging economy.Footnote 3 The majority of existing studies are based on firm level aggregate export data from developed countries, and have shortcomings due to data unavailability. Firstly, they have not been able to account for either product or destination heterogeneity, although firm level export performance may depend on the characteristics of both products and countries a firm is involved with, in addition to firm-specific characteristics. Secondly, they have been unable to determine whether the change in export value is mainly due to a change in product quantity and/or a change in price (unit value), and whether the price adjustment is mainly caused by a change in quality. Finally, spillover variables for each firm are usually measured by considering only the main sector of the firm, although many studies argue that a large amount of export flows are concentrated within multi-product firms that are often active in several industries (Bernard et al. 2007; Mayer and Ottaviano 2008). In this paper, we attempt to address all these issues using detailed data on Bulgarian manufacturing exports for the period 2004–2006. Bulgaria in this period is a very interesting case, because the country was further liberalising both its trade and investment regimes, with a view to becoming an official member of the European Union in January 2007. In Bulgaria this period was characterised by fast economic growth, accompanied by a dramatic increase in exports, and significant FDI inflows. First, we analyse export spillovers from FDI at the firm level following the standard approach, i.e. by relating firm level aggregate export value to industry level spillovers from FDI, taking into account the main sector of each firm over the sample period. These “benchmark” results suggest that Bulgarian manufacturing firms enjoy positive forward export spillovers, whereas both horizontal and backward export spillovers appear not to be statistically significant. Next, we explore the linkage between exports and inward FDI by using firm/product/destination level data (i.e. variety level data), which enable us to account for product heterogeneity, country heterogeneity, as well as firm heterogeneity. We find positive forward spillovers from FDI on export revenues, which are associated with an increase in quantity without any change in price. Conversely, both horizontal and backward spillovers negatively affect export sales, although less robustly, without price changes. Relying on the standard literature on quality and trade, where the unit value of a product would proxy its quality (Schott 2004), we might conclude that these results do not provide evidence of quality effects from FDI spillovers. However, when disentangling the quality component from unit values, as in Khandelwal et al. (2013), we find significant effects on quality with no change in prices, i.e. quality upgrading from forward spillovers and quality downgrading from both horizontal and backward spillovers. Overall, these results seem to suggest that existing varieties at the firm/product/destination level have their quality increased by the use of more and/or better intermediate inputs from foreign-owned suppliers, and reduced in quality when firms are unable to supply foreign-owned customers and face tougher competition by FDI. These results are found to be relatively stronger for differentiated goods, intermediate goods, OECD destinations, and large exporting firms. Finally, we aggregate firm/product/destination data at the firm level in order to investigate whether inward FDI affects export performance of existing exporters differently when accounting for the multi-sector dimension of spillover variables for each firm. Surprisingly, we find a negative forward spillover on export value, rather than a positive one, which takes effect through a decrease in quantity and an increase in average export price within the firm, associated with a decrease in average quality. Conversely, we find that backward spillovers lead firms to sell more at lower average prices, without any change in average quality. These results suggest that previous firm level studies on export spillovers could have reached different conclusions if the “real” presence of multinationals was accounted for in each domestic firm, i.e. by considering all sectors in which each firm produces. It is worth noting that these findings might be due to the entry/exit of export varieties within firms, and not just to changes in existing varieties. Indeed, when we exclude the possibility of a change in the product/destination mix within a firm, the results turn out to be in line with our firm level “benchmark” findings, i.e. we show positive forward spillovers on firm level export revenue and quantity, and additionally negative backward spillovers on export value. Both vertical spillovers seem to occur without any change in average price. Nevertheless, when focusing on the quality measure, we document within-firm quality upgrading from forward spillovers, and within-firm quality downgrading from backward spillovers. Therefore, the presence of foreign suppliers seems to allow firms to export additional varieties of lower quality, and upgrade the quality of existing export varieties, whereas the presence of foreign customers leads firms to drop marginal varieties of lower quality and downgrade the quality of remaining existing varieties. This paper contributes to the empirical literature on firm level export spillovers from FDI, and provides interesting new microeconomic insights because of the recent availability of more disaggregated trade data for different dimensions, i.e. firm, product and destination country. To the best of our knowledge, Bajgar and Javorcik (2016)’s work is most closely related to ours, because they also explore the linkage between inward FDI and exports by using firm/product/destination level data for the Romanian manufacturing sector. Bajgar and Javorcik (2016) find that unit values are positively affected by backward spillovers and (less robustly by) forward spillovers, concluding that quality upgrading occurs via both vertical spillovers from FDI. Unlike their work, we explore more generally the spillover effects from FDI on total export value at the firm/product/destination level, by disentangling the quantity and the unit value channels. Moreover, we go further by measuring quality following Khandelwal et al. (2013)’s approach, rather than using unit value as a quality proxy, in order to separate the quality effect from the competitiveness effect. This paper is also related to the body of research examining the determinants of firm level export performance, and more specifically, those factors which enable firms to produce goods of higher quality. Kugler and Verhoogen (2012), using data on Colombian manufacturers, show that firms producing high quality products tend to use higher price inputs. Amiti and Khandelwal (2013) find that lower import tariffs are associated with quality upgrading for products close to the world quality frontier, whereas lower tariffs discourage quality upgrading for products away from the frontier. Fieler et al. (2014) find that lower import tariffs lead exporters to upgrade product quality, increasing the domestic supply of high-quality intermediates. Bas and Strauss-Kahn (2015) find that a reduction in input tariffs allows Chinese firms to access high-quality inputs, implying quality upgrading of their exported products. We contribute to this literature by considering the role of inward FDI in affecting the price and the quality of exported varieties. This study also relates to the literature investigating the export performance of firms which supply a wide variety of products to the export market. Manova and Yu (2017) find that the more expensive products account for the largest share of revenues for Chinese multiproduct firms. Moreover, exporters focus on their most expensive goods, drop cheaper goods, and earn lower revenues in destinations where they sell fewer kinds of products. Using data from Mexico, Eckel et al. (2015) find that manufacturers producing more expensive varieties generate higher export revenues worldwide. Our contribution to this literature comes from considering how the presence of foreign MNEs at the industry level might affect the export outcomes of multiproduct firms (i.e. revenues, quantity, prices, and quality), rather than focusing on the relationship between these outcomes. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 highlights the Bulgarian macroeconomic context with a primary focus on exports and inward FDI. Section 3 describes the data and provides the preliminary statistics. Section 4 presents the main econometric analysis of the microeconomic linkages between exports and FDI. Section 5 provides robustness checks, and Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",11
153,4,Review of World Economics,28 March 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0282-4,Technology transfer on a two-way street: R&D spillovers through intermediate input usage and supply,November 2017,Christina Poetzsch,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Trade in intermediate inputs is a widely documented channel of technology transfer (e.g., Terleckyj 1974; Keller 2002; Nishioka and Ripoll 2012; Badinger and Egger 2016). The interest in intermediate inputs comes from their inherent conduciveness to diffusing technology. Technological knowledge applied to the production of intermediates diffuses because intermediates enter production in other countries and industries. The empirical studies cited above use input-output (IO) tables to analyze technology transfer to intermediates-using industries. This paper extends this research by also investigating technology transfer to intermediates-supplying industries.Footnote 1
 Trade in intermediate inputs diffuses technology via spillovers from research and development (R&D), which is the primary source of technological advances. R&D spillovers through intermediates trade are externalities that are not reflected in intermediates prices. The externalities comprise rent and knowledge spillovers (Griliches 1979). Rent spillovers result from intermediates prices that fail to reflect the R&D content of intermediates. Knowledge spillovers result from the extraction of knowledge embodied in intermediates or from the communication of knowledge along buyer-supplier interactions that accompany intermediates trade. Empirical researchers have long examined R&D spillovers through intermediates trade. Brown and Conrad (1967) and Terleckyj (1974) led the literature that uses IO tables. Using IO tables for the U.S., both studies show that R&D spillovers diffuse from supplying to using industries. Subsequent analyses provide evidence for other countries, industries, and years (for an overview, see Mohnen 1996). While early studies focused on domestic trade, Keller (2002) documents that also international trade diffuses R&D spillovers from supplying to using industries. Subsequent analyses that exploit a rising availability of (inter-country) IO tables confirm that international R&D spillovers diffuse through intermediate input usage (e.g., Unel 2008; Nishioka and Ripoll 2012; Badinger and Egger 2016). Focusing on intermediate input usage, the available country-industry level literature neglects, however, R&D spillovers that might diffuse through intermediate input supply. Intermediate input supply might diffuse R&D spillovers because R&D affects intermediates trade along a two-way street: R&D affects the production of and demand for intermediates (cf., Wolff and Nadiri 1993). The effects of R&D on the demand for intermediates allow of R&D spillovers from intermediates-using to -supplying industries. At the firm level, intermediates supply is a known channel of R&D spillovers. Firm specific interactions between suppliers and buyers might lead to R&D collaboration or intentional technology transfer. Empirical analyses that isolate firm specific interactions find that supplying firms benefit from R&D in buying firms (e.g., Ikeuchi et al. 2015; Isaksson et al. 2016). Outside of firm specific interactions, supplying firms might receive R&D spillovers by seeking knowledge of buyers (Isaksson et al. 2016) and by observing knowledge that buyers transfer to other suppliers (Suzuki 1993). For Japanese firms, Suzuki (1993) documents that suppliers receive R&D spillovers not only from their own, but also from other buyers. For supplying and foreign buying firms in Vietnam, Newman et al. (2015) find that suppliers primarily receive knowledge from buyers outside of firm specific interactions. The broad mechanisms of technology transfer to suppliers point to potential effects at the industry or country level. At the industry or country level, evidence of R&D spillovers through intermediates supply is scarce. Funk (2001) and Ang and Madsen (2013) find R&D spillovers through exports at the country level, which comprise both intermediates and final goods. At the country-industry level, Badinger and Egger (2016) combine intermediates usage and supply to determine their joint effect in R&D spillovers. The joint effect exceeds the effect of intermediates usage. While hinting at R&D spillovers through intermediates supply, the individual effect is not analyzed. This paper analyzes R&D spillovers through intermediates usage and supply at the country-industry level. Inter-country input-output (ICIO) tables distinguish between domestic and foreign use- and supply-relations. The analysis includes 18 manufacturing industries in 20 OECD countries over 1987–2009. Results confirm the conjectured relevance of R&D spillovers through intermediates supply. Intermediates supply is the dominant channel among domestic industries. For trade with foreign industries, results show similar effects of R&D spillovers through intermediates usage and supply. These findings suggest that firm level mechanisms of supply-driven technology transfer create R&D spillovers across countries and industries. The country scope extends insights at the firm level, which are often confined to single countries. The comparison of supply- and use-driven R&D spillovers allows of an instructive integration with previous research at the country-industry level. The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 sets out the empirical setting. It introduces the measurement of R&D spillovers through intermediates usage and supply, describes the data, and discusses methodological aspects. Section 3 presents the empirical results, emphasizing differences between use- and supply-driven R&D spillovers. Section 4 concludes implications for future research and contributions to other fields in economics.",1

On the income from Germany’s foreign investments,November 2017,Thomas A. Knetsch,Arne J. Nagengast,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Germany’s current account surpluses have been a cause of concern both in the public debate as well as in policy circles (European Commission 2016; International Monetary Fund 2016). Its current account balance has been persistently positive since 2002 and large both in relative and in absolute terms.Footnote 1 As a consequence Germany has gradually started to amass a sizeable net foreign asset position (Fig. 1), although it does not appear exceptional from an international vantage point.Footnote 2 One of the criticisms that has been voiced repeatedly in this regard is that Germany’s savings are being squandered abroad, and that they should have been invested in domestic assets instead. First, this relates to alleged valuation losses in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis in the European Monetary Union. However, these have been largely debunked as a statistical issue and as being linked to crisis-related phenomena such as safe-haven flows (Frey et al. 2014).Footnote 3 Second, the argument concerns the profitability of Germany’s assets relative to its liabilities, and its ability to generate income from its foreign investments. The latter should be reflected in the German investment income balance, which has not been analysed systematically the past. Germany’s net foreign asset position In this paper, we propose a comprehensive decomposition framework, that allows us to quantify the contribution of a range of different factors determining the dynamics of the investment income balance. We apply our decomposition framework to a rich German dataset spanning 11 different investment classes between 1999 and 2014 (Fig. 2), during which the German investment income balance turned from a deficit of EUR 17.5 bn to a sizeable surplus of EUR 60.4 bn. This allows us to shed light on the following three policy questions. Germany’s net foreign asset position by investment class First, would it have been more profitable to invest excess savings at home rather than abroad? We find that the aggregate yield spread, that is the difference of the yield on assets minus the yield on liabilities, turned from \(-0.8\%\) in 1999 to \(+0.5\%\) in 2014. As a consequence from the mid-2000s onwards it would not have been more profitable to invest German savings at home, and in fact from 2008 onwards it would have been less profitable to do so. The reversal of the aggregate yield spread can be traced back to a variety of different developments particularly for the investment of monetary financial institutions (MFIs), long-term debt securities and equity foreign direct investment (FDI). Second, Germany faces an extremely unfavourable demographic trend in the coming decades, with its working age population expected to decline by more than 20% until 2060 (Federal Statistical Office of Germany 2015). The accumulation of net foreign assets prior to the most challenging stage of population ageing is consistent with consumption smoothing (Brooks 2003; Kim and Lee 2007). How much of the increase in net income payments can actually be explained by the accumulation of net foreign assets? We show that roughly 60% of the increase in the investment income balance was accounted for by the development of external assets and liabilities. While sizeable, this also highlights the importance of considering changes in aggregate yields. Third, has the global decline in interest rates left a sizeable scar in Germany’s net investment income? Roughly minus 14% of the total change in Germany’s investment income balance can be attributed to the decrease in the overall yield level. Therefore, as a net creditor country, Germany forewent a share of its net investment income payments that it would have received all else being equal, which leaves scope for a risk sharing interpretation. The paper is organised as follows. The next section provides an overview of the related literature. Section 3 delineates our decomposition framework. Section 4 describes our dataset and its salient features over time. Section 5 provides the decomposition results for Germany as well as a detailed discussion of the three policy questions outlined above. Section 6 concludes.",2
153,4,Review of World Economics,17 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0286-0,Shipment frequency of exporters and demand uncertainty,November 2017,Gábor Békés,Lionel Fontagné,Vincent Vicard,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Commerce always involves uncertainty that necessitates planning and operational optimization. A key source of uncertainty is the volatility of demand. According to an authoritative industry publication, the Gartner 2014 Supply Chain Study, 45% of supply chain managers mentioned “Forecast accuracy and demand variability” as a major obstacle. Similarly, the 2014 Study of the Chief Supply Chain Officer of SCM World, a leading consulting firm, recorded that 70–80% of respondents in a wide variety of industries are “concerned about demand volatility”.Footnote 1 Persistent volatility is an inherent feature of modern globalized economies which involves “customer choices, product customization, rapid technological improvements, global competition and upstream supply fluctuations”Footnote 2 as argued by Rajesh Gangadharan of Celuro, a consultancy. One can easily argue that demand volatility and the uncertainty related to it may be even more pronounced in international commerce since time-to-ship products exacerbates the impact of demand volatility on firms’ decisions (Coleman 2009; Steinwender 2015). Importantly, the volatility of demand is not a transient feature that firms have to face once in a while: demand fluctuates and firms manage it as part of their business as usual. In this paper, we are interested in understanding how exporting firms adapt to high and low demand volatility. In particular, we are interested in the relationship between steady-state volatility and the frequency (the number of months a firm ships its products) and size of shipments (also studied by Alessandria et al. 2011). Besides this, we also analyse how demand volatility is related to more traditional margins of trade. This decomposition can offer new insights with regard to the adaptation mechanisms, because understanding the reaction to volatility, an inherently dynamic phenomenon, requires studying margins that reflect the dynamics of serving markets. Many mechanisms proposed in the previous literature may provide important insights into the relationship between volatility, frequency and other trade margins. For example, higher demand volatility may be associated with higher contractual frictions which increases marginal cost and make more frequent shipments optimal. Similarly, product markets with higher demand volatility may necessitate more learning, which may also affect trade volume and its margins. In this paper we will argue that simple stochastic inventory models (see, for example, Zipkin 2000) provide a possible framework to think about these questions, and their predictions are in line with our findings. The key feature of these models (for example, the s–S inventory model) is a tradeoff between a fixed cost of each shipment and inventory costs. In such models, increased volatility raises the marginal cost of the firm, reducing total sales. Firms also adjust to increased volatility by customizing their inventory policy: in general, it may be optimal to increase their inventory levels and change shipment sizes. Also, in these stochastic inventory models, the relevant measure of uncertainty is the variation in demand during the lag between decisions and the arrival of shipments; hence in such a framework one may expect the effect of demand volatility to increase with distance. Indeed, in a related work (Békés et al. 2015), we present one possible such framework that is in line with our empirical observations. To investigate the relationship between volatility and trade margins, we use disaggregated monthly firm–product–destination level customs data from France to measure the effect of volatility on trade quantities and different export margins. After investigating the relevance and validity of our novel variables, namely, the volatility measure and the frequency margin, we focus on within-firm mechanisms and follow four lines of inquiry. First, we ask whether higher demand volatility at the product–destination (or briefly: market) level is associated with lower exports, only to find that firms export less to markets with higher volatility. This finding implies that demand volatility may be a factor which should be taken into account when modeling trade flows or the effects of trade liberalization. Second, we decompose the total exports of a firm to a market into its two margins, the number of months with positive shipments (which we will call frequency margin) and the average export value in active months (which we will call average value). We find that the negative relationship between demand volatility and exports is mainly explained by the frequency margin. In other words, firms typically send fewer, but similar sized shipments to more volatile markets. Understanding these patterns may help in distinguishing between theoretical models or quantifying the different types of costs in such frameworks. Third, we investigate how the two margins change when we condition on the total export of the firm to the market. This way, we may be able to isolate how increased volatility directly affects the inventory policy of the firm, measured by the relative size of the two margins. In contrast, the total effect of volatility (when not conditioning on total exports) also includes the indirect channel, i.e. the more mechanical relationship between smaller total exports and its margins. We find that, conditional on total exports, firms send less frequent, larger shipments to more volatile markets. This suggests that firms, indeed, reoptimize their logistics when demand is more volatile. In line with this observation, stochastic inventory models predict that it is optimal to change inventory levels and shipment size after an increase in uncertainty, even when the total quantity is fixed. Fourth, we study whether these relationships differ between close and farther away markets. The intuition for this exercise is that volatility may matter more when firms can only react with a longer delay. Our results are in line with this intuition: shipment time to destination market magnifies the impact of demand volatility. From a policy perspective, this result implies a new indirect way through which longer shipment time can reduce trade. Our paper contributes to several strands of literature in addition to the already discussed literature on the relationship between uncertainty and shocks on trade. First, from a trade perspective, export frequency is another margin of exports worth studying: the question is not whether you export (extensive firm margin), or how much you export (intensive margin), but how often you export, conditional on your foreign sales.Footnote 3 Such a “transaction margin” has already been observed in the trade literature, although it received limited attention.Footnote 4 One of these papers is Kropf and Sauré (2014), who derive a Melitz-type model encapsulating the fixed costs of shipping; they show that higher fixed costs reduce the frequency of shipments and increase the value per shipment.Footnote 5
Alessandria et al. (2011) also emphasize the lumpy or infrequent nature of trade and show that frequency and shipment size differ across destinations, in particular between imported and domestic orders. In Hornok and Koren (2015a), consumers have a preference for frequent shipments as timely consumption offers higher utility. In their model, per-shipment costs reduce shipment frequency, increase shipment size and the product price.Footnote 6 According to our knowledge, we are the first to study the relationship between demand volatility and the key adjustment margin of frequency. While our empirical research and interpretation are motivated by these approaches, our paper differs in taking a more static, cross-sectional, ‘business-as-usual’ point of view rather than studying the effect of a shock. Other dimensions of uncertainty have been studied in the trade literature. Political uncertainty (Handley and Limao 2015) is indeed one of the sources of demand volatility. Importantly, however, political uncertainty is a macro concept and, as such, it can be identified at the macro level. Our work focuses on the micro level, and the many fixed effects we include are likely to filter out the effect of political uncertainty. Another macro approach focuses on the effect of crises or sudden shocks—large shifts in demand—on trade (Alessandria et al. 2010, 2011; Novy and Taylor 2013).Footnote 7 These models explain time series evidence after large trade shocks treating it as a dynamic optimization problem. The key difference between these studies and ours is that while these studies identify out-of-equilibrium responses, i.e. the transition from one export/logistics strategy to another, the “business as usual” demand volatility we measure compares strategies applied in different markets. The fact that demand volatility seems to be a key concern of logistic experts suggests that it may affect the structure of logistics decisions and, in turn, the cost structure and amount of international trade. All this implies that the role of uncertainty should be studied not only at the time of policy shocks, but also in an equilibrium cross-sectional setting, where firms face an unpredictable fluctuation in demand for their products. Finally, several additional issues that may be relevant to firms’ sales and logistic decisions are excluded from the scope of this paper. When time matters, firms can optimize transportation by choosing between modes of air and maritime cargo (Harrigan 2010; Hummels and Schaur 2013).Footnote 8
Evans and Harrigan (2005) argue that an additional adjustment path is location choice: products that need to be served in a timely fashion will be produced closer to destination markets, thus affecting specialization patterns.Footnote 9 We consider here that location choices are given, and address firms’ strategies conditional on these choices.Footnote 10
 The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses our data and variables. Section 3 investigates our two key novel variables, the volatility measure and the frequency margin. Section 4 presents our estimation strategy and results. Section 5 discusses the results and relates them to inventory management approaches.",13
153,4,Review of World Economics,28 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0288-y,"Natural resource extraction, corruption, and expropriation",November 2017,Ramin Dadasov,Carsten Hefeker,Oliver Lorz,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Conflicts between foreign investors and domestic governments seem to be particularly frequent and acrimonious in the natural resources sector. Prominent examples of conflicts about revenue sharing and outright expropriation of foreign investments include Repsol in Argentina, Rio Tinto in Guinea, and First Quantum Minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which alone are estimated to have cost some 13bn US-$ (Stevens et al. 2013). These are only recent visible cases illustrating bad relations between investors and host country governments. According to the World Bank (2009), 30 countries have revised oil contracts and taxation systems between 1999 and 2010, and Stevens et al. (2013) mention 25 cases in which increases in taxes and royalties were announced and implemented. These events only exemplify a wave of conflicts before arbitration panels and outright expropriations correlated with high prices for natural resources. One possible explanation for expropriations in the resource sector is that exploitation of non-renewable natural resources like minerals, oil, and gas typically involves uncertainty and a considerable time-span before extraction can actually begin and returns can be realized. Moreover, given a high capital demand and a lack of own technical expertise, resource rich countries often need to rely on foreign investors to exploit their resource wealth. Since most of these investments are sunk, foreigners are vulnerable to an appropriation of their assets by host countries’ governments. If prices for natural resources increase, so do resource rents and conflicts about their distribution.Footnote 1 Apart from outright expropriation, conflicts also arise about taxation and how rents are to be shared (Joffé et al. 2009).Footnote 2 Another factor is that natural resource-rich countries are often characterized by deficient institutions, meaning high levels of corruption, a lack of rule of law, and non-inclusive political institutions. This is connected with insufficient protection of property rights, and reinforces the risk of expropriation and renegotiation of revenue-sharing agreements (Collier 2010; Deacon 2011; Van der Ploeg 2011). In this paper, we look at the interaction between expropriation risk, quality of institutions (in particular corruption), and investments of foreign firms in resource-rich countries. While the literature often treats at least one of these dimensions as exogenous, we are among the first to explicitly model the interaction between all three factors and to endogenize them.Footnote 3
 In our theoretical model, expropriation incentives increase in resource revenues and thereby are related to foreign investments—as higher investments lead to more resource output. Foreign investments in turn are declining in the risk of expropriation and also depend on the expected price of the natural resource. While a higher expected price makes investments more attractive, it also raises the risk of expropriation. Furthermore, foreign investments are declining in the level of corruption, i.e., in the bribes firms have to pay (Wei 2000). We model corruption as an implicit tax on firms’ investments that is determined by an independent bureaucracy. The corruption rate in the host country is increasing in resource output and is declining in the costs of corruption, i.e., in the risk of being detected. We also test the theoretical predictions of our model empirically. Using data on natural resource extraction and institutional quality between 2000 and 2010 for a sample of 46 resource-rich countries, we are able to support our theoretical results. In particular, we estimate a system of equations that endogenizes the risk of expropriation, resource extraction and corruption by employing instruments that are derived from our theoretical model. We apply two estimation techniques: Firstly, the Three-Stage Least Square method (3SLS)—to estimate the structural equations of our model simultaneously—and secondly, an instrumental variable estimator based on the Two-Stage Least Square approach (2SLS)—to estimate each equation in the system individually. With both methods, we show that the risk of expropriation negatively affects resource extraction, whereas higher resource extraction in turn leads to a higher risk of expropriation. Our findings also support the theoretical hypothesis that resource extraction raises the level of corruption. Our paper is related to three different strands of literature. Firstly, we build on the huge literature on the relation between foreign direct investment and the risk of expropriation (Cole and English 1991; Eaton and Gersovitz 1983; Thomas and Worrall 1994). Our theoretical and empirical findings for resource extractive industries are consistent with results on FDI in general, for which a negative influence of the risk of expropriation and ""bad"" institutions such as corruption have been identified (Asiedu 2006; Busse and Hefeker 2007; Hajzler 2012; Hefeker and Kessing 2016). In particular, in countries in which the rule of law is absent, governments are unable to commit credibly not to renegotiate the terms of contracts and not to expropriate. The absence of a binding commitment mechanism leads to less foreign investment and sub-optimally low levels of output.Footnote 4 A sizable theoretic literature looks at optimal contracts trading off the risk of expropriation and risk sharing with respect to fluctuations in the price of the underlying resource (e.g., Stroebel and Benthem 2013). In our paper, expropriation occurs in equilibrium due to an insufficient institutional quality. Since the government cannot commit ex ante to sufficient compensation payments, the risk of expropriation cannot be eliminated completely. Secondly, our results confirm earlier studies showing that the risk of expropriation depends positively on the price of the underlying resource and on the rents it generates (Bohn and Deacon 2000; Guriev et al. 2011; Hajzler 2012). This is particularly obvious if governments receive a fixed compensation for the depletion of a resource and if this compensation does not increase with the resource price. But even if host government and foreign investors alike benefit from higher resource prices and higher revenues, too high profits for foreign firms may lead to public and political resistance in host countries and calls for “fairer” shares of national resources. Thirdly, our paper is related to the discussion on corruption.Footnote 5 Like in Acemoglu and Verdier (1998) and Shleifer and Vishny (1993), we ask how government control and punishment of corruption feed back into corruption and the incentives to invest in a given country. Moreover, as in Ades and di Tella (1999) we look at the incentives to engage in rent seeking, and thus replicate earlier results that show how higher resource revenues and rents lead to more rent seeking, corruption and weaker institutions in general, thus suggesting a vicious circle between resources and bad institutions if institutions are weak in the first place.Footnote 6 We endogenize the level of corruption as one particular measure of institutional quality and take others as given. However, unlike other recent papers (e.g. Asiedu et al. 2009 or Biglaiser et al. 2016), we do not ask how policy reforms could be implemented, or how international institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund or conditional bilateral and multilateral aid may influence corruption or the risk of expropriation. In our theoretical model in Sect. 2, we bring together these literatures in a simultaneous determination of expropriation risk, corruption, and resource extraction. Section 3 provides an empirical test of this interaction, and Sect. 4 concludes.",5

Melitz,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There is an extensive empirical literature documenting the response of firm and product-level markups to market-wide changes in an export destination—often referred to as “pricing to market”. When these market-wide changes affect the delivered cost of exported goods, the evidence overwhelmingly confirms the phenomenon of incomplete pass-through: Those cost changes are passed on less than one-for-one into the imported prices paid by consumers.Footnote 1 More recently, empirical work has also documented that the extent of this incomplete pass-through consistently varies with a producer’s performance (at the firm or firm-product level): Better performing producers absorb a greater proportion of a cost shock into their markups (their pass-through rate is more incomplete than for worse performing producers).Footnote 2
 In this paper, I sketch a very simple model of monopolistic competition with heterogeneous exporters that captures these markup responses to market-wide changes. Endogenous markups are driven by variable elasticities of substitution on the demand side. This model highlights how increases in the market-size of a destination induce increases in competition that are tied to decreases in markups for each exported product. The model is used to connect these predictions for markups to predictions on the reallocation effects of increased market size and competition in export markets. These reallocations include both extensive margin trade responses—changes to the set of products exported to the destination—as well as an intensive margin trade response—changes to the relative market shares of exported products. More specifically, increases in competition (and lower markups) are tied to a reallocation of market shares towards better performing exported products. The paper reviews some recent evidence that strongly confirms this type of intensive margin reallocation. A substantial portion of the theoretical trade literature analyzing the response of heterogeneous exporters assumes constant markups.Footnote 3 These models do a good job of capturing the extensive margin of trade: the selection effects that determine which products are sold where. However, those models cannot capture the intensive margin reallocations I just mentioned. The model described in this paper captures both the extensive margin responses (which are very closely aligned with the predictions of models with exogenous markups) as well as the empirically documented intensive margin reallocations. In addition, this model replicates the main findings of the empirical literature on “pricing to market” and incomplete pass-through that was previously mentioned.",9
154,1,Review of World Economics,24 August 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0295-z,Powerless: gains from trade when firm productivity is not Pareto distributed,February 2018,Marco Bee,Stefano Schiavo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper investigates what happens to the estimated gains from trade when one departs from the standard assumption of a Pareto productivity distribution, which characterizes most of the recent literature. The current vintage of international trade models pioneered by Melitz (2003) and Bernard et al. (2003) puts the behavior of firms, rather than countries or industries, at center stage. This shift adds a number of useful insights and moves trade theory closer to business and policymakers by providing microfoundations to aggregate gains from trade (Greenaway and Kneller 2007; Cernat 2014). However, the welfare implications of the new–new trade theory have not been much explored until recently (see, for instance, Arkolakis et al. 2012; di Giovanni and Levchenko 2013; Head et al. 2014; Behrens et al. 2014; Melitz and Redding 2015; Bas et al. 2017). The debate has to do both with the additional gains associated with heterogeneity (Arkolakis et al. 2012; Melitz and Redding 2015) with respect to the previous models featuring homogeneous firms, and with the sensitivity of welfare gains to the degree (and the shape) of the heterogeneity (di Giovanni and Levchenko 2013; Head et al. 2014).Footnote 1
 The starting point of this recent stream of research can be traced to the contribution by Arkolakis et al. (2012), who aim at assessing the additional gains from trade (GFT) associated with firm heterogeneity. On top of the welfare benefits already present in the new-trade literature (Krugman 1980), heterogeneity adds a further source of gains in the form of within-industry reallocation of market shares, forcing low productivity firms to exit and letting more efficient ones expand, thus raising aggregate productivity. Arkolakis et al. (2012) conclude that heterogeneity does not add much insight to what is already known about the size and composition of the gains from trade. Melitz and Redding (2015) show that the results of Arkolakis et al. (2012) depend on some important restrictions, and are very sensitive to even small departures from the original framework. In particular, the setup of Arkolakis et al. requires a constant trade elasticity: this feature is not robust to any departure from the assumption of a Pareto distribution for firm productivity (Bas et al. 2017), and may thus introduce a potential bias in the computation of the GFT. Using a different approach, Melitz and Redding (2015) find that the differences in aggregate welfare between the two families of models are quantitatively important.Footnote 2 Bas et al. (2017) explore in further detail the relationship between trade elasticities and welfare: they find evidence that the hypothesis of a constant trade elasticity across destinations, implied by the assumption of a Pareto distribution, is not supported by the data. Another interesting take at the issue of the welfare gains from trade is provided by di Giovanni and Levchenko (2013), who investigate the welfare impact of a series of reductions in fixed and variable trade costs under different scenarios. In particular, they show that the degree of firm heterogeneity—defined as the shape parameter of the underlying Pareto distribution of firm productivity—significantly affects both the magnitude and the composition of the gains from trade, as well as the benefits accruing from a reduction in fixed versus variable trade costs. The reason is that productivity dispersion influences export participation and thus the importance of changes at the extensive margin of trade. A reduction in trade costs shifts the export productivity threshold and the number of firms that can successfully export: when the upper tail of the productivity distribution is heavy, marginal new exporters are much smaller than firms already exporting and thus have a very limited impact on welfare. Indeed, di Giovanni and Levchenko (2013) find that if the shape parameter of the productivity distribution increases from 1 to 2 (thus lowering dispersion), the gains from a reduction in fixed costs are an order of magnitude larger, while the impact of a reduction in variable costs is an order of magnitude smaller. The question then arises as to whether choosing a different type of productivity distribution might push the argument by di Giovanni and Levchenko (2013) even further. Rephrasing this, we are interested in understanding whether, when it comes to quantifying the welfare gains and potential benefits resulting from a reduction in trade costs, the assumption that productivity follows a Pareto distribution may no longer be an innocuous simplifying assumption, but rather crucially affect the results. The issue is rooted in the old question of the most appropriate distributional assumption to model firm size and productivity.Footnote 3
 In the trade literature, most if not all papers assume a Pareto or Zipf productivity distribution. This choice is motivated with two main bases: first, that the Pareto is tractable and very convenient from a modeling point of view, allowing closed-form solutions; second, that it provides a good approximation of the data, at least for US firms. To substantiate this latter claim, reference is often made to Axtell (2001), who finds that Zipf’s law provides a good representation for the entire distribution of firms in his sample. More recent evidence, however, suggests that the Pareto distribution does a poor job when applied to the whole size/productivity distribution, and fits reasonably well only to the upper tail (see for instance Combes et al. 2012; Freund and Pierola 2015). And even this milder result is debatable both from a methodological (Virkar and Clauset 2014) and an empirical point of view (Rossi-Hansberg and Wright 2007; Bee et al. 2017; Head et al. 2014).Footnote 4
 
Combes et al. (2012) and Head et al. (2014) provide convincing evidence in favor of the lognormal distribution. Building on this, the latter paper explores what happens to GFT when one abandons the Pareto assumption in favor of lognormality: the authors claim that, depending on the calibration of a few key parameters, the welfare effect can be twice as large as under the Pareto assumption. In this paper, we contribute to the debate by extending the analysis to a third distribution, namely the Weibull, by thoroughly exploring the policy implications of the results, and by performing a series of robustness checks. The choice of the Weibull distribution is suggested by several reasons. First, the Weibull is a member of the Gamma-type family of size distributions, which is probably, with the Pareto and the lognormal, the most common family of distributions used for size modeling (Kleiber and Kotz 2003). Second, the Weibull shares with the lognormal and Pareto distributions the property of closure under exponentiation, which is practical as it allows one to easily link the parameters of the distributions of firm size and productivity. Third, similarly to the Pareto and the lognormal, also the Weibull distribution can be derived from economic theory.Footnote 5 Last, even though the tail behaviors of the Pareto and lognormal distributions are qualitatively different, the two can become almost indistinguishable (Malevergne et al. 2011). Comparing them with a third distribution can therefore help to shed light on the effect that different distributional assumptions have on GFT. Our findings confirm that the choice of a specific distribution has a strong impact on the estimated welfare effects in terms of the magnitude of GFT, the relative importance of reductions in fixed versus variable trade costs, and the additional benefits associated with heterogeneity. For instance, a 25% reduction in fixed export costs (one of the projected results from a possible EU–US trade agreement) would yield negligible GFT under a Pareto distribution, while delivering a significant welfare increase assuming a Weibull distribution. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity of the results to key parameters of the model such as the elasticity of substitution, which is notoriously difficult to pin down. We find that under the Pareto distribution welfare effects are especially sensitive to the value of this parameter. We conclude that, when it comes to trade policy analysis, the choice of a specific productivity distribution cannot be regarded as a mere simplifying assumption, but has important repercussions on the estimated GFT. As a result, we warn against the common practice of relying blindly on a single distribution and urge looking at alternatives to make results more robust. Relative to the existing literature, we not only include an additional distribution, but also perform a detailed sensitivity analysis to understand the degree of variability in the results associated with the choice of a specific distribution over another. Furthermore, we discuss at length the policy dimension of our results, a perspective that the existing literature has not investigated much. In fact, as heterogeneous-firm models are increasingly used to draw policy conclusions, it is important to understand the implications of the key underlying assumptions. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the next section presents a brief overview of the theoretical setup we refer to; Sect. 3 provides detailed information on the calibration of the model parameters; Sect. 4 discusses the results from our investigation, comparing GFT under different distributional assumptions; Sect. 5 evaluates the impact of a reduction in variable and fixed trade costs. Finally, Sect. 6 links our findings to the existing literature and concludes.",8
154,1,Review of World Economics,05 July 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0291-3,Tracking wage inequality trends with prices and different trade models: evidence from Mexico,February 2018,Timothy Halliday,Daniel Lederman,Raymond Robertson,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Does globalization increase or reduce inequality? Intense debate surrounding globalization’s effect on wage inequality followed Wood’s (1997) observation that inequality fell in East Asia but rose in Latin America following liberalization. Wood’s (1997) argument inspired many prominent papers that sought to explain why liberalization in a labor-abundant country would result in rising inequality. During the 2000s, however, inequality fell throughout Latin America, suggesting that the link between globalization and inequality is not well understood. When reviewing this literature, Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007) show that the relationship between globalization and inequality is subtle and complex. Contributing factors include outsourcing (Feenstra and Hanson 1997), skill-biased technological change (Esquivel and Rodriguez-Lopez 2003), rising numbers of educated workers (Lopez-Acevedo 2006; Székely and Sámano 2012), exchange rate movements (Verhoogen 2008), income support policies (Esquivel 2010, Soares et al. 2009, Sánchez-Ancochea and Mattei 2011), industry-specific effects (Revenga 1997; Ferreira et al. 2007), and the rise of China (Chiquiar and Ramos-Francia 2008; Dussel Peters and Gallagher 2013; Mendez 2015). Changes in relative output prices, the variables suggested by neoclassical trade theory, remain relatively unexplored. Interestingly, while many of the early papers documenting the rise in inequality following trade liberalization in Latin America reject the neoclassical trade predictions,Footnote 1 papers that use price data to evaluate the Stolper–Samuelson relationship (Beyer et al. 1999 for Chile, Robertson 2004 for Mexico, and Gonzaga et al. 2006 for Brazil) find support for the Stolper–Samuelson theorem. These results suggest that output prices are relevant when trying to understand the relationship between trade and wage inequality. The goal of this paper is to consider the role of relative output price changes in driving the fall in Mexican inequality. Most trade models focus on one of two relative output price measures. The first classifies products by factor intensity. In the globalization-and-wages literature, the relative price of skill-intensive goods is the most common (Beyer et al. 1999; Robertson 2004; Gonzaga et al. 2006 use the relative prices of skill-intensive goods). The less-common second measure is the relative price of traded goods. To illustrate the potential role of the relative price of traded (to nontraded) goods, we develop and simulate a simple Salter–Swan model with firm-level heterogeneity. Firm-level heterogeneity has become almost a standard for recent trade models, including those that focus on labor-market effects of globalization.Footnote 2
 An important difference between these two mechanisms is that they have different implications for how inequality should behave between and within demographic groups. Most of the papers in this literature focus on changes in inequality that are between demographic groups: skill, education, age, gender, and so on. On the other hand, models with firm-level heterogeneity predict that observationally identical workers can earn different wages and, so, any change in inequality predicted by such models would be within demographic groups.Footnote 3
 To illustrate the potential of relative price movements in explaining inequality, we study Mexico over the 1990–2014 period. Mexico is one of the most studied Latin American countries because it is both one of the most unequal countries and a liberalization leader, having embarked on ambitious trade liberalization programs over the last twenty years. We first briefly present evidence on changes in the relative price of Mexico’s skill-intensive goods. We show that those changes help explain the initial rise in inequality but not the subsequent sustained decline that motivates the Salter–Swan model. The Salter–Swan model generates several predictions that we compare to both census and household labor market data. We show that falling inequality is consistent with the predictions of the model, which implies a potentially important role for firm-level heterogeneity in explaining changes in wage inequality. The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents some stylized facts about labor-income inequality in Mexico. Section 3 presents a Salter–Swan model with heterogeneous firms. Simulating a calibrated version of the model generates several predictions that we compare to population census data and household survey data. Section 4 concludes.",1

Furthermore, the macroeconomic aspects of fiscal conduct take on an even greater precedence for members of a currency union that have no monetary or exchange rate policy autonomy. Despite its heightened importance in recent times, the role of sovereign debt as a determinant of relative prices has widely been overlooked.Footnote 2 The objective of this paper is to investigate the theoretical and empirical relevance of public debt and labor taxation for relative prices in the long run. Determining the long-run path of relative prices is especially important for understanding inflation differentials in a monetary union. That is, without a long-run model, it becomes difficult to ascertain whether, below average inflation is reflective of undershooting such that relative prices are below their long-run equilibrium value and reversion is expected, or convergence to a lower fundamentals-based equilibrium associated with greater international price competitiveness. Correspondingly, pinning down the dynamics of relative prices is relevant for projections of external imbalances, and thus for understanding the mechanics of external adjustment. Emanating from the classical contributions of Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964), that emphasize the sectoral productivity differential, the literature on relative prices has predominantly focused on differences in productivity. Bhagwati (1984), for instance, contends that even without differences in sectoral productivity, the real exchange rate may be higher in countries exhibiting higher average productivity relative to trading partners, as long as the nontraded goods sector is relatively labor intensive. Bergin et al. (2006) find that while the Balassa–Samuelson effect has grown steadily over time, there is little support for the effect as of the mid twentieth century.Footnote 3 They reconcile these findings by building a model with endogenous tradability. In relation to demand-side determinants, a large number of studies have examined the effects of government spending on relative price changes in the long run. Amongst others, Froot and Rogoff (1991), De Gregorio et al. (1994), Chinn (1999), Lee et al. (2008), Galstyan and Lane (2009a, b) and Ricci et al. (2013) find that increases in government consumption are associated with medium- to long-run increases in the relative price of nontraded goods or real exchange rate appreciation. Furthermore, Galstyan and Lane (2009a, b) demonstrate that the long-run effects of government investment are more ambiguous. A notable limitation of these studies, however, is the assumption of balanced public sector budgets and lump-sum taxation. In this paper, we depart from this restrictive case, and build on the two-sector small open-economy framework of Galstyan and Lane (2009a) by allowing for debt-financed government budget imbalances and distortionary labor taxation.Footnote 4 Our study aims to explore the connection between public debt, distortionary labor taxation and the relative price of nontraded goods. At the theoretical level, we show that higher taxes, associated with higher levels of public debt, contract labor supply in both traded and nontraded goods sectors. For a given relative demand, relative prices move inversely with relative supply. Crucially, the sign and magnitude of the supply-side adjustment is determined by relative factor intensities across the two sectors. At the empirical level, for a panel of advanced economies, we find statistically significant effects of public debt and taxes on the relative price of nontraded goods, with higher debt and taxes associated with higher relative prices. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 lays out the theoretical model and derives long-run relations. Section 3 provides an overview of the data employed. Section 4 describes the empirical approach adopted for the long-run analysis and discusses the empirical findings for our sample of advanced economies. Lastly, Sect. 5 concludes.",1

154,2,Review of World Economics,09 November 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0301-5,Can countries rely on foreign saving for investment and economic development?,May 2018,Eduardo Cavallo,Barry Eichengreen,Ugo Panizza,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Financially open economies can in principle invest more than they save by tapping foreign finance. In theory, a poor country with a low saving rate but good growth prospects can build up its capital stock by running large and sustained current account deficits. The question is whether this approach to fostering development and growth is feasible and productive in practice. Skeptics question the advisability of relying on foreign finance in good times and bad. In good times, when foreign funding is freely available, capital inflows may lead to resource misalloation, as funding becomes available to less efficient projects and firms and as the associated consumption boom causes resources to be reallocated to the nontradables sector. In bad times, when foreign finance dries up, the country on the receiving end is then forced to undertake a painful and dangerous adjustment. According to urban legend, the IMF has long regarded current account deficits greater than 4% of GDP as a danger sign: deficits above this threshold indicate that a country is exposing itself to the risk of a current account reversal and growth collapse when the capital inflow that financed the deficit comes to a sudden stop.Footnote 1 Aware of the risks, investors will be reluctant to finance current account deficits that persistently exceed this threshold. Countries seeking to build up their capital stocks therefore must and, indeed, should rely on domestic savings to finance domestic investment. The point is often thought be epitomized by China, which has more than fully financed exceptionally high investment rates out of high domestic savings and thereby sustained near-double-digit growth for three decades. Such is the conventional wisdom, in other words. Our analysis supports one part of this conventional wisdom but not the other. Contrary to the received wisdom, we identify a substantial number of countries that have been able to run current account deficits in excess of 4% of GDP for periods as long as 10 years. It has been possible, in other words, for countries to finance a significant portion of domestic investment out of foreign saving, contrary to popular presumption. To be sure, a substantial number of these episodes are in Sub-Saharan Africa, where official finance has been more important than private finance. Official finance tends to be larger, relative to both private capital flows and the size of the recipient country, and more stable, given its sources and motivations. However, in a significant number of other episodes, large and persistent current account deficits have been financed with private capital inflows, of foreign direct investment in particular. But how do large and persistent current account deficit episodes end? Here our results are more consistent with the conventional wisdom: typically they do not end happily. Instead they end abruptly, with compression of the current account, real exchange rate depreciation, and a sharp drop in investment. We show that large and persistent deficit episodes are characterized by above-average growth in the first 4 to 5 years. However, this positive impact dissipates after 5 years. Over a 20-year period, the cumulative growth effect turns negative.Footnote 2 In addition, periods following large and persistent current account deficit episodes are characterized by unusually severe output volatility. We conclude that financing growth and investment out of foreign savings is not impossible, but it is risky and does not yield a clear growth dividend.Footnote 3
 Our findings relate to four kindred literatures. First, there is research on the relationship between saving and investment adopting the pioneering approach of Feldstein and Horioka (1980) but analyzing data for more recent periods. (The subsequent literature is large: for a survey see Apergis and Tsouimas 2009.) These studies show that the tight correlation between domestic saving and investment found in the original Feldstein-Horioka study loosened after the authors wrote their seminal piece, as international financial markets developed further and governments relaxed and, in the limit, removed their capital controls. Second, there is the literature on the years before 1913, when the savings-investment correlation was also looser than in the third quarter of the twentieth century, and when late-developing countries like Canada, Australia and Argentina relied very substantially on foreign savings for domestic investment. Bayoumi (1990) and Taylor (1994) show that data like those used by Feldstein and Horioka look very different in this earlier period. Schularick and Steger (2010) show that countries relying most heavily on foreign saving for investment grew most rapidly in this period. Fishlow (1985) and Eichengreen (1985) observe that much of the investment financed with foreign capital was in infrastructure and tradable-goods capacity where it could be used to generate the exports needed to service the additional external debt, and that borrowing took place in a setting characterized by strong political ties between the lenders (often European) and borrowers (often overseas regions of recent European settlement).Footnote 4
 Third, there is the literature on lending booms and sudden stops, which highlights the risks of heavy reliance on private capital inflows (Calvo et al. 2004; Cavallo and Frankel 2008). Sudden stops are when foreign investors curtail their purchases of domestic assets and/or local investors engage in capital flight. By definition, they reduce or eliminate the external financing available to countries that previously invested more than they saved, requiring the affected country to eliminate its current account deficit abruptly. This adjustment is usually accomplished through a combination of real exchange rate depreciation and import contraction, both of which are often associated with recession. Real depreciation can be disruptive because it raises the cost of servicing foreign-currency-denominated debt, triggering bankruptcies that create output costs. Import compression is achieved through expenditure-reducing policies that typically also reduce output and employment. For all these reasons, sudden stops are costly in terms of output. At the same time, there is also a related literature documenting that not all externally-financed lending booms end in sudden stops and hard landings (see e.g. Gourinchas et al. 2001), and some work suggesting that even when they do the net growth effects remain positive (Tornell and Westermann 2002; Ranciere et al. 2006). Complementing the literature on sudden stops is research on “current account reversals” (i.e., Milesi Ferretti and Razin 2000; Edwards 2004; Adalet and Eichengreen 2007; Freund and Warnock 2007). Contributors ask whether countries can avoid disruptive current account reversals by strengthening their macroeconomic fundamentals. They establish that countries with weak macroeconomic frameworks are more likely to experience current account reversals. In the paper closest to our own, Edwards (2004) analyzes a data set for 157 countries covering the period 1970–2001. He finds that large current account deficits are typically limited in duration; financing them for extended periods is problematic. In addition, he finds that the probability of a reversal can be predicted by a relatively small number a of variables, including a country’s (lagged) current account to GDP ratio, the external debt to GDP ratio, the level of international reserves, domestic credit growth, and the debt-service ratio. A fourth and final literature considers implications for growth of capital inflows and their termination. Prasad et al. (2007) study the growth experience of countries that rely on foreign finance for investment. They conclude that developing countries have limited absorptive capacity, whether because their financial markets are underdeveloped or because their exchange rates are prone to overvaluation in the event of large capital inflows, excessive consumption growth, or a combination of these factors.Footnote 5 Gopinath et al. (2016) focus on capital inflows into Southern Europe following the advent of the euro and show that the short-term boost to growth was swamped by the longer-term negative effects of resource misallocation. Blanchard (2007) and Benigno and Fornaro (2014) all provide detailed analyses of Portugal, again showing that the loosening of external financial constraints following euro adoption was associated with stagnant productivity and ultimately negative impacts on growth. The conclusions of these studies of the recent period are in striking contrast to those of Schularick and Steger (referenced above) for the years before 1913. Moreover, these studies of recent experience generally focus only on a relatively small subset of countries (sometimes as few as one), so their generality is not established. Establishing it is our goal in this paper. We do so by analyzing data for the population of developing countries and emerging markets over the entire period 1970–2013, a larger panel than considered in previous work. We provide a new and more precise definition of “large and persistent current account deficits” and use that definition to construct a treatment group of episodes, behavior in which we then compare with that in a matching set of control-group cases. We vary the thresholds used in constructing our deficit measure and establish the robustness of our results with respect to a large range of alternative thresholds. The analysis establishes more definitively than before which part of the conventional wisdom regarding large and persistent current account deficits survives, and which part does not.",9

154,2,Review of World Economics,15 February 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-018-0311-y,The variation of export prices across and within firms,May 2018,Juan de Lucio,Raúl Mínguez,Francisco Requena,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The literature has documented large differences across exporters (Bernard et al. 2007, 2012). On the extensive margin, there is ample variation in the number of exported products, the portfolio of destinations and the frequency of transactions across firms. On the intensive margin, there are sizable differences in the export price of a product across firms, and within firms and across destinations (Bastos and Silva 2010; Manova and Zhang 2012; Martin 2012; Harrigan et al. 2015; Görg et al. 2017).Footnote 1 In particular, exporters set higher prices in more distant and richer markets. This paper uses transaction-level trade data to analyze the variation of export prices across and within Spanish firms. The transactional nature of our database uncovers important differences in the export price that a firm charges for the same product in the same destination. For a representative sample of multi-transaction exporters, we find that this new margin explains 23% of the overall variation in export prices. We test five hypotheses that might explain this new component of the variation in export prices. First, the variation of export prices might be explained by randomness or measurement errors in the prices charged by firms. We expect this randomness to increase as firms carry out a larger number of transactions. In line with this hypothesis, we find a positive relationship between the dispersion of export prices within a firm, destination, product and year, and the number of transactions carried out by firms at this level. Second, even in a highly detailed 8-digit product classification, some categories might cover different goods. We show that within a firm and a destination, product categories that cover more goods have a higher dispersion of prices. Third, firms might find easier to set different prices for differentiated than for homogeneous products. We find a positive relationship between the variation in export prices within firms, products and destinations and product differentiation. However, this coefficient is not precisely estimated. Fourth, firms might charge lower prices for customers that place larger orders. Our empirical analysis confirms this hypothesis, documenting a negative correlation between export prices and quantities for the same firm, product and destination. Finally, following Manova and Yu (2017), we argue that differences in prices can be explained because firms offer vertically-differentiated varieties of a product. This model predicts that (i) more productive firms have a larger dispersion of export prices; and, (ii) the dispersion of export prices is higher in large markets and in markets where the level of competition is lower; and the dispersion is lower in markets that are far away. We do not find support for a positive association between productivity and dispersion of export prices. The results for market size and level of competition are in line with the second prediction. However, the result for distance is not in line with the prediction. This paper contributes to the literature showing that there are sizable differences in the export price that firms charge for the same product and destination. This new margin, which is uncovered by the transactional nature of our data, contributes substantially to the overall differences in export prices. We show that this new component of the variation of prices is related to the number of export transactions carried out by firms, the number of goods that are covered within each product category and pricing to customer strategies. We also find partial support for the vertically-differentiated varieties' hypothesis. The dispersion of prices within firms, products and destinations identified in this paper suggests that firms organize production across detailed product lines, vertically-differentiated varieties and customers’ characteristics. These margins provide firms with further opportunities to reallocate resources to their best use in response to shocks. The large dispersion of prices also suggests that the decision to export is not only market and product specific, but also customer specific. In line with this argument, recent empirical evidence shows that export promotion agencies help regular exporters to expand the buyers portfolio in destinations where the firms are already selling (Gil-Pareja et al. 2015). Models of international trade should incorporate this new margin to the understand the differences in exports across firms (Carballo et al. 2013; Bernard et al. 2018). This paper is related with different strands of the literature. First, it is related to previous papers, such as Bastos and Silva (2010), Manova and Zhang (2012), Martin (2012), Harrigan et al. (2015), Görg et al. (2017) and Manova and Yu (2017) that use firm-level data to explain the differences in export prices across and within exporters. We add to this literature showing that differences in prices within a firm and a destination is an important source of variation in export prices. The paper is also related to theoretical and empirical papers which argue that firms compete in quality (Verhoogen 2008; Baldwin and Harrigan 2011; Crozet et al. 2012; Johnson 2012; Kugler and Verhoogen 2012). Our empirical estimations do not show a positive association between TFP and the dispersion of export prices. Our paper also relates to Bernard et al. (2010), Eckel and Neary (2010), Nocke and Yeaple (2014) and Manova and Yu (2017), which analyze multiple-product or multiple-variety firms. The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the theoretical models that guide our empirical analyses. Section 3 describes how we combine three different datasets to build our estimation samples. Section 4 performs the price decomposition and highlights the important contribution of the variation in prices within a firm and a destination to the overall variation in prices. Section 5 proposes five hypotheses to explain the new price variation component and tests their empirical validity. The final section concludes.",4

154,2,Review of World Economics,26 September 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0298-9,Indirect productivity effects from foreign direct investment and multinational firm heterogeneity,May 2018,Karolien Lenaerts,Bruno Merlevede,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Policymakers believe that foreign direct investment (FDI) will contribute to faster economic growth and welfare through increases in capital stocks, improvements in technology, and through the creation of jobs (Harding and Javorcik 2011; Borensztein et al. 1998). Aside from such direct effects, policymakers also expect indirect positive productivity effects on domestic firms. Expected benefits are fuelled by the idea that foreign firms must have some special advantages, such as superior technology, in order to enter new markets successfully (Markusen 1995). Foreign firms indeed have been found to be more productive than domestic firms, even after controlling for selection effects (Arnold and Javorcik 2009; Guadalupe et al. 2012). The analysis of the indirect productivity effects of FDI, however, builds on interactions between many domestic and foreign firms of different productivity levels. In this paper we analyse how indirect productivity effects from FDI vary with the productivity levels of individual foreign and domestic firms and the distance between them. Figure 1 motivates our analysis. It contains typical distribution plots of productivity levels of foreign and domestic firms for an industry in our dataset.Footnote 1 Although the distribution for foreign firms is clearly to the right, the level of productivity of the most productive domestic firms certainly does not fall short of the level of productivity of many foreign firms. Figure 1 thus raises the question whether all foreign firms bring equal indirect productivity effects and how this interacts with the productivity level of domestic firms. Foreign firms have been used to define the technology frontier, e.g. Sjöholm (1999) shows the scope for positive effects to increase with distance to the frontier. This suggests to expect bigger effects from foreign firms with higher productivity levels such as D that is among the most productive (foreign) firms in the market. However, although foreign firms with higher productivity levels might offer a larger scope for positive effects, domestic firms need to be able to tap into this potential. The latter idea is not new to a literature that has often used the distance between a domestic firm’s productivity level and the frontier foreign firm(s) as an indicator of the former’s absorptive capacity. The gap between high-productivity foreign firms and domestic firms might be too wide for productivity effects to manifest themselves. Kokko (1996), for example, finds that within-industry indirect effects are positive and significant only for firms with small or moderate technology gaps relative to foreign firms. Combining scope and absorptive capability arguments leads to potential non-linearities. Girma and Görg (2007) find a U-shaped relationship between productivity growth and their horizontal spillover variable interacted with the level of technology and Girma (2005) observes that horizontal effects increase with absorptive capability up to a threshold level, beyond which the increase is much less pronounced. Damijan et al. (2013) find that positive horizontal effects are more likely to accrue to high productivity firms with higher absorptive capacity, while negative horizontal effect are more likely to affect low productivity firms. To the best of our knowledge, however, productivity heterogeneity of domestic and foreign firms have not yet been jointly analyzed as a determinant factor of indirect productivity effects from FDI. From Fig. 1 it is clear however that both matter and potentially interact. Domestic firm C may not benefit from the presence of foreign firm B because C is more productive than B, but C may well benefit from the presence of foreign firm D. Firm A, on the other, hand might benefit from B, but not from D, or it may even lack the absorptive capacity to benefit at all. Density plot of Olley–Pakes (OP) TFP for domestic and foreign firms in the Romanian ‘Manufacture of food products and beverages’ industry (NACE 2-digit industry 15, revision 1.1) Some authors have investigated other types of foreign firm heterogeneity. Javorcik and Spatareanu (2008) examine the relationship between a firm’s ownership structure (partially versus wholly foreign-owned) and productivity effects. Javorcik and Spatareanu (2011) differentiate between American and European MNEs in order to determine how indirect productivity effects are related to the origin of foreign investors. Work by Marin and Bell (2006) and Marin and Sasidharan (2010) explores how differences in technology-related activities in foreign subsidiaries affect ensuing indirect productivity effects. Keller and Yeaple (2009) find very pronounced indirect productivity effects in high-tech sectors, whereas they are largely absent in low-tech sectors. To the best of our knowledge, however, productivity heterogeneity of domestic and foreign firms have not yet been jointly analyzed as a determinant factor of indirect productivity effects from FDI. To analyse domestic and foreign firm heterogeneity we first split the traditional variables that capture foreign presence into components that refer to foreign firms that have a ‘higher’ or ‘lower’ productivity level than a given domestic firm. This results in firm-specific rather than traditional industry-specific variables. We find that backward linkages with foreign clients with higher productivity levels result in positive productivity effects. Linkages with foreign firms of lower productivity, by contrast, result in zero to negative effects. We further investigate how foreign firms’ productivity levels interact with a given domestic firm’s productivity level as an indicator of both the scope for effects and the domestic firms’ ability to capture them. We find that especially linkages with foreign firms with a productivity level more than two standard deviations higher than the domestic firm boost the latter’s productivity. Domestic firms with the highest initial productivity levels benefit most. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the standard empirical framework for the analysis of indirect productivity effects from foreign direct investment. This section also presents our data. Section 3 inserts foreign and domestic firm heterogeneity in the standard empirical framework and presents and interprets the results. In Sect. 4, we perform a number of robustness tests and in Sect. 5 we discuss our results in the context of a number of issues and limitations that traditionally affect the literature on indirect productivity effects from FDI. Finally, Sect. 6 briefly summarizes our findings.",6

While the objective is usually macro-economic in nature, with a goal to ensure a sustainable path of trade balance, the policies involved are often micro-economic. This is especially true in currency unions such as the eurozone, where changes in the nominal exchange rate intended to reduce the consumer-relevant price abroad are not an option. Some of the remaining policy tools available are directed at non-price competitiveness (R&D tax breaks being one example, see e.g. Hombert and Matray 2015). It is however likely that the impact of this type of measures only manifests itself in the long-run. Shorter-run policies are aimed at reducing the costs of domestic firms with respect to foreign competitors so as to strengthen price competitiveness. Numerous channels of action are possible. The basic idea is that export performance of firms is driven by the export price set by the firm, and that the pass-through of the cut in unit costs to lower export price is high enough to ensure that the market share captured by domestic firms on international markets increases. Any policy reducing the explicit or implicit cost of exports will work under those assumptions. Reducing the price of energy (or the regulations related to how clean the production process is) is an option that has been invoked by the recently elected US administration.Footnote 1 Cutting the costs of using domestic labor is another obvious candidate that can take different forms: wage moderation, flexibility in labor market regulations, or transferring the tax burden of social contributions (payroll tax) to other tax sources for instance. Our paper focuses on the last of those policies. Since 2013, the French government implemented a tax credit aimed at boosting competitiveness and employment, named the CICE in French (standing for Competitiveness and Employment Tax Credit or Crédit d’impôt pour la compétitivité et l’emploi in French). The policy is intended to act as a cut in unit labor costs (see Sect. 3 for all details on the policy change). The tax credit is set proportional to the share of the wagebill paid to workers under a certain threshold (2.5 times the national minimum wage). Each firm receives a transfer of 4% (raised to 6% since 2014) of the total wagebill that is under the threshold. This policy design gives us a natural experiment where we can match for each firm the intensity of labor cost reduction (that varies according to its original labor force composition), and its export performances (intensive and extensive margins) before and after treatment. Our results cast doubts on the effects to be expected from reductions in labor costs regarding export performance. While the magnitude of our point estimates are consistent with expectations, i.e. commonly estimated firm-level trade elasticities multiplied by reasonable values of the share of labor in total costs, coefficients are found to be very noisy, suggesting lack of robust evidence of a causal effect of the policy. A recent paper with similar motivation to ours is Decramer et al. (2016), which looks at how unit labor costs affect export performance using Belgian firm-level data. This paper finds quite large and significant elasticities, when regressing the change in (log of) exports on the change in (log of) unit labor costs. When adopting the same specification, we also find that a 10% increase in unit labor costs is associated with around 2% lower exports. Another related paper is Gan et al. (2016), who evaluate how regionally-driven changes in the minimum wage faced by Chinese exporters affect their competitiveness. In contrast to Decramer et al. (2016), we evaluate a policy that specifically reduced labor costs in a heterogeneous manner depending on the initial wage structure of the firm. This offers a natural instrumentation strategy based on the administrative threshold that determines which employees are eligible to the policy. Compared to Gan et al. (2016), our work does not rely on the exogeneity of changes in the minimum wage decided by local authorities. The policy change is national, and heterogeneity in the treatment only comes through pre-treatment composition of the labor force across firms. The French government had an aim to bolster national competitiveness, not export performance of the subset of firms that had a specially high share of workers below a certain threshold. The choice of the precise threshold was itself not anticipated, and driven by a mix of considerations related to the impact on unemployment and to budgetary constraints rather than pre-trends of different groups of firms.Footnote 2
 In addition to evaluating the impact of a change in labor costs on the competitiveness of firms on export markets, our paper contributes to the literature on price elasticities in trade. The largest set of papers in this vein uses variation in tariffs and/or exchange rates as price shifters. Berman et al. (2012), Fitzgerald and Haller (2017), Bas et al. (2017), Berthou and Fontagné (2016) are recent contributions that all use firm-level response to ad valorem tariffs and exchange rate variation in export markets. Amiti et al. (2014) and Piveteau and Smagghue (2015) use a related approach, where they calculate the change in marginal cost implied by the initial composition of inputs imported by each firm, interacted with exchange rate changes in its sourcing country, which they use to predict changes in export prices and therefore export values. One of the most important finding of that literature is the so-called international elasticity puzzle: the response of demand to changes in tariffs is much larger than the impact of changes in exchange rates, with elasticities typically being estimated (in absolute value) between 3 and 5 for tariffs, and often lower than 1 for exchange rates. This is a puzzle since most of our theoretical framework would predict those two (delivered) price shifters to have the same effect on trade flows. Fontagné et al. (2017) also use the reaction of firm-level exports to tariffs and exchange rates, but add the impact of changes in f.o.b prices at the firm level instrumented by a cost shifter based on how firms differ in their electricity bill. The idea is that changes in electricity prices are mostly driven by regulatory changes interacted with differences in contract dates and length, that are exogenous to the firm, and do not affect exports directly. This is one of the most proximate investigation to ours since the dimension of the estimating variable is firm-level, with a credible claim for exogeneity and therefore causality in the estimation of the price elasticity. Their results start by reproducing the international elasticity puzzle: the response of exports to changes in tariffs is much larger than the response to changes in exchange rates. They also show that the changes in f.o.b prices by the exporter have a large impact on demand, with an elasticity estimated around − 5. Compared to this literature, we base our estimates of the trade elasticity on a policy change, that affected unit costs of different firms in a heterogeneous manner. The remainder of the paper is as follows: Sect. 2 structures our analysis in terms of the underlying theoretical motivation. Section 3 describes the data used, in particular how we merge the different elements of firm-level data sources to calculate the intensity of treatment of different firms in terms of their labor costs. Section  4 proceeds with results for different margins of adjustment to changes in labor costs, before concluding with Sect. 5.",3
154,3,Review of World Economics,21 February 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-018-0305-9,The ladder of internationalization modes: evidence from European firms,August 2018,Gábor Békés,Balázs Muraközy,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Globalization and market integration did not only provide an opportunity for more firms to serve foreign markets, it also opened the door to choose from a number of ways (or modes) to serve those markets: FDI and outsourcing, for example, has become a viable option for a growing number of firms.Footnote 1 The very detailed survey data used in this paper reveals that 63% of European manufacturing firms with at least 10 employees do sell abroad and 25% of these firms engage in internationalization modes beyond direct exporting and FDI. Recent research has shown that internationalization modes can often be ranked based on the commitment or fixed cost they require and, therefore, a growing number of productive firms self-select into more and more demanding modes. This self-selection process can be interpreted as an extensive margin of trade and has been shown to have important consequences for reallocation and gains from trade (Helpman et al. 2004). Such sorting has been studied between different modes. The seminal model of Helpman et al. (2004) proposed a model of sorting between exporting and horizontal FDI, where FDI requires a more substantial fixed cost but a lower variable cost than exporting. This cost structure generates a sorting between non-traders, exporters, and firms conducting FDI. A similar trade-off and sorting pattern was recently proposed regarding the decision between indirect and direct exporting (Ahn et al. 2011; Felbermayr and Jung 2011; Lu et al. 2014).Footnote 2 Another sorting pattern was observed in the relationship between export, outsourcing, and FDI (Greenaway and Kneller 2007; Tomiura 2007). However, mainly because of the scarcity of information, most studies have focused on a few internationalization modes only. A limitation of this approach is either that many distinct modes are handled as one category or, more importantly, some modes are ignored (i.e. firms conducting some modes are treated as non-traders). As a result, only a part of the firm’s choice set is modeled. The main aim of this study is to contribute to the sorting literature by analysing many internationalization modes within an integrated theoretical and empirical framework. In particular, we investigate how firms sort into internationalization modes—a setup which we call the ladder of internationalization. We rely on a cross-country cross-sectional dataset, with direct survey information on multiple internationalization modes at the firm level, and we study the distance between the steps of this ladder as well as features of the sorting mechanism itself. We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we use a survey database gathered in the European Firms in a Global Economy (EFIGE) project, which includes a wealth of information on many internationalization modes and is linked to balance sheet data from the AMADEUS database. The dataset is unique as it both covers a wide range of internationalization as well as innovation measures and may be linked to balance sheet data.Footnote 3
 The questionnaire distinguishes several modes of serving the foreign market. First, firms can sell their products directly to corporate and final consumers; this is Direct export. Second, they may sell to local intermediaries, who will then sell the products to consumers abroad; this is Indirect export. Third, they may invest abroad and set up a service affiliate, Service FDI, to sell locally. Fourth, they may outsource production to a partner, dubbed Outsourced manufacturing. Fifth, having invested abroad, they may have sales from foreign production for the host market called Manufacturing FDI. Importantly, the data enable us to distinguish between vertical and horizontal motives for foreign manufacturing. As our primary interest lies in the manner of serving the foreign markets (and this is what sorting frameworks model), horizontal outsourcing and FDI will be considered as internationalization modes (the dependent variable) while vertical outsourcing and FDI will be explanatory variables in some specifications controlling for foreign sourcing decisions.Footnote 4
 Second, to guide our empirical analysis, we extend a sorting model to a choice among N potential modes. In the model firms are heterogeneous both in their productivity (supply side) and the quality of their product (demand side).Footnote 5 In particular, we extend the models of Crozet et al. (2013) and Aw and Lee (2014) to a choice among N potential modes. In order to describe a ladder of internationalization, we characterize the cost structure of each mode with two parameters: its fixed cost level and the associated iceberg-type marginal trade costs, and assume that modes with lower trade costs have progressively higher fixed costs. In terms of empirical methodology, our model suggests that an ordered logit regression may be appropriate to estimate sorting along multiple variables. Third, besides descriptive tools, we estimate multinomial and ordered logit regressions which allow firms to choose from the set of internationalization modes we observe and control for industry, country variables and firm-level characteristics. Multinomial logit models require weaker functional form assumptions while ordered logits provide estimates which are more closely related to our model. We examine sorting along two measures: TFP and a composite measure of product ’Innovativeness’. One interpretation is that TFP is a proxy for productivity while product innovation is more closely related to product appeal or quality. Another possible interpretation is that these are two related (and correlated) measures of firm capabilities. Importantly, results are very consistent across specifications. There seems to be three clear ’clusters’ or main steps on the ladder of internationalization: first, indirect exporting, which is very similar to no trade; second, direct exporting and outsourced manufacturing; and third, service and manufacturing FDI. These clusters differ significantly, but there seems to be a hierarchy of modes within each of these clusters. Innovativeness seems to be an even stronger predictor of sorting than productivity. We also show that the relative role of the two variables may differ across modes. For example, in the case of outsourced manufacturing, only innovativeness is a significant predictor of selection. This analysis complements a number of empirical studies on sorting. The patterns in our data reinforce the emphasis on sorting for direct export and FDI as in Helpman et al. (2004). Similarly to us, using Japanese data, Tomiura (2007) found evidence for sorting between outsourcing and FDI making firms. However, our results contrast with studies that found strong sorting into indirect exporting [for example, Felbermayr and Jung (2011) and Ahn et al. (2011)]. In line with a growing literature we also find evidence that firm capabilities may be multidimensional: Innovativeness seems to have a strong association with internationalization mode choice, even when controlling for TFP [as in Crino and Epifani (2014)]. Finally, let us point out some important constraints of our analysis. Most importantly, our data is cross-sectional, hence it is not possible to estimate causal effects. This, to some extent, reflects a trade-off between measuring many internationalization modes precisely and estimating causal effects. In addition, we have information on trade modes at the firm level rather than at the firm-destination or firm-product level. In a sense, we observe the most demanding mode the firm is employing in any of its markets. Analysis based on more detailed data could possibly unravel even finer patterns of internationalization. Third, while our results are suggestive that sorting is multidimensional, we cannot clearly distinguish between supply and demand factors because our empirical measures are likely to be correlated both with productivity and quality, though in different ways. Fourth, our database includes data only on manufacturing firms while sorting patterns may differ significantly in the service sector. The paper is laid out as follows. The next section introduces a simple theoretical framework that guides our empirical analysis. In Sect. 3, we introduce our dataset, explain how we classify firms into internationalization modes and how we calculate the explanatory variables and show some stylized facts. Section 4 presents our results, while we conclude in Sect. 5.",8
154,3,Review of World Economics,02 March 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-018-0308-6,Central bank credibility and the expectations channel: evidence based on a new credibility index,August 2018,Grégory Levieuge,Yannick Lucotte,Sébastien Ringuedé,Male,Male,Male,Male,"“In a word, credibility matters in the theory and it is certainly believed to matter in practice—although empirical evidence on this point is hard to come by because credibility is not easy to measure” (Blinder 2000, p. 1421). This quotation perfectly sums up the complex issues surrounding the concept of central bank credibility. Credibility is an issue of critical importance in modern central banking (González-Páramo 2007), and is viewed as a precious asset not to be squandered (Blinder 1998). Nonetheless, despite the growing interest of policymakers and academics in this concept, no clear consensus has emerged on what central bank credibility really means, how it can be established, and especially how it can be measured. The survey conducted by Blinder (2000) indicates that the definition of credibility is not the same for central bankers as it is for academics. In particular, the former more closely relate inflation aversion to credibility than the latter.Footnote 1
 According to Blinder (1998, 2000), such differences in view between practitioners and academics stems from the fact that the former have a definition of credibility in mind that differs from that formalized within the traditional time-consistency literature originating from Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983a, b).Footnote 2 Looking back on his experience as a central banker, Blinder (1998) argues that central bankers consider themselves to be credible if their announcements are believed by people, even though they are not bound by a rule that ties their hands. In other words, a monetary authority is said to be credible if “people believe it will do what it says” (Blinder 2000), i.e. if deeds are expected to match words. This short and intuitive definition is close to that considered by Cukierman and Meltzer (1986) in their theoretical work. They define credibility as the absolute value of the difference between the central bank’s planned monetary policy and the private sector’s beliefs about these plans. They define in this way the “average credibility of announcements”. On these grounds, in an inflation-targeting framework, credibility means that people believe that the central bank has the ability to reach the previously announced inflation target. In particular, this means that private sector inflation expectations are anchored on the target and that people do not over-react to target misses. Based on this statement, several scholars have developed measures for assessing the degree of credibility of a central bank. To the best of our knowledge, the first paper that investigated this issue is Svensson (1993). He compares ex post target-consistent real interest rates with market real interest rates on real bonds to assess whether the inflation-targeting framework is credible or not in Canada, New Zealand and Sweden.Footnote 3 However, such an indirect approach considers credibility to be a one/zero variable (credible or not, respectively), while in practice, there exist intermediate degrees of credibility (Blinder 1998). With the increasing availability of survey data on inflation expectations, further contributions have instead relied on more direct measures of central bank credibility. Direct credibility measures may be divided into two main categories. The first is based on the Bomfim and Rudebusch (2000) methodology, which consists of assessing the weight attached by the private sector to the inflation target in the formation of their inflation expectations. To this point, if the latter are based on the target, then the central bank is considered to be credible. The second category of central bank credibility measures refers to the gap between the inflation expectations of the private sector and the inflation target (or the inflation target range). The well-known index of Cecchetti and Krause (2002), who define credibility as an inverse function of this gap, belongs to this category. Such an index has been extended by De Mendonça (2007) and De Mendonça and de Guimarães e Souza (2009), who replace the inflation target point with a target range and consider the possibility of a loss of credibility for negative deviations.Footnote 4
 The indicators developed by Cecchetti and Krause (2002) and De Mendonça and de Guimarães e Souza (2009) have two main advantages. They are intuitive and easy to compute. However, they are not discriminating enough. Indeed, they rely on an ad hoc parameter for expected inflation, set to 20%, beyond which the credibility of a central bank is considered to be null. Such a threshold is unjustified, considering the single-digit inflation rates and the decreasing inflation targets in the concerned countries over the last decade. When the target is low, these indicators improperly underestimate the effect of large positive deviations of inflation expectations from the target on credibility, particularly when the target is far from 20%. Against this background, the first objective of the paper is to propose and construct a new time-varying measure of central bank credibility that addresses the main limitations of the existing indicators in the literature. More precisely, we propose a forward-looking measure based on the difference between inflation expectations and the announced policy target. This measure has two main features. It assumes that negative deviations of inflation expectations from the target would result in a lower loss of credibility than positive deviations. Furthermore, contrary to the existing indicators in the literature, our index does not depend on any ad hoc threshold. We then compute our measure of central bank credibility for all emerging market economies that adopted inflation targeting and identify some stylized facts about the evolution of credibility in this category of countries. Consistent with the results obtained by Bordo and Siklos (2017), we find for most emerging inflation-targeting economies relatively high credibility levels, reflecting the ability of the central bank of these countries to anchor inflation expectations on their target. Furthermore, we show that our measure is more suited to assess the monetary policy experiences of these economies than the existing ones. In particular, we show that our index is better able to discriminate between the periods of low versus high credibility in a context of rather low inflation targets. This question of monetary policy credibility is particularly relevant for emerging inflation-targeting countries. A credible central bank is expected to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission through two channels: the expectations channel and the interest rate channel.Footnote 5 Indeed, if a central bank is credible, people believe that the announced target will be realized. From the observed and expected inflation rate, agents can infer the future path of interest rates. Monetary policy is then easily transmitted along the yield to maturity curve. Moreover, wages and prices are set accordingly. Disinflation is then less costly.Footnote 6 Finally, changes in the policy rates are less likely to be considered to be temporary by the banking sector, which is then more prone to pass monetary policy impulses on retail interest rates (Mojon 2001). A greater transparency and communication in monetary policy should help the central bank to conduct a less aggressive policy, characterized by an increased interest rate smoothing. It is not necessary to frequently change the level of key interest rates. Communication becomes a tool of monetary policy. Consequently, central bank credibility is a self-reinforcing process that emerging economies should seek to strengthen. For this reason, the second objective of this paper is to use our index of central bank credibility to empirically assess the effect of credibility on interest rate volatility. To this end, we estimate a country-by-country Exponential General Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (EGARCH) model that links our index of credibility with the conditional variance of the short-term interest rate. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first paper in the literature that addresses this issue for a large sample of emerging inflation-targeting countries. Results that we obtain show for most countries that central bank credibility tends to decrease the volatility of the key instrument of monetary policy, suggesting that a credible central bank needs to do less to deliver price stability. Conversely, without credibility more aggressive action is needed to achieve the same objective (Demertzis and Viegi 2016). The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the existing measures of central bank credibility. Section 3 presents our new index. Section 4 compares our index with previous indicators and analyzes the evolution of central bank credibility in emerging inflation-targeting countries. Section 5 is devoted to the impact of credibility on interest rate volatility. Section 6 concludes the paper.",16

154,3,Review of World Economics,23 March 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-018-0315-7,The effects of globalization and technology on the elasticity of substitution,August 2018,Hector Sala,Pedro Trivín,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The elasticity of substitution between capital and labor (\(\sigma\)) is a key macroeconomic parameter. It determines the path of economic growth, affects the functional distribution of income, and conditions the impacts of fiscal and monetary policies (Klump and de La Grandville 2000; Chirinko 2008). Given its prominence, intense efforts to estimate its value should come as no surprise (Antràs 2004; Chirinko 2008; Chirinko and Mallick 2014). However, although there is a wide range of values found for \(\sigma\) across countries and periods, most of the studies rely on Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production functions which, by definition, hinder variations in its value, and lead \(\sigma\) to be treated as a deep parameter. This paper, in contrast, takes an empirical perspective in search of potential determinants of \(\sigma\). To undertake this analysis, we depart from a class of changing elasticity of substitution production functions developed by Antony (2009a, b, 2010), whose main feature is that variations in the relative factor intensity (the capital-labor ratio) may cause changes in \(\sigma\). To identify the change in \(\sigma\) the strategy we follow is given by Bentolila and Saint-Paul’s (2003) framework, where the relationship between the labor income share and capital intensity (the capital-output ratio) can be used to infer the magnitude of \(\sigma\). However, given the close relationship between the capital-output ratio and Antony’s main determinant of \(\sigma\) (the relative factor intensity), we focus directly on two major phenomena driving the path of the capital-labor ratio: globalization and technological change (see Sect. 2). From a methodological point of view, we allow \(\sigma\) to be conditioned by globalization and technology by using multiplicative interaction models, which are estimated by both standard dynamic panel data models, and Mean Group-style estimators based on common factor models (see Eberhardt and Teal 2011). Our database contains information for a maximum of 51 economies (listed in Table A1, in the “Online Appendix”), with a sample period running from 1970 to 2009. The main findings of our analysis are (1) that both globalization and technology affect the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor; and (2) that this is expressed in different patterns in the OECD and non-OECD economies. For the OECD, the results are robust and conclusive. We find that labor and capital are complements (\(\sigma <1\)); that \(\sigma\) increases along with the degree of globalization, but it decreases with the level of technology. The first result confirms previous findings in the literature (Antràs 2004; Chirinko 2008; Chirinko and Mallick 2014); the second one implies that globalization enhances the substitutability between production factors, and provides empirical support to literature in this area (see among others, Rodrik 1997; Slaughter 2001; Saam 2008; Hijzen and Swaim 2010). The third result implies that technological change boosts factors’ complementarity, and is compatible with both the skill-biased technological change and the capital-skill complementarity hypotheses. Although our results are not so robust for the non-OECD economies, they still yield some useful outcomes. The main one is that the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor becomes larger along with the level of technology. We hypothesize that this enhanced substitutability takes place at early stages of the development process, when standard technologies help mechanizing outdated labor-intensive tasks. With respect to globalization, however, results are more complex and difficult to interpret, even though we find evidence of a non-significant impact of the capital-output ratio on the labor share irrespective of the degree of globalization (which implies a unit \(\sigma\)). These inconclusive results could be due to the inherent heterogeneity within this area, as well as to their lower quality data. However, the fact that \(\sigma\) is larger in developing than in developed countries reinforces the capital-skill complementarity hypothesis given the larger share of skill workers in the later (Krusell et al. 2000). To check for robustness and explore to what extent heterogeneities are relevant in driving the results for the non-OECD countries, we further study the impact of globalization by considering alternative country classifications by income level (low, middle, and high) and the world region they belong to (Europe and Central Asia, East Asia and Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean, and Sub Saharan Africa). For the high income group, and for Europe and Central Asia, the findings closely resemble those for the OECD countries. They thus seem to confirm what appears a solid piece of evidence regarding the positive relationship between globalization and \(\sigma\). For the middle income group, and the other three world regions, the absence of a significant pattern seems also a robust finding. It is only the low income level group which detaches from the rest by showing a similar globalization effect on \(\sigma\) to the one found for the developed countries. Given the small number of countries within this group, however, this result should be considered with caution and open to further research. Our findings are related to the functional distribution of income and economic growth. From the economic growth literature we have learned that the more flexible a production function is (i.e. the higher the value of \(\sigma\)), the larger the potential growth that can be achieved. However, the value of \(\sigma\) does also affect the functional income distribution. Given that this effect depends on the pattern followed by the capital-output ratio, a higher value of \(\sigma\) has an ambiguous impact on functional inequality. Consequently, the intertwined linkage among globalization, technology and the elasticity of substitution should be taken into account in any policy makers’ objective function. In any case, this analysis should be considered as a first step in trying to understand how globalization and technological change affect \(\sigma\). Unfortunately, a clear identification of the transmission channels remains an important issue for future research. The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 places our paper in the literature, while Sect. 3 deals with some crucial theoretical issues. Section 4 presents the econometric methodology and Sect. 5 the data. Section 6 shows the results. Section 7 concludes.",9
154,4,Review of World Economics,18 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-018-0318-4,Antidumping as a signaling device under the WTO’s ADA non-disclosure clause,November 2018,Arastou Khatibi,Wouter Vergote,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The WTO Antidumping Agreement (ADA)Footnote 1 stipulates the non-disclosure of confidential information by the antidumping (AD) authority. Article 6.5 of the ADA states that:  Any information which is by nature confidential (for example, because its disclosure would be of significant competitive advantage to a competitor or because its disclosure would have a significantly adverse effect upon a person supplying the information or upon a person from whom that person acquired the information), or which is provided on a confidential basis by parties to an investigation shall, upon good cause shown, be treated as such by the authorities. Such information shall not be disclosed without specific permission of the party submitting it. The justification for confidentiality in AD investigations is that they require sensitive business information to be submitted to the importing country’s AD authority, especially regarding pricing and costing. Of course, exporting firms under investigation will show great reluctance to provide such information if it will fall in the hands of their competitors. On the other hand, correct information is crucial to conduct an AD investigation properly and fairly. Article 6.5 attempts to strike a balance between these two opposing forces.Footnote 2
 Over the past two decades the non-disclosure clause received hefty criticism, especially when AD authorities have substantial discretion to decide which information is confidential. Horlick and Vermulst (2005) point out that one of the major problems with the WTO provisions is that it deprives interested parties from a meaningful way to defend their interests, because too much information is in practice treated as confidential. These concerns seem to be particularly acute in the way the European Union applies the non-disclosure clause.Footnote 3 Horlick and Vermulst (2005) propose a shift to the system of disclosure of confidential information under Administrative Protective Order (APO) as practiced in the United States and Canada. As described by King (2009), under the APO the lawyers of the parties can have access to confidential disclosure. However, the APO obligations include non-disclosure of confidential information by lawyers to the interested parties and the destruction of such information within a specified time period. If the confidentiality is misused, then the APO provides sanctions depending on the seriousness of the violation. This paper draws attention to the fact that when the AD authority is bound not to disclose business sensitive information (e.g. cost information) regarding the exporting firm, it may nonetheless be tempted to signal this information indirectly to the domestic import competing industry by letting the AD duty depend on the non-disclosed information. We develop a simple model to analyze the incentives of the AD authority to use antidumping policy as a signaling device to reveal sensitive information, in this case marginal cost information, of the foreign exporter to its domestic import competing industry. Our model allows us to address the following questions: will an AD authority that cares about domestic welfare reveal the non-disclosed information about the foreign, and if so, how? Would domestic welfare be higher in the absence of the non-disclosure clause? Would global welfare be higher in the absence of the non-disclosure clause? How will signaling through AD tariffs affect the foreign firm’s decision to invest in cost reducing R&D? We show that different AD duties are set under a non-disclosure regime compared to the full disclosure case. This is done by showing the existence of a unique separating (signaling) equilibrium (Proposition 1) as set out by Mailath (1987). In this equilibrium the antidumping duty is biased downward as the AD authority is tempted to have the home firm believe that the foreign firm is relatively inefficient. It is insightful to provide the intuition behind this result. Note first that the government is constrained in its choice of instruments to obtain sensitive business information and that it can only signal this information with an AD tariff under the WTO ADA. Given this, the best the government can do is to signal the efficiency level of the foreign competitor to the home firm through the AD tariff.Footnote 4 Now note that, as in the case of full information, the government prefers to let the AD tariff depend negatively on the marginal cost of the foreign firm. Since quantities in our model are strategies substitutes, the home government, for profit shifting reasons, would like to signal to its home firm that the foreign firm is relatively inefficient. However, the home firm does not observe the marginal cost of the foreign firm and will only correctly infer this marginal cost if the AD tariff schedule used by the government is incentive compatible. The AD tariff schedule under non-disclosure will only be incentive compatible if the government incurs a cost when signaling through the AD tariff. This cost is incurred by charging a lower tariff than would be optimal under the full disclosure scenario, thereby accepting lower tariff revenue and less profit shifting. We show that signaling leads to a domestic welfare loss: eliminating the non-disclosure clause from the ADA increases total surplus in the Home country, as the AD authority no longer needs to distort its AD duty to signal information to the Home firm. However, we observe that the non-disclosure clause leads to lower prices and hence higher global welfare (domestic welfare plus the foreign firm’s surplus) in the market. We thus provide an economic rationale for the existence of the non-disclosure clause as an institutional feature of the WTO ADA (Proposition 2). We then extend our model to study how the signaling behavior of the AD authority affects (dynamic) investment decisions of foreign exporters. In sectors in which technology changes rapidly, firms tend to have incomplete information about the level of technology used by their rivals. Niels (2000) states that R&D intensive sectors are often subject to AD duties, and hence AD policy is expected to impact R&D investment decisions of exporting firms. In the mod el, the foreign firm engages in process-improving R&D before it is subject to an AD duty under the non-disclosure clause, as described above. We show (Proposition 3) that when the cost of investing in R&D is relatively low (high) the foreign firm will invest less (more) in R&D under the non-disclosure clause than in the full disclosure scenario. In an attempt to keep the model simple and to focus purely on the signaling potential of AD duties, we assume that the AD authorities impose duties solely based on the knowledge that the foreign firm has invested in cost reducing R&D. In other words, duties are imposed based on a threat of material injury. While this assumption keeps our results tractable, we emphasize that it is also in line with WTO ADA Article VI.Footnote 5 Its Article 1 reads: The contracting parties recognize that dumping, by which products of one country are introduced into the commerce of another country at less than the normal value of the product, is to be condemned if it causes or threatens material injuryFootnote 6 to an established industry in the territory of a contracting party or materially retards the establishment of a domestic industry. Interestingly, activating AD measures based on a threat of injury in not just a theoretical and legal possibility. In its 2016 Notice of initiation (European Commission 2016a, b) of an AD proceeding concerning imports of certain hot-rolled at products of iron, non-alloy and other alloy steel originating in the People’s Republic of China (2016/C 58/08), the European Commission took action precisely based on the threat of injury.Footnote 7
 To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to consider the idea that antidumping policy could be used as a signaling device to reveal information about the cost structure of a foreign firm. That being said, our methodology relies on and our results are related to several strands of the strategic trade literature. Using a tariff or subsidy under incomplete information as a signaling device has already been studied in the context of strategic trade policy by Collie and Hviid (1993, 1994, 1999), Collie et al. (1999). The first part of our paper is in particular close to Collie and Hviid (1999) in which the domestic government can use a tariff to signal the costs of the domestic firm to the foreign firm. They arrive at the counterintuitive result that the government sets a lower tariff than is optimal under complete information.Footnote 8 In our model the information asymmetry is reversed, but interestingly, we arrive at the more intuitive result that the government wants to signalFootnote 9 that the foreign firm is relatively inefficient, implying a lower injury margin and hence calling for a lower AD tariff.Footnote 10 In addition, our paper goes beyond Collie and Hviid (1999) by endogenizing the efficiency level of the foreign firm through R&D investment. 
Kolev and Prusa (2002) and Collie and Vandenbussche (2006) have used the notion of the AD authority imposing an AD duty to maximize social welfare, but none have considered that the home government has an informational advantage over the home firm. The analysis of a foreign firm signaling its level of technology has been covered by Miyagiwa and Ohno (2007), in which they provide a rationale for dumping. They explore how an innovative foreign firm may need to export larger than normal quantities to signal its cost after adopting a new technology. Indeed, since the home firm does not have complete information about the level of R&D, the foreign firm may export larger than normal volumes to signal its efficiency. They also examine the effects of an AD policy, which reduces the cost of signaling but does not prevent dumping from occurring. This paper is different in two important ways. First, it examines another channel through which the cost of the foreign firm is signaled to the home firm. Second, AD policy and the incentive for the foreign firm to invest in R&D are endogenized, which is not the case in Miyagiwa and Ohno (2007). There is an extensive literature that studies the effect of AD policy on the incentive to engage in process improving R&D. Miyagiwa and Ohno (1995) have analyzed the link between permanent and temporary protection and the speed at which the protected firm adopts the new technology. Gao and Miyagiwa (2005) develop a model based on that of Anderson et al. (1995) and find that when a single government uses AD policy, then the protected firm decreases investment while the constrained firm invests more. When both governments engage in AD actions, then both firms invest more in R&D. Miyagiwa et al. (2016) extend the previous model to take into consideration country heterogeneity in intellectual property right (IPR) enforcements. They provide a more general result and demonstrate that AD policy used by countries with a strong IPR enforcement would be detrimental to R&D, however when a strong country uses AD against a country that violates IPRs, then it can spur R&D for its protected firm. Unfortunately, the present model only takes into consideration R&D by a foreign firm and in this respect does not conclude anything about the incentive of the home firm to invest in R&D. The scenario in our model joins the spirit of Miyagiwa and Ohno (1995) in which the foreign firm is a leader in investing in R&D. This paper provides a new explanation as to why a foreign firm, endowed with low (high) R&D investment costs, may end up investing less (more) in R&D relative to the full disclosure case. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical framework. Section 3 studies the AD game under non-disclosure and under full information and compares the equilibria of these two regimes. Section 4 analyzes the R&D investment decision of the foreign firm in both regimes. Section 5 concludes.",

154,4,Review of World Economics,12 May 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-018-0321-9,Measuring the usage of preferential tariffs in the world,November 2018,Kazunobu Hayakawa,Fukunari Kimura,Nuttawut Laksanapanyakul,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The most-favored-nation (MFN) principle, as a backbone of policy discipline for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), has been strictly implemented, particularly for import tariffs. The privilege of enjoying MFN status has provided a strong incentive for developing countries to participate in GATT/WTO. Tariff reductions under WTO, however, have not been well advanced in the Doha Development Agenda. As a result, most countries around the world have started to aggressively exploit the “exceptions” to the MFN principle. There are three major forms of exceptions to the MFN principle on tariffs. The first is regional trade agreements (RTAs), including free trade areas and customs unions. GATT Article XXIV allows RTAs as exceptions to the MFN principle under loosely specified conditions. The number of RTAs has increased explosively since the 1990s. The second exception is the generalized system/scheme of preferences (GSP). Under the initiative of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), GSP started in 1970 as an exception to the MFN principle so that developed countries can grant preferential status to developing countries’ exports. The third exception includes various special trade arrangements for export processing zones, offshoring operations, and duty-drawback systems. For both academics and policymakers, it is important to quantify the extent of such preference utilization. A traditional trade economist supporting the MFN principle may want to know the extent to which actual trade deviates from the MFN principle. Policymakers may, once the GSP or RTAs are prepared, certainly want to quantify the extent to which the preference scheme is actually utilized. The adoption of preferential tariffs under RTAs and GSP is not automatic; preferential tariffs are applied only when imported products clear the rules of origin. As a result, some exporting countries may still trade under general tariff schemes, such as MFN rates, if they consider it difficult or costly to prove their products’ origins. We have tried to measure preference utilization in various ways. A typical measure is the share of trade that uses preferential tariffs out of total trade.Footnote 1 Several studies have reported such shares for various preference schemes (Bureau et al. 2007; Francois et al. 2006; Manchin 2006; Hakobyan 2015). A crucial shortcoming of the preference utilization ratio lies in the difficulty in obtaining the necessary data. Its computation requires data on trade values classified by tariff schemes such as RTA, GSP, and MFN. Almost all countries other than the US, Japan, and those in the EU do not publicly disclose such data. Such data are often available only for limited purposes such as pure academic research. As a result, differences in preference utilization across countries remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to propose another measure of preference utilization. Our measure is an aggregate measure specific to importing countries and does not allow us to investigate the utilization of specific preference schemes by trading partners. However, it is a good proxy for the value of offered preferences by each importing country to the rest of the world. Our measure of preference utilization is (one minus) the share of “actual government revenues from import duties” in “the hypothetical total government revenues from import duties,” the latter of which are the import-weighted average of MFN rates multiplied by total imports. Namely, it measures the share of exempted duties out of the total tariff revenues that would have been obtained if all imports had been under MFN rates. We call this measure the “tariff exemption ratio.” Our measure approximates the value of preferences provided by importing countries to the rest of the world.Footnote 2
 The most important advantage of our measure is that, unlike the case of the above-mentioned measure, it can be computed by employing only publicly available data. To compute the tariff exemption ratio, we only need the data on import-weighted average of MFN tariff rates, total imports, and total government revenues from import duties.Footnote 3 These are publicly available in international databases, i.e., World Development Indicators (WDI) and the OECD iLibrary. Thus, this measure can be calculated for many countries in the world for both cross-country and time-series comparisons. Furthermore, combining the information on the share of imports of products with zero MFN rates out of total imports, we can make quasi-decomposition of total imports in each country into three types; imports of products with zero MFN rates, those of dutiable products (products with positive MFN rates) under preference schemes, and those of dutiable products under non-preference schemes. This decomposition will be useful for learning the composition of various types of imports in terms of tariff schemes. The rest of this study is organized as follows: the next section provides the specific definition of our tariff exemption ratio. Section 3 employs data on imports classified by tariff schemes in Thailand and examines the performance of this measure by comparing our measure with the preference utilization ratio. In Sect. 4, we compute the tariff exemption ratio for a large number of countries (94 countries) to provide an overview of differences in preference utilization across countries. Section 5 concludes.",2
154,4,Review of World Economics,05 July 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-018-0323-7,"Imported inputs, technology spillovers and productivity: firm-level evidence from Uruguay",November 2018,Dayna Zaclicever,Andrea Pellandra,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In the mid-1980s, the development of the theory of endogenous growth represented a fundamental change in growth theory. Originated with the work of Romer (1986, 1990), this theory endogenized technological change, positing the existence of increasing returns to the accumulation of knowledge at the aggregate level (due to positive spillover effects that raise the level of knowledge upon which new innovations can be based). This implies that policies affecting knowledge accumulation can have a permanent impact on the rate of economic growth (Schiff et al. 2002).Footnote 1
 Although own research and development (R&D) efforts in developing countries (especially China and other Asian emerging economies) have intensified in the last decades, most of the world’s creation of new technology is still accounted for by just a few developed countries. Thus, technical change at the worldwide level is determined in large part by the degree of international technology diffusion. In particular, international trade is considered one of the major vehicles for technology transfer across countries. Explaining the role played by international trade in shaping the large productivity differences existing among countries remains to date one of the key issues in international economics. Endogenous-growth models show that imports can be a channel for long-run economic growth. As initially suggested by Ethier (1979, 1982), importing may enhance firms’ productivity through increased variety of intermediate inputs. Imperfect substitution across goods results in complementarity between foreign and domestic intermediates, which generates positive productivity externalities, as in the love-of-variety setting by Krugman (1979). In addition, imports may make available to domestic firms higher-quality inputs, which would allow them to increase the efficiency of the production processes (see, e.g., Eaton and Kortum 1999). These variety and quality effects are especially relevant for developing countries, where the range/quality of domestically produced inputs can be limited. Another mechanism by which imports may enhance firms’ productivity operates through the diffusion of goods with high knowledge and technology content. Access to imported inputs may raise firms’ productivity, as the more advanced technology embodied in those inputs can allow firms to improve their production methods. In addition, dynamic productivity gains can result from learning spillovers between foreign and domestic inputs, which lower the cost of innovation and enable firms to expand their domestic product scope through the introduction of new varieties. Until quite recently, most studies on the link between international trade and productivity focused on the macro and sectoral levels, treating all firms within a sector as homogeneous.Footnote 2 These studies showed that trade is an important mechanism through which knowledge and technological progress are transmitted from one country to another, leading to productivity gains (e.g., Coe and Helpman 1995; Coe et al. 1997; Verspagen 1997; Keller 2002; Schiff et al. 2002; Lumenga-Neso et al. 2005; Acharya and Keller 2009). However, the assumption of firm homogeneity is at odds with empirical evidence. As first illustrated by Bernard and Jensen (1995), firms show substantial variation in productivity, capital intensity and skill intensity, even within narrowly defined industries. Since then, many trade economists have shifted their attention towards the trading and investment behaviour of individual firms, as part of the so-called new–new trade theory, and a new heterogeneous-firms literature has emerged. Although the relationship between exports and productivity received initially the bulk of the attention,Footnote 3 more recently this literature has also begun to analyse the impact of firms’ importing activity.Footnote 4
 The literature that empirically evaluates at the micro-level the different dimensions that may play a role on the productivity effects from importing intermediates is, nevertheless, still quite scarce. Many of the studies that use micro data simply assume that the impact of foreign intermediate inputs is due to the more advanced technology they contain. However, there is a great degree of variation in the technology embodied in foreign inputs, according to the character of the good, and importing intermediates not necessarily translates into technology transfer. Likewise, foreign inputs are not synonymous with high-quality inputs. Many firms (arguably, the most productive) may be able to better select inputs, or import inputs simply because they are cheaper and not because they are more technologically advanced, or of a higher quality (relative to domestic inputs). This paper aims at contributing to address the above issue by exploring the channels through which imported intermediate inputs may act as a vehicle for enhancing firms’ productivity.Footnote 5 Making use of a detailed firm-level database covering the period 1999–2008, we evaluate the differentiated impacts of increased access to input varieties and technology transfer in the case of Uruguayan manufacturing firms. We also investigate the role played by the geographic origin of foreign inputs, which might translate into differences in quality and incorporated technology. Among the studies that explore the transmission channels between foreign intermediates and firms’ productivity, Lööf and Anderson (2010) incorporate in the analysis the geographic dimension of imported goods. They study Swedish firms over the period 1997–2004, finding that imports from the major world economies (the G7 countries), which are assumed to be on average more R&D and knowledge-intensive and of better quality than imports from other countries, have a stronger impact on productivity. Similarly, for Italian firms, Castellani et al. (2010) find that imports from advanced economies are associated with larger productivity gains than imports from developing countries, a result that is assumed to be related to the higher quality and technology content of the formers. Halpern et al. (2015) decompose the import effect on firms’ productivity into differences in quality and imperfect substitution between foreign and domestic products. For a panel of Hungarian firms covering the period 1992–2003, they find evidence of significant productivity gains from imports, mainly attributable to the complementary between inputs, which amplifies the quality effect. Studies on the dynamic gains from imported intermediates are less frequent in the literature. Goldberg et al. (2010) find that, by providing access to new foreign inputs, the trade liberalisation implemented in India in the early 1990s enabled the creation of new varieties in the domestic market (which would have resulted in productivity growth). Bas and Strauss-Kahn (2014) use French data for the period 1996–2005 to study the impact of imported inputs on firms’ productivity and export scope. Their results show a positive effect of the number of varieties of foreign intermediates on productivity, and thereby exports, through a greater complementarity of inputs and a technology/quality improvement.Footnote 6 They also find that, conditional on productivity, an increase in the number of imported input varieties increases the scope of exported products (through both a technology/quality effect and a price effect).Footnote 7 Damijan et al. (2014) analyse the impact of churning (reallocation) in imported varieties of capital and intermediate goods on Slovenian manufacturing firms’ productivity and export scope over the period 1994–2008. Their results show that the effect of churning, particularly gross churning (i.e., both adding and dropping imported input varieties) is considerably larger than that of reduction in tariffs and import prices. Building on the previous empirical literature, this paper evaluates the channels through which foreign intermediate inputs may have impacted Uruguayan manufacturing firms’ productivity along the period 1999–2008. Uruguay provides an interesting case to analyse the effect of imported intermediates in a small developing economy. In the early 1990s, this Latin American country deepened the trade liberalisation process initiated two decades earlier, combining a gradual unilateral tariff reduction with the regional integration in the framework of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).Footnote 8 The average (unweighted) tariff rate went from nearly 30% in 1990 to around 10% in 1997. As a result, the degree of trade openness increased significantly in this period, with a major contribution of imports.Footnote 9 For a country like Uruguay, where R&D expenditure is low, even compared to the average of low and middle-income countries, international trade can be a primary channel for technology acquisition.Footnote 10
 Unlike Goldberg et al. (2010) and Damijan et al. (2014), we do not focus the analysis on the impact of trade liberalisation on firms’ performance, since tariffs did not experience significant declines during the studied period.Footnote 11 Notwithstanding this, we control for changes in input tariffs, as well as in import unit values, in order to separate their effect on firms’ productivity from that of import scope. Also, we depart from previous works by explicitly studying the potential mechanisms underlying the impact of inputs imported from different countries, adding the geographical dimension to the scope and technology effects. Thus, we provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the channels through which the effect of imports on firms’ productivity may operate. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the estimation strategy adopted in this study. Section 3 presents the data and some descriptive statistics. Section 4 discusses the results. Section 5 concludes.",7

(1999: 170) that “in the trade literature, the role of infrastructure remains largely unexplored” may be justified no longer. It is widely agreed by now that more and better infrastructure reduces trade-related transaction costs and promotes international trade relations (e.g., Limão and Venables 2001; Vijil and Wagner 2012; Francois and Manchin 2013). However, it is not clear through which channels better infrastructure affects bilateral trade. Moreover, the measurement of infrastructure has typically remained deficient. Our analysis overcomes both of these limitations. This paper aims at shedding light into the ‘darkness’ of international and intra-national trade costs. We model explicitly the channels through which infrastructure affects trade flows and volumes by using a structural gravity model. In particular, we decompose trade flows and look at the impact of infrastructure on bilateral trade costs, market access and supplier capacity. In addition to total trade, we perform separate estimations for three major categories of trade (consumption goods, capital goods, and intermediates).Footnote 1 In order to capture different effects of specific aspects of infrastructure, we make use of the composite indices recently developed by Donaubauer et al. (2016) to allow for a systematic and comprehensive measurement of overall infrastructure and infrastructure in four crucial sub-categories (transportation, communication, energy, and finance). We assess the impact of infrastructure on bilateral trade for a panel of 150 developed countries and emerging economies during the period 1992–2011.Footnote 2
 The results of our fixed effects Pseudo Poisson Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimations underscore that a country’s endowment of overall infrastructure is positively associated with more intensive bilateral trade relations. When we decompose the effects of infrastructure on trade flows and trade costs we find that countries with improved infrastructure reduce not only bilateral trade costs but also multilateral trade costs. The decomposition of effects also indicates that the impact of infrastructure on trade is not driven by higher intra-national trade flows. Instead, better infrastructure encourages higher export flows relative to domestic trade flows. Our main results prove to be reasonably robust, also when considering distinct trade categories (consumption goods, intermediates, and capital goods) for a smaller sample of observations. Our analysis thus provides deeper insights compared to previous studies having found positive effects of infrastructure on international trade relations. The recent empirical literature focuses in particular on the export performance of developing countries.Footnote 3 According to Limão and Venables (2001: 451), the “analysis of African trade flows indicates that their relatively low level is largely due to poor infrastructure.” Likewise, Vijil and Wagner (2012), Portugal-Perez and Wilson (2012) as well as Francois and Manchin (2013) find that infrastructure is positively related to the export performance of developing countries.Footnote 4
 At the same time, our coverage of infrastructure is much broader compared to previous studies. Earlier analyses typically rely on just a few indicators of infrastructure. For instance, the index of infrastructure used by Limão and Venables (2001) and Brun et al. (2005) is based on just four indicators.Footnote 5 Francois and Manchin (2013) perform principal component analysis based on a slightly extended set of eight indicators of transport and communication infrastructure.Footnote 6 Several studies focus on adequate transport infrastructure as an important driver for economic development and growth. At the sub-national level, Donaldson (2018) shows that the expansion of the railroad network in colonial India from 1853 to 1930, connecting the individual districts with the rest of India and the world, drastically improved the country’s trading environment and welfare. Similarly, highways reduce transaction costs and increase market access as well as productivity (see e.g. Duranton et al. 2013; Donaldson and Hornbeck 2016, for the United States; Datta 2012 and Ghani et al. 2014, for India; and Volpe Martincus et al. 2017, for Peru). Allen and Arkolakis (2014) use detailed geographical information on the rail, road, and water networks of the United States to show that these locational characteristics, which determine trade costs, account for at least twenty percent of the spatial welfare distribution across the United States. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we outline the channels through which infrastructure may affect trade. Based on a gravity framework, we decompose aggregate trade flows into (i) bilateral and multilateral trade costs, (ii) international versus intra-national trade as well as (iii) major trade categories and specify our empirical approach. Section 3 describes the data. The empirical results of the impact of infrastructure on trade and trade costs are discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",30

For this reason it has received increasing attention in discussions about economic adjustment in the euro area in the face of the recent crises. This paper contributes to this discussion by analysing the effects of European integration and economic fluctuations on migration flows. The paper seeks answers to the following questions. Does membership in the European Union and the euro area increase migration flows between countries? How do cyclical economic conditions affect bilateral migration? Have migration flows become more responsive to economic fluctuations since the establishment of the European Monetary Union? To answer these questions, it estimates a gravity equation of the determinants of gross bilateral migration flows on a global sample and on a restricted sample of the first twelve euro-area countries. By so doing, the paper seeks to contribute to three related strands of the literature: first, the literature on the patterns, determinants and effects of mobility in the EU; second, the literature studying labour mobility in the euro area; and third, the literature exploring the determinants of international migration flows using the gravity approach. The literature on migration in the EU has developed in parallel with European integration and the debates surrounding migration.Footnote 1 Zimmermann (1996) provides an overview of the issues related to European migration in the pre-accession era, while Kahanec and Zimmermann (2010) survey the first wave of literature related to the migratory effects of EU accession. The literature on labour mobility in the euro area has developed as part of a discussion of whether the euro area is an ‘optimal currency area’.Footnote 2 The question in this literature is whether labour mobility is an effective channel to help regions react to economic shocks in a currency area. Many papers in this literature analyse labour mobility following the time-series methodology of Blanchard and Katz (1991). This methodology is most useful when direct bilateral migration flows are not observed; net migration experienced by a given geographic unit is calculated as a residual from other labour market variables. An overview of this literature, as well as original analysis in that vein, is provided by Arpaia et al. (2016). From the perspective of the optimal currency area literature, the most important stylised fact is that mobility and the EU and the euro area remains comparatively low. In 2013, less than 5% of EU citizens lived in a different Member State than they were born, while more than 25% of the US population lived in a different state than they were born (Arpaia et al. 2016). Yet, mobility across the EU has been increasing over the past two decades. The present paper investigates, by estimating gravity models of gross migration flows, to what extent these mobility flows are responding to economic fluctuations, and whether their responsiveness has increased after monetary unification. The modern literature which applies the gravity model to study the determinants of bilateral migration flows was lagging behind applications to trade, but it has recently been spurred by improvements in the quantity and quality of available data.Footnote 3 The literature has found consistent evidence for a number of intuitive relationships: bilateral migration is positively related with the population of countries and negatively with the distance between them; furthermore, common language and past migration between pairs of countries increase migration flows. The first wave of these studies includes Lewer and Van den Berg (2008), Mayda (2010) and Pedersen et al. (2008). Studies with a focus on North America include Clark et al. (2007) and Karemera et al. (2000). A recent wave of the literature includes Ortega and Peri (2013), Bertoli and Fernández-Huertas Moraga (2013) and Beine et al. (2016). Only a few recent studies, however, have investigated the effect of business-cycle fluctuations on migration flows in a gravity framework. Beine et al. (2017) show that the business cycle has a statistically significant effect on migration flows. They also find that mutual euro area membership increases migration flows, although the effects of European integration are not in the focus of their study. Finally, Marques (2010) and Pytliková (2014) study migration from “new” to “old” EU Member States in a gravity framework, while controlling for the effects of short-term economic determinants such as the unemployment rate. This paper is distinct from previous contributions that use the gravity model in that its focus is on the euro area. It seeks to uncover whether migration flows have increased since the inception of the European Monetary Union, and whether migration flows became more responsive to economic differences across Member States of the euro area. It does so by including appropriate interaction terms between variables controlling for stages of European integration and variables controlling for short-term economic fluctuations, as well as by estimating the same empirical specification on various time periods in the euro area. Finally, it also contributes to the gravity literature by controlling for all major recent stages of European integration: the implementation of the Schengen Agreement, the European Monetary Union, EU enlargement and the lifting of labour market restrictions on “new” Member States. Controlling for all these steps at the same time may contribute to a correct estimation of their effects. The paper finds that the unemployment rate of destination countries relative to that in the origin countries has a robust, economically meaningful, and statistically significant effect on bilateral migration flows both globally and in the euro area. In most specifications, it is found that a 10% increase in this relative unemployment rate is associated with a 1.5% fall in the bilateral migration flow. The paper also finds strong evidence that mutual EU membership, and the lifting of labour market restrictions on new member states, increase migration flows. While membership of the euro area does not affect the size of migration flows by itself, the responsiveness of migration flows to changes in unemployment rates has increased after monetary unification. Estimations also suggest that migration flows in the euro area 12 have been on an increasing trend since the late 1990s; after falls in 2009, they picked up again quickly in 2010 and 2011. The evidence overall suggests that labour mobility plays an increasing role in the adjustment to asymmetric shocks in the EU and the euro area. In the remainder of the paper, Sect. 2 introduces the econometric specification, Sect. 3 describes the data, Sect. 4 the results, and Sect. 5 concludes.",4
154,4,Review of World Economics,24 May 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-018-0319-3,Is the emergence of new sovereign wealth funds a fashion phenomenon?,November 2018,Jeanne Amar,Christelle Lecourt,Valerie Kinon,Female,Female,Female,Female,"May the constitution of a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) be considered as a new phenomenon? Over the past decade, more SWFs have been created than ever before and more than the previous 50 years put together. According to the SWF Institute 26 SWFs were created before 2000, investing state-owned profits proceeding from fiscal surpluses and natural resources such as oil, gas or copper. The commodity boom of the 2000s, the rise of emerging countries and especially the current account surpluses of fast growing Asian countries boosted the creation of SWFs. Among others, China, Russia and Dubai created their own SWFs. The amount of capital accumulated by most SWFs has recently dramatically increased due to the increasing price of commodities such as oil.Footnote 1
 This phenomenon of SWFs emergence has continued to grow despite the economic downturn, the market volatility, the sovereign debt crisis and the decline of commodity and oil prices in recent years. 43 SWFs were created between 2005 and 2014 (25 since January 2008). The number of existing and potential funds exceeds one hundred, but there are currently 78 SWFs in activity, with assets amounting to 7.3 trillion dollars (SWF Institute). This development concerns not only developed countries but also all emerging countries, not just Asia and the Middle East but Latin America and Africa too. This is the case, for example, of Angola, Nigeria and Panama that established a SWF in 2012. Very recently, Israel has established a new SWF, “Israeli Citizens’ Fund” whose purpose is to safeguard the windfall revenues made from natural gas.Footnote 2 Some other countries that are planning to establish new SWFs are Bolivia, Japan, India and Thailand. There is no consensus, in either the academic or practitioner literature, on what exactly is a SWF. Most definitions suggest that “SWFs are government-owned investment funds set up for a variety of macroeconomic purposes” (IMF 2008). Confronted to this accumulation of foreign-currency reserves, policymakers can lay down a number of development objectives which they deem appropriate. Such pursued objectives are diversified, including the stabilisation of fiscal revenues, the financing of pensions, saving for future generations, the optimisation of the returns or the diversification of the economy (IMF 2008). In order to meet their policy objectives, one issue that policymakers will face is to determine whether or not they should set up a SWF. Once they have decided to set up a fund, policymakers will have to define operational objectives as well as a strategic asset allocation consistent with their policy objectives. When the size of foreign-currency reserves is considerable, policymakers can follow several broad policy objectives at the same time and/or decide to establish not one but two or more SWFs depending on the objectives assigned to each. Given the increasing number of SWF creations in recent years and their increasing importance in advanced and emerging countries, the questions of why a country decides to set up a SWF, and what type of SWFs have become of major importance. In line with the huge literature trying to answer the question of the optimal level of exchange reserves, the decision of setting up a SWF is closely linked to the excess of exchange reserves (Griffith-Jones and Ocampo 2012). It is also mostly linked to the origins of these ample reserves and to the longevity of these sources. This was clearly the case after commodity price booms during the seventies and in the last few years, after a new resource was discovered or when administration of an existing resource was being restructured. In that case, the level of foreign reserves brutally increases in a long-lasting way and the country may consider what is the adequate level of reserves. If the assets of the country are over and above the adequate level of reserves and the public debt level sustainable, policymakers can then determine what part of these revenues can be considered in excess and can be set aside. Examples of countries that have set up a SWF after a new natural resource was found are Brazil (after large oil deposits were discovered), Israel (after two big gas fields were found) or Mongolia (after mining concessions were granted). This was also the case of other SWFs like the funds of Papua New Guinea and Ghana.Footnote 3
 Another factor that should be considered in the decision of setting up a SWF is the volatility of commodity prices. A boom of commodity prices, such as that in the 1970s and in the last years for oil, tends to swell the sovereign asset holdings of commodity-exporting countries whereas the drop of oil price has the reverse effect. Countries specialized in natural resources are therefore extremely dependent on the prices of these natural resources and on their volatility. To deal with these concerns, policymakers can decide to save a share of the gains from the boom of commodity prices in a saving or a macro-stabilization fund aimed at stabilizing the fiscal impact of fluctuating commodity prices and smoothing boom or bust cycles. The recent decrease of energy prices and more particularly oil prices does not reduce at all the strategic importance of commodity-based funds, because most of them were established to increase the economic resilience of petroleum exporting countries to the depletion of their reserves and the volatility of resources prices. When a country is dependent on its natural resources, a boom of commodity prices or the discovery of a new natural resource can lead to inflationary pressures and an appreciation of the real exchange rate, which then damage the non-resource tradable sector. This phenomenon is known in the academic literature as “Dutch Disease”. Commodities-exporting countries which suffer from Dutch Disease are for example Canada, Australia and Norway (Corden and Neary 1982; Beine et al. 2014). One of the possible policies to prevent an occurence of the Dutch Disease or to mitigate its effects associated with booms in natural resources sectors could be the creation of a SWF as a reserve investment fund which may allow that the proceeds of the fiscal surplus go out of the domestic economy. The fact that many funds have continued to be set up in recent years despite the economic downturn, the market volatility, the sovereign debt crisis and the decline in commodity and oil prices shows that criteria other than economic can also explain the decision. Natural resources rents have often been related to waste and corruption and consequently to poor long run economic performance (Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian 2003). The decision of setting up a SWF for a country can therefore have a political dimension. Even if the declared objective of SWFs created by autocratic countries is to ensure that the proceeds from natural resources rents will be channeled through a transparent, accountable and professionally managed fund, these SWFs may be a mean for these countries to embezzle natural resources revenues in order to invest abroad. An important concern with SWFs created by developing countries is the unethical nature of these funds coupled with the autocratic and authoritarian nature of the countries where these funds are establishing. Setting up a SWF for these countries can be seen as a mean to expand their wealth and their financial power through long-term investment strategies involving assets in Western countries as it is the case for Gulf SWFs. Although the literature analyzing SWFs investment strategies and how SWFs impact target-firm economies has been important over the past decade,Footnote 4 there are very few studies questioning the rationale for SWF creation, probably due to data constraints but also due to a “western bias” in most of the related research (Aizenman and Glick 2009; Carpantier and Vermeulen 2018; Das et al. 2009). In order to fill this gap in the literature, this paper deals with the important financial policy issue of the decision for a country to establish a SWF. More precisely, we would like to test which countries are likely to set up a SWF. Using a large-scale database, we analyze the economic, political and institutional factors that should be considered in such a decision. In particular, we test if the emergence of a SWF can be explained by the following factors: the excess foreign exchange reserves due to natural resources rents or persistent current account surpluses; the volatility of commodity prices; the appreciation of the real exchange rate leading to “Dutch Disease” effects and the governance of the country. We test these hypotheses on a sample of 37 countries that established a SWF over the period 2000–2014 and compare them to a large panel of countries that did not set up a SWF. In order to take into account the temporal dimension as well as the individual unobserved heterogeneity between countries, a Logit panel model with random effects is estimated. In order to take into account the extreme heterogeneity between SWFs, these hypotheses are first tested for all SWFs and then by distinguishing SWFs with respect to the origin of their funding (commodity vs. non-commodity funds), their political objectives (saving/pension, macro-stabilization, reserve investment or development funds) and their size (small vs. large funds at the time of their creation). These distinctions allow to analyze why a country decides to set up a specific type of SWF. Anticipating our findings, we find that countries with excess foreign exchange reserves, which are dependent on a commodity and which suffer from an appreciation of the real exchange rate are more likely to create a fund. We also find that commodity-based funds tend to be established in low democratic countries. Finally, our results suggest that the factors driving SWFs creation are different depending on the origin of the funding (commodity or non-commodity) and the political objective(s) assigned to the fund. The remainder of the paper is presented as follows: in Sect. 2, we present the theoretical framework and empirical hypotheses. Section 3 provides some details regarding the data, Sect. 4 presents the methodology and Sect. 5 presents our empirical findings. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",10

For a monetary union to operate smoothly, it must be accompanied by banking, fiscal and political union or at least by something resembling them. The United States is regularly, and rightly, cited as a case in point. This is an observation of which at least some of the framers of the Maastricht Treaty were aware. As proponents of deeper European integration, they promoted monetary union as a way of creating an additional pressure for banking, fiscal and political union. But these values are not universally shared. Powerful voices in a variety of European countries, not least Germany, resist steps in the direction of deeper European integration that entail compromises of national fiscal, financial and political sovereignty. Thus, the challenge of euro area reform is how to provide some of the stabilizing functions of banking, fiscal and political union while at the same time respecting national sovereignty. It is not a challenge that will be easily met. The most recent round of reform discussions was set off by the 2017 French elections, Emmanuel Macron being a vigorous advocate of measures such as a common budget to deepen the monetary union. But forging an agreement among 19 eurozone members has not been easy. Macron and his German counterpart, Angela Merkel, sought to invigorate the process by convening a joint Franco-German summit in the Brandenburg castle town of Meseberg and presenting the resulting “roadmap” to their 17 eurozone partners. But the Franco-German roadmap left important details unspecified, and other euro area governments voiced reservations about following it.Footnote 1 For precisely these reasons, the Meseberg Declaration opens a revealing window onto the prospects for euro area reform. It indicates areas where there is agreement in principle between leading governments on measures to strengthen the resilience of their monetary union, but no agreement as yet on how to implement those measures. It indicates also areas where there is not even agreement in principle. It can thus be used to formulate an answer to the question of whether the euro area is ready for the next crisis.",2

As a consequence, inflation paths diverged among EU countries, which required that intra-European exchange rates be frequently re-aligned. Since these realignments were easily foreseen, they were accompanied by bruising speculative attacks. The euro was intended to put these disruptions to the Single Market to an end. Mission accomplished. Yet, during the crisis, the ECB has vacillated, which deepened and spread the crisis. One interpretation is that, for a while, the ECB failed to come to grips with the nature of the crisis. Another interpretation is that the ECB did not have adequate instruments. Yet another one is that the ECB felt constrained by political considerations. The present paper argues that while the independence of the ECB is formally guaranteed by the Maastricht Treaty, apparently mistaken analysesFootnote 1 and the perceived lack of instruments are a consequence of the fragility of its independence. This may be the most underestimated limit of the Eurozone construction. The classic threat to central bank independence comes from a lopsided relationship with the government. Fiscal dominance occurs when the central bank is compelled to deviate from its preferred course of action because of fiscal policy choices. It can be compelled because it must take orders from the government, precisely what formal independence rules out. It may also be compelled because the government’s actions create a dangerous situation that only the central bank can defuse. This was well understood by the founding fathers of the euro and fully implemented in the Maastricht Treaty. Recognizing the threat posed by runaway budget deficits, the treaty established the principle that was formalized as the Stability and Growth Pact and by the no-bailout rule. The Eurozone crisis has shown that the pact has failed to prevent burgeoning public debts and the no-bailout rule was transgressed the first time it was tested. Repeated revisions of the pact are most unlikely to deliver a robust mechanism and restoring the credibility of the no-bailout rule is most improbable now that the Eurozone has created the ESM, which is entirely dedicated to bail failing governments out.",7

This reflects that foreign firms select into high wage industries and regions, taking over local firms with higher performance and wages, or foreign ownership itself having an effect on wages through a variety of channels (Fosfuri et al. 2001; Budd et al. 2005; Arnold and Javorcik 2009). There is also an abundance of studies on foreign direct investments (FDI) and wage inequality (e.g. Taylor and Driffield 2005; Figini and Görg 1999) and extensive literature on the various drivers of the male–female wage gap (e.g. see Blau and Kahn 2000; OECD 2012; and Altonji and Blank 1999 for an overview), but still limited evidence and explanations concerning the links between FDI and the gender wage gap (Oostendorp 2009; Kodama et al. 2018, and a conceptual overview of the mechanisms of the effects in Aguayo-Tellez 2011). This paper addresses in particular this last issue. We document the robust relationship between the foreign ownership of firms and the gender wage gap based on employer-employee data from Estonia, and account for various other relevant firm and individual level covariates. Prior analysis on FDI and the gender wage gap includes an econometric investigation of aggregate country level data (Oostendorp 2009) to outline general country-level correlations, the use of a combined household survey and province level data (Braunstein and Brenner 2007), modelling the effects of liberalized FDI policies and the resulting FDI inflow in a general equilibrium model (Chaudhuri and Mukhopadhyay 2014), and also some relevant evidence on labour market outcomes for women in foreign and domestically owned firms based on firm-level (Chen et al. 2013) or more recently also employer–employee level data (Kodama et al. 2018 on Japan). The study using such data from Japan (Kodama et al. 2018) points to foreign owned firms having more female friendly work practices than local firms, therefore suggesting a significant transfer of human resource practices and corporate culture through FDI. Although they do not estimate specifically the effects on gender wage gap, their findings would also suggest a lower gender wage gap among foreign owned firms. Our contribution to the prior literature linking foreign ownership and wages is to provide evidence of a persistently larger male–female wage gap among foreign owned firms compared to domestically owned firms, even if we account for a number of employer and employee specific characteristics. This difference is also evident if we focus on the effects of acquisitions of domestic firms by multinationals and estimate its effects using a propensity score matching approach. We show that a change in ownership from domestic to foreign owned firm is associated with higher rewards for men than women in terms of wages, resulting in a larger gender wage gap in foreign owned firms. There are several channels for how foreign ownership can either increase or decrease the gender wage gap. The net effect is likely to depend on the institutional background of the host country and how it differs from the home country of the investors. Following recent contributions in labour economics (Goldin 2014), our evidence indicating a larger gender wage gap in foreign owned firms is consistent with the reasoning that differences in the gender wage gap between foreign and domestically owned firms are likely to reflect the differences in work commitment and flexibility requirements from employees (e.g. working overtime, availability for afterhours work). Differences in commitment or flexibility requirements across different occupation categories have been suggested in Goldin (2014) as one of the primary explanations of the significant remaining gender wage gap in the US and likely also in other advanced economies. Arguably, such differences in required commitment may depend a lot on the competition environment of the firm, or firm characteristics such as size, trade orientation (Boler et al. 2018; Kvande 2009), or most likely also the type of ownership. For example, Goldin (2014) points out that even within the same occupation, such as among lawyers, the importance of working long hours and other requirements of commitment to work are likely to be quite different in a small firm that may allow short and discontinuous hours at little wage penalty and large law firms, where there is likely to be a disproportionate premium for contributing longer and continuous hours and effort. A recent paper on exporting and the gender wage gap in Norway by Boler et al. (2018) shows clear evidence that is most relevant to this study—that being an exporter is associated with a higher gender wage gap and that higher commitment requirements among exporters is a plausible explanatory factor of this difference. We investigate whether similar results to Boler et al. (2018) in the context of exporters can be observed in the case of the effects of foreign ownership. Our study is based on employer-employee level data from Estonia. Estonia is a good example for investigating both the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the determinants of the gender wage gap. Estonia has historically attracted considerable foreign investment. A very large proportion of the FDI inflows are from neighbouring Sweden and Finland, countries with a strong emphasis on gender equality. At the same time, Estonia has the largest male–female wage gap among European Union countries (Anspal 2015), estimated to be close to 30% across different data-sets and periods. FDI in Estonia has been to a large extent traditionally either the efficiency or market seeking type of FDI (Varblane et al. 2010). It is of significant interest how the Swedish and Finnish multinationals, which have dominated FDI in Estonia, apply personnel practices and remunerate men and women in their local affiliates compared to firms based on Estonian capital. We clearly observe that the expectations that the FDI home country's personnel practices get transferred unchanged to the host economy do not accord with the regularities present in our data. The analysis covers the population of firms and employed individuals in Estonia and is mostly based on estimations of Mincerian wage equations and propensity score matching. The matched employer-employee panel data of firms and employees used in this paper covers the period 2006–2012.",23
155,1,Review of World Economics,18 July 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-018-0324-6,"A consumer-surplus standard in foreign acquisitions, foreign direct investment, and welfare",February 2019,Onur A. Koska,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been the driving force of the global economy since the 1980s, and mergers and acquisitions (acquisition of existing assets in host countries) have been the leading mode of FDI, especially in developed countries in the late 1990s.Footnote 1 There is now a large body of the literature analyzing (i) the gains from acquisition of existing assets and the merger paradox (e.g., Salant et al. 1983; Perry and Porter 1985; Deneckere and Davidson 1985; Farrell and Shapiro 1990; Lommerud and Sorgard 1997; Hennessy 2000); and (ii) the choice between partnership arrangements with local firms (joint ventures, mergers or acquisitions) and a wholly-owned subsidiary (greenfield investment in new assets) in foreign countries (e.g., Görg 2000; Bjorvatn 2004; Desai et al. 2004; Norbäck and Persson 2004, 2007; Müller 2007; Raff et al. 2006, 2009a, 2012; Qiu 2010; Fatica 2010; Qiu and Wang 2011).Footnote 2 Mergers and acquisitions are mostly subject to certain enforcement practices, which may confine their clearance to some performance measures, that is, only a subset of potentially profitable deals will be approved, which will change firm behavior and welfare. The literature focuses on aggregate surplus on this matter assuming that any firm acquisition would be approved by an antitrust authority so long as it did not decrease aggregate welfare. In most countries, however, antitrust authorities bring consumer welfare to the forefront. In New Zealand, for instance, mergers and acquisitions that lessen competition and adversely affect consumers are prohibited under the Commerce Act 1986.Footnote 3 Australia has a similar practice under the Competition and Consumer Act.Footnote 4 Similarly, enforcement practices in the US and the EU can be best approximated by a consumer-welfare standard (Breinlich et al. 2017). The implications of adopting a consumer-surplus standard on firm behavior and welfare have been delineated, to some extent, by the Industrial Organization (IO) literature. This literature focuses on competition policy practices, and thus on mergers and acquisitions between firms that are already competing in the same market and on the application of a consumer-welfare standard in approvals of domestic mergers or acquisitions; see, for example, Dertwinkel-Kalt and Wey (2016); Breinlich et al. (2015); Nocke and Whinston (2010); Goppelsroeder et al. (2008). A consumer welfare argument in the context of potential foreign market entry by a multinational (that is not yet in the market) is, however, overlooked especially by the trade and FDI literature. This study, thus, would like to make progress on this. The main contribution of this study to the trade and FDI literature is that in a simple Cournot oligopoly model, it incorporates the strategic use of a consumer welfare argument into foreign market entry regulations and looks into potential foreign market entry by a multinational (either by greenfield investment/trade, or via foreign acquisition of a local firm) and its welfare implications. To this end, although the scope of the main (consumer welfare) argument is consistent with one as in the IO literature, it is not employed as a competition policy practice in this study, but rather it is determined as the outcome of negotiations for foreign market entry between the host country and the multinational; that is, it is geared especially toward regulating potential foreign market entry by a multinational. In the case of domestic acquisitions, any transfer of surplus among firms still contributes to total welfare, and thus a competition policy practice that secures a level of consumer welfare that is at least as good as the initial (pre-acquisition) market structure is sufficient from the host country perspective. This is not the case in the context of potential market entry by a multinational, which implies in most cases an increase in aggregate output (relative to the initial case with no market entry) and a decrease in local profits (as some surplus is transferred from local firms to the multinational), with an ambiguous impact on local welfare (assuming the multinational does not retain its profits in the host country). In particular, borrowing the idea from the IO literature, this study shows that by strategically using a consumer-surplus standard in regulating foreign market entry, the host country will not be worse-off, but can substantially gain in terms of local welfare. The strategic use of a consumer-surplus standard (as the outcome of negotiations between the host country and the multinational) in regulating foreign market entry warrants a minimum output requirement for foreign acquisition of a local firm if the host country decides to allow for foreign market entry. Given the multinational is allowed to enter the market and required to not produce below a certain output level if its entry is via acquisition of a local firm (and given that there are two local firms, foreign acquisition of which will fulfill the minimum output requirement), in the first part of the study, under complete cost information, an investor’s firm selection for foreign acquisition and the acquisition price are endogenously determined in three different mechanisms: sequential offers, generalized Nash bargaining, and an ascending auction. In this regard, the first part of the study can be related to Norbäck and Persson (2008) and Pagnozzi and Rosato (2016). While Norbäck and Persson (2008) also focus on the choice between foreign acquisition and greenfield entry, potential implications of a foreign market entry regulation that includes a consumer welfare argument on multinational behavior and on local welfare are not studied. By the some token, in Pagnozzi and Rosato (2016), a foreign market entry regulation that includes a consumer welfare argument is not an issue, nor is the choice of a multinational between foreign acquisition and greenfield entry (or trade). Considering no private cost information and no ex-ante significant cost asymmetry between local firms, but ex-post firm heterogeneity due to an efficient firm’s greenfield entry, or due to firm-specific synergies (if entry is by foreign acquisition), the first part of the study shows that some results suggested for domestic firm acquisitions by the IO literature, where a consumer-surplus standard is employed as a competition policy practice, can be extended also to foreign acquisitions, for which a consumer welfare argument is strategically used to regulate foreign market entry, such that (i) a minimum output requirement for foreign acquisition warranted by the strategic use of a consumer-surplus standard in regulating foreign market entry implies an upper-bound threshold of ex-post marginal production costs (similar to Farrell and Shapiro 1990; ii) irrespective of the method by which the multinational acquires existing assets of a local firm, the multinational prefers acquiring the firm that decreases ex-post marginal costs more (the ex-post efficient firm); and (iii) the multinational prefers sequential offers to an ascending auction under complete information, while the local firms’ profits (and thus welfare) are greater in an auction than in negotiations. An interesting result that provides an alternative explanation to an important observation is that if there is some potential foreign takeover that will fulfill the minimum output requirement of the foreign market entry regulation, then it is in the best interest of the multinational (more profitable than greenfield entry or trade) even under complete trade liberalization. In the FDI literature, studies mostly rely on models with complete information. In cross-border investments, however, some firms are better informed than others. In the case of foreign acquisition of existing local assets, for instance, the majority of targets have been the firms that are not publicly listed (Ang and Kohers 2001; Draper and Paudyal 2006) resulting in information asymmetries that crucially affect multinationals’ investment strategies (Koska and Stähler 2014; Lópes Duarte and García-Canal 2004; García-Canal et al. 2002; Shen and Reuer 2005). To address this, the model is extended so as to take information asymmetries among firms on board. The second part of the study delineates the optimal foreign market entry choice of the multinational and scrutinizes welfare ramifications of strategically using a consumer-surplus standard in regulating foreign market entry under incomplete cost information such that firm-specific synergies (generated by foreign acquisition of a local firm’s existing assets) are private information. By extending the model to the case of information asymmetries in foreign takeovers with endogenous profit shares, the second part of the study also addresses the problem of identifying good matches with potential local targets. The second part of the study can be related, to some extent, to the literature on auctions with externalities. Koska et al. (2017), for instance, show that if the target firms are ex ante heterogeneous in their production costs that are their private information, then any auction mechanism that separates costs will lead to a commitment problem on the investor’s part. Jehiel and Moldovanu (2000) look at the sale of a cost-reducing innovation, which generates negative externalities on other firms, in a second-price, sealed-bid auction; and Goeree (2003) considers an auction setup for a cost-reducing patent, and finds an upward bias on the equilibrium bidding strategies, especially when bidders signal their private information via the winning bid. Ding et al. (2013), in a signaling model, compare different takeover auction mechanisms (e.g., first-price vs. second-price, cash vs. profit-sharing auction) that are followed by Cournot competition. Janssen and Karamychev (2010) consider after-market Cournot competition and look into auctioning of multiple licenses. They show that the auction mechanism does not always choose the most cost-efficient firms. The main focus in these studies is, however, exclusively on the optimal sale mechanism. That is, they do not look at the implications of a foreign market entry regulation that incorporates a consumer welfare argument on the conflict between the host country and the investor in terms of the preferred market entry mode. The second part of the study further contributes to the trade and FDI literature by not only incorporating the consumer welfare argument into the host country’s foreign market entry regulation, but also by scrutinizing the multinational’s optimal foreign market entry mode and its welfare implications under incomplete cost information. The results suggest that, unlike the conventional wisdom, private information by local firms regarding the “quality of the match” (modeled as the size of the ex-post marginal production cost of a potential foreign takeover) need not bias the multinational’s choice toward greenfield investment, or trade, especially when there is a minimum output requirement in the case of acquisition of existing assets of a local firm. On the contrary, by auctioning off its participation to local firms, the multinational can identify the most profitable (ex-post efficient) local target firm and can gain from acquisition of that firm’s assets, insofar as acquisition of the local firm’s assets fulfills the minimum output requirement. Similar to the result from the first part of the study, also under incomplete information, the multinational prefers acquiring a local firm’s assets over greenfield entry or trade even in the times of complete trade liberalization. The welfare implications of such foreign takeovers depend on the spread of the distribution of ex-post productivity: local welfare improves (i) if the local firms have ex-ante sufficiently high marginal costs; (ii) if the expected contribution of acquisition of existing assets to the productivity of the multinational is sufficiently large; or (iii) if the expected negative impact of a foreign takeover on the other local rival is sufficiently small. If, however, the local firms have only a small productivity disadvantage relative to the multinational, foreign market entry can have detrimental effects on local welfare. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 first introduces the model with complete information and the minimum output requirement (based on consumer welfare) for foreign acquisition as the outcome of negotiations for foreign market entry between the host country and the multinational, then solves the model (i) for a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in pure strategies for the case of sequential offers (Sect. 2.1), which is extended also to generalized Nash bargaining (“Appendix 1”); and (ii) for a pure-strategy equilibrium for the case of an ascending auction (Sect. 2.2). Section 3 extends the model to a private cost information structure and introduces a second-price, sealed-bid auction by which the investor’s share from acquisition profits is determined. In what follows, Sect. 4 scrutinizes the welfare implications of the strategic use of a consumer-surplus standard in regulating foreign market entry, and briefly discusses the policy implications of the model. Section 5 provides some extensions and discussions of the main argument for the case of complete trade liberalization and for potential buyer competition for foreign acquisition when the host country strategically uses a consumer welfare argument in regulating foreign market entry. Section 6 concludes. For convenience, most of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the “Appendix”.",2

Distance between the country of origin and the country of destination does not (fully) capture this effect. Skype, e-mail and the good old phone are to a large part close substitutes for face-to-face interaction in day-to-day business, and, therefore, even a large North-South distance like the 9111 km between Germany and South-Africa (where time difference is 1 h) might not cause a large problem. “In contrast, differences in time zones can matter even given today’s easy and low-cost communications, for the obvious reason that people at night usually prefer to sleep.” (Stein and Daude 2007, p. 97). This is labelled the synchronization effect, because offices in different locations with no (or only partly) overlapping work hours require some employees to come in early or stay late to communicate (Bista and Tomasik 2015, p. 1336). This tends to increase costs of exporting to destination countries in different time zones because employees required to be in office outside of the usual working hours may require additional compensation (Bista and Tomasik 2017, p. 1053). Ten years ago Stein and Daude (2007) presented the first systematic evidence of the impact of time zone differences on the cost of doing business. While the authors focus on the (negative and significant) effect of differences in time zones on the location of foreign direct investment, they use bilateral trade data to estimate a standard gravity model of trade that is augmented by a time zone difference variable, too. The coefficient for the time zone difference turns out to be negative and significant. Time zones matter for trade—time zone difference tends to reduce trade, ceteris paribus. Since the pioneering study by Stein and Daude (2007) a large number of other studies report similar results. Egger and Larch (2013) use bilateral trade data between US states and Canadian provinces and find that time zone differences reduce bilateral trade. Anderson (2014), too, reports that time differences have a negative impact on merchandise trade. Bista and Tomasik (2015) show that a larger distance within a time zone between a country pair leads to a reduction in real exports. Bista and Tomasik (2017) find that differences in time zone effect new trading relationships (the extensive margin of trade) but not trade in existing relationships (the intensive margin).Footnote 1 All these studies use aggregate data for trade flows between countries or regions. Trade costs related to the negative time-zone difference effect, however, can be expected to vary to a large amount between heterogeneous firms engaged in trade. Firms may differ with regard to experience of doing business with various destination countries in different time zones, and some firms with extensive exports to countries in time zones that differ much may have set up a tailor-made solution to communicate with customers there already. Furthermore, costs related to time-zone differences also vary widely across products lines. While standardized products that are easily screened for quality and that do not need any kind of after-sale service can be shipped to customers in a time zone with no (or only a few) overlapping office hours without problems, products that need intensive consulting and support in service in implementation, maintenance and repair in case of disruption are much more demanding with regard to frequent interaction in real time between suppliers of a good in one country and customers in another country. And the need for communication when trading intermediate goods within global value chains may be stronger than the need for communication when exporting final goods. Therefore, trade costs related to time difference can be expected to vary not only between a country of origin and different destination countries, but also between the different products traded between two countries and between firms engaged in these transactions. Estimates of the time-difference sensitivity of exports, therefore, should control for these firm-specific and product-specific effects by including firm-product fixed effects. Identification of the regression coefficient of the time-zone difference variable then comes from the within-firm-product variation of export values across countries. To the best of my knowledge, however, there is no study that reports estimates of the time-difference sensitivity of exports that uses transaction-level data at the firm-product-destination level and that controls for firm-product fixed effects.Footnote 2 This paper contributes to the literature by reporting such estimates for Germany, one of the most important actors on the world market for goods. To anticipate the most important results, when distance to destination countries is controlled for, time zones only decrease exports for smaller exporters and for intermediate goods. The quantity of exports declines with increasing time difference within a firm for a given product for exports to the West (where time difference to Germany is negative) but not the East. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the data and measurement issues. Sections 3 and 4 present the results of the empirical investigation. Section 5 reports results from several robustness checks. Section 6 concludes.",

155,2,Review of World Economics,25 February 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-019-00343-4,Contingent trade policy and economic efficiency,May 2019,Phillip McCalman,Frank Stähler,Gerald Willmann,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Contingent protection occupies an interesting niche within the trade policy literature; if certain pre-specified criteria are met, as substantiated through a quasi-judicial process, then a country feels entitled to impose a trade barrier. Classifying policies from this procedural perspective implies that contingent protection covers a range of policies such as anti-dumping (AD), countervailing duties (CVD) and safeguards/escape clause actions. While the motivation and application of these policies varies, the pre-determined criteria for their use lends an air of legitimacy to their implementation.Footnote 1 However, despite the apparent legitimacy afforded by an inquisitional methodology, these policies tend to be criticized for the malleable nature of the criteria employed and their resulting excessive use. In short, while there may exist some criteria which justify a policy intervention at a global level (i.e., some market failure), the inefficiencies from having policy implementation at a national level tends to offset any potential benefits.Footnote 2 However, it is not immediately obvious that tolerating a market failure is the better option. Hence the objective of this paper is to distinguish the circumstances under which policy action may potentially be effective from those when it will not. To explore the issues associated with this question we construct a simple framework that includes the potential for market failure and therefore scope for a policy response. The setting we choose resembles a dumping style model. Our point of departure is to move the rationale for policy intervention away from the usual motivation of predation toward a broader and more relevant concept of allocative efficiency.Footnote 3 Therefore we focus on the question of who should be producing what and whether trade policy, in the form of duties, has a role to play in improving efficiency. If a policy-maker has complete information about the relevant costs, then determining the optimal allocation of resources is straightforward and the only real concern is one of policy failure. This is the element—policy failure—that the previous literature has focused on and sought to stress. If the policy-maker is incompletely informed about the cost structure, then both the mechanics of competition become more involved and the criteria for determining government intervention become less transparent. In this setting it is possible to have a market failure that cannot be adequately addressed by government intervention. It is this environment of asymmetric information in which we couch our analysis.Footnote 4 To help fix ideas consider the steel industry, a frequent user of contingent protection.Footnote 5 Many dimensions on the cost side for steel producers display location specific idiosyncrasies: material prices, energy prices and other local bottle-necks or benefits. The demand side is also relatively lumpy. For example, the laying of a new gas and fuel pipeline in West Texas generates a fixed volume of demand for steel that is also period specific. The homogeneous nature of products (reinforced steel bar, pipes, etc) and lumpy demand tend to make for a relatively competitive setting. Moreover, many of the requests for contingent protection in the steel industry revisit the same product from the same source country, but at a different point in time.Footnote 6 This suggests that the relevant shocks tend to be transitory in nature. To capture these features we develop a duopoly model of international competition where neither firm is reliably informed of the other’s cost structure.Footnote 7 To sharpen the implications of competition, we assume that firms produce a homogeneous product and compete in prices; generating a winner-take-all scenario. Under complete information this set-up achieves allocative efficiency. Allocative efficiency is also achieved under the assumption of symmetry when firms are incompletely informed (that is, both firms are assumed to take cost draws from the same probability distribution).Footnote 8 The virtue of this set-up is that under either complete information or asymmetric information with symmetric cost distributions there is no market failure and therefore no need for government intervention. This provides us with a clear and unambiguous benchmark. However, as a model of international competition it is lacking a critical feature: transport costs.Footnote 9 The introduction of transport costs implies that the firms are no longer symmetric. This small, but realistic change has potentially important implications for the allocation of resources: the higher cost firm can ultimately be the sole supplier in the market. This market failure has a clear source; since the foreign firm is at a disadvantage due to transport costs it prices more aggressively than the domestic firm. Consequently, when both firms have the same cost draws (inclusive of transport costs in case of the foreign firm), the foreign firm will quote a strictly lower price. This implies two things. First, in the neighborhood of these cost draws it is possible to identify outcomes where the higher cost foreign firm serves the domestic market; an inefficient allocation of resources. Moreover, this inefficiency can be very pronounced, representing up to 15% of ex ante surplus. Second, the foreign firm prices more aggressively abroad than in its local market, i.e., dumping occurs.Footnote 10 Given such market failure, the question we address in this paper is whether the use of contingent trade policy can remedy the inefficiency and achieve an efficient allocation of resources.Footnote 11 One important obstacle the policymaker faces is that production costs are private information. Can a government infer which firm is the lower cost producer for any given set of cost draws from the firms’ pricing behavior? And if the answer is positive, does the announcement of a rule for intervention still enable such an inference to be drawn?Footnote 12 We consider this problem from two perspectives, starting with the case of a global institution seeking to maximize global welfare. We show that a global planner who announces a policy of contingent intervention will indeed be able to infer the costs from the optimal pricing functions in this new environment. In fact, the optimal pricing functions are symmetric over the sub-region of common costs. So despite the difficulties associated with the cost draws being private information, a global planner can design a policy of contingent intervention that will result in a first best outcome. The second scenario is the case where it is up to national governments to implement contingent trade policy. This is an important case to consider since historically national governments have designed and implemented the most frequently used contingent protection schemes (e.g., AD). Once again we show that even though the pricing game is altered by the potential for policy intervention, a national government can still infer the relevant costs to satisfy its policy objective. National policymakers, however, do not have any incentive to implement the global first best outcome. Seeking to maximize national welfare, they exploit the rent shifting aspect of protection and make excessive use of contingent trade policies. The resulting equilibrium will thus again be inefficient from a global perspective, this time because of rent shifting. The presence of two inefficiencies—one stemming from market failure, the other from a purely national objective—obviously raises the question which of them is quantitatively more important. Our analysis shows that the allocative inefficiency dominates at high trade costs. For lower trade costs, on the other hand, it is the inefficiency caused by rent shifting motivated policy that is larger. At high trade costs, it might be preferable to allow national governments to conduct contingent trade policy, while for low trade costs the laissez-faire regime welfare-dominates nationally conducted policy. This paper is not the first paper on contingent trade policies, there is a large and extensive theoretical and empirical literature on anti-dumping, countervailing duties and safeguards/escape clauses (for an overview, see for example Chapter 7 in Feenstra 2004; Blonigen and Prusa 2003, 2016). We regard our paper as complementary to a newer literature whose objective is to explain the flexibility of trade agreements and the existence of contingent trade policies as a response to potential shocks.Footnote 13 Our paper characterizes the conditions under which contingent trade policies are feasible (that is, can be “successfully ”implemented), and it offers a rationale for why countries may have this discretion rather than be bound by a fixed policy. While this is a similar emphasis to the flexibility literature, the innovation of our paper is that we allow for an interplay between the policy environment and the actions of firms—that is, we allow the announcement of the policy rule to change firm behavior. So rather than having a given degree of uncertainty and choosing the optimal design of the institution under various constraints (e.g., ability of adjudicators), we examine how the institutions themselves can either enhance or undermine their own effectiveness. One paper that uses a similar framework to ours is the important early contribution by McAfee and McMillan (1989) who analyze preferences for domestic firms in public procurement auctions. While similar in motivation, they consider an unconditional policy, whereas the emphasis in this paper is on conditional policy. Note also that we take the option of contingent trade intervention as a fact of life; we do not scrutinize an optimal mechanism as an alternative. Our type of conditionality of the intervention distinguishes our paper also from the strategic trade literature under asymmetric information. This literature starts from the assumption that the government knows less about market and/or cost conditions than firms do. For example, Creane and Miyagiwa (2008) discuss the conditions under which firms have an incentive to disclose information to their local government. Qui (1994) shows that a government prefers to employ a menu of policies which leads to revelation of private cost information in case of quantity competition but a uniform policy in case of price competition. Maggi (1999) demonstrates that allowing non-linear trade policy instruments when firms know more about market conditions can accentuate inefficiencies relative to the case of complete information. Similar to these papers, our model shares the feature that the government commits itself (successfully) to an intervention. In strategic trade policy models, however, the treatment of each firm depends only on what this firm has done, and not on what the other firm has done. In our model, the announcement of a policy framework not only alters the behavior of both firms, but also potentially alters the ability of the policy to be implemented; after all an intervention takes place only if the government concludes that the “wrong” firm has won the market. Our paper draws on the methods in auction theory but also moves beyond it in an important way. While the laissez-faire case is strategically equivalent to an auction and can be solved in the usual manner by looking for an Bayesian Nash equilibrium, the case of policy intervention is more involved. In that case, we solve for a perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium, since both firms and the regulator form mutual beliefs about their behavior, and more importantly, all act upon these beliefs, which must be confirmed in equilibrium. This analysis goes beyond the usual auction setup because actions are taken based on the outcome of the market game. We will show that a perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium exists in which the regulator will learn the type of each firm and thus will be able to pursue the announced policy. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we set up the model, solve for the price functions, and show that an allocative inefficiency can arise. Section 3 presents the analysis of a contingent trade policy that maximizes global welfare. In Sect. 4, we analyze the policy a national government seeking to maximize national welfare would enact, and Sect. 5 compares it to the laissez-faire case. Section 6, finally, offers concluding remarks.",1

In this paper we provide an anatomy of the great cross-border banking retrenchment in the EU and investigate a wide range of possible drivers of this phenomenon, including indicators of banking sector performance and stability, prudential policies and bank levies. Using a granular breakdown of cross-border bank lending by instrument and counterparty sector, we are able to identify the most affected components of cross-border lending and shed light on the underlying causes. There are important financial stability benefits that may results from financial integration via cross-border banking. These include risk diversification and risk-sharing. For instance, a geographically diversified loan book and deposit base make banks less susceptible to domestic shocks and thus reduce the volatility of their lending and income streams. Further benefits may stem from enhanced competition and greater stability of banking systems, as foreign banks entering less mature markets tend to introduce more sophisticated risk management practices, accelerate the process of privatisation of state-owned banks and contribute to faster resolution of non-performing loans. However, cross-border banking may also entail financial stability costs. The presence of foreign banks, which are associated with greater mobility of capital than domestic banks, may weigh on financial stability in the host economy, owing to spillovers from external shocks (Giannetti and Laeven 2012). Indeed, the “pecking order” in the post-crisis deleveraging by European banks—shedding cross-border assets initially while sheltering domestic assets—is a case in point. Nevertheless, the view that financial integration via cross-border banking is beneficial overall, except in situations where cross-border exposures are excessive, prevails in the literature (Allen et al. 2011; Beck et al. 2016).Footnote 1 The global financial crisis triggered a rapid decline in international capital flows intermediated by banks, which prior to the crisis had been increasing dynamically (Forbes et al. 2016).Footnote 2 In Europe, the precipitous decline in cross-border exposures, especially between banks, partly reflected some excesses prior to the crisis, which may have reflected to some extent distorted incentives for banks to expand their balance sheets (Hale and Obstfeld 2016). Therefore, part of the reduction in cross-border banking positions may be seen as a welcome development. This notwithstanding, cross-border banking integration in the euro area remains desirable, given the still relatively limited cross-border penetration of the banking industry. As well as further enhancing risk-sharing, cross-border banking integration via, for example, cross-border mergers and acquisitions could also help tackle the “over-banking” problem in some EU countries (Hartmann et al. 2017). A number of studies suggest that several factors, such as banking sector vulnerabilities, regulatory tightening and government interventions lay behind this cross-border banking retrenchment. While the available literature tends to focus on the impact of a single factor, our paper investigates them jointly in a comprehensive and integrated framework. This is motivated by the fact that European banks during the post-crisis period faced tighter prudential regulation and higher taxation amid worsening asset quality (Fig. 1).

(2016), World Bank, authors’ calculations. Note: Intra-EU cross-border claims is the sum of bilateral cross border intra-EU claims. Bank levies refer to the number of EU countries that implemented them. Prudential policy index is the average index across EU countries. Non-performing loans as percentage of total gross loans (un-weighted country average) Banking sector performance and vulnerabilities have significant implications for cross-border exposures. McGuire and von Peter (2016) stress their importance as banks affected by larger credit losses at home spread credit contractions across countries. Cerutti and Claessens (2016) suggest that cross-border deleveraging during the height of the global financial crisis varied across countries and was in line with markets’ prior assessments of banks’ vulnerabilities. Temesvary and Banai (2017) find at the bank level that lower capital ratios and higher non-performing loans (NPL)—at either the subsidiary or the parent bank-level—significantly weighed on subsidiary lending growth in Central and Eastern Europe before and during the crisis. We contribute to this literature by considering the role of banking sector performance indicators at the country level in the ‘advanced’ post-crisis period, by investigating in particular cross-border spillovers from deteriorating asset quality, the presence of which was highlighted by the European Commission (2017). Our empirical analysis establishes a significant link between deteriorating asset quality and the great retrenchment in cross-border banking in the EU, highlighting the spillovers from national banking sector conditions across the EU. The literature on international spillovers from prudential policies has remained inconclusive: some studies highlight the role of regulatory arbitrage (or “leakage”), which could increase cross-border banking positions, while others stress that adhering to more stringent rules is costly for banks, which in turn cut cross-border positions. For instance, Houston et al. (2012) provide evidence of regulatory arbitrage for the period before the global financial crisis, concluding that banks exploiting differences in regulation focused more on markets with less stringent regulation. Ongena et al. (2013) show that tighter regulation at home is associated with looser lending standards in bank’s foreign operations. Similarly, Bremus and Fratzscher (2015) find that increasing independence and power for supervisory authorities at home diverts credit abroad, except in the euro area, where more stringent capital requirements reduced cross-border banking activity. Forbes et al. (2016) conclude that the interaction between prudential regulation and unconventional monetary policy explains roughly a third of the contraction in the UK’s cross-border bank lending, while Ichiue and Lambert (2016) suggest that tighter regulatory standards explain a sizeable portion of the decline in cross-border bank lending globally since the global financial crisis.Footnote 3 It has also been established in the literature that international spillovers from prudential policies can vary significantly across various instruments (Fahr and Zochowski 2015; Buch and Goldberg 2017). Buch and Goldberg (2017), using a collective analysis of studies of the International Banking Research Network, also show that international spillovers from prudential policies are heterogeneous across banks, as balance sheet conditions and business models drive both their size and direction. Avdjiev et al. (2017), using a sample of advanced and emerging economies, find that better-capitalised banking systems and those with more liquid assets and less core deposit funding react stronger to changes in macroprudential policies. Franch et al. (2018), studying the reaction of euro area banks’ local operations to changes in macroprudential policies abroad, find that tighter capital requirements in other euro area countries lead banks to reduce lending locally, while higher loan-to-value limits and reserve requirements have the opposite effect. Reinhardt and Sowerbutts (2015) observe that more stringent capital requirements for domestic banks lead to a higher demand by the non-bank sector for cross-border funding. We find evidence that prudential policies can entail spillovers via cross-border banking in the EU, albeit with heterogeneity across instruments in terms of direction, magnitude and significance. In particular, our results suggest that regulatory arbitrage might be possible via the use of foreign branches, while stricter policies at home may preclude banks from direct lending activities abroad, albeit this is not found for a sub-sample of euro area countries. The final policy measure we investigate in this paper relates to the impact of newly introduced bank levies on cross-border banking. We treat banking sector taxes separately from prudential policy measures and measure them using data on actual revenues from those taxes. This in our view better captures the additional tax burden on banks compared with using binary variables as in Cerutti et al. (2016), given different definitions of the underlying tax base for bank levies across EU countries.Footnote 4 We find that the introduction of bank levies after the financial crisis did not have an overall adverse impact on cross-border banking in the EU, but may have affected its composition by incentivising cross-border lending to the non-bank sector. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides stylised facts on the retrenchment in cross-border banking in the EU. Section 3 presents our empirical strategy and discusses the explanatory variables. Section 4 provides the main empirical results, while Sect. 5 presents several robustness checks and Sect. 6 concludes.",20
155,2,Review of World Economics,06 December 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-018-0337-1,Chinese competition: intra-industry and intra-firm adaptation,May 2019,Benjamin Gampfer,Ingo Geishecker,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The rise of China as an economic power and its integration into the world economy has spurred considerable public concern and may yet culminate in a protectionist backlash across the world.Footnote 1 In the centre of the debate is the question to what extent intensified competition from Chinese exporters is responsible for the loss of manufacturing jobs and adverse wage effects in western economies. A seminal study by Autor et al. (2013) exploits cross-regional variation in the exposure of US industries to Chinese imports on the home market and established export destinations. On average, US regions’ competition exposure to China has risen substantially resulting, as the study suggests, in an up to 20% cumulative decrease in manufacturing employment, and among other economic effects, a significant decline in labour force participation and wages. In a methodologically comparable region-level study, Dauth et al. (2014) show similar effects for Germany considering import competition from Eastern Europe and China. However, adverse effects from import competition are more than outweighed by positive employment effects from exporting. Similarly, Costa et al. (2016) in a study for Brazil, find that manufacturing imports from China significantly reduce wage growth in exposed regions, an effect that, however, is compensated by faster wage growth in regions experiencing increased commodity demand from China. The aforementioned studies rely on an identification strategy that exploits the begin-of-sample variance in regional exposure to exogenously changing industry-level competition reflecting on the idea that contemporaneous regional exposure in itself may be a function of changing competition. To the extent that the industry composition of regions evolves, for which the significant employment changes identified in, e.g., Autor et al. (2013) and Dauth et al. (2014) provide evidence, overall regional competition exposure is altered. Holding regional industry composition constant at begin of sample values as done in the aforementioned studies thus avoids an obvious simultaneity issue. However, relying on industry level aggregates has some shortcomings. As shown by Ashournia et al. (2017), there is considerable intra-industry heterogeneity in static competition exposure which is ignored when exploiting industry-level variation. Moreover, compositional changes that affect the dynamics of competition exposure, are not limited to the regional industry structure but also take place within industries and within firms. Entry, exit and sales share reallocations of firms that are subject to high or low competition will affect the overall observed change in industry-level competition exposure. The same holds with respect to intra-firm compositional changes of the product mix or the set and relative importance of market outlets. Numerous studies find that such intra-industry and intra-firm adjustments to increased competition are empirically relevant. Table 1 provides a partial overview of this empirical literature. To start, there is ample evidence that competition from China significantly reduces firm sales (e.g., Ashournia et al 2017; Autor et al 2016b; UtarTorresRuiz 2013; Utar 2014). Furthermore, Jaekel (2014) shows that import competition significantly raises firms’ exit probabilities and that the size of this effect depends on the degree of product differentiation within industries. Similarly, UtarTorresRuiz (2013) find that competition from China significantly raises the probability of plant closure and lowers the probability of plant opening, with effects being strongest in low-skill intensive industries. Accordingly, Chinese competition affects the inter- as well as intra-industry composition. Regarding intra-firm adjustments, Bernard et al. (2006), for example, show that US plants, when faced with higher import competition from low-wage countries, alter their product mix and switch to industries that are less exposed to competition from low-wage countries and are more capital- and skill-intensive. Iacovone et al. (2013), show that firms respond to increased Chinese competition on their home and key export market by focusing on their core activity, dropping products in which they are less productive—a result in line with theoretical predictions of Eckel and Neary (2010). Similarly, Mayer et al. (2014) show that firms respond to stronger competition by adjusting their product mix, concentrating on their best performing products. Also, Utar (2014) demonstrates that increased competition exposure to China in the textiles and clothing industry causes firms to change their portfolio away from exposed textile and clothing products. At the same time, Lopresti (2016) empirically shows that firms’ adjustment of their extensive product margin in response to increased competition via trade liberalisation can be very heterogeneous and depends on firms’ export orientation. Bernard et al. (2011) model firms’ extensive product and export destination margins. They theoretically and empirically demonstrate that increased competition via trade liberalisation causes firms to change the composition of their product portfolio, dropping their least-successful products which also implies a compositional change along the extensive export destination margin. Alongside compositional changes, quality upgrading appears to be a relevant margin of adjustment. Amiti and Khandelwal (2013) show how trade liberalisation and intensified import competition foster quality upgrading for products exported to the US that are close to the world quality frontier, whereas they discourage quality upgrading for products too distant from that frontier.Footnote 2 In addition, a study by Martin and Mejean (2014) finds that higher exposure to low-cost manufacturers significantly increases the average quality of French exports. Furthermore, Fernandes and Paunov (2013) show that import competition positively affects intra-product quality of Chilean firms over time.Footnote 3 To summarise, compositional changes, i.e., inter-industry reallocations, intra-industry reallocations through firm exit, entry and sales reallocations as well as intra-firm adjustments of the product and export destination mix can be important channels through which exposure to international competition is altered. In addition, product quality adjustments may shield firms from increased low-cost competition and open new market opportunities. Accordingly, competition exposure should be understood as being endogenous. Drawing on unique firm-commodity-destination-level sales data for the universe of Danish firms, we quantify exposure of Danish manufacturers to Chinese competition on the home market as well as all export markets in the years 2000 and 2013. This granular approach allows us to construct a counterfactual competition measure and to decompose different channels of adaptation. Importantly and departing from existing studies summarised in Table 1 our aim is not to identify any causal relationship between Chinese competition and industry or firm adjustments. The paper is, thus, not about how such structural change and reallocations come about, for all we know they could be the result of, e.g., competition, technological forces or, more unlikely, interventions by a benevolent government planner. We rather ask how inter-industry structural change and intra-industry and -firm reallocations shape aggregate competition exposure. We thereby can quantify, and this is the main contribution of our paper, how aggregate competition exposure has been de facto altered by intra-firm product and destination switching, quality differentiation, intra-industry firm exit and entry and sales share reallocations as well as inter-industry broad structural change. The paper, thus, quantifies and compares the aggregate importance of different adaptation channels highlighted in the literature. Our method adapts and extends the productivity decomposition of Olley and Pakes (1996) and Melitz and Polanec (2015) to the decomposition of competition exposure. The change in competition exposure is decomposed along the industry, firm, product and destination margin. As an extension, we also consider quality differentiation as an additional adaptation channel. The main findings of the paper, abstracting from quality differentiation for the moment, are summarised in Fig. 1. The vertical axis represents competition exposure measured by the weighted sum of Chinese product-destination-time specific import shares with Danish manufacturing sales shares as weights. Aggregated exposure to Chinese competition thus depends on the Chinese market shares as well as the importance of the respective markets for Danish manufacturing sales. Between 2000 and 2013 readily observable competition exposure of Danish manufacturing (solid line) increased by 126%. However, by holding all Danish sales shares constant at their begin of sample values, we obtain a counterfactual competition exposure change that is much higher. Without any compositional adjustments, competition exposure would have increased by counterfactual 214% (dashed line). Thus, 88% points of the overall competition exposure increase are accounted for by adaptation. Of this, 60% are attributable to inter-industry reallocations towards less exposed industries, 36% to intra-industry reallocations towards less exposed firms and 4% to intra-firm product and destination switching, as well as sales share reallocations. Accordingly, our results emphasise the aggregate importance of intra-industry reallocations and intra-firm adjustments for shaping competition exposure to China. Competition exposure change and channels of adaptation The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 describes how competition exposure is measured and how competition exposure change is decomposed. Section 3 provides details about the data used in the analysis. Section 4 discusses the results of our baseline decomposition. Section 5 extends the analysis by introducing a structural estimate of relative quality and by considering quality differentiation as an additional adaptation margin. Section 6 summarises our findings and discusses implications for future research.",3
155,2,Review of World Economics,21 January 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-019-00339-0,"Economic integration agreements, immigrants and trade costs",May 2019,Bedassa Tadesse,Roger White,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Aided by the creation of a large number of unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral economic integration agreements (EIAs)—more than 500 from 1990 to 2009 alone (Dür et al. 2014)—and their subsequent vertical and horizontal expansions, the global economy has become more integrated in both the depth and the breadth of engagement.Footnote 1 A cursory look at data from the KOF Index of Globalization (Dreher et al. 2008) sheds light on the extent of these agreements. Between 1970 and 2014, the average value of the economic globalization dimension among the 122 countries for which data are available increased by nearly 70% (from 37.46 to 63.33); in 1970, 32 economies had dimension values that were less than the lowest value (24.72) observed in 2014.Footnote 2 Further illustrating how widespread the increase in economic integration has been, during the near half-century period since 1970, 119 of the 122 countries saw their KOF economic globalization dimension value increase. Global businesses benefit immensely from the proliferation of EIAs. First, EIAs provide consistent criteria for investment and trade while also commonly reducing barriers to market entry (e.g., reduced tariffs, uniformity of standards/regulations, and fewer regulations). Second, the presence of an EIA allows companies that choose to manufacture in one country and sell in others to more easily move goods between EIA member countries. Conversely, the formation of an EIA also presents challenges to businesses. For example, a new EIA may suddenly put firms outside of a trading bloc or subject them to industry-specific “rule changes.” In addition to the opportunities and challenges the formation of an EIA may present to the functioning and efficiency of firms, the benefits that accrue to involved firms from the vertical (level of EIAs) and horizontal (the number of countries included) proliferations of EIAs may vary considerably. An empirical study of EIAs, particularly one that examines their relationships with trade costs, is relevant for several reasons. First, by rendering exports uncompetitive, high trade costs can effectively nullify the comparative advantage a country would otherwise hold. Second, high trade costs have the potential to deny firms access to technology and intermediate inputs and, as a result, to prevent firms from entering or moving up global value chains. Finally, by narrowing the range of goods and services on offer and increasing prices, high trade costs may erode consumer welfare. Thus, examining the relationships between EIAs and trade costs has the potential to yield information that is relevant for policymaking and, thus, to have ramifications for commercial and business activities. One issue central to policy making that overlaps with the influence of EIAs on commerce and business is the relationship between international migration and trade flows. A considerable literature asserts that immigrants reduce trade-related transaction costs via the business connections they have with entities in their host and/or home countries (i.e., by functioning as trade intermediaries) and through the information they possess about their home and host countries (e.g., knowledge of informal contracting requirements, linguistic and cultural similarities, etc.).Footnote 3 However, only since estimates of bilateral trade costs have become available has it become possible to examine a direct relationship between immigrants and trade costs. Tadesse and White (2015), for example, examine annual data for 174 immigrant home countries and 19 OECD member host countries during the period from 1995 through 2010. The authors find evidence supporting the hypothesis that immigrants reduce trade costs generally and, while differing in magnitudes, across sectors as well. A more recent study (Tadesse and White 2017) also finds that immigrants facilitate international economic transactions and enhance global integration by countering bilateral trade costs associated with cultural differences. To our knowledge, no other study has examined the direct influence of immigrants on trade costs. Additionally, no prior work has considered the joint effects of EIAs and international migration on bilateral trade costs. Thus, the work presented here, while within the purview of the existing studies, extends the associated literature. Our primary research question is whether the direct influence of immigrants on trade costs rises or falls with the level of economic integration between immigrants’ home and host countries. Consistent with prior studies, we empirically examine the relationship both at the aggregate level and across economic sectors (i.e., for trade in agricultural and manufactured goods separately). Given that the provisions underlying various EIAs may vary considerably, we address our core research question while controlling for the depth of integration. Addressing our primary research question also paves the way for examination of potential variation in immigrants’ influences on trade costs across their home countries. It is straightforward to assume that the influence of immigrants on trade costs increases with a rise in the level and depth of EIAs. The rationale is that by reducing policy-related barriers to trade (i.e., fixed costs of trading), higher levels of integration and/or provisions of an EIA (e.g., whether the agreement covers services liberalization, investment measures, intellectual property rights and standards, etc.) may afford immigrants greater opportunities to offset the variable costs of trading. Conversely, as higher levels of economic integration may also correspond with lower bilateral trade costs, it may limit the avenues and, hence, the extent to which immigrants facilitate trade flows. Further, heterogeneity across immigrants’ home countries supports the notion that corresponding variation in the influences of immigrants on trade flows is to be expected. Thus, variation in the relationship between immigrants and bilateral trade costs across levels of economic integration and across home countries remains a matter of empirical question.Footnote 4 Our study is important for several reasons. First, our findings allow for a more complete understanding of the potential economic benefits of immigrants to their host and home countries. Second, enhancing the understanding of the trade-migration nexus allows us to better discern the unique inter-relationships between two core components of international economic integration. Finally, as the expansive reach of economic integration has implications on broader international economic interactions (e.g., foreign direct investment and technological diffusion) and, more generally, on the political, cultural, and social aspects of globalization, our study provides information relevant for the formulation of trade and immigration policies that seek to maximize the benefits of internationalization. We examine data that span the period from 1995 through 2009. Our data set includes annual information on bilateral trade costs and the level and depth of EIAs between 35 OECD member countries and 137 trading partners.Footnote 5 Additionally, we utilize data on the stock of immigrants from each of the trading partners that reside in each of the OECD member countries as well as information on a set of appropriate control variables. When conducting our analysis, we estimate augmented gravity specifications by regressing ad valorem tariff-equivalent bilateral trade costs on annual immigrant stocks, measures of the level and depth of EIAs, and control variables often used in theoretical and empirical gravity models of trade. We obtain our results from a series of multi-level mixed effects models (random intercepts and random coefficient) estimated following the Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal (2008) framework. Consistent with the related literature, our findings indicate that immigrants significantly reduce bilateral trade costs between their home and host countries. While accounting for heterogeneity due to the regional clustering of home countries and consequent variation in bilateral trade flow structures, our models permit estimation of the average effects of immigrants for the entire sample as well as home country-specific effects. These results confirm that the effects of immigrants on trade costs vary across host countries. Further examination of the effects of immigrants on the bilateral trade costs faced at various levels of economic integration (i.e., no EIA, one-way preferential PTA, two-way preferential PTA, Free Trade Agreement (FTA), Customs Union, Common Market, and Economic Union) and across economic sectors (i.e., the manufactured and agriculture goods sectors) produces consistent results. We find that EIA levels are not equally important in reducing trade costs. For example, although relatively higher at the peak EIA level (i.e., Economic Union), the extent to which immigrants reduce bilateral trade costs does not linearly rise or fall with the EIA level. A series of robustness checks conducted using both standard panel data and Heckman sample selection methods support our findings. In the next section, we discuss the related literature. In Sect. 3, we present our empirical model, our data and variable construction, and our estimation strategy. A detailed account of our econometric results and findings follows in Sect. 4. We conclude in Sect. 5 with an emphasis on the implications for public policy.",2

Timmer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Countries may specialize in particular stages of production, relying on imports of intermediate goods and services to produce for exports. This process is known as vertical specialisation in trade as proposed by Hummels et al. (2001). Using input–output tables to measure the import content of exports, they found that vertical specialisation increased over the period 1970–1990 in thirteen out of the fourteen countries studied. Yi (2003) showed how the increased interdependence of countries can have major implications for trade policy, for example through cascading effects of import tariffs and other types of trade protection. Relatedly, Johnson and Noguera (2012, 2017) introduced a new metric that measures the value added of a country that is absorbed abroad (expressed as a ratio of gross exports). Based on a panel data set of 42 OECD countries and major emerging markets, Johnson and Noguera (2017) documented a decline in this ratio for almost all countries over the period 1970–2008, interpreted as a widespread process of production fragmentation in the world economy. At the global level, the ratio was falling roughly three times as fast during 1990–2008 compared to 1970–1990. This paper contributes to the literature on vertical specialisation in two ways: methodologically and empirically. Johnson and Noguera (2017) studied developments in a set of mainly rich and middle-income countries. In this paper we provide new evidence on trends in vertical specialisation in trade for a large set of 91 countries at various stages of development, including many low-income countries, for the period 1970–2013. We also extend the sectoral detail in the data (19 detailed industries, up from 4 broad sectors as in Johnson and Noguera 2017). This puts higher requirements on the data, but improves the measurement and opens the avenue for studying vertical specialisation in the production of particular manufacturing product groups. We track vertical specialisation in trade through the share of domestic value added in gross exports, which we refer to as the VAX-D ratio.Footnote 1 We focus on the exports of manufactured goods which includes value added in the exporting sector, as well as value added from other domestic sectors that contribute through backward linkages. These can be other manufacturing industries, but also non-manufacturing industries delivering primary materials or business and support services. We follow Bai and Perron (1998, 2003) and estimate structural breaks in the time series of VAX-D ratios to identify periods of vertical specialisation and vertical integration. Thus we are able to provide an overview of long-run trends in vertical specialisation in trade for a wide set of countries and explore possible correlates, in particular GDP per capita. Our methodological contribution is in elucidating the difference between an indicator that tracks vertical specialisation, as defined by Hummels et al. (2001), and an indicator that tracks value added absorbed abroad as defined by Johnson and Noguera (2012, 2017). The latter has been developed as an alternative measure of exports that fits international trade models that are written in value added terms rather than gross flows (Johnson 2014). Its measurement is built upon tracing forward linkages rather than backward linkages which are central in the concept of vertical specialisation and picked up in VAX-D. The difference between VAX-D and VAX-C measures is not only conceptually, but also empirically relevant. They are quantitatively comparable at the level of aggregate exports, but not at the sectoral level. This is further discussed in Sect. 2 and also highlighted in our results. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the calculation of our main indicator, the VAX-D ratio. We also present our approach to the estimation of structural breaks and the identification of periods of vertical specialisation. In Sect. 3, we discuss the construction of our dataset. A novelty in our empirical strategy is in using untapped data of value added and gross output in manufacturing in developing countries at a high sectoral disaggregation and annual frequency (UNIDO 2016). This is combined with detailed trade data from Feenstra et al. (2005) and benchmark input–output tables. We present our main findings in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",15

Measured as Official Development Assistance (ODA), OECD countries contributed $142.6 billion in 2016,Footnote 1 a doubling in real terms since 2000. The UK has scaled-up its ODA considerably, providing more than $18 billion in 2016, and is currently the world’s third largest donor after the US and Germany. The UK is one of only a handful of countries to have reached the long-standing United Nations’ target of net ODA equal to 0.7% of a country’s Gross National Income (OECD 2017). In 2015 a law was passed that committed the UK government to maintaining this level of assistance. The rise in UK ODA has increased the politicisation of foreign aid in the UK. The media and surveys of public attitudes have focused on whether the government is providing an appropriate amount of ODA, with some UK newspapers citing examples of aid being ‘wasted’ and arguing that ‘charity should begin at home’. Far less attention has been paid to how UK aid is allocated across developing countries—which is surprising given that people’s feeling about the level of aid could be very different to their preferences with respect to which countries are supported and the amount of aid received.Footnote 2 Anecdotally, it is clear that governments consider multiple objectives when allocating aid across developing countries. Though donor agencies’ objective statements emphasise the humanitarian role of aid in reducing global poverty, it is not the case that the countries most in need receive the most aid. For example, in 2015 Tuvalu, an upper-middle-income country in the Pacific, received more than $4500 per person from the international community, whereas Niger, one of the world’s poorest countries, received less than $44 per person; on a per capita basis, Syria receives nearly 12 times more aid than Sudan (World Bank 2018). With respect to aid from the UK government, Lebanon, an upper-middle-income country in the Middle East, received almost $26 per capita, whereas Togo, one of the least developed African countries, receives less than one cent per capita (World Bank 2018). As well as humanitarian objectives, national interests and political and strategic goals also play a role in government aid allocations. Security concerns partly explain the high levels of aid currently going to countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria. Such motives are sometimes stated in donor agencies’ objective statements. For example, the mission of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), is “to end extreme poverty and promote resilient, democratic societies while advancing our security and prosperity” (USAID 2017). The UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) states that it “leads the UK’s work to end extreme poverty… Our work is building a safer, healthier, more prosperous world for people in developing countries and in the UK too.” (DFID 2017). Following an influential study that found aid is more effective in countries with sound macroeconomic policies (Burnside and Dollar 2000), international donors have increasingly sought to allocate aid to countries capable of putting it to good use. The macroeconomic policy environment is one of many factors that donors need to consider in getting the most ‘bang for their buck’, as further discussed below. This paper develops a model for the allocation of UK government aid that prescribes how aid ought to be allocated, in contrast to most earlier studies that explain how aid has been allocated.Footnote 3 Such prescriptive allocations (how aid ought to be allocated) depend on the relative importance, or ‘weight’, attached to the motives ascribed to aid allocation. Earlier studies have struggled with determining valid and reliable weights. In this paper, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) involving more than 1600 members of the UK general population is used to ascertain their weights for the three broad motives introduced above (and discussed in greater detail in the next section): recipient need, donor interests and the ability to use aid effectively. The prescriptive facet of the paper is supported with reference to the ‘median voter theorem’, which implies that foreign aid programmes should reflect the preferences of voters (e.g. Mayer and Raimondos-Møller 2003). This is the case even if other factors, such as group lobbying, influence foreign aid programmes and if the political institutions created by modern democracies provide a degree of autonomy in policy formulation (Kapstein 2005). As aid levels increase, the greater is the median voter’s interest in foreign aid spending and the more important it is that aid programmes reflect the preferences of the public, who rightfully demand greater accountability for their taxes. Applying the three broad motives and their weights from the DCE, the model determines how much aid each country should receive from the UK government, given its budget constraint. These allocations are compared with how much aid each country actually receives. Finally, a cluster analysis is performed to identify any ‘clusters’ of DCE participants with similar patterns of weights, including investigating the extent to which such clusters are related to participants’ socio-demographic and background characteristics. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 develops the model of UK government aid allocation, which is strongly informed by the academic literature. Section 3 discusses the data and the DCE used to elicit the weights of the UK general population and the results. Section 4 presents the country allocations of UK government foreign aid based on the model and DCE results and compares it to current actual allocations. Section 5 presents the results of the cluster analysis. Section 6 discusses the paper’s conclusions and their implications.",5

The United States, the major emitter of greenhouse gas at the time of negotiating, motivated its refusal to participate with leakage concerns (Hagel 1997). Models of international trade (Copeland and Taylor 2005) and computable general equilibrium models (Babiker 2005) were used to study the issue and predicted widely varying leakage rates. Predicted leakage was shown to be very sensitive to the choice of parameters (Burniaux and Oliveira Martins 2012). Studies by Aichele and Felbermayr (2012, 2015) presented the first econometric evidence for carbon leakage via international trade. Their second paper examines leakage on a sectoral level. The authors argue that Kyoto ratification caused an increase of sectoral imports from non-member countries and a decrease of exports to non-members of 7.8%. Their estimation strategy derives from the building blocks of structural gravity models. Trade flows of embodied \({\hbox{CO}}_{2}\) are explained by a variable that captures the between-country difference in Kyoto ratification status. Regressions are conducted on pooled data of sectoral trade flows (40 countries, 12 sectors). The aim of the present study is to estimate the partial equilibrium carbon leakage caused by the Kyoto Protocol while controlling for multilateral trade resistance.Footnote 3 More specifically, we are asking how Kyoto affected the global carbon trade balance of ratifiers versus non-ratifiers, i.e. the difference between exports and imports of embodied carbon dioxide. The concept of the carbon trade balance is also known in the literature as ‘\({\hbox{CO}}_{2}\) trade balance’ or ‘balance of embodied emissions in trade’ (Munksgaard and Pedersen 2001; Muradian et al. 2002) and was used to study emission transfers via international trade between Kyoto ratifiers and non-ratifiers (Peters et al. 2011). Examining carbon leakage using the concept of the carbon trade balance is a direct consequence of the ’strict’ definition of carbon leakage we employ [see the discussion in Peters and Hertwich (2008)]. Essentially the decision to ratify commitments under the Kyoto Protocol is a unilateral environmental policy even if the negotiating process was multilateral. The decision to ratify engages a country relative to its trading partners. At the same time, the decision to not ratify also amounts to a change of relative domestic environmental policy. The ratifying country will increase relative production costs and therefore substitute foreign for domestic products, while the non-ratifying country will decrease relative production costs and substitute domestic for foreign products. Thus we need to look at both exports and imports of Kyoto ratifiers (and non-ratifiers) to determine the amount of carbon leakage caused by the Protocol. Carbon Trade Balance of Kyoto ratifiers with non-ratifiers. Notes The carbon trade balance consists of exports minus imports of embodied \(\hbox{CO}_{2}\). This graph is from the viewpoint of Kyoto ratifiers in the sample, where trading partners are all non-ratifiers in the sample Looking at Fig. 1, we observe a noticeable kink in the development of the carbon trade balance between Kyoto ratifiers and non-ratifiers around the year 2002. Most member countries ratified their commitments in national parliaments that year. Committed countries increased their net imports of embodied carbon dioxide from around 100 to around 600 megatons. Several explanations for this development are possible, among them leakage effects, China joining the WTO,Footnote 4 an increasing number of regional trade agreements between members and non-members of Kyoto and so on. We follow the methodology of Aichele and Felbermayr (2015) of effectively treating the Protocol as influencing domestic production costs which will result in changes to domestic mill prices and consequently to multilateral trade resistance. Under the leakage hypothesis, the Kyoto Protocol leads to an increase in the effective price of carbon dioxide. This in turn will lead to a partial substitution of goods and services from non-ratifiers for those from ratifiers. In order to meaningfully relate estimated leakage to the carbon trade balance we need to take into account sectoral differentiation of the effects and apply the estimated elasticities to sectoral emission trade flows. This is especially important if trade flows are very unequally distributed across sectors as is the case with services. While several studies have presented evidence on traded emissions including services sectors (Fernández-Amador et al. 2016, is one example), the use of the World Input–Output Database (WIOD) in combination with multi-regional input–output analysis allows us to present the first econometric evidence for leakage effects from the Kyoto Protocol through services trade. Carbon leakage from services turns out to be quite substantial in percentage terms, although less so in absolute terms. Besides the estimation of Kyoto’s impact on the carbon trade balance, including the first estimates of services’ role in that, this study makes four further contributions. First, we estimate the treatment effect from Kyoto ratification via a two-stage procedure suggested by Head and Mayer (2014) in order to control for multilateral trade resistance while estimating the carbon trade impact of a unilateral policy. Second, we suggest an alternative specification of the Kyoto treatment variable that allows us to estimate asymmetric effects on Kyoto ratifers’ imports and exports. Third, we allow for time-varying effects of ratification. Fourth, we take into account the special role of Eastern Europe, a previously neglected issue. These countries are shown to significantly influence the results, however, we will raise some doubts about the estimates in their case. The average annual estimated effect of the Kyoto Protocol on the carbon trade balance amounts to 88 megatons of \({\hbox{CO}}_{2}\), summing up to a total of 705 megatons in the period 2002–2009. Kyoto ratification is associated with an increase of 4.4% of total emissions embodied in imports, and 4.2% of total emissions embodied in exports from ratifiers to non-ratifiers. Depending on the years, between 11 and 54% of the negative carbon trade balance of Kyoto countries can thus be explained. We can quantify major sources of carbon leakage in transport sectors such as water or inland transport. The effect of services remains somewhat limited due to the low level of trade in these sectors. Energy-intensive manufacturing sectors such as metals, machinery and transport equipment exhibit the highest levels of leakage and are responsible for 76% of the total estimated effect on the carbon trade balance.",7

155,4,Review of World Economics,31 July 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-019-00356-z,Firm export diversification and change in workforce composition,November 2019,Sarah Guillou,Tania Treibich,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The recent availibity of employer–employee linked datasets has allowed to study the empirical relation between a change in a firm’s international status and the distribution of skills in its domestic workforce (Grossman 2013). When a firm starts exporting or expanding its export portfolio, it may hire professional workers to establish new dedicated teams (Bernard and Jensen 1997; Biscourp and Kramarz 2007) or decentralize decision processes to better address the new production, marketing and distribution problems (Marin and Verdier 2014). It has indeed been shown that exporting can be related to a shift in a firm’s employment structure toward higher skills (Serti et al. 2010; Iodice and Tomasi 2015). It follows that such an expansion in size and such a change in the overall nature of skills should require an increase in the complexity of the firm’s management structure, as theoretically shown by Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012). However, to our knowledge, the relation between export behaviour and the management structure of the firm has not yet been empirically studied. In the international economics literature, several theoretical mechanisms explaining why the employees of exporters present higher skills have been introduced. The first hypothesis is that exporters benefit from increasing returns to skills, hence they have a greater incentive to adopt more advanced technologies of production (Yeaple 2005; Helpman et al. 2010; Amiti and Davis 2012) or to produce higher quality products (Verhoogen 2008). Closer to our framework, Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012) shows that exporters are required to change their internal labor organization to raise their productivity and sustain the trade cost. In their model, firms that start exporting increase the number of layers of management. Most explanations so far consider the fixed cost of exporting to be external to the firm. Indeed, the literature discusses the country-specific nature of sunk costs, such as the cost of complying with foreign regulations, establishing distribution networks (Moxnes 2010), or achieving high quality standards (Kugler and Verhoogen 2012) and the cost associated with specific cultural and linguistic barriers (Egger and Lassmann 2015). Instead, the objective of this paper is to show that part of the fixed cost of a firm’s trade expansion (through either export entry or export diversification) is the acquisition of new internal capabilities (e.g., technology, production processes or skills), which imply a (costly) change in the firm’s internal labor organization. The empirical relation between trade and the skill structure of firms has been studied in different contexts (Bernard and Jensen 1997; Biscourp and Kramarz 2007; Serti et al. 2010; Iodice and Tomasi 2015). Their results indicate that because exporters demand more high-skilled workers, this induces a rise in their labor costs, explaining the wage premium.Footnote 1 Although these studies also investigate the labor characteristics of exporters with respect to non-exporters, their aim is to explain the overall differences in wages, skills and productivity. Thus, they do not consider the way in which these different types of workers are organized within the firm, which instead requires detailed information on firms’ distribution of occupations and skills, which was recently made available in matched employer–employee datasets, as we use here. In the literature on multi-product firms, a firm’s range of products is determined by both demand and supply elements. Bernard et al. (2010) consider stochastic shocks to firm productivity and to consumer taste, Eckel and Neary (2010) distinguish between the competition and market-size effects, and Mayer et al. (2014) study the effects of competition and the distance of the products from the core competences of the firm. Caselli et al. (2014) follow Eckel and Neary (2010) and Mayer et al. (2014) by considering the distance to the plant’s core expertise which defines its productivity level. The important mechanism put forward in this discussion is that a product’s distance to the core competences of the firm is assumed to drive its cost. Indeed, for a given knowledge level, the firm reduces its productivity when enlarging its product scope. We will extend the analysis of export diversification by multi-product firms by considering export varieties instead of products. As in Broda and Weinstein (2006), we define a variety as a product–destination pair. Adding a new product to the export portfolio is either a product innovation; or a product adaptation to the demand; or a product addition to capture new customers. In all cases, adding a new product is a response to demand characteristics, in other words, it is also a response to destination characteristics. A change in the product portfolio therefore has a strong relation with the targeted destination. On the other side, adding a destination requires the adjustment of the product previously sold by the firm.Footnote 2 Note that such adjustment in specifications (or customization through packaging, design, secondary characteristics) may not often lead to a change in the classification of the product. Using export varieties therefore serves the purpose of accounting for the intertwined nature of product- and destination-types of diversification.Footnote 3 Building on the above insights, why would export diversification, i.e., an increase in the number of products and/or destinations, impact a firm’s labor organization? The first part of the answer relates to the concept of complexity of products and destinations. By adding products and/or destinations, the firm is more likely to encounter production, distribution or marketing “problems” that need to be addressed at a higher management level. Reaching a new destination also means facing new administrative rules, prospecting new distribution networks, and fitting new customers’ habits. All these issues call for additional competences. In parallel, when a firm adds new products, it also augments the need for adapting both skills and production processes. This is even more true because trade diversification is associated with investing in R&D to face tougher foreign competition, as shown by Baum et al. (2016). Thus, similar to Mayer et al. (2014), we associate changes in costs to modifications of the product (here, varieties) portfolio, but we assume that the changes depend on the complexity of the modifications, which is a more general assessment than the distance to the core competences of the firm. Second, trade diversification also has a scale dimension: it is costly because the firm has to manage a higher number—a larger scope—of different products and destinations, increasing the diversity of problems that must be addressed. Therefore, both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of trade diversification increase management complexity and should impact the internal labor organization of the firm. However, building on the insights from Mayer et al. (2014), the impact of trade diversification on the necessity to implement organizational changes within the firm may depend on how much more complex the new problems caused by trade diversification are with respect to the “business-as-usual” activities in the firm. As we show in our model, a trade-off between the motivation to add varieties to gain from economies of scope and the rise in costs due to the organizational changes required to manage such increased complexity of operations may emerge. Therefore, an empirical investigation is required to test the relation between the use of managers and the export diversification behavior of firms. Our empirical study is based on three French administrative datasets, and it focuses on the relationship between a firm’s organization and export activity, exploiting employee-level data to reconstruct the management structure of individual firms.Footnote 4 The records of exporters’ individual transactions are used to measure the scope of a firm’s export portfolio. Finally, balance sheet data allow us to control for other firm-level characteristics. We use a range of methods to test the empirical impact of export entry, and export diversification on the probability to add a layer of management through OLS and probit regressions. In a second step, we control for reverse causality by using an instrumental variable approach. Our findings generally point to the fact that firms that are expanding their export portfolio have a higher probability of adding managerial layers. First, we identify the impact of trade entry on the labor organization of a firm, as measured by the likelihood of adding a layer of managerial occupations. We show that export entry has a different impact on the labor organization than does a mere change in size (here, value added growth). Our results support a positive relationship between a firm’s trade diversification and the likelihood that it changes its labor organization. We find that firms expanding their export portfolio have a higher probability of adding managerial layers, after controlling for firm growth, and we confirm these results with an instrumental variable approach. Our work contributes to the literature in two important ways. First, we show that, on average, a higher share of exporters in general, and among them, those with a greater number of export product–destination varieties have a management layer, and that this result still holds after controlling for firm size (total sales). We argue that the increasing complexity that comes with greater trade diversification may constitute an important component of the sunk and fixed costs of exporting. This is especially true if large upfront investments are required to restructure a firm’s organization and if the cost of maintaining management layers is inelastic to variations in output volume. Second, we show that trade matters for a firm’s hierarchical structure, not only because it expands its market size (Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg 2012; Caliendo et al. 2017) but also because it increases the complexity of a firm’s operations. To illustrate this intuition more formally, we present a simple model in which the complexity of a firm’s operations depends on the number of product–destination flows generated, and firms can choose to add managers to address this complexity more efficiently. In the model, because the number of managers is less sensitive to the quantity produced than the number of blue-collar workers, it acts as a fixed cost. Third, our work contributes to the growing literature on the importance of managers for firm performance by proposing a reason why managers are important for firm’s exporting performance. Since managers’ skills are needed for export diversification, larger and more globalized firms would hire more managers with higher skills. Our results support those by Bender et al. (2018), who state that it is the skills of the group of managers which matter most to translate the best management practices into higher firm performance. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents our rich dataset, which compiles several data sources. Section 3 displays the descriptive statistics, which illustrate our intuition regarding the relation between trade diversification and labor organization. Section 4 outlines a simple theoretical framework of a multiproduct firm, which supports our empirical evidence. Section 5 tests and discusses the results. Section 6 concludes.",5

Some countries are hit particularly hard by a shock, and others are not. For natural disasters this is hardly surprising, as these are often country-specific, but why macro-economic, or economy wide shocks affect countries differently is the topic of a growing body of literature.Footnote 1 The Great Recession, which started in 2008, is an example of an economy-wide shock which illustrates that not all countries respond in the same way. Figure 1 illustrates this for Asia, the USA and the Euro area. The size of this shock has not been seen since the 1930s, see Irwin (2012). We analyse the role played by international trade linkages through supply chains (or global value chains) in the decline and recovery process following the Great Recession using various measures related to value-added trade flows (forward, backward, and total linkages) and the Grubel–Lloyd index of intra-industry trade. Source: Based on monthly data from CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB); trade volume for a country or region is average of export and import index Volume of trade, selected global regions and countries; index (2005 = 100). The Grubel–Lloyd index has the advantage that it allows us to use more detailed data than value-added measures. In general, we find hardly any effect for the value-added measures of supply chains, but strong effects for the Grubel–Lloyd index: a more intense involvement in intra-industry trade flows implies that the duration of the trade recovery takes longer, such that the timing of the recovery is later. This finding also helps us to, partially, explain Europe’s recovery problem, see Salvatore (2017). The observation that countries respond differently to shocks is by now well-established, see Fingleton et al. (2012), Brakman et al. (2015b), Martin and Sunley (2015), Bailey and Turok (2016), and Martin et al. (2016). These studies, however, have an inward-looking methodology; countries are most often studied in isolation with scant attention for linkages between countries and the global economy. This is remarkable as the recent attention for supply chains hints at a relationship between the different responses of countries to shocks and international linkages. The World Trade Organization (2009, p. 2), for example, notes: “…the magnitude of recent declines relates to the increasing presence of global supply chains in total trade…—goods cross many frontiers during the production process and components in the final product are counted every time they cross a frontier. … this effect, whose magnitude can only be guessed at in the absence of systematic information….” Altomonte et al. (2012) observe that along a global supply chain shocks as well as recoveries can be magnified due to ‘inventory’ effects (the so-called bullwhip effect).Footnote 2 Brakman et al. (2015b) suggest a link between regional specialization patterns (due to comparative advantage) and resilience.Footnote 3 If specialization patterns are driven by international competition then a link between trade and resilience should be visible. At the country level, the current discussion on the impact of supply chains on the Great Recession is inconclusive, ranging from Altomonte et al. (2012) on the one hand to Wagner and Gelübcke (2014) and Behrens et al. (2013) on the other hand. In these studies, Altomonte et al. (2012) note for France that along a global supply chain shocks as well as recoveries can be magnified due to a bullwhip effect, Wagner and Gelübcke (2014) conclude for Germany that the hypothesis that foreign multinationals are more volatile following a negative shock is not supported by their empirical research, while Behrens et al. (2013) conclude that value chains play a minor role in Belgium, and in line with this observation Bems et al. (2011) find a dampening effect of supply chains on the trade collapse of 2009. For this paper it is, however, not the inconclusiveness of the debate that is interesting: it is whether the heterogeneity of country experiences can be linked to participation in global supply chain linkages. Our main conclusion is straightforward; a strong involvement in global supply chains as measured by the Grubel–Lloyd index slows down the recovery of countries to recessions. Our findings are consistent with Altomonte et al. (2012) who point out that with longer supply chains a bullwhip effect is likely and that the impact of (export) credit restraints after the crisis might have restricted trade along supply chains. Section 2 describe the data and provides some highlights on the Great Recession and the timing of various stages of the ‘trade-cycle’. Section 3 explains our methodology. Section 4 discusses some advantages and disadvantages of measures of supply chains. Section 5 links these measures to the Great Recession, while Sect. 6 provides a survival analysis.

155,4,Review of World Economics,03 April 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-019-00346-1,Competing liberalizations: tariffs and trade in the twenty-first century,November 2019,Jean-Christophe Bureau,Houssein Guimbard,Sébastien Jean,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"While recent years have produced more threats than promises for the multilateral trading system, it would be wrong to interpret this background as a progressive slowdown in trade policy reform. On the contrary, since the beginning of the century, a number of countries have significantly liberalized access to their market, either as a result of their own policy initiatives or of their commitments upon World Trade Organization (WTO) accession, China and India being cases in point. Meanwhile, the number of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAsFootnote 1) has quadrupled in 20 years. From 2012 onward, negotiations between very large economic entities—the so-called mega-deals—were a significant innovation in the trade landscape, even though the radical change in U.S. trade policy’s orientation in 2017 has put a big question mark upon the prospects in that respect, at least for the two most important of them. The varied nature of these crisscrossing policy changes makes it difficult to understand how they redefined the trade policy landscape. Indeed, even the scope and depth of PTAs strongly differ from one another, as we document below. Moreover, the expected consequences are controversial.Footnote 2 Against this background, this paper aims to address several questions: What do all these policy changes add up to? What are the respective contributions of multilateral agreements, preferential agreements, and unilateral initiatives to the aggregate trends, and do they vary meaningfully across products and countries? In doing so, we devote particular attention to tracing changes down to policies, and to take into account the various dimensions of tariff duties, distinguishing commitments from applied levels, and multilateral from bilateral policies. To provide a consistent overview encompassing the different policies at stake, we focus on tariff protection. Clearly, tariffs are not the only impediment to market access, and non-tariff measures are increasingly important. The growing emphasis on rules in trade agreements, already evident in the Marrakesh Agreement, is a consequence of this trend. However, the trade restrictiveness impact of non-tariff measures (NTMs) is not directly observable, and its assessment raises considerable methodological and data issues. Several sophisticated analyses have been carried out to assess their trade impact.Footnote 3 While these approaches provides useful insights, none of them can yet be considered an indisputable basis for providing a robust, comparable and reliable assessment of the trade restrictiveness of NTMs worldwide, let alone of how they evolved over time or of how regional agreements influenced them. While restrictive, the focus on tariff protection allows us to rely upon an indisputable and consistent basis in measuring and comparing trade policy changes. The fact that tariffs remain one of the main bones of contention in important negotiations such as the one of the Doha Round also illustrates their enduring relevance. Our focus is also restricted to tariffs applied on a permanent, as opposed to temporary, status. Contingent protection, well described in recent works (e.g., Bown 2011) should also be taken into account to get the full picture of trade policy changes, and they have taken particular importance with the multiplication of exceptional measures under the Trump administration. While it is increasingly well documented,Footnote 4 available data did not make it possible to cover the period and countries considered here in an exhaustive and consistent way. To carry out this broad assessment of the trade policy landscape through tariff protection, we put together an unparalleled database of product-level, consistent information about tariff protection worldwide, from 2001 up to the hypothetical situation where agreements under negotiation at the end of 2013 would be signed and fully enforced. Country by country, partner by partner, the same method is used to compute bilateral ad valorem equivalent tariffs encompassing all protection components, across the different years considered. The different dimensions of tariff protection are taken into account, making it possible to disentangle commitments under the multilateral system, concessions in the context of reciprocal and non-reciprocal trade preferences, and countries’ own trade policy choices. In addition to trade policies observed up to 2013, we also take into account ongoing negotiations and their possible outcome, if they were concluded. We also evaluate the tariff-cutting impact of a hypothetical multilateral agreement, based on a product-by-product application of the latest circulated modalities. This uniquely detailed historical dataset makes it possible to provide a comprehensive picture of multilateralism, regionalism and unilateralismFootnote 5 over a relatively long period. In a work concomitant to the present one, Caliendo et al. (2016) also undertake building a very large database making it possible to assess protection consistently at the world level and over time. They assess the impact of tariff liberalization over the period 1990–2010, thus showing the significant gains reaped from tariff reductions negotiated in the Uruguay Round, and analyzing the corresponding theoretical channels, based on a heterogenous-firm model. By contrast, the focus of the present paper lies in analyzing in a detailed and consistent way the relationship between policies and tariff protection. For this reason, we do not rely upon a single measure of tariff duties, but rather develop in parallel measures corresponding to the level of binding commitments (bounds), of duties applied on a multilateral basis (MFN applied) and of duties applied on a preferential basis (preferential applied). In doing so, the period we study (2001–2013) is less extended than in Caliendo et al. (2016). Still, our dataset presents several contributions in addition to theirs: our coverage of preferential agreements is exhaustive and does not include any re-construction of applied tariffs (the data are based on countries declarations to the ITC and as needed on agreement texts themselves); we compute AVE of non-ad valorem tariffs which, even though they are far less frequent, are on average far higher than ad valorem duties; we work at the HS6 level, making it possible to produce a more detailed picture and to distinguish by categories of products; and we use an aggregation method taking into account products’ importance while minimizing the so-called endogeneity bias. In addition to this, we extend our dataset to cover the hypothetical situation where agreements still being phased-in would be fully implemented, and another one where in addition the mega-deals would be concluded and implemented.Footnote 6 To trace changes in tariff duties down to policies, we propose a simple methodology allowing the main categories of policies to be distinguished: multilateral commitments, reciprocal (bilateral or regional) agreements and countries own (or unilateral) initiatives. Doing so is important from a policy point of view, because the three processes are fundamentally different in their institutional counterparts and in their political economy determinants and consequences. It matters for instance in assessing the contribution the WTO may have made to declining tariff protection, or in evaluating the importance of regionalization as an engine of world trade. To our knowledge, the only existing paper decomposing the contributions of these policies to trade liberalization is Martin and Ng (2004), who by lack of data had to focus on a limited number of developing countries and to rely upon strong assumptions. Their conclusion at the time, dealing with changes between 1983 and 2003, are consistent with ours, since they find own-initiative (or, in their word, autonomous) liberalization to play a significant role, accounting for 66% of total liberalization, with multilateral agreements contributing to 35%, and regional agreements only to 10%. This leads us to question to what extent the motivation for own-initiative liberalization might be linked to the willingness to join global value chains (GVCs). Indeed, the motivation for these own-initiative liberalizations might be linked to institutional and technological factors that made possible the development of GVCs (Baldwin 2011, 2016). This would be consistent with Blanchard’s et al. (2016) conclusion that GVC participation lowers the level of optimal tariffs; indeed, Olarreaga et al. (2018) show that tariffs tend to be set non-cooperatively (i.e., following an optimal tariff logic) as soon as the tariff water (binding overhand) is not trivial, which is the case for 75% of WTO members’ tariffs. As a good deal of adjustment had already taken place at the beginning of the period under study here, 2001, we use an index of GVC participation at that date to measure the extent to which underlying factors were influential at the sector-country level. As an alternative, we assess whether liberalization was stronger on intermediate and capital goods than on final consumption goods. In both cases, we find that tariff cuts, in particular those taken on own initiative, were deeper for products more prone to GVC participation, suggesting that favoring such participation has been a powerful motivation underlying government liberalization initiatives. Reflecting on the consequences of these policy changes reminds of the heated debates held in the 1990s about whether regional agreements would be “stepping stones” or “stumbling blocks” for multilateralism. Some, such as Bhagwati (1991) and Krugman (1991a), viewed regional agreements as potentially undermining the economic rationale for multilateral liberalization. Others, such as Bergsten (1991) and Summers (1991), considered every liberalization (every “ism”), whatever its form, to be a step forward, paving the way for worldwide trade liberalization. An extensive literature has developed, analyzing the multiple mechanisms through which regional agreements may erode opposition to further liberalization, but also undercut incentives to engage in further trade reform (see Baldwin and Freund 2011, for a survey). Despite its elaboration, this sum of works is not fully conclusive regarding the way regionalism and multilateralism interact. The 1990s literature was mainly theoretical, spelling out a number of mechanisms and results, finally showing that the influence of regionalism on multilateralism could be mixed. More recently, applied investigations have been carried out, but they reached contrasting results, in accordance with the theoretical analysis showing the variety of possible mechanisms at stake. While several studies, in particular Estevadeordal et al. (2008), find that preferential agreements may favor multilateral liberalization, Limão (2006) and Karacaovali and Limão (2008) find the opposite for the EU and the US. The latter result is presumably linked to the different nature of the trade agreements sealed by these two blocs, which likely aim inter alia at extracting non-trade benefits from their partners. Still, it remains difficult to reach a firm conclusion based on this literature, which in addition focuses on episodes differing significantly from the present predicament. In the present context, the question of the consequences of unilateralism and regionalism for multilateralism thus remains essentially an empirical one. Addressing it requires first evaluating in-force and planned policies. An additional question, reminiscent of Krugman’s (1991b) “Is Bilateralism Bad?”, is about the welfare consequences of this accumulation of regional agreements. This question of welfare implications is also raised regarding unilateral liberalization, since it is difficult to infer a consistent appreciation of the global picture resulting from the accumulation of country-specific policy reforms. We deal with all these questions using simulations based on a standard general equilibrium model, applied to scenarios based upon our protection data, including a detailed assessment of the tariff-cutting provisions considered when the Doha Round negotiations were arguably closest to conclusion. By doing so, we are inter alia able to evaluate to what extent the spread of regionalism may have eroded, or in some cases renewed, economic incentives to conclude the round. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and methodology used to document accurately tariffs and trade in the twent-first century. Section 3 disentangles reciprocal commitments and unilateral contributions to liberalization since the turn of the century. To study some of the underlying reasons, Sect. 4 econometrically assesses how these trade policy changes were linked to GVCs. Section 5 quantitatively assesses the interaction between regionalism, unilateralism and multilateralism, using model-based simulations. The last section provides concluding remarks.",11

Having constrained this traditional instrument of import protection, countries may be inclined to pursue trade policy objectives through non-tariff measures (NTMs) (see, among others, Bhagwati 1988; Bagwell and Staiger 2001; Drazen and Limão 2008; Carrère and De Melo 2011). The use of NTMs to restore former levels of tariff protection can be defined as trade policy substitution. The theoretical literature does not provide clear-cut predictions as to whether there is trade policy substitution. Some theoretical contributions indeed suggest trade policy complementarity. Bagwell at al. (2002) argue that market access concessions made in the context of GATT/WTO negotiations may lead to a race to the bottom or regulatory chill.Footnote 1 According to Essaji (2010), both trade policy substitution or complementarity may occur, depending on several factors: (i) the effects of the standard on a consumption externality; (ii) the effect of the standard on the amount of sales by foreign firms in the initial equilibrium; and (iii) the weight placed by the government on domestic firms’ profits, on tariff revenue and on the consumption externality. In this paper we reconcile the findings in the literature using a political economy framework à la Grossman and Helpman (1994). The main prediction of the model is that the occurrence of policy substitution depends on the effect of product standards on firms’ marginal standard compliance costs. In particular, a necessary condition for a tightening of the standard to be welfare-improving is that domestic firms’ compliance costs are lower than foreign firms’ compliance costs. In the light of case-study and econometric evidence that developing countries face higher compliance cost compared to developed countries, the empirical implication of the model is that trade policy substitution is more likely to occur in developed economies, as they have on average a technological advantage in complying with standards. A novelty of our approach is that the empirical analysis is conducted using only NTMs that constitute actual trade restrictions. As Beghin et al. (2015) show, almost 40% of the product lines affected by NTMs according to the NTM global database (Kee et al. 2009) are actually trade-facilitating measures rather than trade-restrictive ones. We tackle this issue using NTMs based on Specific Trade Concerns (STCs) raised in the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). STCs may be brought forward by any WTO member who considers itself to be negatively affected by a TBT measure imposed by a WTO trading partner. They are soft law mechanisms to deal with NTMs based on diplomatic relations rather than adjudication. Moreover, STCs refer to measures of general application, as opposed to bilateral measures such as anti-dumping investigations. The empirical application of the model determines to what extent the probability of applying NTMs is related to tariff reductions. Several papers tackle this topic (Falvey and Reed 2002; Goldberg and Pavcnik 2005; Broda et al. 2008; Kee et al. 2009; Limão and Tovar 2011; Aisbett and Pearson 2012).Footnote 2 With the exception of Falvey and Reed (2002) and Goldberg and Pavcnik (2005), these studies find evidence of policy substitution. Building on this literature, we confirm the model’s prediction that the occurrence of trade policy substitution is conditional on country characteristics. Only developed economies, where the costs of compliance with standards are relatively low, engage in such substitution. We face two main empirical challenges. First, there is potential reverse causality. Countries may be relaxing tariffs knowing that their non-binding existing NTMs will start having some bite. We address this issue with an identification strategy based on pre-determined (lagged) tariff cuts and on the exclusive use of STCs relating to ‘new measures’. Second, NTMs such as standards normally have a declared purpose of serving a public policy goal (WTO 2012). The literature often struggles to relate changes in standards to possible protectionist purposes. We use two approaches that enable us to unveil possible protectionist purposes behind the use of standards. First, we consider the end of the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA), providing novel evidence on the substitution of NTMs for protectionist import quotas on textiles and apparel applied by industrial countries. Second, we match STCs with information on WTO notifications and estimate the empirical specification in two different subsamples: one only including STCs on measures that were previously notified, and one only including STCs on measures that were not previously notified. As the importing country did not fulfill notification obligations under the WTO agreements, the non-notified measures, arguably, are more likely to be protectionist. We find statistically weak and quantitatively limited evidence of trade policy substitution in the subsample of STCs with previous notification, and much stronger evidence of trade policy substitution in the subsample of STCs without previous notification. We interpret this finding as further indirect evidence that, for advanced economies, the imposition of NTMs in the wake of tariff liberalization might be related to protectionism. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present the theoretical model from which we derive a testable hypothesis regarding policy substitution between applied tariffs and product standards. Section 3 presents the empirical approach and identification strategy. In Sect. 4, we describe the information contained in the database on STCs and present descriptive statistics for the variables used in the regression analysis of Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes.",15

Anyanwu,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"International migration has increased significantly since the early 1990s and is now an integral part of globalization. One of the main characteristics of this migration is the size of the youth involved. Indeed, the examination of the architecture of international migration clearly shows a strong dominance of the mobility of the active population (see Fig. 1). Developing countries, which are primarily affected by this phenomenon, are characterized by high emigration to developed OECDFootnote 1 countries. Moreover, the highly skilled emigration rate from Africa—especially West and East Africa—is among the highest in the world (see OECD 2015). Figure 2 shows the remarkable increase of migration from African countries to the OECD countries with a growing share of highly skilled migrants. This brain drain from developing countries nourishes the stock of the highly skilled Diaspora.Footnote 2 Age distributions of world population and international migration Migration from Africa to OECD countries by level of education The impact of brain drain from developing countries is a controversial issue on which two paradigms are opposed. The first paradigm, the oldest and most widespread, posits that brain drain is detrimental to the economic development of the countries concerned (Bhagwati and Hamada 1974; Miyagiwa 1991; Haque and Kim 1995). The argument is that emigration of an individual with a higher than average level of education and income results in a decrease in the average level of income and education. Thus, GDP per capita is reduced and the average human capital that is needed for future growth is also reduced. In addition, it results in a tax loss for sending countries and a loss of externalities related to the education of the individual. The second paradigm is more recent and challenges the first by putting forward two brain drain effects that could be beneficial to sending countries (Meyer 2001; Kerr 2008; Spilimbergo 2009; Docquier et al. 2010; Agrawal et al. 2011). The first is an incentive effect, which takes place ex-ante of emigration itself, and leads families to invest in the education of their children in the perspective of future emigration. As all high-skilled individuals do not emigrate, the stock of human capital could increase with this incentive effect. The second effect is ex-post and relates to the links that the Diaspora maintains with the country, by their financial transfers or their possible return, but also and especially by their participation in scientific, political and business networks. Such networks potentially generate trade and capital flows, technology transfers, and can also contribute to the dissemination of social and institutional norms conducive to development (Rapoport 2010). Given these two divergent paradigms, predictions of the macroeconomic impact of the Diaspora or emigration on economic development are purely speculative if they are not based on rigorous empirical studies. Also, due to the initial lack of consensual data on migration by skill level, empirical studies on brain drain are relatively recent. This paper aims to study the impact of the Diaspora on economic development in low-income countries, with particular focus on African countries. In order to shed some light on the issue of brain drain versus brain gain, we study both the global impact and the specific impact according to the level of education of the emigrants. To ensure the quality of our estimates and conclusions, we use a set of powerful econometric tools to overcome identification problems that are likely to characterize the relationship between the Diaspora and economic development. For example, the causality between emigration and economic development can go both ways. Indeed, while the Diaspora can contribute to the economic development of the countries of origin, the low level of economic development of these countries generally constitutes an incentive for emigration. To deal with this endogeneity issue, we use an instrumental variable (IV) approach. We rely on two complementary IV strategies: (i) a gravity model predicting a country’s emigration rate out of a set of reasonably exogenous bilateral variables and (ii) internal instruments using both DIF-GMM and SYS-GMM estimations. Finally, using the income decomposition proposed by Hall and Jones (1999), we analyze the main income-related channels through which the effect of the Diaspora passes. Thus, once the human capital channels, capital intensity and total factor productivity are analyzed, we then explore two additional channels by studying the impact of the Diaspora in developed OECD countries (by level of education) on remittances and democracy in Africa. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief review of the literature on the impact of brain drain or the Diaspora. Section 3 describes our empirical strategy. In Sect. 4, we present and discuss our main results, and provide some robustness checks. We propose and analyse of transmission channels in 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper and presents some policy implications.",5
155,4,Review of World Economics,24 June 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-019-00353-2,Accumulation of reserves in emerging and developing countries: mercantilism versus insurance,November 2019,Luis Cabezas,José De Gregorio,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Across emerging market economies, the 2000s were characterized by massive accumulation of international reserves. It was a key feature of the global landscape. There were intense policy discussions, from insurance needs to currency manipulation, as well as important research on the causes and consequences of reserve accumulation. In their influential study, Aizenman and Lee (2007) argue that countries maintain international reserves for two main reasons. First, as a precautionary motive, to self-insure against foreign financial shortfalls, such as sudden stops or capital flights, which cause negative effects on economic activity and trigger financial turbulences. And second, due to a mercantilist motive, to weaken their currency in order to promote export-led growth. Most calibrations of the optimal level of reserves have focused on the precautionary motive, where international reserves act as a buffer to absorb transitory shocks to the balance of payments. Heller (1966) pioneered this research, affirming that reserves can allow countries to buy time for a gradual adjustment in the balance of payments. Frenkel and Jovanovic (1981) argue that they serve as a buffer stock whose role is to accommodate fluctuations in external transactions, implying that the optimal stock of reserves depends positively on these fluctuations. In turn, Edwards (1983) shows that countries that peg the exchange rate have a demand for reserves that is different from those that use occasional devaluations to correct balance of payments imbalances. The latter group maintains lower levels of reserves, although it adjusts them more quickly to their desired level. In recent decades economies have become more exposed to external financial shocks as financial integration has grown over time. In this context, one of the most studied issues within the precautionary motive has been avoiding financial crises and mitigating sudden stops. Some research has found that maintaining reserves reduces the likelihood of crises, the costs associated with them and mitigates the effects of financial sector adverse shocks.Footnote 1 Other research has argued that a loss of confidence in the local currency (as measured by M2 over GDP) or high levels of short-term debt are important reasons for maintaining reserves.Footnote 2 In all these cases the authorities have a large war chest to use in times of turmoil. Although most authors claim that the precautionary effect serves the purpose of smoothing shocks to foreign financing, a large stock of reserves also acts as a deterrent to currency speculation, and hence even if not used, they still play a stabilizing role. Indeed, this is consistent with a fact discussed later, namely, reserves are rarely used, at least massively (De Gregorio 2014). Cheung and Qian (2009) have suggested that the high level observed in international reserves could be a response to an implicit rivalry among economies that gives rise to a comparative hoarding mechanism, the so-called Joneses effect. Thus, a high level of international reserves compared with peer economies can deter speculative pressures and reduce the chances of bearing a currency attack. When speculators look at currencies with greater potential of being successfully attacked, they compare the relative size of their reserves. This is part of the precautionary motive, and we call it the deterrent effect. There is also a sizable literature that evaluates jointly the roles of both motives for reserve accumulation. Aizenman and Lee (2007) started this type of study by quantifying the relative importance of these two motives for the years 1980–2000. Their results show that both motives are significant, though the precautionary motive carries greater weight in explaining the increase in reserves. Along this same line, Delatte and Fouquau (2011) find evidence that the elasticities change over time, i.e., the demand for international reserves shows a nonlinear behavior. Additionally, they support the mercantilist view through a nonlinear approach. Finally, Ghosh et al. (2017) show that motives have varied over time. They conclude that undervaluation of currencies became more important around 2000, which can be associated with a deliberate undervaluation strategy following a mercantilist motive. In this paper, we want to go further by distinguishing explicitly the roles of the precautionary motive in its traditional version and also as a deterrent of speculation, and of mercantilist motive. Despite the relevance of the issue, there is still no consensus regarding the main cause of the surprising increase in reserves, what the appropriate method should be for measuring the mercantilist motive, or how important it was during the massive accumulation of the 2000s. This paper investigates the motives that drove the hoarding of international reserves in emerging and developing countries between 2000 and 2013, mainly focusing on the period comprised in 2000–2008.Footnote 3 We take advantage of the unprecedented boom of commodity prices (ToT) during this period to estimate the mercantilist motive. We follow the route of the joint estimation of the mercantilist and precautionary motives for reserve accumulation. In addition to the use of one of the traditional proxies for mercantilism, GDP growth, we focus on the ToT. The significant increase in the ToT induced a loss of competitiveness that incentivized the use of other policies to prevent the strengthening of the currency, being the accumulation of reserves a very relevant one. We show, based on our empirical evidence, that the ToT effects on reserves is not caused by the precautionary motive. We also argue that the conventional manner to estimate this motive —exchange rate overvaluation—has severe problems that our measures prevent. In our empirical investigation we separate explicitly the precautionary motive between self-insurance and speculation deterrent. The main contribution of this paper is to present an estimation including all the motives for reserves accumulation and complementing the mercantilist measure using the terms of trade, examining a period in which many emerging market economies enjoyed significant gains in the ToT. The traditional approach has measured the mercantilist motive through currency undervaluation and export growth or excess export growth (e.g., Ghosh et al. 2017). However, these measures have, beyond causality issues, problems to a correct interpretation of mercantilism. Actually, these approaches assume that undervaluation and high export growth are caused by the accumulation of reserves.Footnote 4 Many countries begin accumulating reserves for mercantilist reasons when their currency is relatively strong.Footnote 5 The use of undervaluation is not capable of capturing this effect, since the currency would probably start overvalued. In addition, to have a positive relationship between the level of reserves and currency undervaluation, one needs to assume that interventions are effective in weakening the currency, which is heterogenous across countries.Footnote 6 Finally, what could affect the exchange rate is the accumulation of reserves, not their level. These concerns are also valid when export growth is used as an indication of mercantilism. In this paper we identify mercantilism using the terms of trade, which does not experience econometric and economic problems inherent in the traditional methods used to measure the mercantilist motive. The reason to use this variable is that an improvement in the ToT induces a real exchange rate appreciation, with a consequent fall in competitiveness in the sectors not affected by the terms of trade gain. Thus, policymakers may have an incentive to intervene in the foreign exchange market to mitigate the effect of the terms of trade gain, which, in some cases, could be combined with capital controls and other policies.Footnote 7 This hypothesis is reaffirmed by the fact that the accumulation of international reserves can cushion the effects of ToT shocks on the real exchange rate.Footnote 8 Thus, the accumulation of reserves in the presence of positive ToT would reveal a mercantilist motive. This is particularly relevant in our sample period since the commodity price boom took place in it. In addition, the traditional mercantilist approach focuses on hoarding international reserves as a by-product of an industrial policy to prevent or mitigate exchange rate appreciation and gain export competitiveness (see Aizenman and Lee 2007). Thus, a country growing faster than its competitors could increase reserves in order to delay a real appreciation that would dent economic growth. For this reason, and for the quarrels related to the variables traditionally used to measure the mercantilist motive, we use also GDP growth as another proxy for mercantilism. Our analysis also splits the precautionary motive into two components. The first is the traditional self-insurance, by which reserves are accumulated to face foreign financing fluctuations. Therefore, the traditional variables related to current and financial accounts’ vulnerabilities are used to capture this motive. The second one is the deterrent effect, which is proxied by the level of reserves of the remaining emerging and developing markets. Countries should have high reserves to prevent an attack on their currency, however what is meant by “high” depends on the level of reserves of other countries. Finally, we use our model to analyze what motive for maintaining reserves predominates when we divide our sample of countries between those that are commodity exporters and those that are not (henceforth, “other countries”). The paper follows in Sect. 2 with a brief discussion on the stylized facts on reserves accumulation and their behavior during the global financial crisis. Then, the methodology, description of data and main results are presented in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we perform robustness checks and a decomposition of reserves hoardings during the period 2000–2008. Section 5 concludes.",6

Such public procurement often accounts for a significant share of GDP and aggregate demand. In low-income countries, public procurement constitutes 14.4% of GDP on average, with even larger values recorded in some of the poorest regions of the world, including South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (Djankov et al. 2016). Most national public procurement systems embody procedures to ensure value for money: award of contracts to the lowest cost suppliers able to meet technical specifications required by a project. Value for money is not the only goal of public procurement systems, however. Public procurement may also be a tool of industrial policy or be used to attain sustainable development goals (Kattel and Lember 2010; OECD 2013; UNIDO 2017), reflected in “buy national” policies, local content or technology transfer requirements for foreign bidders (e.g., Altenburg and Lütkenhorst 2015). As government procurement can represent a meaningful source of demand for firms, a government contract may encourage firms to invest more, expand employment and increase productivity (Geroski 1990; Acemoglu et al. 2013; Ferraz et al. 2015). Most empirical research on public procurement centres on whether contract award procedures and mechanisms result in (support) realization of value for money goals, with a specific focus often being on control of corruption and anti-competitive behaviour (e.g., bid rigging). The international trade literature has analysed public procurement through the lens of trade policy objectives—one means governments may use to discriminate in favour of domestic firms.Footnote 1 Governments generally source most goods and services from national (domestic) firms. Research has shown that the import share of public procurement in OECD countries is substantially less than the import share of private sector demand (e.g., Shingal 2015; Gourdon and Messent 2017). Empirical analysis of public procurement in low-income developing countries is limited due to absence of comparable, disaggregated data on procurement awards. In this paper, we employ firm-level data from a survey covering roughly 6700 companies based in 19 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The survey includes information on the share of total sales of each firm to the government and thus the shares of foreign-owned firms, reflecting inward foreign direct investment (FDI), as opposed to national firms in total reported sales to government entities—a proxy for participation in public procurement by these two groups of firms. We use the information on the shares of foreign-owned or controlled firms in total sales to government reported by all firms in the sample to analyse the relationship between participation in procurement and firm performance (productivity) in the countries concerned. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to explore empirically the nexus between public procurement and firm performance in a cross-section of low-income African countries, taking into account the role of FDI as a source of foreign competition. The case of SSA is particularly relevant given arguments in the literature that one factor impeding structural transformation in Africa is weak demand (McMillan et al. 2014; UNIDO 2017). A focus on SSA is also of interest from the perspective of international trade cooperation. The home bias in procurement awards has incentivized countries to negotiate international agreements on public procurement. The main example is the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA).Footnote 2 Procurement is increasingly also included in bilateral or regional preferential trade agreements (PTAs). Such agreements aim to enhance market access for foreign bidders through a mix of transparency-related disciplines and commitments to open contracts above a minimum threshold value to international competition. A distinguishing feature of countries in SSA is that they have not signed the GPA or PTAs that require non-discrimination in procurement. Reasons for this may include a lack of export interest, i.e., limited capacity of firms in developing countries to contest foreign public procurement markets, and a desire by governments to be able to allocate government contracts to domestic firms, i.e., industrial policy. Whatever the motivation, the international procurement literature has pointed out that inward FDI may be a more salient channel to contest public procurement opportunities than trade (e.g., Evenett and Hoekman 2005). This may reflect the type of products that are procured (e.g., services provision often requires a physical presence), contract enforcement and performance monitoring considerations, or political economy factors. Given that SSA countries tend to be open to FDI, another potential reason for lack of participation in the GPA may be that governments already source from foreign firms through this channel. The availability of data on sales by foreign-invested firms to SSA governments allows us to shed some light on this possibility. The analysis reveals that public procurement is a significant source of demand for many firms in SSA. Government contracts account for a larger share of sales of domestic firms than foreign-owned ones, and are more important for larger and older firms. We find a strong positive relationship between sales to the government and the performance of firms. Increasing the share of total output sold to the government by 10 percentage points is associated with a 4% higher productivity.Footnote 3 Although there is substantial heterogeneity across firms, the correlation between sales to the government and performance is more evident for smaller and domestically owned firms, and for firms that are at the bottom of the productivity distribution. Public procurement also relates positively with other dimensions of firm performance, not just productivity, e.g., product innovation by domestic firms. The correlation between procurement participation (sales to the government) and indicators of firm performance is greater in countries that are more open to foreign participation, measured by the share of total sales to the government accounted for by foreign firms (FDI), suggesting domestic environments more open to foreign participation in public procurement are more likely to enhance overall local competitiveness. Foreign participation is defined as sales to the government by foreign-owned firms based in each country. This excludes other forms of foreign participation in procurement (i.e., imports). While this restricted definition of foreign participation reflects data constraints, it fits with the overall aim of this work, which is to examine whether and to what extent participation by locally based firms in public procurement can result in positive performance outcomes.Footnote 4 Foreign participation (the share of foreign firms in total sales to government agencies) in turn correlates with the quality of procurement institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Benchmarking Public Procurement indicators (World Bank 2016) as well as economy-wide measures of governance such as control of corruption. Given that SSA countries have not signed the GPA but are nonetheless relatively open to foreign participation, our results suggest that the potential benefits of GPA membership may be associated more with improvement in procurement institutions than with market access liberalization.Footnote 5 Our analysis uses cross-sectional data. Given that we have no information on the timing of access to procurement, i.e., when firms start selling to the government and how long they have been doing so, we cannot draw any conclusions regarding causal effects of participating in public procurement: the results may be driven by selection of better firms into procurement contracts or by unobserved characteristics of the firms (e.g., connections with government officers) we cannot control in our analysis. We try to address this concern through a selection model exercise that matches firms that participate in procurement with firms that do not but share a common set of observables. This exercise suggests that larger and better performing firms are more likely to sell to the government, and our main findings continue to hold. The results we obtain are consistent with recent developing country-specific panel studies using detailed administrative (contract-specific) data that establish a causal relationship between participation in public procurement and different dimension of firm performance (e.g. Ferraz et al. (2015) for Brazil and Fadic (2018) for Ecuador). The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews related literature. Section 3 discusses the data and provides some descriptive statistics for our sample of 19 countries. Section 4 describes the empirical framework. Section 5 presents the results and several robustness checks, including the matching exercise. Section 6 explores the role of foreign participation in public procurement in influencing our findings. Section 7 concludes.",8
156,1,Review of World Economics,29 January 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-019-00340-7,Sectoral inflationary dynamics: cross-country evidence on the open-economy New Keynesian Phillips Curve,February 2020,Hülya Saygılı,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Empirical estimates of the open-economy New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) vary considerably across countries,Footnote 1,Footnote 2 while the other line in the literature using the closed-economy version of the NKPC models shows that the response of inflation to changes in domestic factors displays noticeable heterogeneity even from sector to sector.Footnote 3 This study combines the features of these two lines of the same literature and complements them by showing that sources of the heterogeneity in the response of inflation to domestic and external factors are also related to sectoral heterogeneity in integrating global value chains. Technological advancements, by allowing production processes to be sliced up into several stages, have mediated the integration of production activities worldwide (Acemoglu et al. 2012). Sectors attach to global value chains at different production stages. The types of products (consumption/intermediate) to be imported more depend on the stage being integrated. The response of sectoral inflation to external shocks is related to the link between domestic and imported products. Trade in intermediate inputs or complementary goods as an indicator of globalized production (Hummels et al. 2001) causes domestic macroeconomic dynamics to become more sensitive to international disturbances of productivity, demand, and thus inflation (Wong and Eng 2010). Auer and Schoenle (2014) suggest that, when relative prices are sector-specific, pass-through may work in opposite directions if domestic and imported inputs are complementary. Thus, it is important to understand how trade in different types of goods used for different purposes affects inflation dynamics. Empirical findings on the significance of trade-related variables in the open-economy NKPC analyses have important implications for the effectiveness of monetary policy. In particular, they imply that inflation may become less sensitive to domestic factors. In other words, trade may reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy by limiting the ability of central banks to stabilize domestic inflation. Recent studies have drawn attention to sectoral heterogeneity in the coefficient estimates of domestic forcing variables in the closed-economy NKPC models, which adds further complexity to the implementation of monetary policy. In addition, this paper argues that the impact of trade on domestic inflation may vary depending on the nature of trade and the degree of sectoral production linkages. This is not the first study focusing on the differing impacts of consumption goods and intermediate inputs on inflation. Previously, Leith and Malley (2007b), Rumler (2007) and Mihailov et al. (2011a, b), using cross-country open-economy models, concluded that firms importing intermediate inputs are more likely to follow different pricing strategies (local currency pricing/producer currency pricing) than those that import mainly consumption goods.Footnote 4 Chung (2016) supports this argument by showing that dependence on imported inputs affects the choice of the invoicing currency, with those exporters dependent more on foreign currency-dominated inputs being less likely to price in the domestic currency. Our study, however, differs from them by extending the discussion to include sectoral level analysis and examining if there is a systematic association between the extent of global production linkages and estimated coefficients. The study begins with a formal analysis to show in which channels consumption goods and intermediate inputs affect inflation in the open-economy NKPC models. It does that by using the approaches in Gali and Monacelli (2005), and Wong and Eng (2010). In Gali and Monacelli (2005), trade is incorporated into the closed-economy NKPC using imported and home-produced consumption goods together in the representative households’ utility function, whereas Wong and Eng (2010) analyze potential impacts of globalized production structure by introducing home-produced and imported intermediate inputs in the representative firms’ production function. Our study combines the ideas and models in these two studies so that the effects of trade in consumption goods and intermediate inputs on inflation dynamics can be examined independently. The majority of earlier empirical studies utilized aggregate data and time-series methodologies to estimate different versions of the NKPC models. Instrumental variables estimation techniques, primarily GMM, were mostly preferred to deal with the forward-looking inflation term in the NKPC models (Gali and Gertler 1999; Gali et al. 2001; Leith and Malley 2007a, b; Rumler 2007; Mihailov et al. 2011a, b). However, GMM estimation techniques are subject to the problem of weak instruments attributed to the lack of higher-order dynamics in the exogenous variables (Stock et al. 2002; Dufour 2003; Nason and Smith 2008; Kleibergen and Mavroeidis 2009). In addition, Byrne et al. (2013) (BMK hereafter) note that the GMM estimators are particularly problematic with panels of disaggregate data because instrumentation affects the properties of heterogeneous panel estimators. Finally, the full-information approach, which improves the small-sample properties of the estimates, is criticized for being based on the conditionality on the correct specification of the general equilibrium model (BKM). We explore inflation dynamics in a sample of OECD countries for manufacturing and two-digit manufacturing sub-sectors for 1990–2016. There are a couple of issues in panel data analysis: (1) shocks to domestic and external factors may be correlated within a panel member; (2) shocks to individual domestic and external factors may be correlated across panel members; (3) shocks to inflation may be correlated across panel members. Therefore, as another contribution, we employ the Prais-Winsten regression heteroskedastic panels corrected standard errors (PCSE) approach, rather than the GMM, to overcome these issues. The inclusion of both cross–sectional and time-fixed effects in panel regression analysis enables unobserved common factors to be accounted for. In addition, the PCSE approach, which assumes a serial correlation of type AR(1), helps to deal with additional correlations across the variables without losing the first observation. Panel techniques were used in Ghosh (2014) and BKM as well (to obtain mean unweighted/weighted group estimators of a closed-economy NKPC). In contrast, our analysis is based on a variant of the open-economy NKPC derived by combining Gali and Monacelli (2005) and Wong and Eng (2010). The analysis is similar to Romer (1993), Lane (1997), Gruben and McLeod (2004), Rumler (2007), Bowdler (2009), Daniels et al. (2005), Razin and Loungani (2007), Badinger (2009), Mihailov et al. (2011a, b), and Ghosh (2014) in the sense that we empirically investigate the impact of trade openness on inflation dynamics. However, unlike them, we focus on differences in the impacts of consumption goods and intermediate inputs trade on sectoral inflation dynamics. Our study also differs from those studies utilizing sectoral data, for instance, Leith and Malley (2007a, b), Imbs et al. (2011) [IJP here after], Petrella and Santoro (2012), and BKM, by focusing on the open-economy version of the NKPC models. The results signify the importance of both domestic aspects and the nature of trade openness in inflation dynamics. The estimated coefficients display sectoral heterogeneity depending on the degree of integration into the global value chains. Inflation reacts to imports of consumption goods and intermediate inputs in opposite directions, supporting the view on the different pricing strategies between firms engaged in trading consumption goods and intermediate inputs. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the theoretical background and justifies the empirical analysis. Section 3 explains the empirical model and dataset. Section 4 presents the results, while the final section concludes the paper.",1

Nowadays, most countries are actively trying to attract inward foreign direct investment (FDI) (Bah et al. 2015). A primary reason for that is the belief that foreign firm entry is accompanied by technology and knowledge transfer into the host economy. Economic theory predicts that multinational enterprises (MNEs) which decide to enter a foreign market via FDI should possess a firm-specific advantage vis-à-vis domestic firms (advanced technology, superior managerial practices etc.) since they must compensate for their inferior local market knowledge (Bellak 2004; Caves 1971; Dunning 1979; Markusen 1995). The knowledge and technology transfer from the parent company to a foreign affiliate stationed in the host country as a by-product of FDI happens in the context of the so-called direct effects of FDI. This, in turn, results in the foreign affiliate’s productivity being higher than domestic firms. A large body of empirical literature supports the theoretical prediction that foreign-owned firms are more productive than domestic firms. Doms and Jensen (1998), for instance, found that foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the USA performed better in terms of total factor productivity (TFP) and labour productivity than domestic plants. Girma et al. (2001) found for the UK that labour productivity in foreign firms was almost 10% higher than in domestic firms, whereas TFP was about 5% higher. However, while these studies confirm the statistical correlation between foreign ownership and productivity, they generally do not analyse the causal relationship between them (Barba Navaretti and Venables 2004). This means they do not account for the possibility of selection bias. Namely, foreign investors may be inclined to only acquire the best-performing firms. This may then lead researchers to overestimate the impact of a foreign takeover on productivity (Salis 2008). Studies addressing this question give results that paint a much vaguer picture. Reported differences in productivity between foreign and domestic firms are smaller than previously estimated and often non-significant (Barba Navaretti and Venables 2004). On one hand, regarding Indonesian manufacturing firms Arnold and Javorcik (2009) find that foreign acquisitions lead to significant productivity improvements for the acquired firms. Three years after acquisition, the latter enjoyed 13.5% higher productivity than the control group. Damijan et al. (2015) determine that the performance of acquired plants had improved post-acquisition in seven new EU member states. Moreover, they reported that the productivity increase was achieved via increased efficiency in the use of labour and capital rather than a reduction of the number of workers. Benfratello and Sembenelli (2006), in contrast, analysed a large sample of Italian firms and found that foreign ownership has no effect on firm productivity, after controlling for input simultaneity, unobserved heterogeneity and measurement errors. Salis (2008) studied the impact of foreign acquisition on the productivity of Slovenian manufacturing firms, as did Oražem and Vodopivec (2009), with neither finding evidence of a positive effect. Little is known about the reasons for the ambiguous results concerning the productivity advantage of foreign-owned firms over their domestic peers. Is this vagueness simply the result of cross-country differences with respect to the host and/or investing firms themselves or can it perhaps be explained by certain other factors of technology transfer efficacy resulting in the improved TFP performance of local affiliates? Can skilled worker mobility explain the effectiveness of the parent company’s technology transfer to a host-country affiliate? Are foreign firms which appoint skilled migrant workers more productive than those which do not? Accordingly, in this paper we aim to test a potential explanation of this ambiguity, i.e. the role played by skilled worker mobility. We aim to characterise the interaction between capital (FDI) and worker mobility to establish whether worker mobility has a significant role in effectively transferring knowledge from the parent company to a host-country affiliate. We test the effectiveness of a technology transfer indirectly via its impact on affiliates’ TFP performance. This indirect approach is often taken in studies on FDI impact on host countries. As noted by Lipsey (2004), the examination of productivity is an attempt to measure technology gaps and changes in technology, whereas most theoretical discussions of the possible role of inward FDI refer to the transmission of superior technology. There is strong support in the management literature for the premise that the technology transferred to the subsidiary contributes to the subsidiary’s performance (Lyles and Salk 1996; Dhanaraj et al. 2004) and that the knowledge transferred has a mediating effect on the impact of expatriates on the subsidiary’s enhanced performance (Wang et al. 2009). We address the role of skilled migrant workers by explicitly distinguishing two types of skilled migrant worker positions; namely management and expert positions in local affiliates. We focus on foreign managers and experts since these categories of foreign workers have a vital role in facilitating the transfer of MNEs’ technology or promoting firm performance generally, e.g. as confirmed for managers by Tsang (2001) in the case of China, Santacreu-Vasut and Teshima (2011) using Mexican plant-level data and Inzelt (2008) for expat managers in a survey-based study for Hungary, while the contribution of experts is acknowledged in Markusen and Trofimenko (2009) and Malchow-Møller et al. (2011). The literature provides several reasons in support of the expectation that attempts to move knowledge are more effective when accompanied by the movement of people. First, individuals are able to adapt knowledge to new contexts [Allen as cited by Argote and Ingram (2000)]. Second, they are able to transfer explicit knowledge as well as tacit knowledge (Argote and Ingram 2000; Berry and Broadbent 1984, 1987), which seems to be a critical advantage of skilled expat workers who come from within the MNE organisation itself. As argued by Kerr (2008), effectiveness in adopting (imitating) inventions depends on codified and tacit innovation-specific knowledge. Within knowledge creation and learning models in the expatriation literature, expat workers (PCNs) holding managing positions are seen as knowledge carriers capable of transferring intellectual capital between the parent and affiliates as they embody professional skills, specialist know-how and enjoy better social ties with other managers within the MNE (Belderbos and Heijltjes 2005; Ando and Endo 2013; Wang et al. 2009; Michailova et al. 2016). While within the control and coordination framework the use of expatriates is a way of directly controlling operations in an affiliate and aligning the affiliate and parent companies’ objectives, which may reduce goal incongruence and information asymmetry (Belderbos and Heijltjes 2005; Kren and Liao 1988; Zajac 1990). Further, externally sourced foreign experts or managers who do not carry the MNE’s specific knowledge may still possess certain knowledge and experience that helps facilitate the knowledge transfer process. They can, for example, have acquisition experience. According to Daniliuc and Jang (2014), prior experience with acquisitions may facilitate the acquired firm’s integration. Moreover, foreign workers may bring in knowledge and competencies that complement those possessed by the host-country workers, not necessarily connected to the knowledge transfer process between the parent company and the affiliate. As Malchow-Møller et al. (2011) state, one quite straightforward possibility is that foreign experts possess knowledge related to the firm’s export destination (e.g. knowledge of the local culture, market, language), thereby positively impacting export activities. As far as empirical evidence is concerned, in the field of international economics empirical studies typically deal with the impact of skilled migrant workers, especially experts, on firm performance generally, but not in the FDI context. Markusen and Trofimenko (2009) tested their theoretical model using plant-level Colombian data and concluded that foreign experts exert a substantial positive effect on local workers’ wages and value added per worker, although this effect is not always immediate. Malchow-Møller et al. (2011), on the other hand, analysed Danish matched employer–employee data and constructed a simple theoretical model. The model suggests that firms using foreign experts are more productive and consequently pay higher wages. The results of the empirical part of their research also showed that Danish firms employing foreign experts indeed pay higher wages, strongly indicating they also achieve higher productivity levels. Ghosh et al. (2014) conducted their research using US data for publicly-traded firms matched with data on H-1B visa applications. They concluded that loosening the restriction on the number of visas issued to skilled foreign workers would result in higher labour productivity, firm size, and profits for a subgroup of firms. Based on analysis of German data, Trax et al. (2015) in contrast concluded that the share of foreign workers in the establishment does not affect productivity. Regarding the firm’s export performance, Lodefalk (2016) shows that temporary expats are positively associated with exports. The second strain in the mostly survey-based literature studies expat workers’ role in technology transfer directly, i.e. not by examining the affiliate’s performance. Using Mexican plant-level data, Santacreu-Vasut and Teshima (2011) found that expatriates are associated with higher amounts of technology transfer measured by expenditure on technology transfer from abroad over sales. They also concluded that not all subsidiaries employ expatriates. In a survey-based study for Hungary, Inzelt (2008) found that the initial temporary mobility of foreign managers (1–2 years after the FDI entry) led to a ‘one-off’ transfer of knowledge to the local affiliate. The third strain in the literature, the closest to our paper, links foreign workers (in some cases expatriates) with the performance of local affiliates. An early study by Verner (1999) employed data from Zimbabwe and showed the number of expatriates in metal firms was positively correlated with firm-level labour productivity. Hahn et al. (2013) further examined the trade-off between hiring host-country-national managers and parent-country-national (PCN) managers in MNEs’ affiliates using a Korean-origin FDI dataset. Their results suggest the host-country-national-manager ratio is positively correlated with productivity improvement in developing countries, but not in developed countries. The same positive correlation was established for less R&D-intensive industries. By tracking employee transfers within Korean multinationals, Cho (2013) also confirmed that managers transferred from MNE headquarters to the affiliates facilitated firm-specific knowledge transfer and were positively related to labour productivity for Korean multinational foreign affiliates. Evidently, the empirical literature dealing with FDI-related intra-firm knowledge transfer via skilled migrant workers is relatively scarce and chiefly limited to individual industries. Moreover, no study has looked into the interaction of capital and worker mobility for generating foreign firms’ productivity advantage vis-à-vis domestic peers, which requires consideration of the entire population of firms across various industries in a particular country. We aim to fill this gap. Therefore, this paper focuses on the question of whether worker mobility indeed leads to productivity advantages in host-country affiliates in the case where foreign managers and experts become employed by the affiliate soon after the FDI takes place. To tackle this, we must address the causal links between worker mobility, foreign ownership, and local affiliate performance—which cannot be done in a conventional matching framework with only two potential states, treatment and non-treatment. In our case, we need to identify the causal effects of multiple treatments since the actual choice set contains more than just two options, i.e. the treatment of foreign ownership alone and the treatment of foreign ownership accompanied by skilled migrant worker appointment. To deal with the likely non-randomness of these two treatments, we follow Arnold and Javorcik’s (2009) approach based on a combination of propensity score matching and the difference-in-differences methods and extend it to multiple treatments. Building on the idea of Lechner (2001), we transform average treatment effects for multiple treatments into a series of binary comparisons, i.e. the outcomes for firms where inward FDI is combined with employment of skilled migrant workers are compared to the outcomes where inward FDI is not combined with the employment of skilled foreign workers and with outcomes of domestic firms solely employing domestic skilled workers. To our knowledge, no research has yet compared those sets of outcomes. We conduct our analysis using matched employer–employee data for the population of Slovenian firms merged with firms’ financial and FDI data covering the period 2002–2010. The data set allows us to differentiate employees based on both their education level and occupation. Hence, we are able to analyse the effects of interaction between worker and capital (FDI) mobility for different categories of skilled migrant workers. Since experts and managers are most frequently associated with the effectiveness of technology transfer in the literature, we focus on foreign managers, foreign experts, and parent-country-national (PCN) managers). The rest of the paper is structured as follows: the empirical approach is explained in Sect. 2, while the data are described in Sect. 3. Section 4 reports and discusses the baseline, as well as checks the robustness of the results. The paper ends with concluding remarks in Sect. 5.",5
156,1,Review of World Economics,26 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-019-00355-0,"The social preferences of the native inhabitants, and the decision how many asylum seekers to admit",February 2020,Oded Stark,Marcin Jakubek,Krzysztof Szczygielski,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The question of how many asylum seekers a country should admit has rarely before featured so prominently in European public debate as in recent years. Day in, day out, officials, politicians, opinion leaders, and others float ideas on capping the number of people to be admitted into their country. The issue is not a passing one, and has featured prominently in European public debate and policy formation in every one of the past six years, especially when 2.5 million asylum seekers arrived in Europe in 2015-2016. As an example, consider the year 2016. The proposal to set daily quotas for the number of refugees to be allowed to enter Germany, made in January 2016 by Julia Kloeckner, at that time Deputy Federal Chair of the Christian Democratic Union party in Germany, is one such example.Footnote 2 Statements in February 2016 by the then French Prime Minister Manuel Valls that his country will accept 30,000 migrants over the next two years, and by the then Chancellor Werner Faymann that Austria will cap the number of asylum seeker applications at 80 per day, are two other examples.Footnote 3 The decision of the majority of British voters to leave the European Union in the referendum held on June 23, 2016 has been widely attributed to the campaign by “Brexiters” against freedom of movement within the EU.Footnote 4 More openly, Matteo Salvini, Italy’s Interior Minister, is reported to “want to suspend asylum procedures completely until the E.U. agrees on fair distribution of refugees, an issue that has deadlocked leaders in Brussels for years.” (Time magazine, September 24, 2018). In this paper we tackle the issue of how many asylum seekers to admit from a particular perspective. The formula that we propose does not provide, nor is it intended to deliver, a “golden rule” for admission; rather, it highlights a specific aspect that hitherto has not been considered in the design of admission policies, and it demonstrates how a factor that affects the optimal number of asylum seekers that a country can / should admit and integrate can be assessed through an explicit maximization of a social welfare function. In addition, as shown in detail below, our proposed formulation identifies an incongruity between two advocated policies when the maximization of the social welfare of the natives is the objective. This incongruity arises because taking steps to integrate the asylum seekers - which brings them into the mainstream workforce - is incompatible with allocating them between countries in proportion to the size of the populations of the countries: integrating the asylum seekers into the mainstream bears on the wellbeing of the natives, and if the allocation of asylum seekers is carried out without considering this effect, then the objective of maximizing the natives’ welfare is not served. Here we present briefly the setting that we consider, and the assumptions that we make. Later on, we present evidence in support of several of our key assumptions. The native inhabitants of a country, henceforth the natives, have social preferences. They consist of two homogeneous groups: the incomes of members of one group are higher than the incomes of members of the other group. (We hasten to add that the assumption of having two homogeneous groups of natives is not essential and is made in order to render it easier to derive the paper’s main claims. A more general income distribution would yield the same insights.) As a consequence of their social preferences and their lower income, the low-income natives experience disutility caused by relative deprivation. We consider what happens when we let low-skill asylum seekers into the country. In order to pay the costs of admitting and integrating the asylum seekers, the natives are taxed. Following their admission and integration, the asylum seekers join the income distribution of the native population “from below,” namely the incomes of the asylum seekers are lower than the incomes of the low-income natives.Footnote 5,Footnote 6 From the maximization of the natives’ social welfare function that incorporates these considerations we obtain the optimal share of asylum seekers in the population as a unique, strictly positive solution \( m^{*} \). Multiplication of \( m^{*} \) by the size of the population yields the optimal number of asylum seekers. We then investigate a related issue that is relevant to recent policy-making, especially in the European context, namely that of allocating a given number of asylum seekers between a group of host countries. Drawing on a multi-country framework, we find that an allocation that maximizes the countries’ aggregate welfare should not be proportional to the size of the populations of the host countries. Instead, the country in which the difference in incomes between the high-income natives and the low-income natives is larger should admit more asylum seekers (as a share of its population) than the other country, assuming that the cost of admission and integration, and the shares of high-income natives and low-income natives, are the same in the two countries. This result arises because the low-income natives in the former country experience higher relative deprivation and consequently stand to gain more from accepting asylum seekers. Finally, we compare a policy of admitting and integrating the optimal number of asylum seekers with a policy of direct tax and transfer from the high-income group of natives to the low-income group of natives, where the taxing of the high-income natives is the same in both cases. We find that if the cost of admission and integration is not excessive, the policy of letting in asylum seekers is preferable to an equivalent tax and transfer policy. In our setting, the asylum seekers confer a benefit on the natives not by raising the productivity of the latter or by lifting their incomes but rather by affecting the relative deprivation experienced by the low-income natives. This happens when, and because, the presence of the asylum seekers reduces the share of the high-income natives in the population, which in turn lowers the relative deprivation experienced by the low-income natives. Given the manner in which relative deprivation is measured, namely as the fraction of those members of the population whose incomes are higher, times their mean excess income (see the next section and footnote 8), the relative deprivation gain is conferred not because the low-income natives look “down” in the income distribution. Rather, it follows because in the wake of the admission and integration of the asylum seekers, when the low-income natives look “up” they find that the share of the high-income natives in the population is smaller. Thus, our main assumptions are that asylum seekers enter the social space of the natives; that they join in at the lowest rung of the income hierarchy; and that the wages of the low-income natives remain approximately constant. The integration programs referred to in footnote 5 see to it that asylum seekers who otherwise might constitute an “outsider group” become an “insider group,” both in the social landscape, and in the economic domain. In a way, integration programs constitute a technology that helps convert asylum seekers to productive workers. The assumption that the wages of the low-income natives remain approximately constant can be supported by empirical evidence regarding the effect of low-skill migration on the wage earnings and / or the employment opportunities of low-skill native workers, which finds that the effect tends to be weak, neutral, or slightly positive (LaLonde and Topel, 1991; Card, 2001, 2005; Kifle, 2009; Cohen-Goldner and Paserman, 2011; Manacorda et al., 2012; and Foged and Peri, 2016). Still, this is not a holy grail. Several empirical studies find an adverse effect of low-skill migration on the earnings and / or the employment opportunities of comparable native workers, and a positive effect on the earnings and / or the employment opportunities of complementary native workers (Dustmann et al., 2013; Borjas, 2017; and Borjas and Monras, 2017). We briefly return to this issue in the next paragraph. In Section 5 (“Measures of robustness”), we show that our results can hold even in the presence of these two effects. Moreover, in our benchmark model, the net wages of the low-income natives are already reduced because of the asylum seekers’ admission and integration tax paid by these natives. In fairness to the received literature, we also refer briefly to four related aspects brought up in that literature: a perception of an adverse effect of migration on the wages of low-income natives; the attitude of these natives towards migration; the tax burden incurred following the arrival of migrants; and the direct negative effect of migration on income distribution in the receiving economy. An eloquent representation of the first three aspects is in Mayda (2006). Out of these three aspects, the first two relate to skill-specific attitudes towards migration. It has been argued that when migrants are less skilled than natives, they reduce the relative supply of skilled labor to unskilled labor, which leads to an increase in the skilled wage and a decrease in the unskilled wage. The third aspect relates to public finances. In that context, an assumption has been made with regard to the response of the welfare state to migration: the arrival of unskilled migrants who are considered to be net claimants of welfare benefits calls for an adjustment in the financing of welfare costs (the tax burden) in order to balance the government’s budget. The associated assumption made in the received literature is that high-income natives are more negatively affected by unskilled migration than low-income natives because the former bear most of the additional cost of the welfare system. In contrast to these perspectives, we study an environment in which the opposite considerations arise: low-income natives can gain from the arrival of low-skill migrants, and high-income natives need not necessarily oppose the associated tax burden given the menu of alternative targets of the tax. Moreover, as modeled below, low-income natives can gain from the admission of migrants even when they share the associated tax burden. A fourth aspect alluded to in the received literature is that an inflow of low-wage migrants can directly worsen the distribution of incomes in the receiving economy (Blau and Kahn, 2015). This effect, however, will not negate the improvement in the natives’ wellbeing due to the weakening of the adverse effect of relative deprivation. An example can help clarify this point. Suppose that the incomes of the two natives are 2 and 3. Then, the Gini coefficient is 1/10, and the relative deprivation of the low-income native is 1/2, assuming that this relative deprivation is measured as in footnote 8 below (namely as the fraction of those whose incomes are higher, times their mean excess income). If an asylum seeker joins the population so that his admission and integration result in him obtaining income 1, the Gini coefficient increases from 1/10 to 2/9, but the relative deprivation of the low-income native decreases from 1/2 to 1/3. A wealth of evidence from field and laboratory studies in economics, social psychology, and neuroscience confirms that individuals routinely engage in, and are affected by, interpersonal comparisons. In particular, people are dissatisfied when their consumption or income levels are lower than those of others who constitute their comparison group. Studies that recognize such discontent are, among others, Stark and Taylor (1991), Zizzo and Oswald (2001), Luttmer (2005), Fliessbach et al. (2007), Blanchflower and Oswald (2008), Takahashi et al. (2009), Fan and Stark (2011), Stark and Fan (2011), Stark and Hyll (2011), Card et al. (2012), Stark et al. (2012), and Goerke and Pannenberg (2015). The overwhelming weight of the evidence supports the notion of a strong asymmetry: the comparisons that affect an individual’s sense of wellbeing significantly are the ones rendered by looking “up” the hierarchy, whereas looking “down” does not appear to be of much consequence or to deliver satisfaction. Cohn et al. (2014) find that in choosing their level of work effort, workers respond to increased relative deprivation but not to increased “relative satisfaction.” Frey and Stutzer (2002), Walker and Smith (2002), and Stark (2013) review a large body of evidence that lends support to the “upward comparison” hypothesis. Motivated by social space considerations, our analysis should be interpreted as adding a novel dimension rather than as constituting a negation of prevailing ones. Specifically, we hold constant a number of variables, and we ask how the social preferences of the low-income natives could be brought to bear on the decisions of whether to admit asylum seekers and, if yes, how many to admit. We are well aware that the list of repercussions of migration of all types is long, and that incorporating a good many of them could strengthen the case for admitting asylum seekers beyond the reduced relative deprivation modeled in this paper. (Low-skill migrants help to make markets denser, strengthen agglomeration economies, increase the returns on capital, stimulate investment, reduce the costs of non-traded services, and so on).Footnote 7 Yet the write up of a complete balance sheet, let alone quantification of its entries, are clearly outside the terms of reference of this paper.",2

Large literatures examine links between exchange rates and issues such as prices and price setting currencies [see e.g. Burstein and Gopinath (2014)], investments [see e.g. Goldberg (1993)] and stock market valuation of firms [see e.g. Dominguez and Tesar (2006)]. Not only the level of the exchange rate, but also its variability may affect a firm’s decision making. In a seminal contribution (Stigler 1939) showed that a firm that faces more variability may want to organize production in a way that sacrifices static efficiency to gain flexibility. Stigler’s intuition, together with the observation that more flexible work practices generally require more highly skilled labor [see e.g. Caroli and Van Reenen (2001), Thesmar and Thoenig (2000)] motivate our analysis of links between firm specific exchange rate variability and the skill composition of the labor force in these firms. We use matched employer–employee data covering the universe of private sector Swedish firms for 1998–2014 inclusive. These data are matched to firm-level customs data that include observations on each firm’s imports and exports across currency areas. With this rich data, we derive a risk index that measures each firm’s exposure to exchange rate shocks, which is a function of the firm’s trading activities across currency areas, and the magnitude of the variability of the exchange rate. Firms differ in their international composition of imports and exports and this gives us variation in exchange rate risk at the firm level: the risk index varies between firms and within firms over time. We use this variation to identify the effect of risk on skill composition at the firm level.Footnote 1 As a first test of the relationship between risk and skilled labor, we study firm-level effects within narrowly defined industrial sectors. Effects are positive throughout and non-trivial in magnitude when we consider the full population of firms with at least some international trade in the sample period. We find substantial effects for the tercile of firms with the highest trade share: for these firms, the estimated elasticity of a firm’s currency risk exposure from net trade on the firm’s share of skilled labor is 0.06. For manufacturing firms, the corresponding elasticity is 0.05. Given the variation of our measure of exchange rate risk, this suggests that a firm’s net exchange rate exposure has an important effect on the share of skilled labor employed by these firms. For example, for a given level of trade intensity, a manufacturing firm switching its exports and imports from Germany to the United States faces a 130% increase in exchange rate risk and would employ 7% higher share of labor with post-secondary education.Footnote 2 Identification of these first estimates relies on variation in the risk index and skill levels between firms as well as within firms over time. However, we observe that most of the variation in risk and skill is between firms, which suggests that the estimated effects are derived mainly from between-firm variation. This evidence is consistent with a view that the decision on what skill level to use, and what currency areas to trade with, are long run in nature with significant sunk costs. Even with a rich set of controls and high-quality register data a causal interpretation of the estimates partly derived from between-firm variation in risk should therefore be undertaken carefully. We therefore proceed to a specification that relies on within-firm variation in exchange rate risk to identify effects. To account for the time that it can take for firms to adjust their skill composition, given the relatively strong labor protection laws in Sweden, we examine 4-year periods. For the top tercile of trade intensive firms the effects are marked with an estimated elasticity of the share of high-skilled labor with respect to exchange rate risk of 0.07 and the associated increase in exchange rate risk associated with fully switching exports from Germany to the U.S. this would imply an increase in the share of high-skilled by some 9%. For an average firm with around 130 employees this is equivalent to replacing three low-skilled workers with three high-skilled workers. We parse the population into subsamples and find that the effect is particularly strong on the most trade intensive firms with fewer than 50 employees with an estimated elasticity of 0.1, or by some 13% for the thought experiment of fully switching from Germany to the U.S. as a trading partner. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to examine the links between exchange rate risk and the skill composition of labor. In a related study (Kaiser and Siegenthaler 2016) examine the effect of a first moment exchange rate shock on the composition of skilled labor at the firm. Using rich data from Switzerland they establish that an appreciation of the Swiss franc is associated with a higher share of skilled labor. In contrast, we study skill-biased organizational change under second moment shock. Nonetheless, we also identify the same effect from first moment shocks to Swedish firms. Our contribution is to establish a distinct effect of exchange rate risk on skill composition. We relate to a large literature that examines links between labor demand and a firm’s international engagement [see e.g. Bandick and Hansson (2009), Grossman (2013), Davidson et al. (2017), Malgouyres and Mayer (2018)]. Although are focus is on the role of risk, our results fit well with this literature. For instance we see that firms with a higher export share are more skill intensive. In the next section we outline the theoretical foundations for the predicted effects and discuss the related literature. Section 3 describes the data and the risk indices that we compute. We discuss the empirical specification in Sect. 4 and then turn to results in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes.",
156,2,Review of World Economics,23 September 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-019-00364-z,Two worlds apart? Export demand shocks and domestic sales,May 2020,Aksel Erbahar,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Exporters generally serve at least two markets: home and foreign. Traditional heterogeneous firms and trade models such as Melitz (2003) and Chaney (2008) predict no causal relationship between firms’ exports and domestic sales in the short-run (abstracting from general-equilibrium effects). By analyzing the relationship between sales in different markets at the firm-product level, this paper seeks to identify the channels that link exports and domestic sales. This question is important mainly due to two reasons. First, the traditional trade models’ assumption of profit maximization with perfectly segmented markets and constant marginal costs might not be correct, leading to misleading trade liberalization effects on firm-level adjustments such as productivity gains. Second, understanding the link between firms’ sales in different markets can help policymakers alleviate the negative consequences of cross-border business cycle transmissions. To examine the mechanism that links firms’ sales at home and abroad, I use a detailed dataset on Turkish firms for the 2005–2014 period that allows me to match firms’ product-level sales data with product-level exports. First, I instrument firm-level exports with destination-product-year specific imports from the world to proxy for exogenous demand shocks. I find that an exogenous 10% rise in exports increases a firm’s domestic sales by 2.6% on average, confirming the findings of Berman et al. (2015) for French firms. However, unlike Berman et al. (2015), I find that this effect exists for Turkey’s large firms as well, albeit with a lower magnitude when compared to the effect for small firms. The finding that there is a positive causal relationship between sales in different markets is useful to predict aggregate firm-level sales dynamics, but it is not sufficient to understand the mechanism that transmits these shocks. The literature identifies three main channels that can explain the relationship between firms’ sales in different markets: (i) capacity constraints at the firm-product level that would generate a negative relationship, (ii) liquidity constraints at the firm level that would generate a positive relationship, and (iii) efficiency gains that can be both at the firm and firm-product level that would generate a positive relationship. This type of efficiency or productivity gains is also known as “learning by exporting” in the heterogeneous firms and trade literature, whereby some firms increase their productivity once they begin exporting. In the short-run, this third channel is likely due to increasing returns to scale at the firm-product level, where an exogenous demand shock would cause the firm to move along its (non-constant) marginal cost curve.Footnote 1 To identify the mechanism described above, I first differentiate between the firm and firm-product channels. In order to achieve this, I use firm-year fixed effects and examine the relationship between firms’ sales in different markets at the firm-product level, and find coefficients that are almost twice as large as the ones found in the firm level regressions, hinting to the importance of product-specific scale effects. This result is robust to a battery of sensitivity analyses using alternative controls, samples, and multiple instruments. Then, following Bernard et al. (2019), who show the prevalence of carry-along trade (CAT) for Belgian firms, I separate Turkish exporters’ foreign sales into produced versus non-produced (or CAT) exports, and show that the complementary relationship is also due to CAT exports. Assuming that liquidity constraints operate at the firm level (not at the firm-product level), and that exogenous changes in CAT exports affect firms through a financial channel, combined with the finding that the relationship between sales is strongest for smaller firms suggest that spillovers at the firm level such as the easing of liquidity constraints also play a role.Footnote 2 In the process, by examining produced and CAT exports separately, I propose a novel approach to isolate the production versus non-production factors that influence firm dynamics. Moreover, I show that export demand shocks influence firms’ employment, wages per employee, and investment decisions as in Lileeva and Trefler (2010) and Bustos (2011). In the final part of the paper, I follow di Giovanni et al. (2018) and Héricourt and Nedoncelle (2018) to quantify the effect of exogenous export demand shocks at the aggregate level. My estimates indicate that variations in export demand can explain about 1.4% of the annual variation in Turkish domestic sales. This figure, which shows heterogeneities at the sector level, rises to 4.6% during the Great Recession in 2009, when demand in Turkey’s key export partners collapsed and credit supply shrank. This paper is mainly related to two strands of the heterogeneous firms and trade literature. First, it is related to the growing literature on the relationship between exports and domestic sales. Berman et al. (2015), using French firm-level data, find that firms’ exports and domestic sales are complements, not substitutes. More precisely, they find that an exogenous 10% increase in a firm’ exports increases its domestic sales by 1–3% in the short-run. Even though they show suggestive evidence that the link between sales might be due to liquidity constraints, they cannot identify the precise channel since they do not observe sales at the firm-product level. Almunia et al. (2018), on the other hand, find that Spanish firms whose domestic sales were negatively affected by the Great Recession increased their exports, and explain this “venting-for-surplus” phenomenon by building a Melitz-type model with non-constant marginal costs.Footnote 3 Bugamelli et al. (2015) use Italian firm-level data to find a business-cycle dependent correlation (not causation) between exports and domestic sales. Overall, these results are contrary to what is predicted by traditional trade models such as Melitz (2003) and Chaney (2008) which project that exogenous shocks to one export-market should have no effect on that firm’s sales to other markets in the short-run. Other papers that examine the effects of foreign shocks on firms include Ekholm et al. (2012) who find that Norwegian firms that were more exposed to the appreciation of the Krone restructured manufacturing, and Hummels et al. (2014) who find that positive export shocks caused Danish firms to pay higher wages.Footnote 4 However, these papers are mostly silent about the channel of transmission as they lack firm-product data, and thus cannot observe product-market segmentation. My paper first confirms the findings of Berman et al. (2015) at the firm level using a different context, and then contributes to the literature by finding that export demand shocks influence domestic sales positively at the firm-product level as well, with a larger magnitude. The firm-product specifications that shut down the firm factors by firm-year fixed effects reveal a strong link, and thus give support to scale effects. Nevertheless, the positive effect of CAT exports on domestic sales suggests that factors unrelated to production (e.g. liquidity constraints) also contribute to the link between sales in different markets. As revealed by the quantification exercise, the results are informative as in a world that is increasingly integrated through supply-chains, exogenous foreign demand shocks can have large spillover effects in home countries. When these shocks are negative, firms’ sales to their home market can be adversely affected as well, hinting to policy recommendations that encourage product-market diversification. Second, by analyzing the relationship between firms’ sales in different markets, this paper is related to a growing literature that seeks to deduce firms’ cost structures. Papers in this literature argue that the constant marginal cost assumption made by traditional trade models might not be correct due to, for example, capacity constraints which would entail increasing marginal costs. Vannoorenberghe (2012), Soderbery (2014), Ahn and McQuoid (2017), and Almunia et al. (2018) suggest that firms might have increasing marginal costs that generate a substitutable relationship between sales in different markets. A model with liquidity constraints, on the other hand, can produce a complementary relation between sales in different markets. This is what is proposed by Berman et al. (2015) as an explanation for their finding: an exogenous increase in exports allows the firm use the surplus cash-flow to expand domestic operations by causing a downward shift in the firm’s marginal cost curve. Models of firm dynamics with liquidity constraints such as the ones developed by Cooley and Quadrini (2001) and Kohn et al. (2016) would also predict a positive relationship between exports and domestic sales due to cash flow fluctuations.Footnote 5 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data. In Sect. 3, I explain the empirical identification strategy to analyze the effect of export demand shocks on domestic sales, as well as the strategy to identify the channels that link firms’ sales in different markets. Section 4 shows the results with robustness checks, and provides a quantification exercise. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",9
156,2,Review of World Economics,21 September 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-019-00365-y,"Machine imports, technology adoption, and local spillovers",May 2020,Gábor Békés,Péter Harasztosi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Capital goods, machines and manufacturing technologies are produced in a few developed economies. Countries who do take part in developing these technologies can benefit from them via knowledge spillovers as suggested by endogenous growth theories which highlight the external nature of technology (see Romer 1990; Rivera-Batiz and Romer 1991). For developing countries, who do not produce manufacturing technology themselves, a key vehicle for spillovers and growth are imports. Indeed, Coe and Helpman (1995), Acharya and Keller (2009) find large spillover effects from imports from foreign, R&D-abundant countries on domestic productivity at the aggregate and sector levels. Importing technology embedded in machines, materials leads to increased productivity also at the level of the firm (see Halpern et al. 2013, 2015). This paper looks at how accumulated knowledge of machine imports affects new adoptions and dissects channels of this spillover. Focusing on the imports of machines allows to gain a better understanding on a possible source of productivity gains and development. In particular, we investigate how investment to a particular machine may be encouraged by earlier imports of the same machine carried out by local firms. As more and more local firms have imported a particular machine, the easier it is for another firm to be informed about the advantages and the specifics of the technology. In addition, if the machine is available from many countries, firms learn whether it is worth substituting a machine from one country with one from another. If these learning channels are at work, we hypothesize that in the absence of peers a firm would be less inclined to import a given machine or it would import it much later. To answer these questions, we compile a dataset that matches machine level import observations to Hungarian manufacturing firms for 1992–2003. The period provides several advantages. It starts with Hungary’s early transition years, prior to which foreign machine was not generally available to domestic firms. Possibly, every machine imported in the early 1990s can be regarded as technologically more modern and more advanced than previously installed machines. In addition, the transition invited waves of foreign direct investments, which introduced new imported machines and technology to many sectors. This is not only true for green-field investment, but also for a portion of the privatized companies as well where firms upgraded their production facilities through imports. In the examined period, foreign machines indeed play an important role in manufacturing investments. The share of machine investment of manufacturing firms is over 60%, see Fig. 6 in the Appendix. Our results indicate that the presence of a previous importer of a specific machine in the close vicinity increases the probability of a firm importing the same machine. The presence of such peers within 1 km of the firm increases import probability by 0.3 percentage points. This effect decreases with the distance of the peers and increases in the number of peers. An additional peer within 1 km of the firm increases the probability of same machine import by 0.27 percentage points. Compared to the baseline probability of machine import, peer presence suggests a 26% increase. We also investigate how the decision about the country from which the chosen machine is to be imported from is influenced by peer presence. The results show that firms tend to import a particular machine from the country with 0.6 percentage points higher probability if there is a firm in the vicinity which have already imported the machine from the same country. There is great deal of evidence suggesting that the extent of knowledge spillovers varies by key features of both the receiver and the sender. To better understand the nature of the spillovers we will hence, investigate the heterogeneity of both the importing firms and that of the early importing peers. Our analysis suggests spillovers go from more to less productive firms, as local first importers of a specific machine are more productive than followers. We also find that the probability of choosing the machine that others have already imported in the vicinity is higher if the firm is exporter, larger in size, foreign owned or more recently established. Regarding the heterogeneity of peers, we see much smaller differences as the importing probably is somewhat higher when peers are of medium size, foreign owned, exporter and more recently established. This study contributes by broadening the scope of spillovers in trade behavior in showing that they not only encourage exporting behavior but can affect the importing technology embedded in machines. We build on previous findings in the trade spillover literature. For exporters, empirical evidence suggests that location can be an important factor influencing internationalization. Agglomeration economies can help firms overcome up-front costs and engage in trade.Footnote 1 Benefits arise from sharing indivisible goods and facilities and a larger variety of more specialized inputs, from better matching of the right employment or intermediate inputs and services and from learning and the diffusion of knowledge about, e.g., production technologies and market opportunities (Duranton and Puga 2004). A positive effect of agglomeration for exports was documented in Mexico (Aitken et al. 1997; Cardoso-Vargas 2017), in Argenina (Pupato 2007) in France (Koenig et al. 2010) in Belgium (Dumont et al. 2010) in China (Fernandes and Tang 2014; Mayneris and Poncet 2015) and in Hungary (Harasztosi 2016). There is ample evidence on the productivity enhancing effect of imports also at the firm level.Footnote 2 The sources of these positive effects can be different mechanisms. Some explain the increased productivity with the technology embedded in the inputs and the wide variety imports make accessible (Halpern et al. 2015; Goldberg et al. 2010; Bas and Strauss-Kahn 2014). Others highlight the R&D-generating nature of imports. MacGarvie (2006), e.g., uses patent citations to show that importing firms are more likely to generate new patents. More recently, Halpern et al. (2013) shed light on the productivity-enhancing effect of the imported technology on machines. Despite the advantages only a fraction of firms import. For firms to be able to trade internationally, they need to be competitive and highly productive. This is often explained by the sizable up-front cost that only the most productive ones can afford. See, e.g., Bernard and Jensen (1999), Bernard et al. (2007), Amiti and Konings (2007) or Castellani et al. (2010). Also, future trading firms are already bigger, employ more skilled and better paid workers and are more capital intensive than their peers in the same sector who do not trade. We know little about the effect of agglomeration on importing activity at the firm level, especially for capital items, even though importers may face a harder challenge than exporters. First, evidence suggests that the productivity premium needed to start importing is higher than in the case of exporting (Altomonte and Békés 2010). Second, while exporters often experiment their profitability on foreign markets for a year or two (Eaton et al. 2011), machine importers make long term investment decisions which might result in a higher fixed cost. Firms deciding to invest in an imported technology face the screening cost of potential foreign suppliers, the cost of the technology itself and adapting equipment to foreign conditions and standards. They also require information about the skill requirements for workers and operating difficulties (see Eaton and Kortum 2001; Bas and Berthou 2012). While this information may be available via the manufacturer, local industry experience with a given machine may also prove beneficial and encourage adoption. Recent empirical evidence for Sweden suggests positive local effect of peers on import activity (Pateli 2016). There is also evidence on the effect of peers on the country choice of Hungarian importers located in the capital city, as shown by (Bisztray et al. 2018) for a smaller set of countries. There is some evidence at the firm level that the characteristics of the location affect the adoption of advanced machines.Footnote 3 These studies, however, do not relate machine adoption to trade activity. They suggest that the rate and beneficial effects of technology diffusion differ across location characteristics: regions distant from the innovation leader adopt the technology much later, while successful adoption depends on other location characteristics such as the level of existing knowledge and technology, the absorption capacity of the location and the availability of a skilled workforce. Kelley and Helper (1999) show a positive effect of localized economies on the numerically controlled machine adoption of U.S. firms. Also, No (2008) takes a similar approach and investigates the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies (design, fabrication and inspection) across Canadian firms.Footnote 4 The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2, which discusses empirical strategy is followed by Sect. 3 introducing the dataset. It gives details on data compilation and the construction of the main variables and portrays spatial distribution of machine imports. Section 4 discusses the results, limitations and offers additional insights into the sources and heterogeneity of the spillovers. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",5

After all, Rose was right",May 2020,Silviano Esteve-Pérez,Salvador Gil-Pareja,Rafael Llorca-Vivero,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Over the last 70 years the GATT and its successor from 1995, the WTO, have sponsored nine rounds of trade-policy negotiations that have successfully reduced trade barriers and contributed to a more transparent and predictable environment for world trade. Up to the early 2000s there was a broad consensus on the important role played by GATT/WTO in promoting international trade. However, in a seminal empirical contribution, Rose (2004) reported the striking finding that countries acceding or belonging to the GATT/WTO did not have significantly different trade patterns than non-members. This contradiction between the conventional view and Rose’s results led him to describe this finding as an “interesting mystery” (p. 112) that deserved further research. Ever since, a considerable number of studies have attempted to solve this puzzle by updating Rose’s dataset, accounting for potential sources of omitted variables bias, using alternative econometric techniques, taking into account the margins of trade (extensive and intensive) or splitting the sample by groups of countries, periods and sectors. A review of the literature reveals that there has been an intense debate on this issue over more than a decade.Footnote 1 The empirical work relies on different specifications of the gravity equation. While some papers confirm Rose’s finding (Eicher and Henn 2011; Roy 2011), and there exists a large heterogeneity in the results across group of countries and periods, most papers find that, as a whole, the GATT/WTO has had a trade promoting effect in line with the aforementioned consensus view. Tomz et al. (2007), Liu (2009), Chang and Lee (2011), Herz and Wagner (2011), Dutt et al. (2013), Cheong et al. (2014), Kohl and Trojanowska (2015), Kohl (2015), and Gil-Pareja et al. (2016) find evidence of such a trade-enhancing effect. Moreover, other papers find evidence of a positive effect but limited to some groups of countries, sectors or periods (Subramanian and Wei 2007; Felbermayr and Kohler 2010; and Bista 2015).Footnote 2 In parallel with this literature, several authors have focused on seeking the proper econometric specification for the gravity equation. Glick and Rose (2002), Egger and Pfaffermayr (2003), Chen and Wall (2005) or Baier and Bergstrand (2007) illustrate the importance of including time-invariant country-pair fixed effects to control for unobservable bilateral heterogeneity and endogeneity.Footnote 3 Baier and Bergstrand (2007) and Baldwin and Taglioni (2007) suggest that the gravity equation should also include exporter-time and importer-time fixed effects to control for changes in multilateral resistance terms (Anderson and van Wincoop 2003). Last but not least, Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006, 2010a) propose to use the Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood estimator (PPML, hereafter) to deal with econometric problems resulting from heteroskedastic residuals and the prevalence of zeros in bilateral trade flows.Footnote 4 Despite the fact that the available empirical literature on the effect of GATT/WTO on trade has progressively improved the econometric specifications to account for potential sources of bias, computational issues have so far conditioned the choice of estimator. The large datasets used in the estimation of the GATT/WTO effect (requiring to compute three different types of high-dimensional fixed effects) and/or difficulties to achieve convergence have precluded accounting simultaneously for unobserved bilateral heterogeneity and endogeneity (with country-pair fixed effects), multilateral resistance terms (with exporter-time and importer-time fixed effects), heteroskedastic residuals and zero trade flows.Footnote 5 However, recently Correia et al. (2019) have provided a new Stata command (ppmlhdfe) for fast estimation of (pseudo) Poisson regression models with multiple high dimensional fixed effects, allowing accounting for all above issues in large datasets.Footnote 6 This paper uses the computational development brought about by Correia et al. (2019) to estimate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the GATT/WTO effect on trade using the PPML estimator with the aforementioned three types of (high-dimensional) fixed effects. We carry out the estimations employing a dataset that includes trade flows between more than 200 countries over the period 1948–2013. Therefore, we need to compute more than 50,000 fixed effects to obtain unbiased and theory-consistent estimates. Our findings suggest that when we estimate the gravity equation with PPML including the full set of high-dimensional fixed effect, the (direct) positive GATT/WTO trade effect vanishes, which is in line with Rose (2004). Interestingly, in contrast to the results for the GATT/WTO, we find strong support for the positive effect of regional trade agreements and currency unions on bilateral trade flows. This result holds using different measures of trade flows, across country groups and time periods for alternative classification criteria, and when including lags in the regression. The results are also robust to changes in the periodicity of the data, to controlling for the participation of only one country in GATT/WTO and to accounting for nonmember participants à la Tomz et al. (2007), as well as to the use of alternative datasets. It is worth noting that these results are based on total trade flows, which put more weight on large bilateral trade flows and possibly hide positive effects for small countries. Indeed, we find evidence in favour of this intuition when we estimate PPML on trade shares. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the methodology. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents and discusses the results and Sect. 5 includes a set of robustness checks. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",15

However, empirical evidence on this so-called “learning by exporting” (LBE) has been mixed at best (for example, Keller 2004; Wagner 2007). Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that LBE is far from a general phenomenon, but is conditional on several factors including room for technological catch-up (Blalock and Gertler 2004; van Biesebroeck 2005), exports destination (De Loecker 2007) or the scope of exported goods and exports destinations (Masso and Vahter 2015). This paper explores how LBE is shaped by the types of exports, each associated with participation in different segments of global value chains (GVCs). Over the past three decades, the decline in trade, transportation and communication costs have allowed firms to fragment production processes and tasks globally, giving rise to global value chains and magnified trade volume (Baldwin 2012; Amador and Cabral 2016). Intermediate goods and services incorporated at various stages of the production process comprise more than 60 per cent of global trade (World Bank 2019). Yet, empirical evidence on the implication of GVCs to LBE is so far scant.
 Case studies on GVCs have documented that GVC participation offers firms, especially from emerging economies, opportunities to absorb knowledge transfer through interaction with global buyers such as multinational enterprises (MNEs) (Gereffi 1999; Giuliani et al. 2005; Simona and Axèle 2012; Atkin et al. 2017). This notion of “learning by supplying” (Alcacer and Oxley 2014) is close to the concept of LBE. Exporters supplying highly complex or customised goods or services to GVCs may enjoy closer interaction and thus stronger knowledge transfer from global buyers. As a result, they may realise larger productivity gains than exporters supplying generic or standardised goods or services. GVC studies have also highlighted uneven distribution of value added among GVC participants (Gereffi 1999; Kaplinsky 2000; Dedrick et al. 2010). For instance, the participants supplying knowledge-intensive inputs such as core components or research and development services often create disproportionally larger value added than those supplying generic goods or services, such as assembly services. These participants also enjoy stronger bargaining power over other participants, thereby gaining larger profit margins. These observations suggest that exporters of knowledge-intensive goods or services realise larger productivity gains.
 We use a matched firm-level dataset of Estonian and Latvian firms to test the above hypotheses. We examine whether LBE is stronger for some types of exports that involve stronger interactions with global buyers and are associated with activities that generate high value added within GVCs. We indeed find that exports of non-transport services and re-exports result in significantly larger productivity gains than exports of final goods. Although activities that generate high value added are often considered to be those located in upstream or far downstream segments of GVCs (for example, Baldwin 2012), we find that exporters from upstream or far downstream industries do not enjoy larger productivity gains. Our findings suggest that LBE in GVCs is defined by the scope of knowledge transfer and not by the positioning of an industry within a value chain. This study adds several novel perspectives to the existing research on learning by exporting. First, it is a first attempt to capture LBE in the context of GVCs by exploring the heterogeneity of LBE that stems from the difference in exporters’ role within GVCs. Second, it employs the estimation method by De Loecker (2013), which allows export status to affect a firm’s total factor productivity (TFP) endogenously, in contrast to the majority of the previous studies on LBE that assume that TFP levels are determined exogenously from exporting.Footnote 1 Third, the inclusion of service exporters relates this paper to a relatively small number of studies that use service trade firm-level data (such as Breinlich and Criscuolo 2011; Malchow-Moller et al. 2015). Latvia and Estonia are suitable countries for studying the effect of exports and GVC participation on productivity, not least for their considerable room for productivity catch-up against the most advanced OECD economies (OECD 2018, 2019). Due to the small size of their economies, access to foreign markets is essential for their firms to take advantage of economies of scale and to make major qualitative changes such as upgrading technologies or improving skills. Past studies have indeed found supportive evidence of LBE for both countries (Masso and Vahter 2015). Also, higher productivity is particularly important for the competitiveness of these economies, as labour shortages due to international outward migration and population ageing fuel strong upward pressure in wage growth (OECD 2018, 2019). The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 formulates several hypotheses on LBE in the context of GVCs through a brief review of GVC literature. Section 3 describes data and provides some descriptive statistics. Section 4 explores the determinants of export entry and estimates the impact of entry to different types of exports on firm productivity by applying the difference-in-difference analysis. Section 5 provides a conclusion.",17
156,3,Review of World Economics,08 January 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-019-00372-z,"International trade, quality sorting and trade costs: the case of Cognac",August 2020,Charlotte Emlinger,Viola Lamani,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"It is well known since the seminal works of Krugman (1979) and Lancaster (1980) that international trade flows are not only composed of different products, but also of similar products either horizontally or vertically differentiated. The latter type of trade is based on an objective product differentiation, where a good is considered qualitatively superior to another and recognized as such by all consumers. While trade liberalization policies have contributed to the intensification of these trade flows, trade costs continue to play an important role as determinants of the volumes and quality of traded goods. The impact of trade costs, whether natural (i.e. transportation costs) or policy-related (i.e. tariffs), on the quality structure of international trade flows has been examined extensively by both theoretical and empirical studies (Falvey 1979; Curzi and Olper 2012; Curzi et al. 2015). In this respect, a key pillar in the theoretical literature, yet less documented empirically, is the Alchian and Allen effect. This effect, first highlighted by Alchian and Allen in 1964, stipulates that per-unit transportation costs increase the relative demand for higher quality goods. This point gave rise to several theoretical analyses (Borcherding and Silberberg 1978; Razzolini et al. 2003; Bauman 2004; Baldwin and Harrigan 2011; Sorensen 2014; Irarrazabal et al. 2015), but to seldom empirical verifications. The main challenge of empirical analyses of the Alchian and Allen effect resides in having (or rather lacking) an objective measure of product quality. The vast majority of the existing empirical research on the quality mix relies on an indirect measure of quality that is either based on unit values (Hummels and Skiba 2004; Schott 2004; Hummels and Klenow 2005) or derived from an econometric estimation (Khandelwal 2010; Amiti and Khandelwal 2013; Khandelwal et al. 2013). The use of the former, albeit being straightforward and easily implementable—higher unit values indicate higher quality—suffers from a major drawback. Indeed, differences in unit values do not necessarily reflect differences in product quality. They could be the result of higher production costs or higher margins related to market power. To circumvent this issue and produce more precise estimates of product quality, alternative measures have been developed more recently. One of the most cited was proposed by Khandelwal (2010), who estimates a model that captures the mean valuation that consumers attach to an imported product by using both unit value and quantity information. In this paper, we focus on Cognac to analyze the impact of trade costs on the quality of traded goods. Cognac is an authentic spirit whose elaboration is rooted in traditional practices and must conform to a strict legal framework. Its production involves a multi-stage process including ageing which leads to three distinguishable grades or designations based on the minimum time in oak of the youngest eau-de-vieFootnote 1 used in creating the blend. Cognac’s ageing is closely supervised by the Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (BNIC), and Cognac Houses (Maisons de Cognac) must comply with this age-based rule when commercializing their bottles. These designations are defined based on a measurable, objective and time-invariant criterion, making a compelling case for concentrating on Cognac to analyze the impact of trade costs on the quality mix of exports. We test the validity of the Alchian and Allen effect by exploiting both the cross-sectional and time-serial dimensions of trade costs. More specifically, we first estimate the impact of the cross-sectional variation of trade costs through distance and tariffs, using a unique database of Cognac exports by volume, destination and quality designations to more than 100 destinations worldwide, and a database of customs protection from 1996 to 2013. Second, we evaluate the impact of a reduction in trade costs over time as a result of the technological revolution in maritime transport following the adoption of containerization. Contrary to indirect measures, Cognac designations are clearly distinguishable from each other based on the ageing system. Obviously, this measure does not suffer from drawbacks of proxies such as unit values, but it does not guarantee that the consumers’ perception of Cognac quality differs across designations. We thus explore this possibility in our analysis by checking whether the different Cognac designations correspond to different perceived qualities estimated using the Khandelwal et al. (2013) methodology. We conclude that Cognac designations are not only objectively different from one another, but also recognized as such by consumers. Cognac’s designations prove therefore to be a unique and direct measure of product quality. A similar direct approach to product quality has been adopted by Crozet et al. (2012) who examine the structure of Champagne export flows based on experts’ ratings. Contrary to theirs, our measure is not based on subjective judgment and it is therefore more appropriate for conducting a study over time. Our work contributes to the literature on trade costs and their impact on product quality. As we said above, despite distinguished theoretical studies, empirical work on the subject remains relatively scarce. Moreover, the majority of papers studying the effects of trade costs estimate the impact of transportation charges (usually distance) and/or customs duties on unit values, using either country-level data (Schott 2004, 2008; Hummels and Klenow 2005; Baldwin and Harrigan 2011) or firm-level data (Bastos and Silva 2010; Manova and Zhang 2009; Martin 2012). Instead of using unit values to define a product’s quality, in this paper, we estimate the impact of distance and customs duties on the quality mix of Cognac exports based on an objective definition of quality. Our paper also relates to the literature on luxury goods. Indeed, Cognac is a luxury product, based on Fogarty’s (2010) estimations of the income-elasticity of demand for spirits. Moreover, important Cognac Houses, e.g. Martell and Rémy Martin, belong to the famous list of the Comité Colbert, an association of 75 French luxury brands, founded in 1954 by Jean-Jacques Guerlain to promote the concept of luxury. Among the different papers on trade of luxury goods, Fontagné and Hatte (2013) estimate a gravity equation of high-end products and find that exports of these products are less sensitive to distance and more sensitive to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of destination countries than other products. For their part, Martin and Mayneris (2016) conclude that high-end variety exporters are mainly characterized by more distant markets on average, and that this goes hand in hand with a wider geographic diversification of their exports. This study is also related to the literature on the economic impact of containerization. The adoption of containerization (i.e. the method of shipping goods via containers) revolutionized shipping methods in the 20th century. According to Hummels (2007), it is one of the major postwar technological changes in ocean transport. The use of containers in different modes of transport (ship, rail or truck) made possible for goods to be shipped to distant destinations “without being unpacked and repacked” (Hummels 2007, p. 141). The overall quality of transportation improved, productivity of dock labor increased, and insurance costs dropped. Intermodal transport also reduced the speed of delivery. The trade and transport facilitation brought by containerization has been well documented in the literature (Levinson 2006), but only a few studies have quantified empirically the effects of the shipping container.Footnote 2 To the extent of our knowledge, we are the first to analyze empirically the impact of containerization on trade flows by quality, based on Rua’s (2014) and Bernhofen, El-Sahli, and Kneller’s (2016) data on the first port containerized by country. The contribution of this article is threefold. First, we validate empirically the Alchian and Allen effect based on a direct and “physical” measure of product quality. Second, we assess empirically the impact of customs protection on trade flows by quality by distinguishing between per-unit and ad-valorem tariffs. Third, we evaluate empirically the impact on the quality mix of the reduction in trade costs brought by containerization during an extensive period of time, covering forty-five years of Cognac export flows. The paper is organized as follows. First, we review the theoretical and empirical literature on the Alchian and Allen theorem. Section 3 presents our original database of Cognac exports and gives details on the different quality designations. In a fourth section, we perform an econometric estimation on the share of high quality Cognac exports to different countries. In Sect. 5 we test empirically the impact of containerization on the Cognac quality mix. Finally, in Sect. 6 we conclude.",11
156,3,Review of World Economics,07 February 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-020-00373-3,Learning-by-doing and business cycles in emerging economies,August 2020,Akihiko Ikeda,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The role of learning-by-doing in emerging economies has received increasing attention as their presence in the global economy grows, while the existence of the mechanism still seems controversial. Lucas (1993) suggests that learning-by-doing may best explain rapid growth (“miracles”) of several emerging economies. Recent studies also emphasize its usefulness in analyzing capital inflows, resource allocations across sectors, or reserve accumulation policies in emerging economies (e.g., Rodrick 2008; Aizenman and Lee 2010; Benigno and Fornaro 2012, 2014; Korinek and Servén 2016; Alberola and Benigno 2017). In contrast, Young (1993) argues that emerging economies cannot benefit from learning-by-doing effects as much as developed economies, as the learning process is specific to sectors with advanced technologies. Martin and Rogers (2000) empirically confirm Young’s (1993) conclusion by considering the relationship between economic growth and business cycles. Furthermore, growth accounting studies by Young (1995) and Fernald and Neiman (2011) show that factor accumulation is more important than productivity growth in explaining Asian miracles,Footnote 1 which contradicts Lucas’ (1993) view. This paper examines the importance of learning-by-doing in emerging economies from yet another perspective. The focus is on the features regarding the two business cycle moments, namely, large volatility of consumption relative to that of output and high countercyclicality of net exports, which have been examined in recent business cycle studies (e.g., Aguiar and Gopinath 2007; Uribe and Schmitt-Grohé 2017). They are considered as key moments in analyzing emerging economies, since the former moment contrasts with developed economies’ well-known smoothness of consumption (e.g., Campbell and Deaton 1989), and the latter one is closely related to the former. Though Aguiar and Gopinath’s (2007) model (henceforth, the “AG model”) explains these features by exogenous shocks to trend growth (“trend productivity shocks”), empirical observation suggests the importance of endogenous factors. That is, there exist correlations between business cycle moments and average growth rates in the data. Table 1 shows the regression results of economic growth and business cycles.Footnote 2 According to specification 1 in the table, there is a positive relationship between relative volatility of consumption with respect to output and average output growth rates, growth. That is, the coefficient of growth is 41.23 and significant at the 5% level. The coefficients are also positive and significant in specifications from 2 to 4. Specification 5 shows a negative relationship between the cyclicality of trade balance–output ratio and average output growth rates (the coefficient of growth is − 26.47 and significant at the 5% level). The coefficient is also negative and significant in specifications from 6 to 8. As Martin and Rogers (2000) point out, learning-by-doing is related to both economic growth and business cycles. Hence, the existence of their significant correlation might suggest the possibility of learning-by-doing playing an important role in the cross-country difference in business cycles features. Considering these features, the model of this paper introduces learning-by-doing to endogenously generate changes in trend growth. This model (henceforth the “LBD model”) can effectively replicate the aforementioned business cycle regularities in emerging economies in a similar way as the AG model. Since Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) state that a standard small open economy real business cycle (RBC) models such as Mendoza’s (1991) with transitory shocks are suitable for developed economies, I also compare the results with the RBC model. Figure 1 summarizes the intuition of the LBD model. The persistence of a transitory productivity shock (“Transitory shock” in the figure) is enhanced by learning-by-doing (“LBD” in the figure), which impacts the household’s expectation of permanent income. The change in expectation significantly influences the household’s consumption, which leads to high relative volatility of consumption and highly countercyclical net exports (“Volatile consumption” and “Countercyclical NX” in the figure). This effect is similar to that of trend productivity shock (“Trend shock” in the figure) in the AG model. The LBD model is different from the AG model, however, in that it entails an endogenous growth effect. That is, when the effect of learning-by-doing is larger, the mean output growth rate also becomes higher (“High growth rate” in the figure). Hence, the LBD model predicts specific patterns of correlations between mean output growth rate and relative volatility of consumption or countercyclicality of net exports (“Correlations” in the figure), which the AG or RBC model does not. Growth and business cycles in the LBD model. This figure summarizes the concept of the LBD model. Learning-by-doing (“LBD”) can generate large relative volatility of consumption and countercyclical net exports (“NX”) observed in emerging economies by enhancing the persistence of transitory productivity shocks. It can also generate specific patterns of correlations between these moments and the output growth rates observed in the data through endogenous growth I conduct empirical examination of the model with the Bayesian method to evaluate the performance and to compare the importance of learning-by-doing in emerging and developed economies. I use the data of Mexico and Canada as the examples of those economies, which were previously analyzed by Aguiar and Gopinath (2007). The estimation results suggest that combined with transitory productivity shocks, the learning-by-doing mechanism outperforms the trend productivity shocks in the AG model. That is, the LBD model can replicate the business cycle moments as well as the AG model, and the predictive performance measured by the log marginal likelihood is better than that of the AG model. When estimated with data of a developed economy, the rate of learning-by-doing is estimated to be smaller, and the LBD model yields results similar to those of the RBC model, which performs best in this case. That is, the LBD model can describe both emerging and developed economies by altering the value of the learning rate. In addition, the LBD model yields results that are consistent with the empirical fact on the relationships between growth and cycles shown in Table 1. With these observations, I conclude that learning-by-doing is a source of difference in key business cycle moments, and plays an essential role particularly in emerging economies. Understanding the difference between emerging and developed economies from such a structural perspective could help explain why business cycle features change as an economy develops. That is, the change in relative volatility of consumption and trade balance countercyclicality would be attributed to a decline in the learning rate during development. This study is related to three strands of the literature. One comprises studies on the learning-by-doing mechanism. The mechanism has been introduced in both economic growth (e.g., Arrow 1962; Romer 1986) and business cycle models (e.g., Chang et al. 2002; Cooper and Johri 2002). It is known as an endogenous growth factor in the former models, and as an endogenous shock propagation mechanism in the latter, since it can enhance the persistence of productivity shocks. Both these aspects are considered in this paper. The second strand of the literature studies the business cycle features in emerging economies that are different from those of developed economies (e.g., Aguiar and Gopinath 2007; Uribe and Schmitt-Grohé 2017). Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) attribute these regularities to trend productivity shocks. Many studies, however, propose other factors, such as interest rate shocks (e.g., Neumeyer and Perri 2005; García-Cicco et al. 2010), financial frictions (e.g., García-Cicco et al. 2010; Mendoza 2010; Jeanne and Korinek 2010; Bianchi 2011; Chang and Fernández 2013; Fernández and Gulan 2015; Ikeda 2017; Akinci and Charhrour 2018), or information on the trend (Boz et al. 2011). The third strand of studies investigates the relationship between economic growth and business cycles (e.g., Bean 1990; Saint-Paul 1993; Ramey and Ramey 1995; Martin and Rogers 2000). As mentioned above, Martin and Rogers (2000) examine the existence of learning-by-doing by considering the relationship between growth and cycles. This study combines their idea with the business cycle regularities in emerging economies noted in the second strand of literature. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the formulations of the models. Section 3 describes the estimation method. Section 4 shows the estimation results and conducts several simulation analyses. Section 5 concludes.",1

Koska,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It is widely reported in the empirical trade literature that changes in international trade costs substantially affect firm-level decisions on trade, on foreign direct investment (FDI), and on both horizontal and vertical product differentiation; see Atkeson and Burstein (2010). Modeling both horizontal and vertical product differentiation in a differentiated Cournot duopoly market, this study scrutinizes the implications of upstream market power (for high-quality inputs) on a downstream firm’s endogenous choice of foreign market entry mode and product quality. The endogenous choice of product quality is modeled as the choice of an input supplier. While low-quality inputs are provided by a perfectly competitive upstream industry and lead to low-quality differentiated products, both high-quality exports and subsidiary sales (the latter of which warrants also vertical intra-industry trade) require high-quality inputs supplied by a monopoly upstream firm, and thus are costly. In such an environment, the paper delineates (i) different incentives of exporters and multinationals to penetrate foreign markets by high-quality products; (ii) variation in input/output prices, sales and markups between exporters and multinationals; and (iii) how firm-level decisions on the foreign market entry mode and on the input choice change with changes in relative quality among varieties, in the degree of product substitutability and in product-specific trade and transport costs. There is a large and rapidly growing trade literature relating variation in firm-level decisions to firm heterogeneity. One strand of this literature focuses on heterogeneity in firm productivity (e.g., Melitz 2003; Helpman et al. 2004), and its implications on firm-level decisions (including the optimal foreign market entry mode). In particular, firms’ investments in R&D, and their intensive use of professional and technical workers are considered the main source of firm-level economies of scale leading to heterogeneity at the firm level. The related empirical literature has shown that multinationals are well represented in capital-intensive and R&D-intensive industriesFootnote 1 and that there is sorting by productivity: multinationals are, on average, more productive than exporting firms which are themselves more productive than firms serving only domestic markets.Footnote 2 While the literature on heterogeneity in firm productivity, to some extent, also studies horizontal product differentiation, vertical (quality) differentiation is, by and large, assumed away. In general, the related literature has shown that (i) multinationals’ products can be characterized by higher sophistication (Markusen 2002; Navaretti and Venables 2004); (ii) an exporter’s cost disadvantage (when competing against a local firm) leads to a less competitive product specification, whereas a multinational may prefer a more aggressive one (De Fraja and Norman 2004); and that (iii) trade liberalization increases exporters’ incentives to invest more in product differentiation (Schmitt 1995; Braun 2008; Bastos and Straume 2012). Another strand of the trade literature models heterogeneity in product quality so as to explain the significantly high share of intra-industry trade in vertically differentiated products and variation in unit values (among firms, or within firms, across destinations, etc.) with vertical product differentiation.Footnote 3 For instance, Anderson and Schmitt (2010) report a significantly high share of intra-industry trade in vertically differentiated products (e.g., 40% in the EU) and explain this with asymmetric trade liberalization in a general equilibrium trade model. In particular, the related trade literature has reported a strong positive correlation between unit values and product quality; see, for example, Verhoogen (2008), Kugler and Verhoogen (2012), Manova and Zhang (2012), Crozet et al. (2012), Feenstra and Romalis (2014). This strand of the literature argues that product quality can be related to firm productivity (e.g., Baldwin and Harrigan 2011; Kugler and Verhoogen 2012), and that (i) higher productivity firms tend to be larger in terms of sales; (ii) tend to use higher quality inputs and pay more for their inputs; (iii) tend to produce higher quality products; and thus (iv) tend to charge higher prices for their exports; for empirical evidence, see Hallak and Sivadasan (2013) using Indian data; Kugler and Verhoogen (2012) using Colombian data; Manova and Zhang (2012) using Chinese data. Building on these different strands of the trade and FDI literature, this study would like to complement and contribute to the existing literature in the following ways. Most studies in the related literature rely on nonhomothetic demands, or heterogeneity in consumer preferences/tastes (so as to capture vertically differentiated traded products), which can be argued to be relevant to certain markets.Footnote 4 This study, however, looks into another empirically relevant market segment, simply by focusing on a representative consumer’s preferences (for both vertically and horizontally differentiated varieties) represented by a quality-augmented quadratic utility function. The main motivation behind this is the observation that many households demand (horizontally) differentiated products of different qualities at the same time (e.g., households with multiple cars and TV-sets of different qualities etc.). Following the related literature, while this paper also assumes that maintaining high quality warrants quality inputs (e.g., Kugler and Verhoogen 2012; Hallak and Sivadasan 2013) and is costly, it takes a different approach and models that not all firms are able to manufacture high quality and there are large frictions against quality upgrading. The existing trade and FDI literature on vertical product differentiation simplifies firms’ input quality choices and focuses mainly on fixed and/or variable costs of manufacturing high quality.Footnote 5 This study, however, shows that a number of intuitive results can be obtained by explicitly modeling both the input choice and frictions against quality manufacturing. While there are certainly different ways to capture different aspects of such frictions, the innovation of this study is that it models a potential downstream exporter’s and a multinational’s input choice under upstream market power. In particular, the paper considers quality inputs that are highly customized (according to the needs of a final good producer), and thus are not sold on an organized exchange, nor are they reference priced in trade publications.Footnote 6 They are rather produced by a monopoly upstream firm generating frictions by exercising market power, which renders the high quality manufacture costly. The empirical motivation is the observation that the share of differentiated and customized input trade in world trade has increased substantially, as emphasized by Antràs and Staiger (2012). The related literature predominantly focuses on contract enforcement for highly customized inputs so as to address an important aspect of such frictions and its implication on exporters’ and multinationals’ decisions; see, among others, Antràs (2003), Antràs and Helpman (2004), Antràs and Staiger (2012) and Antràs (2016), and references therein. This study thus complements the related literature by focusing on another important aspect of such frictions, that is, upstream market power in customized high-quality inputs. Thus modeling frictions from a different and novel perspective, (i) it provides a further theoretical background and intuition explaining and qualifying empirical results reported in the related trade literature (in regards to vertical differentiation and trade); and (ii) it extends discussions to also multinationals and FDI. The existing literature focuses mainly on exporters and importers in the context of vertical product differentiation.Footnote 7 This study thus complements and contributes to the existing literature by delineating incentives for both exporters and multinationals. By allowing for both vertical and horizontal product differentiation in a differentiated Cournot market, this study focuses on the role upstream market power can play for a downstream foreign firm’s market entry mode choice (trade or FDI) along with its product quality choice (via choosing a particular input supplier). The downstream firm has the option to procure high-quality inputs (so as to produce a differentiated high-quality final good) from a monopoly upstream firm located in Home, or to rely on a standard input (leading to a differentiated low-quality final good) from a perfectly competitive upstream industry (either in Home or Foreign) when entering a foreign market. Upstream market power for high-quality inputs renders production of a differentiated high-quality final good costly and leads to double marginalization. That said, product quality improves foreign market access. The downstream firm has to bear per-unit trade costs in the case of exporting the final good to Foreign from Home, which can be avoided by undertaking FDI. FDI, however, requires fixed investments costs, and if the downstream firm decides to procure high-quality inputs from Home, then in addition to fixed FDI costs, it has to pay per-unit trade costs to transfer such inputs to Foreign (i.e., costs of vertical intra-industry trade). Relative product quality, the degree of product substitutability and product-specific trade costs (i) are the key for variation in input/output prices, sales and the markup between an exporter and a multinational; (ii) are important factors affecting a firm’s optimal foreign market entry mode and product quality choices; and (iii) have significant policy implications for high-quality exports and subsidiary sales. The model is simple and generates a rich set of some intuitive results. For instance, according to the results, decreasing the degree of product substitutability can undermine positive economic virtues of costly quality upgrading, irrespective of the foreign market entry mode, whereas trade and transport costs have a more involved role. Decreasing trade and/or transport costs in final goods can promote high-quality exports against low-quality subsidiary sales especially if relative quality is sufficiently high, which is supported in equilibrium even for zero fixed investment costs.Footnote 8 If, however, relative quality is sufficiently low, decreasing trade and/or transport costs in final goods only leads to quality downgrading by an exporter, while low-quality subsidiary sales dominate in equilibrium irrespective of trade and transport costs, so long as fixed investment costs are also sufficiently low. In contrast, decreasing input trade and transport costs can lead to quality upgrading by a subsidiary. If input trade and transport costs decrease faster than those in final goods, then in equilibrium, high-quality vertical intra-industry trade and subsidiary sales can be promoted against high-quality exports so long as relative quality is high and fixed investment costs are sufficiently low. In particular, it can be argued that according to results, there is some scope for using trade policy as an instrument of quality control, especially when relative quality is sufficiently high. While free trade in final goods supports high-quality exports, free trade in inputs can support both high-quality exports and subsidiary sales such that consequently, the level of fixed costs will determine the equilibrium foreign market entry mode. Also the model is extended to vertical integration, which clearly shows that double marginalization due to upstream market power generates significant frictions and makes manufacturing high quality less likely for both multinationals and exporters (in terms of both fixed investment costs and trade costs in both inputs and final goods). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model. Section 3 scrutinizes the optimal sourcing decisions (the product quality choice) of an exporter and a multinational. Section 4 solves the model for the equilibrium foreign market entry mode. Section 5 extends the model to vertical integration and delineates the optimal behavior of the integrated firm. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the study. For convenience, most of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the “Appendix”.",4
156,3,Review of World Economics,21 March 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-020-00378-y,Exporters’ agglomeration and the survival of export flows: empirical evidence from Colombia,August 2020,Ricardo Arguello,Andres Garcia-Suaza,Daniel Valderrama,Male,Male,Male,Male,"As the focus of the empirical and theoretical international trade literature has shifted from countries and industries to firms and products (Bernard et al. 2012), the analysis of export survival and growth has changed too. In this context, it has been noted that while the extensive margin of trade accounts for a large share of exports across countries (and of exports growth in the long term), most of the year to year variation in trade is basically due to the intensive margin. These facts are associated to the small size of new exporters and their ensuing comparatively strong growth, conditional on survival (Bernard et al. 2012). Hence, the increasing interest in the empirical trade literature for studying the determinants of the survival of trade flows, as long-term export growth significantly depends on the survival of exporting firms. Findings from this body of work suggest that the survival of trade flows depends on multiple factors, associated to firms’ productivity and the interaction between sunk and fixed costs of the particular export activity, such as the characteristics of the destination market (e.g., distance and demand behavior), initial export value, type of product (differentiation level), export experience, market and product diversification of the firms, enforceability of contracts between exporters and their suppliers, and transport efficiency and logistics, among others (Albornoz et al. 2016; Carrère and Strauss-Kahn 2017; D’Amato et al. 2015; Fu and Wu 2014; Fugazza and Molina 2016; Volpe Martincus and Carballo 2009). Many of the determinants of export survival examined in the literature relate to the uncertainty that firms face about their profitability, potential demand, long-term benefits from exporting, buyers’ preferences, applicable legislation, and other common challenges characterizing foreign markets. As solving this uncertainty is a discovery process that is knowledge intensive (Clerides et al. 1998), firms might actively learn from their own export experience or try to take advantage from the experience of exporters nearby, in order to lower sunk, fixed and variable costs, other risky investments required by exporting, or get a better matching with buyers. Therefore, they tend to benefit from agglomeration externalities or from their involvement in networks (Krautheim 2012; Chaney 2014). In line with some strands of this literature, in this paper we empirically assess the effects of the presence and of the number of firms situated in the same place, exporting the same product to the same market (our definition of an agglomeration) on the survival of export flows in Colombia. An export flow is defined as a triple firm-product-destination, so its disappearance does not necessarily imply that the firm exits the export market, as it can continue exporting the same product to other markets or other products to other markets. Therefore, the analysis hinges on a highly granular way of assessing export survival, which is becoming more common in the related literature. Previous works have extensively investigated spillover effects on both the decision to entry the export market and on export value (see Bernard and Jensen 2004; Alvarez 2007; Greenaway and Kneller 2008; Koenig et al. 2010; Mayneris and Poncet 2013; Kuznetsova 2016). Among the mechanisms studied, reducing the uncertainty that firms face about their own productivity and the size of foreign demand (Albornoz et al. 2012; Nguyen 2012), lowering fixed costs of exporting (Aitken et al. 1997; Krautheim 2012; Schmeiser 2012), reducing search costs and improving the quality of buyer–supplier relationships (Rauch and Watson 2003; Eaton et al. 2007), and mutualizing fixed and variable costs (e.g., sharing transportation costs or cost participation in international fares, see Mayneris and Poncet 2013; Cassey and Schmeiser 2013), provide examples of this. However, less attention has been paid to the study of the survival of export flows, in spite of its importance for export growth and export promotion policy (Fugazza and Molina 2016). The relevance of export survival is implied, for instance, in Eaton et al. (2007) who, using Colombian data, show that almost half of the exporting firms in a given year are new exporters, that a high proportion of them will not export the following year, and that new exporters that are able to survive expand rapidly both in terms of destination markets and export volume, accounting for a significant share of export growth in the long term. Similar findings are reported for the US (Bernard et al. 2012), Portugal (Amador and Opromolla 2013), Mexico (Iacovone and Javorcik 2010), Ireland (Lawless 2009), and Argentina (Albornoz et al. 2016). One of the avenues whose role in export entry and survival has been explored is that of networks. Managerial networks is one of them, as exemplified by Amador and Opromolla (2013) and Mion and Opromolla (2014), who show that prior export experience obtained by managers in previous firms lead their current firm to higher export performance and higher survival rates. Another is the role of neighboring exporters in lowering matching costs between buyers and sellers in the international market, as in Kamal and Sundaram (2016) or Rauch and Watson (2003), or their role for enhancing the likelihood that firms enter the export market (export spillovers) as in Koenig et al. (2010). The role of networks is made explicit in works such as Chaney (2014) that builds on the notion that firms look for trading partners guided by geography, acquire networks of foreign contacts in several locations, and use them to find new trading partners. It also takes central stage in Fernandes and Tang, which develop a social learning model where firms learn from their neighbors under uncertainty about country of destination specific demand and its own market-specific product appeal (Fernandes and Tang 2014). There is a growing empirical literature studying the role of agglomeration externalities or network spillovers on the survival of export flows, to which this paper relates. For a set of exporters in four African countries, Cadot et al. (2010) show that the probability of survival beyond the first year of a new entrant on a product-destination market increases with the number of firms exporting the same product to the same market. Stirbat et al. (2015) analyze the role of experience and local spillovers in the case of Lao PDR, finding that the presence of strong networks of similar firms (i.e. the number of other firms engaged in trade in the same sector and market) has an important positive impact on export survival. For the case of Colombia, Tovar and Martinez (2011) study both the effects of export diversification and networks on export activity survival. Using the number of firms exporting the same product to the same market as a measure of networks, irrespective of firm location within the country, they find a positive effect of the size of the network on export survival. In this context, we empirically assess the effect of agglomerations of exporting firms on the survival of export flows, where agglomerations, and their size, are measured as the presence and the number of firms situated in the same place, exporting the same product to the same market. We use different specifications of the agglomeration measure in order to infer about the characteristics of the mechanisms at play, including the presence of networks. By estimating discrete-time hazard models, after controlling by firm, municipality, and market-product characteristics, and unobserved heterogeneity, we compute the marginal effect of two features of agglomerations, i.e., its existence (at least one firm exporting the same product to the same market) and its size (the number of firms satisfying these criteria). Our results suggest that the presence of agglomerations lowers the exit rate of trade flows by 7.3 p.p. Furthermore, agglomeration size also has an impact on survival of export flows by reducing its probability of ending by 16.3 p.p. when an additional 100 firms operate on the same product-destination. These results are heterogeneous with respect to export experience since a reappearing export flow sees its exit rate lowered between two and five additional p.p., which might indicate that agglomeration spillovers are complementary to experience in export activity. In light of this, we control by a number of confounders related to firm’s exporting experience, such as reappearing trade flows, number of markets, and number of products. Our estimates provide strong evidence on the benefits of agglomeration forces for other exporters. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we provide novel empirical evidence showing that the existence and size of agglomerations matter for export survival at a very granular level. Secondly, we show that the effect of agglomeration size on export survival is greater the more specific the product-destination agglomeration is for a particular trade flow, while the effect of the existence of an agglomeration is greater when it is less specific. Finally, we provide evidence that proximity is a key driver of our estimate, since the effect of agglomeration size when defined at broader geographical levels is reduced; however, the significant effect originated in the presence of agglomerations at the national level, provides additional evidence on the existence of spillovers. Besides, we validate, for the case of Colombia, the differential role of local spillovers at the product and destination specific levels, as well as the relevance of reappearing firm-product-destination export flows as evidence suggesting the importance of learning processes for export activities. Therefore, our findings are instrumental for understanding the scope of export promotion policies for being successful. The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. In section two we discuss the data used, provide relevant definitions, and discuss some key features of the structure of trade flows in Colombia. In section three the econometric specification is presented and discussed. Section four presents the main results and discusses relevant robustness checks, and in section five we discuss the results and conclude.",9

Offshoring, understood as ‘the process of changing the geographic assignment of the mix of tasks needed to produce a single final good or service’ (Hummels et al. 2018: 983) has traditionally been seen as a threat to domestic workers (job losses, declining wages, heightened inequality). The topic has become a media phenomenon, an issue in the political debate and one of the main themes in current economic literature. The theoretical literature on the distributional consequences of offshoring and global value chains (GVCs), recently reviewed by Frassen (2019), is abundant but ambiguous, particularly when it comes to predicting the combined effect of the various, often conflicting mechanisms at play.Footnote 1 In the empirical literature as well, despite the impressive development of measurements and methods the debate on the labour market consequences of importing foreign inputs is still unresolved, due to the gap between concepts and what can be feasibly demonstrated given the data (Hummels et al. 2018). This paper uses rich individual-level data on workers in 28 European countries in the period from 2005 to 2014 to produce a multidimensional cross-country evaluation of the factors that determine wages in labour markets characterised by strong links to GVCs and task-related specificity of jobs. The core of our empirical analysis relates to the way we quantify dependence on foreign inputs and the role of cross-border production relations in generating labour market outcomes. The standard measures of fragmentation are based on the ratio of imported intermediates in a given industry to its output or value added (Feenstra and Hanson 1999). That is, the focus is on the last stage of production only, as if the use of foreign inputs were independent from the previous stages (whether performed domestically or abroad). Instead we employ the latest release of the WIOD input–output dataFootnote 2 and methodology proposed by Timmer et al. (2016), proxying fragmentation by a newly devised index of global import intensity of production (GII), which counts imports of goods and services required in any stage of production, including trade with third countries.Footnote 3 GII measures the extent to which a given industry depends on imported intermediates to attain its total production value (direct exposure) and previous international and cross-industry links (indirect exposure). Our approach is thus closer to the framework of sequential production and national interdependence driven by vertical specialisation and GVCs (Antràs and Chor 2013; Kohler 2004; Costinot et al. 2013) than to the ‘classic’ offshoring literature, which considers the last tier only (see Hummels et al. 2018, Sect. 2 for a review). To illustrate this point, we refer to the statistics on GVC involvement (Table 1). Between 2000 and 2014 the import intensity of European production (ratio to total output) increased from 15.9% to 20.2%.Footnote 4 According to the monetary interpretation of GII proposed by Timmer et al. (2016), this means that in 2014 one dollar of goods and services finished in Europe generated about 20 cents worth of imports worldwide. Conventionally measured offshoring—the inputs used in the last stage of production—accounts for a bit less than half the increase that occurred over this period. The rest of the imported intermediates were used in earlier tiers and can be traced back in the GVC framework. The United States is less dependent on imported intermediates, but there was an increase in GII there as well (from 7.9% in 2000 to 8.8% in 2014). Worldwide, the ratio of GVC imports (i.e. imports by the country where the last stage of production occurred and by all other countries involved in earlier stages of production) to the output of the final products was approximately 16% in 2014 (12% in 2000).Footnote 5 And only a third of it can be ascribed to the final stage of production, so proper measurement of dependence on foreign inputs in earlier stages is essential. To date, however, the literature on the labour market effects of production fragmentation has neglected this aspect. The studies of the effects of fragmentation on the European labour market that have considered the task content of jobs suffer another severe limitation, namely limited coverage: these inquiries have involved only a few Western European countries,Footnote 6 not the other, less highly developed economies of Southern or Central and Eastern Europe (CEECs).Footnote 7 Furthermore, often only the impact on manufacturing workers is analysed (as in Geishecker et al. 2010; Baumgarten et al. 2013; Hummels et al. 2014; Geishecker and Görg 2013).Footnote 8 The dependence on foreign production is sector-specific and non-negligible in non-manufacturing activities (Geishecker and Görg 2013),Footnote 9 so we do not limit our study to manufacturing alone. Our central question is thus: are wages in Europe affected by globally measured dependence on foreign inputs, including direct and indirect exposure, given all the other dimensions of the wage determination process?Footnote 10 To answer, we construct a rich dataset: individual-level information on wages, occupational task profiles, personal and job characteristics on 1.3 million workers in 28 European countries over the period 2005–2014. We match our microdata with input–output measures of sectoral dependence on foreign inputs, other sector characteristics, and information on national labour market institutions and wage bargaining schemes. In addition to considering all the pre-final tiers of production, we compare the effects of dependence on foreign inputs measured globally, regardless of country of origin, with the effects of dependence on inputs from less developed countries only. Further, given our cross-country approach, we consider the task profiles of workers, which are occupation- and country-specific (Lewandowski et al. 2019). The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the theoretical background and some essential contributions on production fragmentation and wages in Europe, which our paper expands on. Section 3 presents the data and methodology and the measurement of global dependence on foreign inputs and of wages in Europe. The empirical strategy and the results of the estimations for various subsamples are presented in Sect. 4. The last section concludes. Numerous robustness checks are included in the additional material and available in the online appendix.",4

156,4,Review of World Economics,19 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-020-00382-2,Exchange rate pass-through to import prices: accounting for changes in the eurozone trade structure,November 2020,Antonia López-Villavicencio,Valérie Mignon,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The exchange rate pass-through (ERPT from now on), understood as the extent to which an exchange rate change is reflected in import and/or consumer prices, is a central concept in international trade and macroeconomics, both from theoretical and empirical viewpoints (see Knetter 1989; Campa and Goldberg 2005; and Burstein and Gopinath 2014). A large body of the related literature puts forward that ERPT is incomplete and has been steadily declining over the past few decades. From a theoretical perspective, the decline in the degree of pass-through has both macroeconomic and microeconomic sources. The main explanations proposed in the literature are (i) the presence of nominal rigidities impeding prices’ responses in the short term (Monacelli 2005), (ii) an increasing pricing-to-market behavior of firms (Betts and Devereux 2000),Footnote 1 and (iii) the existence of a stable and predictable monetary policy environment in which nominal shocks play a vastly reduced role in driving fluctuations in prices and the exchange rate (Taylor 2000). The literature is, however, far from conclusive in identifying with certainty the origin of incomplete and declining rates of ERPT (see, for instance, Aron et al. 2014; López-Villavicencio and Mignon 2017, 2018; and the references therein). Given this absence of clear-cut results regarding monetary factors, we consider in this paper another determinant that could be at play in explaining the dynamics of ERPT to import prices, namely trade integration and liberalization, i.e., globalization. It is worth mentioning that we refer here to the original definition of ERPT, namely the percentage change in import prices in domestic currency in response to a 1 percent change in the exchange rate. In other words, by considering import prices, we focus on the so-called “Stage 1 ERPT”. An alternative would have been to investigate the effect of exchange rate changes on producer or consumer prices,Footnote 2 and to address the impact of a change in import prices on producer or consumer prices—which is known as “Stage 2 ERPT”. Since we aim at explaining the decline in the degree of ERPT, working with import prices is more appropriate. Indeed, it is well-known that the sensitivity to the exchange rate tends to diminish along the price distribution chain, from import prices to final consumer prices (see, e.g., Aron et al. 2014, among others). Furthermore, as suggested by Campa et al. (2005), the import price approach is more suitable because it is the most relevant dependent variable in the debate of the inflationary consequences of exchange rate changes.Footnote 3 From a theoretical viewpoint, two effects of trade integration on ERPT are at play. According to the first effect, globalization impacts inflation dynamics through its influence on the degree of competition. Specifically, globalization—which refers here to a rising share of goods sold by foreign firms in the domestic market or factors leading to higher trade integration—impacts imported inflation dynamics through its effect on ERPT into import prices. As imported goods represent a large fraction of consumption and intermediate goods, the overall price index becomes more sensitive to external conditions, namely the combined dynamics of the nominal exchange rate and foreign marginal costs. The second channel through which globalization influences the dynamics of inflation is, indirectly, via its effect on the pricing strategies of domestic firms selling in the internal market. In particular, Gust et al. (2010) suggest that globalization induces changes in the competitive environment and forces exporters to lower markups in response to an exchange rate depreciation, thereby moderating pass-through. Under the same perspective, Bergin and Feenstra (2009) set up a theoretical two-country model and show that the fall in ERPT to import prices in the United States can be largely attributed to the increasing import penetration rate of China through two effects: (i) a direct composition effect, which comes from the renminbi’s peg to the US dollar (more imports from a country with a fixed exchange rate regime push ERPT down), and (ii) an indirect competition effect, which results from the fact that other foreign exporters need to compete with Chinese goods in the US market. On the opposite side, Dornbusch (1987) and Benigno and Faia (2016) argue that globalization tends to raise ERPT through the growing dependence of imported inflation on external conditions. The share of foreign products in the domestic market plays a crucial role in this explanation. This paper falls into this strand of the literature, with the aim of shedding light on the globalization channel and, in particular, on the role played by key factors affecting the composition of trade flows in some European countries using disaggregated, good-level price data. The hypothesis we test is the indirect effect proposed by Bergin and Feenstra (2009) and Gust et al. (2010), i.e., whether changes in the competitive environment induce exporters from other countries to moderate pass-through. To this end, we begin by empirically investigating the link between globalization and ERPT by paying particular attention to China as source of European imports. Our motivation is in line with the evolution of the global trade pattern observed for about two decades. Indeed, since the beginning of the 2000s, all developed countries faced a stark increase in their exposure to Chinese import competition. This is especially the case for the United States, with a 25 percentage points (pp.) increase in the import share of China in ten years, from 2000 to 2010. The same growing dynamics is observed in European countries with an augmentation in the Chinese import share in total imports by around 16 pp. in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and 14 pp. in Germany; France and Sweden being the least exposed with a share amounting at 13 pp.Footnote 4 Although these increases are lower than for the United States, they are non-negligible and may have an impact on ERPT in European countries. Along with the growing market shares of China in European imports, the rise of Eastern Europe is also likely to affect the European global trade pattern. This evolution is of particular interest as the emergence of China occurred shortly after trade was liberalized with the former planned economies after the fall of the Berlin wall. As neighboring countries, eurozone members may have been impacted by the liberalization of markets in Eastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania. We, therefore, consider if this similar and pronounced increase in the shares of these new players affects the elasticity of import prices to exchange rate movements. A final major feature that has shaped the interconnection of European countries with their external environment is the processes set in motion by the introduction of the euro. If countries have a higher proportion of imports in their own currency, ERPT should decrease. Given that trade barriers have been removed and euro adopted as a common currency in the European Monetary Union (EMU), there is, in principle, a smaller share of “output” exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.Footnote 5 These characteristics should affect the way foreign firms pass exchange rate shocks onto prices as they reduce the market power of exporters outside the euro area. As such, the transmission of exchange rate variations into import prices would have declined as the proportion of eurozone final demand satisfied with extra-EMU imports diminished (see, e.g., Faruqee 2004 and Campa et al. 2005). Therefore, we study if the three aforementioned parallel shocks, namely (i) the emergence of China, (ii) Eastern countries’ integration, and (iii) the launch of the single currency, are helpful to explain the role of the exchange rate for European import prices. We consider both globalization and regional integration, i.e., interaction with distant countries as well as relations to neighboring nations. In addition to overcoming the drawback linked to the short time sample used in previous studies for the euro area contextFootnote 6 (with the exception of Ben Cheikh and Rault 2016), we go further than the existing literature in various ways. First, we confront seven European economies that differ regarding their external exposure and the share of imports invoiced in euro. The comparison is interesting since, in principle, relatively low dispersion of ERPT levels is expected in the euro area due to the anticipated convergence process implied by the monetary union (see, e.g., Ben Cheikh and Rault 2016).Footnote 7 However, in reality, some countries are more insulated from exchange rate shocks, while others are highly sensitive to them. Accounting for such different responses of import prices to euro exchange rate changes is important for the conduct of the single monetary policy. It is also worthy of interest with regard to the impact of entering into the union and the success of protocols and processes calling for structural reforms in the EMU. Second, we present an overview of the exposure to Chinese, Eastern European, and eurozone countries import competition by sector for our selected European member States since 2000. We further assess the effect of trade liberalization on bilateral ERPT by addressing the competitive impact of growing market shares of the new players together with the changing proportion of imports with other EMU members—three trade shocks that have not been simultaneously studied in the previous literature. Third, we avoid two types of aggregation bias. The first one has been largely discussed in the literature—especially in the context of the purchasing power parity hypothesisFootnote 8—and concerns the bias due to the use of aggregated price series (see, e.g., Pesaran and Smith 1995, and Mumtaz et al. 2006). Moreover, aggregated pass-through could also arise from the compositional change in import bundles over time as the level of ERPT varies dramatically across sectors (e.g., Devereux and Yetman 2010). To avoid this bias, we rely on disaggregated, good-level manufacturing industries based on the two-digit Standard International Trade Classification (SITC). Those data enable us to compare ERPT coefficients across manufacturing goods, which is highly relevant since European countries tend to import textiles, toys and computer equipment from China (miscellaneous and manufactured goods), while they import cars and car parts from Eastern Europe (see Figure A1 in the online Appendix). The second bias may arise by aggregating import prices and bilateral exchange rates across countries. Indeed, ERPT is usually summarized by the coefficient obtained using sectoral, multilateral price indices, and effective exchange rates. By doing so, the consensus in the literature is that the estimated short-run ERPT is incomplete.Footnote 9 However, ERPT to import prices should not only depend on cross-sectoral characteristics but also on specificities from both exporting and importing countries due to, for instance, different pricing strategies—producer versus local currency prices—, pricing-to-market behavior of firms, etc.Footnote 10 Therefore, we focus on bilateral relations with main trading partners, namely China, Japan, the UK, and the US.Footnote 11 Employing bilateral data is crucial since it allows us to distinguish the effects of exchange rates on unit values at the level of country pairs. To give a concrete example, consider the case of France with two trading partners, the US and Japan. It is well known that ERPT could be very high, even complete if exporters set prices in their own currencies—the so-called “producer currency pricing” strategy. However, exchange rate movements are not necessarily transmitted to consumer prices if exporters set prices in euro—the so-called “local currency pricing” strategy. As shown in Table A2 in the online Appendix, more than half of extra-European Union (EU) imports in France are invoiced in US dollar, and less than 5 percent in currencies other than euro or dollar—yuan, yen, etc. As a consequence, changes in the exchange rate do not much influence the prices paid by consumers for imported goods which are invoiced in other currencies than the US dollar or the euro. In other words, when the local currency pricing strategy dominates, the channels for adjustment through relative price changes are considerably narrowed. It is then expected to find a higher pass-through for the US than for Japanese imports to France. Finally, given that controversial results may come from the implemented methods,Footnote 12 we pay particular attention to methodological issues. Specifically, our estimation approach controls for cross-sectional dependence using the common correlated effects estimator extended to dynamic panel specifications. Furthermore, although we aim at estimating the short-run ERPT, we account for the time-series properties of our variables through the estimation of an error-correction model. The latter specification complements our ERPT evaluations by providing the estimated value of the long-run ERPT.Footnote 13 Relying on quarterly data over the 2000Q1–2018Q3 period, our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, the incomplete ERPT suggested in the literature is not a general result. On the contrary, exchange rate changes are fully reflected in bilateral import prices in many cases, especially when considering Chinese import prices. This result holds both for short- and long-run ERPT. Second, interacting exchange rate changes with our trade competition indicators shows the absence of a generalized link between trade liberalization and ERPT. Indeed, ERPT is neither related to China’s gains in market shares nor Eastern European surging exports to Europe. Finally, the launch of the single currency has not significantly reduced the share of trade exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our methodology. Section 3 presents the data and some stylized facts. Section 4 displays our estimation results, and Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",2

This induced major capital flows from the North to the South, which were initially considered to be largely benign.Footnote 1 In retrospect however, the inflow of capital mainly fueled a boom of domestic lending and construction, contributing little to productivity growth or business cycle convergence.Footnote 2 As the discrepancy between the external debt level and the capacity to repay kept growing, eventually the solvency of the recipient regions came under pressure (see Giavazzi and Spaventa 2010). Whereas there exists a fairly broad consensus regarding this narrative (see e.g. Baldwin and Giavazzi 2015), less is known about how the sectoral allocation of capital came about. It is therefore also unclear whether the developments in the first decade of EMU were an unfortunate one-off or something that could have been foreseen and possibly prevented. In this paper, based on a detailed breakdown of the share of production that is absorbed domestically, we document how the growth of the nontradable sector in Southern Europe was a broad-based phenomenon extending beyond the construction- and real estate sectors. We then proceed by constructing a tractable two-sector two-region (‘North’ and ‘South’) general equilibrium model of a monetary union. We simulate the non-linear transition path following the permanent drop in the real interest rate experienced by Southern Europe in the run-up to the introduction of the euro. The fall in the interest rate induces a regional demand boom, which increases demand for both tradable and nontradable goods. Whereas the nontradable sector is able to increase prices and output, the tradable sector faces foreign competition and thus has less room to increase prices. Therefore, in real terms, capital and labor are cheaper in the nontradable sector and are (re)allocated to this sector. In North, Southern demand for tradables and upward pressure on the EMU-wide interest rate induce wage moderation and a shift of resources to the tradable sector. As such, cost competitiveness positions in North and South diverge, while Southern external debt accumulates. Absent a debt-elastic interest rate or a debt limit, there is nothing to stop this process. When we extend the model to include a third region—the ‘Rest of the World’—the effects of monetary integration in the Southern part of the union are amplified, while spillovers to North are more muted, in part due to an appreciation of the union’s exchange rate that limits the growth of the Northern tradable sector. We empirically validate key model predictions using a reduced-form panel-BVAR for 9 euro area countries. We show most predictions to hold up well: countries which experienced negative interest rate shocks relative to the euro area average, saw a rising price level (relative to the union average), a deteriorating current account balance, and faster growth of the nontradable sector. In contrast, tradable sector growth was not significantly affected by downward shocks to the interest rate. Our paper contributes to an emerging body of research that studies the allocation of incoming capital flows in Southern Europe, both across and within sectors, and the effects thereof on the external position and productivity.Footnote 3 Most related, Benigno and Fornaro (2014), Kalantzis (2015) and Piton (2019), show that in a small open economy (SOE) framework an exogenous fall in the interest rate leads to (relative) growth of the nontradable sector. Piton (2019) focuses on the drivers of rising unit labor costs, while Benigno and Fornaro (2014) show how—in a setting where only the tradable sector experiences productivity growth—the reallocation of labor to the nontradable sector contributes to stagnating productivity growth. Kalantzis (2015) emphasizes how the interest rate drop results in both growth of the nontradable sector as well as increasing leverage, which together make balance-of-payments crises more likely. Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, by moving to a multi-country setting with an endogenous interest rate, we document the feedback effects that occur within a monetary union.Footnote 4 Our model suggests that wage moderation, tradable sector growth and a current account surplus in Northern Europe do not (only) reflect prudent policies, but also the consequences of unification. In this way, we complement not only the SOE literature, but also studies by Gadatsch et al. (2016) and Bettendorf and León-Ledesma (2015), who focus on the extent to which German economic policies have driven euro area imbalances. Second, our modeling approach takes into account that the interest rate shock hitting Southern Europe was large and long-lasting and allows for monopolistic competition and differing levels of productivity between regions and sectors. We can thereby show that the reallocation of capital and labor towards the nontradable sector induced by a falling interest rate is not hindered by the nontradable sector being the less competitive or productive one. This offers a structural explanation for the empirical findings of Borio et al. (2016) and Cette et al. (2016), who show that credit booms are associated with a productivity slowdown driven by a reallocation of resources towards less productive sectors.Footnote 5 Third, as our model covers both Southern and Northern EMU-countries, we can test the model predictions using a panel-BVAR. To this end, we compute tradable and nontradable sectoral growth rates based on a detailed decomposition of the share of sectoral production that is absorbed domestically. The results in this paper raise important policy issues, as to correcting external imbalances and preventing new ones. For one, the model suggests that growth of the Southern nontradable sector, deteriorating competitiveness, and current account deficits are relatively straightforward consequences of the economic boom induced by the sharp, permanent decline in real interest rates. A sufficiently strong reaction of Southern interest rates to the accumulating debt, or possibly macroprudential measures, could have helped to moderate these developments, preventing the need for a sharp rebalancing process later on. However, in the absence of these timely stabilizing measures, investors ‘waking up’ and demanding a higher interest rate premium induces a sharp rebalancing process during which Southern GDP falls. We investigate various policy options that can accommodate a less disruptive rebalancing process, focusing on product market reforms that have the potential to both boost growth and facilitate the rebalancing process. Firstly, we analyze the effects of a liberalization of the Southern nontradable sector, i.e., allowing for more domestic competition. Perhaps counter-intuitively, but in line with Cavelaars (2006), this does not improve the region’s external position. As markups in the nontradable sector come down, demand for nontradable goods increases and the sector expands. Total output in South grows, while the external position marginally deteriorates. Spillovers from liberalizing the Northern nontradable sector are limited. Secondly, we simulate a decrease in the markup on tradable goods (interpreted as a deepening of the European internal market). This induces a shift of productive resources towards the tradable sector and boosts growth, though in the short run it does come at the expense of a deterioration of the external position of the union as whole.",1

A myriad of papers assesses the impact of EIAs on bilateral trade and welfare empirically, mainly focusing on the trade creation effects of EIAs. In contrast, evidence on the trade diversion effects of EIAs seems to be more scarce. The measurement of the trade creating impact of EIAs is typically based on gravity models of bilateral trade and EIA-dummy indicators. Identifying trade diversion effects is less straight forward. Many contributions use a reduced form measuring trade diversion by a dummy variable that picks out trade flows between any two countries that do not share an EIA, but either the exporter country or the importer country (or both) have one or more EIAs in force with other countries.Footnote 1 Strictly speaking, in this design trade diversion is modelled as if the conclusion of an EIA between any two countries increases trade barriers toward third non-member countries. Economic theory predicts the adjustment of the terms of trade and, therefore, multilateral resistances, as a response to the formation of EIAs (Anderson and Yotov 2016). Actually, trade diversion is a consequence of the general equilibrium effects induced by EIAs, but not necessarily of new trade barriers between EIA members vis-à-vis non-EIA members. Contributions by, e.g., Caliendo and Parro (2015), Clausing (2001), Felbermayr et al. (2015) and Trefler (2004) consider specific trade agreements and favour the structural (general equilibrium) approach to estimate the trade creating and trade diverting effects of EIAs, as well as the implied welfare effects. In a similar vein, Bergstrand et al. (2015) estimate the welfare effects of EIAs using a structural gravity model in the spirit of Anderson and van Wincoop (2003). All these models fully account for the changes in terms of trade via changes in the estimated multilateral resistances. This paper reconsiders the trade creation and trade diversion effects of EIAs using constrained panel PPML estimation and the delta method for establishing reliable confidence intervals of general equilibrium EIA effects. The estimated econometric specification follows Bergstrand et al. (2015), modelling the impact of EIAs on bilateral trade as a reduction of the border effects. In line with the literature, in a sample of 65 mainly developed countries the EIAs put in force between 1994–2012 induced positive and quantitatively important trade creation effects. But despite their increasing number and the phasing-in effects the trade creating effect of EIAs increased only moderately over time. The establishment of EIAs improved the welfare of countries with many EIAs in force, while for those with just a few EIAs in force the welfare gains turned out insignificant. On the other hand, EIAs produced pronounced and significant trade diversion effects. Since the data base includes domestic trade flows it is possible to compare the diversion of domestic trade flows with that of international trade flows with the outsider countries to EIAs. If the former dominate the latter, the trade diverting repercussions of EIAs are possibly less of a concern for economic policy in the outsider countries. Indeed, the estimation results indicate that on average the diversion of domestic trade turn out substantial and larger than the diversion of international trade with outside countries. Freezing all trade costs as well as the EIA status counterfactually at the level of 1994 reveals a much lower trade creating effect of EIAs relative to non-policy related changes in trade barriers. A third scenario with all international trade flows counterfactually covered by an EIA indicates potential of welfare gains of further multilateral trade liberalization efforts. This scenario would induce a substantial increase in trade flows not covered by EIAs and sizeable welfare gains of countries holding just a few EIAs, affecting trade flows under existing EIAs only marginally. Since parameter estimation induces uncertainty to the counterfactual predictions, the involved confidence intervals of the estimated EIA-effects are relatively large and wider than previously reported in the literature, however. As a methodological contribution, the paper introduces a constrained panel pseudo-Poisson maximum likelihood (PPML) estimation approach, adapting the constrained PPML estimator for cross-sections proposed in Pfaffermayr (2020) to a panel setting. The constrained panel PPML estimator concentrates out country-pair fixed effects and exploits the restrictions imposed by the system of multilateral resistances not only for comparative static analysis, but also for estimation. Since concentrating out country-pair fixed effects is equivalent to imposing further restrictions on the cross-section based constrained PPML estimator, the available econometric results for this estimator are applicable to a panel setting as well. While both the constrained and the unconstrained panel PPML estimators of the structural trade cost parameters are consistent if the imposed restrictions hold true, there are several important differences. First, Weidner and Zylkin (2019) show that in a three-way panel the unconstrained PPML estimates of the structural trade cost parameters are biased (to the order of the number of countries) as the exporter-time and importer-time dummies are treated as parameters to be estimated.Footnote 2 Thus asymptotic confidence intervals are not correctly centered at the true point estimates. The constrained PPML estimator is free of this asymptotic bias, since exporter-time and importer-time dummies are pinned done by the system of multilateral resistances and are thus functionally dependent on the structural trade cost parameters and the exogenously given gross-production and expenditures figures. Second, under constrained PPML estimation the estimated standard errors of the structural trade cost parameters typically exhibit a much lower bias (downward and of the order of the number of countries) as demonstrated in Pfaffermayr (2020). Moreover, it is straight forward to apply the delta method to derive confidence intervals for counterfactual predictions which might serve as an alternative to computationally intensive bootstrapping procedures. Constrained panel PPML estimation is especially useful in case of missing trade flows. It implicitly predicts the missing trade flows and delivers theory consistent predictions that add up the given gross production and expenditure figures. The constrained PPML estimation approach is related to several contributions to the literature. French (2016, 2017) also applies the constrained estimator to gravity models. However, he does not use the constrained PPML estimator to improve inference and to establish confidence intervals of counterfactual predictions. Poissonnier (2019) proposes the usage of the RAS-algorithm used in the input–output literature to solve the system multilateral resistances efficiently. Lastly, the present paper contributes to the evolving literature proposing fast zig–zag algorithms for the estimation of high dimensional panel models based pseudo-demeaning or separate up-dating of fixed effects (see Correia et al. 2020; Larch et al. 2019; Stammann 2018).",9

Regardless of the outcome and the duration of the political negotiations between the European Union and the British government, financial markets and multinational enterprises had already prepared to confront the BREXIT event. Particularly, Dhingra et al. (2017) found out that a soft-BREXIT may decrease the average income per capita by 6.3% in the UK. On the other hand, a hard-BREXIT may weaken the average income per capita by 9.4%, partly via the decline in foreign direct investments (FDI). Actually, a potential divestment or a decline in FDIs would negatively affect the nominal exchange rate of the British pound in the long run. Moreover, Srovnalikova and Razinskaite (2017) believe that BREXIT may have a negative impact on inward foreign direct investment. They discovered that UK leaving the EU will reduce foreign direct investments. Such losses will damage the UK investments, and reduced productivity will consequently reduce real incomes. Such an incident will inevitably lead to further depreciation of the British currency in international foreign exchange markets. Choudhry et al. (2016) investigated the relationship between stock market volatility and the business cycle in four major economies, namely the US, Canada, Japan and the UK. Their results offer that there is a bidirectional causal relationship between stock market volatility and the business cycle within each country and additionally reveal that the recent financial crisis plays a significant role in this context. Finally, Dao et al. (2018) studied the effect of the Brexit vote on the intraday correlation and volatility transmission among major currencies. They discovered that the vote causes an increase in the correlation among the safe-haven currencies of the Swiss franc and Japanese yen as well as gold, and also find a decrease in their correlation with the directly involved currencies of British sterling and the euro. Consequently, the principal research aims of this study are to examine (a) the impact of BREXIT referendum on the financial markets of the UK (stock, bond and forex markets) and (b) the potentials of GBP against the USD and the euro after the official BREXIT era. In specific, we test the influence of FTSE-100 and the 10-year UK government bond yield on the nominal exchange rate of sterling against the euro and the US dollar. Under these circumstances, we attempted to investigate this issue by providing evidence from the British financial markets (stock, bond market and forex market). Particularly, we used the Error Correction Model (ECM) as a mean equation and the Exponential Realized GARCH (R-EGARCH) as a conditional variance equation. Actually, we created a brand-new drift of these econometric models, ECM-R-EGARCH. This model provides the opportunity to isolate the realized long-term volatility which is the most important interest of our research. Realized long-term volatility is able to express the reaction and the impact of the control variable on the dependent variable in the long- run, from the realized volatility aspect of view (Degiannakis & Floros 2015). The use of errors in the mean equation provides information about the realized causality of leverage effect in the long-run (asymmetries). Therefore, our results express higher validity on the estimation of the realized volatility and the realized effect of bad and good news (leverage effect) than the use of the two models (ECM and Realized-EGARCH) separately (Stoupos & Kiohos 2017). We reckon that the outcomes of the present paper provide important evidence to the academia, EU/UK policy makers, international institutions (IMF, World Bank, BIS), investors, risk managers and individual people across the globe. Particularly, if a strong political event is able to crash the currency of a highly developed country, such as the UK, we expect that similar events are able to have analogous effects. According to the EU officials, the withdrawal of the UK from the EU (BREXIT) will commence on 31st January 2020, after the second official postponement of 29th October 2019. In the meantime, an adjustment period will take place, which will eventually terminate on 31st December 2020. Also, it was decided that only Northern Ireland will have access to the European Single Market and the customs union due to common land borders with the Republic of Ireland (backstop condition). Moreover, companies and individuals could be prepared to safeguard their wealth by purchasing different currencies or investing their money in commodities or corporate and governmental bonds. Finally, our empirical findings offer sufficient evidence that a devaluation of the British pound against the euro and the US dollar may occur due to the upcoming BREXIT. A swift devaluation of GBP will shock the British economy by affecting internal consumption due to the imported inflation. Imported inflation may be set off by imports price increases, or by depreciation of a country's currency exchange rate. An increase of the general prices will lower the income of the British people when they purchase imported goods and services. On the other hand, a depreciated pound will increase British exports. However, it is not still clear if the UK will remain a member of the European Single Market after BREXIT, unless the UK signs a special trade agreement with the EU, such as Canada (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement-CETA). Otherwise, trading relationships will be set off according to the principles of the World Trade Organization (implementation of tariffs, quotas or licenses). Before concluding, we believe that it will be useful to present the most important political events of BREXIT negotiations from 2016 to 2020. Figure 1 will aid our analysis to explain how the political events influence the reaction in the financial markets (finance behavior).

Much less is known about the drivers and impediments of services trade. What makes services trade and its impediments particularly interesting relative to goods trade are three features: first, services contribute a larger share to GDP in most developed and developing countries, while services trade is smaller than goods trade, pointing to high services trade costs; second, both the production and trade of services grow faster than those of goods; and, third, cross-border services transactions appear much more restricted by economic policy than goods transactions. Even though a cottage literature started evolving around the policy domain of services impediments (see Francois and Hoekman 2010, for a survey), fundamental knowledge about whether countries adopt liberalization strategies in the same systematic way and in compliance with economic reasoning as they liberalize goods and investment (see Frankel et al. 1996; Baier and Bergstrand 2004, 2007; Egger and Larch 2008; Bergstrand and Egger 2013) is relatively scant. This paper contributes to existing literature by providing a systematic analysis of services trade agreement (STA) membership with a particular eye on the adoption and role of unilateral services provisions. It takes hypotheses on STA formation from existing literature to data on STA membership up until August 2014, employing (unilateral) services provisions, embodied in the World Bank’s Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI; Borchert et al. 2014), as exogenous versus endogenous and other economic determinants as exogenous determinants thereof. Barriers to services trade typically take the form of behind-the-border regulatory measures that can completely prohibit or greatly restrict the cross-border flow of services. Such impediments to services transactions protect (reduce competition for) domestic services suppliers, but this distortion leads to a welfare loss for consumers, since they entail higher services input prices for (domestic as well as foreign) goods manufacturers, higher prices of final goods, and less consumption than would otherwise be possible. Liberalization of such barriers is easier within the confines of a preferential (bilateral or regional) agreement where proximity, whether geographic or cultural, favours closer institutional and regulatory ties and repeat interaction among regional officials and institutions (Shingal et al. 2018). In contrast to goods trade agreement (GTA) membership, STA formation does not generate a loss in tariff revenues and, hence, appears even more desirable than the preferential liberalization of goods trade from a welfare perspective. Conceptually, the larger the welfare gains from preferential services liberalization, the more likely are countries to negotiate an STA and like for GTAs (for instance see Baier and Bergstrand 2004), the relative desirability of STAs is likely to vary for large versus small countries, geographically remote versus central economies, and ones with highly versus less highly regulated services markets. We find that economies with more similar unilateral services regulatory provisions may also be more likely to negotiate preferential STAs. A similar finding is not observed with respect to “goods-only” trade agreements. Given that STA-membership is coincident with GTA-formation in the data, the latter finding justifies the choice of STRIs as explanatory variables in our identification strategy. Moreover, association with economic size of partners, factor endowments and services cost shares in GDP comes through more strongly for goods-only agreements, which further enables us to disentangle determinants of STA-formation from those of GTA-membership. Finally, remoteness from other countries’ goods trade is found to be negatively correlated with STA membership while remoteness from other countries services trade is found to be correlated positively. The paper thus extends the empirical analysis of GTA-formation in Baier and Bergstrand (2004), Egger and Larch (2008) and Baldwin and Jaimovich (2012) to STA-membership. Its main contribution lies in providing an economic explanation of unilateral services regulatory provisions, embodied in the STRI, and their interaction with services preferentialism. The paper’s findings on the role of unilateral services trade restrictiveness in the likelihood of STA membership and the comparison provided of the determinants of “GTA-only-” vs STA-formation are both novel results in this literature. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines hypotheses pertaining to STA formation from existing literature and in the process, relates this paper to earlier research on PTA membership. Section 3 presents the empirical model used to examine the hypotheses with respect to preferential services liberalization. Section 4 describes the dependent and explanatory variables used in the empirical analysis. Section 5 describes the data. Section 6 discusses the key estimation results while Sect. 7 discusses those from sensitivity analysis. Section 8 concludes.",4
157,1,Review of World Economics,20 August 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-020-00390-2,Does backward participation in global value chains affect countries’ current account position?,February 2021,Antonia López-Villavicencio,Valérie Mignon,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Economic globalization has brought about profound changes in international trade. Among all of them, one of the most prominent is the increasing dispersion of stages of production across countries in recent years. Indeed, the production structure of the past where goods or services remained within national borders was internationalized to take advantage of the decline in transportation costs, the adoption of more open trade policies as well as advances in information and communication technologies. This evolution towards international production fragmentation gave rise to various concepts and definitions among which global value chains (GVCs)Footnote 1—referring to the case where a source country produces intermediate goods that are used as inputs in other countries to produce/assemble the final good—play a key role. This international production process in which production is split into several stages and located in various countries refers to what Baldwin (2016) called the second unbundling of globalization—the first one being the separation between production and consumption countries. International fragmentation has been accompanied by increasing participation of countries in GVCs, with intense involvement of emerging and developing economies (Gary et al. 2001; Cattaneo et al. 2010; Baldwin 2014). The consequence of this process was a steady increase in trade flows, particularly in intermediate goods and services.Footnote 2 According to Krugman et al. (1995), international fragmentation is among the main key changes explaining the sharp rise in the trade to GDP ratio since the mid-eighties. This dispersion of production stages across countries may also explain why some of them display very high levels of export propensity, given that their exports incorporate a very low share of domestic value-added (De Backer et al. 2018). As a result of this evolution of the global production process, it is highly relevant to study current account balances by accounting for the relationships between trade and international production, i.e., by paying attention to participation in GVCs. Indeed, as widely documented in the literature,Footnote 3 the 2008 financial and economic crisis was preceded by a dramatic increase in global imbalances, whose level remains still high despite the adjustments since 2009. These simultaneous developments suggest that the presence of global imbalances cannot be dissociated from the process of globalization and the expansion of GVCs. The literature addressing this issue is quite scarce, and has detected one main mechanism through which GVCs could impact a country’s current account.Footnote 4 According to this mechanism, higher participation in GVC implies a larger share of a country’s exports that represents value-added to its imported intermediates. The resulting increase in the economy’s trade balance feeds through to the current account balance. This transmission channel has been investigated by Brumm et al. (2019) who developed a two-country international real business cycle model with trade in both final consumption goods and intermediate inputs in production—domestic and imported intermediates being imperfect substitutes in production. Assuming that the efficiency of imported intermediates in home production is subject to transitory shocks, the authors show that a positive shock (i) increases the share of foreign value-added incorporated in home exports, and (ii) stimulates, through improvements in competitiveness of home exports, foreign demand for domestic goods and home income. Accordingly, the shock being transitory, at equilibrium, the domestic economy saves part of its income gains to smooth consumption through time, resulting in current account surpluses. Note that this interpretation is, in principle, limited to one exclusive form of participation in GVC, namely backward participation, which consists of importing intermediate goods or services that are then used to assemble the final product that is exported.Footnote 5 Two additional points, forgotten in the above-hypothesized mechanism, should however be mentioned. Firstly, increasing GVC participation should have a positive effect on the current account position because, especially in the case of backward participation, higher participation implies that there are more imports which are then used as inputs for exports. Indeed, when domestic firms increase their GVC participation, they achieve a gain in competitiveness since they substitute less expensive imported intermediate goods for those produced domestically. However, if we look at the current account, we should consider that even if exports are increasing, imports are also rising with higher participation. The relationship between GVC participation and the current account is, therefore, ambiguous.Footnote 6 From an empirical viewpoint, by relying on a sample of 26 countries and considering the IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA) model, Brumm et al. (2019) show that stronger GVC participation is associated with larger current account balances. Secondly, in addition to the decomposition between exports and imports, current account balances are determined by saving and investment decisions (see Chinn and Prasad 2003). As a response to competitiveness and income gains, investment is likely to be triggered, stimulating, in turn, the inflow (supply) of foreign capital in support of this new type of investment. These imports of capital goods are recorded as increases in the current account deficit. Our paper departs from Brumm et al. (2019)—which is the closest article to ours—in several aspects. First, we put together data covering 57 countries, providing a larger data set than previous studies linking the current account and GVCs. Second, we rely on several empirical specifications to ensure the robustness of our results. In particular, while Haltmaier (2005) and Brumm et al. (2019) deal with static representations, we additionally consider a dynamic specification to account for the persistence of imbalances. Allowing for such inertia in our framework is of primary interest as persistence of disequilibria in several countries—especially industrial—has become a key issue.Footnote 7 Third, we disaggregate our indicator of backward linkages to explore sectoral differences; the effect of importing foreign inputs being not necessarily homogeneous among the different sectors in the economy. In particular, distinguishing goods and services seem to be interesting, due to the evolving role of services in GVCs. Although, at the origin, GVCs were mainly concerned with goods, services are today increasingly disaggregated and traded as separate tasks—typical examples being back-office and data processing services. Due to this increased GVC-related trade in services, one may expect to find similar results regarding the link between involvement in GVC and current account position for both goods and services. Finally, we complement our investigation by paying particular attention to the impacts of GVC participation on the dynamics of (i) imports of intermediate and final goods and services and (ii) exports, which are key elements in the hypothesized mechanism that underlies the sign of the impact exerted by GVC participation on the current account balance. This is particularly important since a positive effect is expected if and only if the trade balance effects of the resulting competitiveness gain from producing domestically is higher than the increase in imports of intermediates. Moreover, the rise in domestic production due to this competitiveness gain may bring about further increases in imports of final and intermediate goods, not necessarily related to GVC participation. Our results show that backward GVC participation tends to deteriorate the current account position. This negative effect is stronger for services than for manufactured goods, although being significant in both cases. We further show that, whereas backward linkages in supply chains boost exports, the increase in imports of intermediates more than offsets the trade balance effects. Importantly also, we provide evidence that higher backward linkages lead to further increases in imports of final and intermediate goods, particularly capital and mixed end-use, not associated with GVC participation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the sample and data, and provides some brief stylized facts. Section 3 displays our main estimation results regarding the effect of GVCs on current account balances. It also provides some robustness checks related to (i) the sectoral level, (ii) the framework retained for modeling the current account dynamics, (iii) the subsets of countries and control variables, as well as an in-depth analysis of the effects of backward participation on imports, exports, and the trade balance. Section 4 concludes the paper.",
157,1,Review of World Economics,01 September 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-020-00391-1,Understanding economic openness: a review of existing measures,February 2021,Claudius Gräbner,Philipp Heimberger,Florian Springholz,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The impact of economic openness on domestic economies has been a prime area of interest within both the scientific community as well as the wider public. The relevant debates, however, use a great diversity of concepts to describe the extent of international economic integration: terms like ‘trade openness’, ‘economic integration’, ‘trade liberalization’ and ‘globalization’ are widely used when the general increase in economic openness during the last decades is addressed. The same observation holds true for the financial dimension, where terms like ‘financial openness’, ‘financial integration’ and ‘financial globalization’ are used regularly and often interchangeably (e.g., Kose et al. 2009; De Nicolo and Juvenal 2014; Saadma and Steiner 2016). In analogy to this variety of terms and concepts, a large variety of measures of economic openness have been developed. These measures typically emphasize different aspects of economic integration. As a consequence, not only the definition, but also the measurement of openness has varied considerably over the past three decades and a corresponding lack of consensus on how to best measure economic openness has been widely acknowledged (e.g. Yanikkaya 2003; Squalli and Wilson 2011; Busse and Koeniger 2012; Huchet-Bourdon et al. 2017; Egger et al. 2019). At the same time, many econometric studies discount the underlying debate on the measurement of economic openness by simply employing the most popular measures without any in-depth explanations or justifications for doing so. Against this backdrop, this paper contributes to the literature by providing a systematic collection, categorization and evaluation of the most prominent openness indicators used in the relevant literature. The main purpose of our work is threefold: first, we provide applied researchers with relevant information to make an informed choice on the use of different openness indicators, which eventually depends on the specific questions and methods employed in their empirical work. Second, we highlight the practical implications of choosing some openness indicator by showing how empirical outcomes change when different openness indicators are used. Third, we compile a data set on openness indicators to be used in further research, where the data are based on 216 countries over the time period 1960–2019, although coverage for individual openness variables varies widely in the country and time dimension. Researcher can access this data set via an openly available R package through which we are able to provide regular updates of the data discussed in this paper, including references to all the primary sources for the relevant indicators.Footnote 1. In this context, we will operate under two restrictions: first, we consider only measures that are available over a time period of at least 20 years. Second, we restrict ourselves to direct measures of economic openness. As a consequence, we exclude instrumental variables that are sometimes developed to deal with endogeneity problems and to estimate causal effects of openness indicators on outcome measures such as economic growth,Footnote 2 as well as indicators based on extensive models of domestic economies (e.g. Waugh and Ravikumar 2016). While these approaches deserve their own assessment, we confine ourselves to direct measures of economic openness for two main reasons: first, finding a suitable instrument or model capturing trade openness is heavily context-dependent and requires additional theoretical assumptions (e.g. exclusion restrictions). Thus, a general assessment of such instruments seems difficult to undertake. Second, direct openness measures as discussed below are not only a prerequisite for instrument design, but also predominant in most of the applied literature (e.g. Dreher et al. 2010; Martens et al. 2015; Potrafke 2015). The paper proceeds as follows: the next section introduces a typology for openness indicators by discussing the distinction between ‘trade’ and ‘financial’ openness, which have a ‘de-facto’ and ‘de-jure’ dimension, respectively. We classify the most commonly used openness measures according to this typology. Section 3 provides descriptive trends of the most relevant openness indicators, while Sect. 4 analyzes the relationship of these indicators by inspecting the correlations between different openness measures. Section 5 highlights the practical implications of choosing among different measures in a growth regression framework. Section 6 summarizes and concludes the paper.",22

The long-held principle of the “freedom of the seas” is crucial for safe and frictionless international movement of maritime cargo. At present, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) is the international legal framework around the freedom of the seas, establishing guidelines for resource extraction, trade, and sovereignty over the oceans (UNCLOS 1982). Importantly, the UNCLOS gives nations territorial claims on waters up to 12 nautical miles offshore, but allows transit passage (also called “innocent passage”) for all countries’ military and civilian ships through both territorial waters and the high seas beyond.Footnote 1 In recent years, however, numerous geopolitical tensions and threats by state actors seem to potentially impede freedom of movement through international waters.

In Southeast Asia, several nations have disputes over island chains in the South China Sea. The efforts of China to transform offshore reefs and shoals into artificial islands and build naval bases, as well as the “Freedom of Navigation Operations” by the U.S. and British navies, have further heightened uncertainty in the region.Footnote 2 These tensions were reflected by a stand-off between Chinese and Vietnamese navy ships on July 2019 over geological surveys in disputed waters.Footnote 3 This paper investigates the impact of a potential long-run disruption of navigation through the Southeast Asian sea lanes on trade and welfare. In particular, we simulate a complete shutdown of maritime shipping through the South China Sea and all the east-west passages in the Indonesian archipelago, causing shipping between the Pacific and Indian oceans to reroute south of Australia. We do so by solving for the shortest actual and counterfactual maritime trade routes between existing ports and the associated sea distances using GIS software. Using the increased distances in a quantitative general equilibrium model, we calculate the trade and welfare effects of moving from the initial to the counterfactual state. Depending on parameterization, the average welfare loss from the disruption of regional maritime trade ranges from 6.2 to 12.4% for the countries in the East Asia, South East Asia, and Pacific regions. For these countries, the magnitude of real GDP losses is also correlated with their military spending as a proportion of GDP, suggesting that they respond to the perceived risk and cost of a possible conflict. Antecedent work on the rerouting of maritime trade falls into two lines. The first uses the opening and closure of major canals as quasi-natural experiments to causally estimate the effect of trade on incomes (Feyrer 2009; Maurer and Rauch 2019). The second line uses these events to estimate distance elasticities of trade and quantify equilibrium trade and welfare effects (Hugot and Dajud 2016, 2017). To our knowledge, we are the first to apply quantitative trade analysis to counterfactual scenarios involving the South China Sea.Footnote 4",2

Twenty-first-century trade and production are structured around so-called global value chains (GVCs) where stages of a single production process are dispersed internationally. It is often argued that GVCs have offered a new path towards industrial development, since firms from high-technology nations are combining their firm-specific managerial, technical and marketing know-how with the low wages in developing nations (Baldwin 2016). However, little is known about the implications of GVCs in supporting the international transfer of technology to firms in developing countries. Nowadays, most trade concerns the movement of inputs between and across countries. According to the OECD (2015), three-quarters of world trade involves intermediate and capital goods. The increasing importance of input trade has accompanied a parallel increase in the customisation of products (Antràs and Staiger 2012). As a result, to minimise the transaction costs involved with the production and incorporation of inputs into final goods, the firm leading the supply chain (hereafter ‘the buyer’) may transfer intellectual property rights and know-how to its suppliers.Footnote 1 As Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez (2015) states, “When Toyota makes car parts in Thailand, they do not rely on local know-how; they bring Toyota technology, Toyota management, Toyota logistics and any other bits of know-how needed since the Thai-made parts have to fit seamlessly into the company’s production network” (p. 1684). According to Antràs and Staiger (2012), intermediate input purchases tend to be associated with significant lock-in effects for both buyers and sellers. For example, differentiated intermediate inputs are frequently customised to meet the needs of their intended buyers and hence embody a disproportionate amount of relationship-specific investments (Nunn 2007), which may be difficult to recoup when transacting with various parties. Moreover, offshoring often involves a costly search for suitable foreign suppliers or foreign buyers, making separations expensive and thereby providing another source of lock-in. The competitive pressure imposed on firms participating in a supply chain is crucial for firms in developing countries.Footnote 2 Rigo (2017) argues that the fragmentation of production processes has significantly affected manufacturing firms in developing nations, showing that a common set of technologies and capabilities correlate with firms’ participation in complex international activities. While global buyers, which to date reside overwhelmingly in developed countries, take great care to protect their technologies or product innovations, they may be willing to share their knowledge with their foreign suppliers in developing countries to reduce the costs and uncertainty of trading intermediate goods along global or regional supply chains.Footnote 3 This paper tests for this prediction by investigating whether GVCs may incentivise the transfer of foreign technologies to firms in developing countries. My findings contribute to the literature in three respects. First, I examine the implications of international trade on an empirically unexplored channel of technology transfer, namely, foreign licensing.Footnote 4 Based on a representative sample of manufacturing firms for 130 developing nations, Rigo (2017) shows that those firms using foreign-licensed technology account for 30% of employment (on average), similar to the figure for foreign-owned firms. This evidence suggests that foreign licensing may be an essential and alternative channel to foreign direct investment (FDI) for the transfer of international technologies to developing countries. Second, I investigate whether the complexity of the firm’s trading status affects the licensing of foreign technology to firms in developing countries. The literature has shown that the transfer of technology through international trade may depend on several factors, but this is the first paper, to the best of the author’s knowledge, that distinguishes between simple traders (defined as exporters-only or importers-only) and complex traders (two-way traders) in studying the international transfer of technology. Third, I consider the implications of acquiring a foreign-licensed technology on firms’ performance. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of 3340 manufacturing firms from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys. These surveys are harmonised to construct a two-year panel data set for 18 developing and emerging economies covering the period 2006-2016.Footnote 5 To control for the potential endogeneity embedded in the relationship between international trade and technology adoption, my empirical strategy combines a propensity score matching (PSM) technique with a difference-in-differences (diff-in-diff) approach. As a first step, I use a PSM technique to match each firm participating in a GVC (treatment group) with a synthetic counterfactual (control group). This matching process pairs up each firm that will start a complex trading activity in the future (i.e. firms becoming two-way traders) with a domestic plant or a simple trader having very similar observable characteristics. I then calculate the average difference in the probability of using foreign-licensed technology between firms becoming involved in complex trading activities and their matched control firms. This strategy allows controlling for observable time-variant and unobservable time-invariant firm characteristics.Footnote 6 The results show a positive effect of being involved in complex trading activity on the licensing of foreign technology. Firms becoming two-way traders are significantly more likely to use foreign-licensed technology than firms starting to export or import. This evidence suggests that the complexity associated with the mode of internationalisation determines the licensing of foreign technology. The second part of my empirical analysis investigates the impact of acquiring foreign-licensed technology on firm-level productivity. Using once again a PSM diff-in-diff approach, I find that foreign licensing leads to large increases in total factor productivity (TFP) and labour productivity. The improvement is on the order of 88% for TFP and 50% for labour productivity. These findings suggest that GVC participation through access to foreign technologies fosters firms’ performance. The empirical literature has long considered international trade a channel of technology transfer. Exposure to international markets may bring several advantages (better quality inputs and higher revenues), which may lead to productivity gains (Amiti and Konings 2007; Topalova and Khandelwal 2011; Halpern et al. 2015) and motivate firms to invest further in upgrading their technology (Bustos 2011; Lileeva and Trefler 2010). Moreover, firms that export are expected to absorb new knowledge from foreign markets and buyers. However, learning by exporting is far from guaranteed and is conditional on several factors. For instance, such learning tends to occur more when firms are exporting to advanced economies (De Loecker 2007), when they are exporting multiple products or to multiple destinations (Masso and Vahter 2015), or when firms are involved in knowledge-intensive activities (Benkovskis et al. 2020). Coherently with this literature, I show that GVC participation may unlock the international transfer of knowledge to a further degree. This paper also relates to the recent empirical literature studying the impact of GVCs on economic development. Recent macro evidence points to the beneficial role of GVCs in developing nations’ industrial development (Kummritz 2016; Constantinescu et al. 2019; Altomonte et al. 2018). More closely related to my paper, Piermartini and Rubinova (2014) provide evidence that GVCs are a much stronger facilitator of knowledge spillovers than final goods trade. Coherently, this paper reveals that GVC participation can enhance developing countries’ learning possibilities through the introduction of new foreign technologies. A related body of empirical literature using firm-level data shows that GVC participation fosters firms’ performance in developing countries (Gereffi 1999; Pietrobelli and Saliola 2008; Atkin et al. 2017; Del Prete et al. 2017; Benkovskis et al. 2020). My paper extends this literature, illustrating how through foreign licensing, GVC participation generates significant productivity gains in manufacturing firms in developing and emerging economies. Finally, FDI represents another major channel of international technology transfer (see Javorcik (2013) for a review of the literature). Studies indicate that multinational enterprises are responsible for the majority of technology advancements, which they can bring to their host countries (Arnold and Javorcik 2009; Jiang et al. 2018), especially through supply chain linkages. Newman et al. (2015) show that multinational enterprises transfer their technology and methods to their operations in destination markets through supply chain activities. Alfaro-Urena et al. (2019) find that firms in Costa Rica experienced strong and persistent improvements in performance after starting to supply multinationals. My paper complements this literature, suggesting that through foreign licensing multinational enterprises might transfer international technology to their suppliers located in developing countries. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 presents the data and discusses measurement issues, Sect. 3 lays out the empirical strategy and presents the main findings and Sect. 4 summarises the conclusions.",17
157,2,Review of World Economics,12 October 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-020-00396-w,Customs brokers as intermediaries in international trade,May 2021,Hege Medin,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"A recent strand in economic research concerns how intermediaries like merchants facilitate international trade by making it possible for firms unable to handle all trade-related issues by themselves to participate in international markets. This, in turn, can boost aggregated trade flows. I argue that another type of intermediary–customs brokers–can play a similar role. In Norway, all exported or imported goods must pass through customs and be declared, and a producer can choose between handling the customs declaration by itself (henceforth: self-declare) or engaging the services of a broker to do this. I use an exhaustive panel of Norwegian manufacturing producers’ trade transactions containing information on usage of customs brokers. The data reveal that outsourcing of customs brokerage is very common. To my knowledge, customs brokers have rarely been studied in economics before, and this is the first article to document the use of such brokers in a whole population or even representative sample of firms. Building on the seminal Melitz (2003) model of international trade, Ahn et al. (2011) proposed a model in which exporting firms avoid paying high fixed costs of reaching foreign customers by using a merchant (referred to as a trading company) to sell their goods in foreign markets. This comes at the expense of lower operating profits, however, as the exporter has to pay a de facto fee to the merchant (which is proportional to the traded value). Other, similar models have been proposed by scholars like Felbermayr and Jung (2011), Crozet et al. (2013), Bai et al. (2017) and Akerman (2018), focusing on, respectively, wholesaler subsidiaries; quality differences; learning by exporting and economies of scope. The survey article of Blum et al. (2018, p. 20) refers to these models jointly as the canonical model of export intermediation. The model has the feature that a third type of firm emerges in equilibrium in addition to the exporters and non-exporters in Melitz (2003). Like in that model, a producer’s operating profits from exporting to a given market is proportional to the value exported, and a sorting pattern arises where only the most productive firms export, because they are the only ones that earn enough to cover the market specific fixed exporting costs. The new feature is that firms of intermediate productivity levels export indirectly through merchants, as this involves lower fixed exporting costs (but also higher variable ones).Footnote 1 Consequently, the model predicts that larger and more productive producers exporting sizeable values to more profitable markets with lower trade costs are less likely to use intermediaries. There are some empirical studies that, for selected countries, find patterns in accordance with the intermediation model. In contrast to the present study, all of these define the intermediary as a merchant like a wholesaler or retailer, and such merchants are found to account for significant shares of trade (see footnote 5). Two different approaches are used in the literature. In what will here be referred to as the intermediary approach, the intermediaries as such are compared to producers that trade without using them (henceforth: direct trading producers). Ahn et al. (2011), Crozet et al. (2013) and Akerman (2018) all used customs declaration data from, respectively, China, France and Sweden, and showed that the share of exports accounted for by merchants was larger in destination markets with lower profitability (e.g. lower GDP) and higher trade costs (e.g. higher tariffs).Footnote 2 However, such data typically do not contain information on the intermediary-users; that is, the producers that export or import through the merchants. The scholars were therefore not able study how producer-features affected intermediary-use. In what will be referred to as the intermediary-user approach, in contrast, the direct trading producers are compared to producers who channel their trade through intermediaries. Studies applying this approach found that a producer’s inclination to trade directly rather than via a merchant was positively associated with measures of firm level profitability, such as the number of employees (Abel-Koch 2013; Ahn et al. 2011; Maurseth and Medin 2019), labour-productivity (Ahn et al. 2011; McCann 2013; Grazzi and Tomasi 2016) and foreign ownership (Abel-Koch 2013; McCann 2013; Maurseth and Medin 2019). All these studies used firm level survey data from one or several developing countries. The data were based on interviews with producers that traded, either directly or via merchants, but not the merchant used. The scholars were therefore not able to study the intermediaries as such. Nor were they able to study how intermediary-use related to partner country characteristics, as such information was not available in the data.Footnote 3 The data also had other limitations. Being based on interviews of samples of firms rather than register data, they yielded less accurate information; and they were mostly cross-sectional and hence provided limited possibilities for controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. Fixed trade costs may not only accrue when searching for foreign contacts, but also when complying with trade and customs procedures. Grainger (2008) points out that many costs like that are fixed, as they involve, for instance, ‘purchase of specialist IT systems and employment of dedicated staff’ (p. 26). This is also the case in Norway. The Directorate of Norwegian Customs informs that declarants must purchase special software, familiarise themselves with regulations and complete an electronic form for each declaration (shipment). Relevant certificates, like health certificates for food, must also be obtained. Further, declarants must hold customs credit, and must calculate and pay taxes and duties.Footnote 4 Such customs related transaction costs are not negligible. Verwaal and Donkers (2003) found that they, on average, constituted 2% of the traded value among Dutch firms. They varied largely among firms, however, and there were indications of economies of scale. Relatedly, WTO (2016) found that border procedures were the third most important trade barrier for EU firms operating in the US (after product standards). In the model of intermediation, the merchants face lower fixed trade costs, either by assumption or due to economies of scope. In addition, they may be better able to overcome such costs by pooling trade from many producers. Similarly, customs brokers are likely to face lower fixed customs clearance costs than produces since they specialise in handling border procedures. Furthermore, in the article it is shown that brokers handle trade from several different producers, and that each broker-handle considerably larger values than each producer. Consequently, not only merchants, but also customs brokers may facilitate trade by offering reduced fixed trade costs for producers that use their services. Using brokers is costly, however, their services must be purchased, and thus, the choice between hiring brokers and self-declare is likely to be a trade-off between fixed and variable trade costs, just as in the model of intermediation. If this holds, the predictions from that model should also be relevant for broker-use, and we should expect that producers trading small values hire brokers, and those trading large values self-declare. This prediction is studied here. In addition to providing evidence of a new type of intermediary and focusing on a country not previously studied in this regard, this article also offers several contributions to the empirical literature on trade intermediaries. In contrast to other studies, I have in the same data information on the intermediaries themselves (customs brokers), as well as on the two types of producers; those that trade directly (self-declarants) and those that rely on intermediaries (broker-users). I am therefore able to merge the intermediary and intermediary-user approaches, thereby providing a more consistent and comprehensive investigation of intermediary-use. I first use highly disaggregated data–at the declaration level, to show that there is a positive correlation between the probability of a producer self-declaring a single declaration and its trade value. This is consistent with producers avoiding fixed customs clearing costs by hiring brokers when they trade small values. The correlation may be spurious, however, and unlike other studies, I therefore control for characteristics of producers, countries and products at the same time–observed as well as unobserved–by aggregating the data and using the panel dimension. The correlation between tendency to self-declare and trade value is still positive. Apart from that, only producer level features affect intermediary-use. This contrasts studies of merchant-intermediaries, especially those using the intermediary approach, which generally found that country- and product characteristics also affected the tendency to trade directly. This underlines the importance of controlling for all these features at the same time. Most other studies of intermediary-use, whether theoretical or empirical, have focused solely on how intermediaries facilitate exports. But, importing may also involve fixed costs that can be reduced by using intermediaries. This is likely to be the case as regards customs clearance because procedures are similar for clearing goods into as well as out of Norway. To compare the trade-facilitating role of brokers in exports and imports, I conduct all analyses for both modes of trade. In line with what a few other studies have found for merchant-intermediaries, I find that brokers-intermediaries are more commonly used in exporting than importing, and that effects are similar for the two modes of trade.Footnote 5 In the following, Sect. 2 discusses some concepts, Sect. 3 presents the data and provides some descriptive statistics, Sect. 4 presents empirical evidence of customs-brokers acting as trade facilitators and Sect. 5 offers some conclusions.",1
157,2,Review of World Economics,27 October 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-020-00397-9,Tariff scheme choice,May 2021,Kazunobu Hayakawa,Nuttawut Laksanapanyakul,Taiyo Yoshimi,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"During the 2010s, regional trade agreements (RTAs) were negotiated among numerous countries to reap the benefits of trade liberalization. RTAs with many countries are called “mega” RTAs. Recent examples of mega RTAs include the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP); the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership; and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). RTA networks between each country pair will likely overlap with mega RTAs. For example, Mexico entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and the U.S., which overlaps with the CPTPP. Mexican firms must choose between a most-favored-nation (MFN) scheme and multiple RTA schemes (NAFTA or CPTPP) when they export to Canada. As this example indicates, firms increasingly face decisions between multiple RTA schemes as the number of mega RTAs has increased. With multiple RTA schemes available, firms find it difficult to choose a tariff scheme.Footnote 1 Firms are required to adhere to the rules of origin (RoO) and obtain certificates of origin (CoO) when they use RTA tariff schemes. To certify the origin of goods, exporters must collect the required documents, such as a list of inputs, a production flowchart, production instructions, invoices for each input, and contract documents. This process arises as an exporter’s fixed cost for RTA utilization. When exporters choose between an MFN and RTA scheme, they examine whether the benefit of RTA tariff rates, which are generally lower than MFN rates, exceeds the fixed costs for RTA utilization. However, given multiple RTA schemes, exporters must consider the distinction among them, which stem from tariff rates and RoO. Exporters compare tariff rates and RoO across RTA schemes to select the best one. Furthermore, a change in tariff rates in one RTA influences the probability not only that this RTA is chosen but also that other RTAs are chosen. As the number of overlapping RTAs increases, such interaction effects are more likely to be present. This study empirically investigates the determinants of choosing a tariff scheme when multiple RTA schemes are available. We use data on Thailand imports from other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries in 2014 for two primary reasons.Footnote 2 First, the data allows us to identify the tariff schemes (e.g., MFN or RTA) used in each transaction. We obtained the data, which covers all commodity imports, from the Customs Office of the Kingdom of Thailand. Product coverage is important for our study because we need sufficient variation in the tariff rates and the RoO across products.Footnote 3 Second, at least seven tariff schemes were available for Thai imports from ASEAN countries in 2014: an MFN scheme, the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), the ASEAN–Australia–New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA), the ASEAN–China FTA (ACFTA), the ASEAN–India FTA (AIFTA), the ASEAN–Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership (AJCEP), and the ASEAN–Korea FTA (AKFTA). Exporters from ASEAN to Thailand can apply any of these seven schemes for any product. By examining this trade flow in 2014, we can investigate how firms choose tariff schemes, given multiple RTA schemes. Our study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, we use discrete choice models, which are tractable in expanding the set of alternatives, i.e., the number of RTA schemes. Studies on the determinants of choosing preference schemes typically explore cases where a single preference scheme is available in addition to an MFN clause (e.g., Ju and Krishna 2005; Cadot et al. 2006; Cadot and de Melo 2007; Francois et al. 2006; Manchin 2006; Hakobyan 2015). Similar studies have been conducted with two preferential schemes and an MFN scheme (e.g., Bureau et al. 2007; Hayakawa 2014; Hayakawa et al. 2019). However, the empirical method we propose in this study is the nested logit model with two stages, which is based on a theoretical study on a firm’s tariff scheme choice (Demidova and Krishna 2008; Cherkashin et al. 2015) and can easily expand the number of alternatives (i.e., RTAs). Thus, our methodology ensures a more flexible framework. The upper stage includes two nests and describes the choice between the MFN and RTA schemes, while the lower stage describes a specific tariff scheme. As a natural extension, we also estimate the mixed logit model, which is more flexible in terms of substitution among alternatives than the nested logit model.Footnote 4 Another advantage of using the discrete choice model is that it enables us to conduct the following three quantitative analyses. First, we examine how changes in tariff rates in one tariff scheme influence choice probabilities of this and other tariff schemes. Specifically, this study computes the elasticities of the probability of choosing each scheme in terms of tariff rates. Thereafter, it quantitatively demonstrates how differently the tariff reduction in one RTA influences the choice between this, other RTAs, and an MFN scheme. This analysis reveals the detailed interaction effects of tariff rates on the choice probability of each tariff scheme. The second analysis is to estimate the elasticity with respect to transaction values according to export countries. This provides an insight into the difference in the magnitude of fixed costs for RTA utilization across countries because larger transaction values lead to larger benefits to cover the associated fixed costs; thus, elasticity is expected to be higher when fixed costs are lower.Footnote 5 The third analysis is indicating the extent to which scheduled tariff reduction influences the choice probability of each tariff scheme. Furthermore, we investigate how this choice probability changes if the RoO in all RTAs are set to the least restrictive type. These simulation analyses will help predict each RTA’s utilization in the final year of tariff reduction and the impacts of revising RoO to a relatively more business-friendly type on RTA utilization. Our paper’s second contribution is to examine the role of a most disaggregated measure on transaction sizes. The existing studies have used aggregated trade values to examine the “size” effect on preference utilization. Examples of the measures used in the literature include country-level annual trade values (e.g., Hakobyan 2015) or the district-level monthly average of trade values (e.g., Keck and Lendle 2012). These aggregated measures mask the difference in transaction sizes across exporting firms. We utilized transaction-level import data. For example, one firm may import one product from one country multiple times even within one day. We identify these observations of multiple transactions and then examine how the transaction size affects a firm’s tariff scheme choice. The use of transaction-level data is crucial when examining an exporting firm’s choice on tariff schemes. Because the information on tariff schemes used in international trade is collected in the customs of importing countries and not in exporting countries, it is a usual limitation to rely on import data. However, in our study, we do not use aggregated data like firm-level data on annual imports because they are not necessarily associated with the characteristics or decisions of a specific exporting firm, especially when a firm imports from multiple exporting firms. Only at the transaction level, can the trade information be linked with a specific exporting/importing firm. In sum, using transaction-level data is the desirable strategy for examining exporting firms’ decisions from import-side data. Our estimation results indicate that RTA schemes are likely to be chosen rather than the MFN scheme when our disaggregated measure of transaction size is larger. Our third contribution is to improve the empirical identification strategy when examining the role of tariff rates and RoO. Unlike the framework in the literature (e.g., Carrere and de Melo 2006), our analysis is a cross-RTA analysis with regard to a product rather than a cross-product analysis within an RTA scheme. In other words, we elucidate the difference in RoO for one product across RTAs, whereas the literature uses the difference in RoO in an RTA across products. In the latter, the difference in the effect of the RoO on RTA utilization depends on not only the difference in RoO per se but also the difference in product characteristics. In particular, if product characteristics (e.g., export competitiveness) affect both the selection of RoO and the tariff scheme choice, the estimates will be biased. In our study, we directly compare RoO in each product, and our results on the effect of the RoO are not driven by differences in product characteristics. Indeed, our results on the magnitude order of the negative effects across RoO differ from those obtained in previous studies. Furthermore, thanks to the richer variation of RoO in our study RTAs, we can examine the effects of more types of RoO than previous studies. The remainder of this paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 specifies the nested logit model for empirical analyses. Section 3 explains the data sources and presents a brief overview of RTAs in Thailand. Section 4 discusses the estimation results. Section 5 provides some quantitative interpretation of our estimation results, and Sect. 6 concludes our study.",3

157,2,Review of World Economics,11 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-020-00401-2,Income inequality and the quality of imports,May 2021,Andrea Ciani,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In a world of rising earning disparities within and across countries, income inequality can be an important determinant of trade patterns.Footnote 1 So far, the literature has mainly focused on the effect of international trade on inequality.Footnote 2 Nonetheless, Mitra and Trindade (2005), and Fajgelbaum et al. (2011) assess the relevance of the effect working in the opposite direction: income disparities within countries influence trade flows.Footnote 3 Evidence shows that rich countries import more high-quality goods (Hallak 2006; Hummels and Lugovskyy 2009). Indeed, since quality demand increases with household income (Bils and Klenow 2001), firms export their most expensive products to destinations with high income per capita.Footnote 4 Although several studies investigated how income per capita affects trade flows, the role of the income distribution remained overlooked. Within this context, assessing how income inequality affects import demand is crucial for the optimal pricing strategy of the firm and for policy makers, whose actions affecting inequality might influence international trade patterns. This study employs detailed firm-level data to determine if income inequality in the destination country influences the quality and the unit value of imported products.Footnote 5 The unit value is widely considered a reliable proxy for quality (Schott 2004; Feenstra and Romalis 2014), although it might be affected by variations in manufacturing costs or markups. Khandelwal (2010) relaxes the quality equals unit value assumption assigning higher quality to products with higher market shares, conditional on price.Footnote 6 This paper contributes to the literature investigating whether unit value and product quality are similarly affected by variations in income inequality, once accounting for other country-level determinants of import demand. Among these, we focus on the role of income per capita and on its interaction with inequality. Detailed data enables us to consider factors affecting the pricing strategy of the firm, such as market power and different product characteristics. In order to shed light on firm-level heterogeneous responses to market conditions, we assess whether incumbent exporters in the destination market respond differently to income inequality with respect to entrant firms.Footnote 7 This empirical analysis relies on data from Bulgarian firms exporting manufactured products in the period 2001–2006. Bulgaria in the years under observation was further liberalizing its trade regime in view of becoming a member of the European Union in January 2007. During this period, the transition economy experienced fast economic growth accompanied by a relevant increase in the exports of manufactured products (Gorodnichenko et al. 2014).Footnote 8 Evidence shows that both the extensive and the intensive margin of trade for firms in transition economies were affected by the EU accession process (Benkovskis and Rimgailaite 2011). This gives us the possibility to observe the trade performance of new and incumbent exporters from a European transition economy undergoing economic liberalization. Empirical results, accounting for firm and product level determinants varying over time, show that income inequality in the importing country is negatively associated with the unit value and the quality of products exported by Bulgarian firms. A standard deviation increase in our proxy for income inequality, the interdecile ratio, is associated with 0.85% lower unit value and 0.97% lower product quality. These effects are economically relevant and comparable in magnitude to variations in unit value and quality due to other, previously considered, determinants of import demand. Moreover, we find that exporting firms ship high-quality products to richer destinations: income per capita in the importing country is positively correlated with the two dependent variables.Footnote 9 Interestingly, we observe that the correlation between inequality and unit value is negative, significant, and larger in magnitude for richer importing countries. Empirical results discussed in the present study are largely consistent with theoretical predictions obtained from frameworks based on hierarchical preferences (Bekkers et al. 2012) and demand systems allowing consumers in all parts of the income distribution to consume differentiated products (Simonovska 2015).Footnote 10 According to these frameworks, when exporting firms maximize profits not only serving high-income consumers but selling positive amounts to both rich and poor consumers, a higher income inequality in the importing country can be associated with lower prices and quality. The importance to distinguish between unit value and product quality becomes apparent when considering firm-level heterogeneity in market presence (Rodrigue and Tan 2019). We find that incumbent firms react to higher inequality lowering unit values without changing the quality of exported products, while firms entering the same market for the first-time supply goods of lower quality, independently of income inequality. Our main finding is robust to alternative specifications. First, we attempt to address the possible endogeneity of our explanatory variable employing two novel instruments measuring the availability of foreign and domestic newspapers in the importing country 10 years before each trade flow occurs (Buehlmann et al. 2011). Both instruments are strongly and negatively associated with our proxy for income inequality while not being affected by the quality and the price of products imported 10 years after. Estimates confirm that inequality impacts negatively both dependent variables. Second, we observe that income inequality is negatively correlated with unit value and quality when considering exports of consumer goods, while unit values of intermediate products are not significantly correlated with inequality. This result confirms that demand factors rather than supply-side determinants (e.g. FDI) mainly explain our findings. Third, the main result is confirmed using a different measure of income inequality, the Gini index. We then introduce several proxies for firm market power in a product-destination pair to consider within-firm adjustments in markups. Our finding holds when controlling for market shares (Amiti et al. 2014) and for product-level demand elasticities in the importing country (Broda et al. 2006). Finally, the alternative proxy for product quality proposed in Khandelwal et al. (2013) reports, as well, a negative correlation with income inequality. Theoretical channels. The role of income inequality as a determinant of demand can be investigated relying on different theoretical frameworks. Fajgelbaum et al. (2011) suggest that the fraction of domestic consumers buying products of higher quality increases with income, thus raising the average willingness to pay for high-quality products.Footnote 11 According to their framework, inequality within a country determines trade patterns and the pricing of traded goods. Variations in income inequality might decrease or increase prices and quality, depending on how demand changes in the different income groups. Discrete-choice models, starting from Flam and Helpman (1987), assume that individuals consume a homogeneous good in every desirable quantity and a vertically differentiated good whose consumption is fixed at unity. Nevertheless, the consumer can choose the quality of the differentiated good. Richer individuals consume more units of the homogeneous good and a higher quality of the differentiated good. If we assume income heterogeneity in the population under analysis, when the increase in income inequality leads to an income of the median consumer significantly lower than the average income, we obtain a negative relationship between income inequality and import quality. Indeed, the increase in income inequality increases demand for goods of lower quality. Bekkers et al. (2012) empirically validate the hierarchical demand model which predicts a negative relationship between import prices and income inequality. According to this framework, an increase in income inequality extends the budget set of high-income consumers which start demanding new varieties and consuming more units of the same product. For a given average income, higher income inequality as measured by the Atkinson index leads to higher price elasticity and lower import prices. This channel overturns increases in prices due to the increase in the weight of high-income consumers in total demand caused by higher inequality. Frameworks proposed by Flach and Janeba (2017) and Latzer and Mayneris (2018) predict a non-linear relationship between prices and income inequality. According to both models, prices increase with income inequality in economies characterized by low income per capita, while this relationship is reversed in economies with high income per capita. Therefore, rich economies demand more goods of lower quality when income inequality increases. Our results confirm the negative correlation between inequality and unit value when firms export to rich destinations, thus supporting the existence of an inverted u-shaped relation between income per capita in the importing country and the effect of inequality on quality. Moreover, since we observe firms exporting to the same destination for different time intervals, we can assess whether incumbent exporters respond differently than new exporters to variations in income inequality. This study also adds to the literature investigating how the size of the importing market influences the price of imported products. Hummels and Lugovskyy (2009) find that declining marginal utility of new varieties results in lower prices in larger markets and higher prices in richer destinations. Desmet and Parente (2010) show that firms operating in large markets obtain lower markups because of tougher competition. We focus on the role of income inequality as a demand determinant, and study how it affects the firm’s pricing strategy considering different market characteristics. The rest of the paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 describes the firm-level data at our disposal. Section 3 discusses the results. Section 4 reports the robustness checks. Section 5 concludes.",6

The empirical methodology of the BL contribution focussed on a regression of the forecast error in the output (GDP) growth rate on the planned fiscal consolidation of individual member states. Under rational expectations and assuming forecasters used the correct model for forecasting, the coefficient on the fiscal consolidation variable is expected to be zero. BL argued, however, that if forecasters underestimated the size of fiscal multipliers then there would be a negative and significant coefficient on the fiscal variable, which would explain the “growth disappointments” experienced by countries undertaking substantial fiscal retrenchment. Based on a sample of 26 European countries for the period 2010/2011, their baseline coefficient estimate on the fiscal consolidation variable was − 1.1. They employed a series of robustness tests, which backed up their central finding of a significant negative coefficient on the measure of consolidation. During the most severe of the European recession (2010 and 2011), therefore, BL interpret the true value of the multiplier as being about 1.6, that is the “normal times” multiplier of 0.5 plus the 1.1 value. Consequently, BL claim the substantial fiscal contraction of the period had a much more negative impact on output growth than was expected a priori. They also contend that the scale of their multiplier estimates could be conditional on the 2-year period over which they were estimated, one of deep recession in Europe. As member states respond to the damaging economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic through fiscal stimulus, and notwithstanding the state-dependency of multipliers, it is important to examine whether shortcomings arose with official forecasters’ estimates of fiscal multipliers in the EU after the recession of the early 2010s ended.Footnote 1 If official multipliers are estimated inaccurately in what BL refer to as “normal times”, and against the background of what has been learned from their assessment, then it suggests that it may be difficult to quantify the extent to which fiscal policy would address reduced demand in the economy arising from the effects of the pandemic. In this paper, we update then the BL analysis by applying their model to a sample of 26 EU member states over the period 2013–2018 using, in one dataset, the projections of ministries of finance (in their Stability and Convergence Programmes, henceforth SCPs) and, in a second dataset, those of the European Commission (in its Spring Forecasts).Footnote 2 GDP outturn data are sourced from the EU AMECO database. Assessing the accuracy of fiscal multipliers for this period provides a timely insight into how efficiently fiscal policy may or may not be implemented presently. The analysis is conducted over a period where changes to the EU fiscal rules enacted, in part, to support better macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting in the wake of the 2008–2012 financial and sovereign bond market crisis had taken effect. The European Semester was adopted in 2010 with the purpose of improving ex-ante economic and budgetary policies in the EU. Its introduction coincided with a new “six pack” (of five regulations and one directive) intended to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact and its “preventive arm” geared to providing detailed scrutiny of member states’ budgetary and macroeconomic forecasts. A concern that had been voiced in the policy literature was of a bias in official forecasts within Europe, with, for example, Jonung and Larch (2006), Frankel (2011), and Frankel and Schreger (2013) illustrating an “optimism bias” in official growth forecasts. In response to such academic studies and the experience of forecasting during the crisis (exemplified in BL’s findings), the Fiscal Compact, effective since 2013, provided for independent oversight of member states’ forecasting at the national level, including a role for independent forecasting authorities. BL also contend that official forecasts may improve due to learning, including from the 2010–2011 experience. This paper focuses then on the recent forecasting performance of member states and the European Commission against the background of the experience of the last economic crisis and where increased fiscal and forecasting oversight is in place at national and EU level. Our findings indicate that official forecasters continue to miscalculate the size of fiscal multipliers. Unlike BL, however, we find that forecasters now overestimate the effect of fiscal policy on output growth, as opposed to underestimating it. Our econometric results hold irrespective of whether the forecasts used are those of the member states or of the European Commission and are robust to the inclusion of control variables. The concluding section of the paper discusses the policy implications, both in general and in the new economic circumstances arising from the Covid-19 epidemic, of these results.",1
157,3,Review of World Economics,23 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-020-00404-z,Global governance and gross capital flows dynamics,August 2021,Nataliia Osina,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"One of the famous puzzles in macroeconomics, the Lucas (1990) paradox on “why doesn’t capital flow from rich to poor countries”, continues to exist and shapes capital flows in the modern world. However, our knowledge still lacks a solid empirical explanation of the main determinants of international capital flows. In the last decades, cross-border capital flows have increased significantly in both advanced and developing countries and this was reinforced by globalization and financial integration (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2007; Papaioannou 2009; IMF 2012; Alberola et al. 2016). Despite this trend in the world economy most developing countries still experience underinvestment to finance domestic markets (Prasad and Rajan 2008; Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2008; Dadush and Stancil 2011). This contradicts the neoclassical model with decreasing returns and frictionless markets that stresses the movement of capital from rich to poor countries where marginal returns are higher (Clemens and Heinemann 2013; Alvarez 2015). In practice, international capital flows are moving to the advanced countries and this observation is called the “Lucas Paradox”. This paper provides cross-country evidence on the role of financial and politico-institutional determinants in gross capital flows dynamics over the period 2000–2016. We argue that the main determinants of net capital flows are better understood if we explore gross capital flows and disentangle between capital inflows (i.e. foreign investments) and capital outflows (i.e. domestic investments).Footnote 1 Both gross foreign inflows (GFI) and gross domestic outflows (GDO) include all three categories of capital flows: foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio flows and other capital market flows. Using panel regressions incorporating country fixed effects, we find that institutional quality rather than the effect of diminishing returns of capital is a key explanation for the “Lucas Paradox”. An increase in countries’ institutional quality should draw more capital inflows if foreign investors look for safer investments and this is called “flight to quality”. Countries with a high level of government effectiveness and regulatory quality contribute to a market-friendly environment, stimulating domestic demand and foreign investment. While a higher level of political stability and rule of law in the countries may discourage illicit capital outflows as domestic residents might place more resources in their local country instead of overseas. These global governance indicators are useful to maintain favourable capital outflows dynamics and carry symmetric effect (Martin and Rey, 2000, 2001; Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2003; Dell’Ariccia et al. 2008; Binici et al. 2010; Alberola et al. 2016). However, voice and accountability and the level of corruption do not have an impact on gross capital outflows/private capital outflows. This paper explores the association between the multidimensional nature of financial development and gross capital flows. The primary contribution of the paper is to explore the effects of eight indices of financial development that reflect how developed financial institutions and financial markets are in terms of their depth, access, and efficiency.Footnote 2 A more developed domestic financial sector will contribute to greater private investors’ ability in acquiring foreign assets and sustainable issuance of foreign liabilities. This is evidenced by our empirical results that highlight the significance of the differences in gross capital inflows/outflows depending on the country’s level of financial development. However, this link disappears if to look at private capital outflows and suggests the impact of other factors e.g. tunnelling.Footnote 3 We analyze the role of financial institutions versus financial markets in the dissemination of gross capital flows. We provide new evidence on the predominant role of financial institutions versus financial markets in facilitating gross capital flows dynamics. For instance, financial institutions can provide information about risks in the local markets and this raises credibility to future profit and stimulates potential foreign investors to enter the market. While financial markets have advanced in ways that allow investors and companies to diversify their savings, and companies can now make money investing in stocks, bonds, and wholesale money markets, without using traditional bank lending. Although both financial institutions and financial markets are quite important determinants of gross capital flows, the majority of funding is still intermediated through financial institutions. The paper also provides useful insights into the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle (1980), which still exists in international macroeconomics and continues to be one of the important explanations for the “Lucas Paradox” (1990). We show that lower savings may constrain the investment decisions of domestic residents. These investment decisions are not connected with the search for higher returns. These findings once again confirm the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle (1980) and are incompatible with the intertemporal theory of the current account. This paper argues that no explanations for the “Lucas Paradox” are conclusive, but global governance indicators and financial development significantly contribute to explaining the lack of foreign financing in the poor countries. Our policy recommendations include that to attract foreign investment countries should enhance global governance indicators by creating governance infrastructure, strengthening institutions, and enhancing government effectiveness and bureaucratic quality to support investment processes. We argue that protection from the expropriation of resources and better rule of law are vitally important to foster entrepreneurship and technological development which are important to sustain capital flows dynamics. This should be complemented by establishing a good track-record of government debt repayment. While a more developed financial sector will contribute to lower the risk of currency, maturity, or capital structure mismatch that may trigger a financial crisis. However, the extent to which a country should be financialized (e.g. debt indicators of households and corporations, dependence on private pension funds or thrift institutions, etc.) should be influenced by country-specific circumstances. We are using a series of robustness checks and different control variables e.g. Chinn-Ito index to confirm the validity of our results estimated in the panel regressions with country fixed effects. Panel regressions are complemented by using the dynamic panel GMM estimation to ensure that the potential issue of endogeneity does not undermine the main inferences.",1
157,3,Review of World Economics,03 April 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00407-4,Political constraints and currency crises in emerging markets and less developed economies,August 2021,Jacob M. Meyer,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Currency crises usually follow speculative attacks or capital stops/reversals and lead to a significant depreciation/devaluation of currencies, foreign exchange reserve decumulation, and/or policy rate hikes. A subset of currency crises that involve significant depreciations or devaluations of currencies are referred to as “currency crashes.” Regardless of whether policymakers are able to prevent a currency from crashing, these events generate large economic and financial costs for the countries experiencing the crisis. Typical triggers of currency crises include vulnerability in real exchange rates, external balances, and/or the financial sector, plus shocks to global pull factors such as global interest rates and global volatility.Footnote 1 While most extant analysis of currency crises focuses on economic determinants, there is a growing literature examining the role of political factors in the onset of crises.Footnote 2 However, most studies on the political economy of currency crises thus far have focused on direct causal pathways, such as the effect of political factors on the likelihood of capital reversals or speculative attacks through these political variables' influence on market expectations of future economic conditions. Some of these studies (e.g., Leblang and Satyanath 2006; Keefer 2001) acknowledge the possibility of indirect pathways, such as the influence political factors can exert on economic determinants of crises (including credit growth, inflation, and exchange rate appreciation). Though an extensive literature exists linking political institutions with economic factors relevant to currency crises (e.g. Henisz (2006) on political constraints and economic growth, Acemoglu et al. (2014) on democracy and economic growth, Besley and Persson (2009) on institutions and state capacity, and Rodrik (2000) on institutions and volatility), little of the work on the political economy of crises has explicitly estimated the magnitude and statistical significance of indirect causal pathways linking political institutions to financial crises.Footnote 3 This paper contributes to this literature on the political economy of crises by providing a methodology to explicitly estimate these direct and indirect causal pathways, applying this method to evaluate the influence of political institutions upon the likelihood of currency crises.Footnote 4 The primary contribution of this paper to the literature is empirical. I first construct a methodology to estimate both direct and indirect causal pathways through which political factors may affect the likelihood of financial crises. I then apply this methodology to estimate the effects of Veto Player Theory, a common framework for analyzing political institutional constraints, on the likelihood of currency crises and currency crashes. Countries with more veto players have more political institutional actors with the capacity to halt legislation—similar to the idea of “checks and balances.” Political institutional constraints of this kind have been found to influence economic fundamentals relevant to the onset of crises—such as budget deficits and inflation (e.g., Roubini et al. 1989; Treisman 2000)—thereby indirectly affecting the likelihood of a crisis. They have also been found to influence the likelihood of financial crises through direct causal pathways—such as through generating confidence in policymakers' ability to react to changing conditions, or confidence in consistent policies that facilitate long-term investment (Prabha and Willett 2009; Macintyre 2001). The econometric analysis in this paper finds that estimates considering both direct and indirect causal pathways can yield substantially different conclusions than those that solely consider direct causal pathways; suggesting the conventional econometric approach provides an incomplete picture of the true links between political factors and financial crises. Estimating both the direct and indirect causal pathways requires the use of econometric mediation (Heckman and Pinto 2013), which consists of a two step estimation process. The first step estimates the effect of veto players on economic factors, known as mediators, that in turn have a significant effect on the probability of crises. The second step estimates the effect of these factors on the probability of crises while controlling for the veto player measure. It is then possible to calculate the magnitude and statistical significance of the effect of veto players on the probability of crises through their effect on these economic fundamentals. This is called the “indirect effect.Footnote 5” The effect of the veto player variable in the second stage estimation (while controlling for the indirect causal pathway) is known as the “direct effect.” This is the effect of veto players on the likelihood of financial crises that is estimated in a standard econometric framework. The combination of these effects through both the indirect and direct causal pathways comprises the “full effect.” This paper is structured as a “horse race” between the conventional econometric approach for empirical work on the political economy of financial crises (which only estimates the direct pathway/effect of the political variable on the likelihood of crises) and the mediated approach (which estimates both indirect and direct pathways). As the benefits of mediation analysis relate to causal rather than predictive analysis, this will be done by comparing the causal interpretation of the results across the two methodologies.Footnote 6 A causal analysis—using the standard econometric approach—of the effect of veto players on the likelihood of currency crashes is conducted first. Next the indirect effects of veto players on the likelihood of currency crises are estimated then aggregated with these direct effects to yield the full mediated analysis. A comparison of these two approaches then demonstrates the richer dynamics revealed in the mediated approach that are missed when using the standard econometric approach. Section 2 conceptually outlines the direct and indirect links between political institutions and currency crises, motivating the mediated estimation strategy. Section 3 provides an overview of the econometric methodology, with “Appendix A” reporting the regression outputs of individual stages of this estimation process.Footnote 7 Section 4 uses these estimations to report the output of the conventional methodological approach (direct effects) and the mediated approach (full effects). Section 5 concludes with a comparison of these two methodologies, demonstrating the greater richness of insights provided by the proposed mediated approach.",

The COVID-19 pandemic further strengthens the case for sustainable growth which protects the environment and benefits the poor. While Chinese policymakers have a number of policy tools at their disposal, fiscal policy—i.e. taxation and government expenditure is likely to be at the front and center of any policy package which can help China build back better after the pandemic. For example, fiscal spending on social safety nets may reduce risk and uncertainty facing households and thus encourage them to save less and spend more, thus strengthening domestic demand and economic recovery. Likewise, fiscal spending on COVID-19 vaccines can restore the health of the workforce and reduce social distancing restrictions which limit mobility, thus paving the way for the normalization of economic activity. Furthermore, an effective taxation system is needed to secure the fiscal resources for fiscal spending that promotes sustainable growth. More generally, fiscal policy can influence economic growth through both macroeconomic and microeconomic channels (IMF, 2015a). At the macroeconomic level, fiscal sustainability is the cornerstone of macroeconomic stability, which, in turn, is indispensable for economic growth. When the government spends more than its income—i.e. tax and non-tax revenues it collects on a sustained basis, the inevitable outcome is macroeconomic instability, which creates uncertainty among companies and deters private investment. At the microeconomic level, both taxes and spending can influence the behavior of firms in ways that can promote growth. For example, well-targeted tax incentives can promote greater investment by companies and foster higher productivity through research and development (R&D). Another example is public spending on education and health care, which contribute to human capital formation, a core ingredient of economic growth. The central objective of our paper is to empirically examine the relationship between fiscal policy and economic growth in China. The effectiveness of China’s countercyclical fiscal response to the global financial crisis highlighted the sizable impact of fiscal policy on short-term growth. However, in this paper, we are interested in the effect of fiscal policy on China’s growth beyond the short term. Our paper contributes to the existing empirical literature on the nexus between fiscal policy and economic growth in China in a number of ways. Above all, we look at the growth impact of not only central government’s fiscal policy but also the impact of local governments’ fiscal policy. In light of the substantial role of local governments in China’s fiscal policy, examining the impact both central and local governments on China’s economic growth gives us a more accurate understanding of the effect of fiscal policy on China’s growth. In addition, our empirical analysis is enriched and extended in several significant directions. In particular, we incorporate both investment and external debt into our empirical analysis of the link between fiscal policy and economic growth in China. Furthermore, we divide the sample period into three different sub-sample periods of China’s economic development. In addition, our analysis distinguishes between automatic fiscal policy and discretionary fiscal policy. Our econometric analysis yields a number of interesting findings. Our evidence suggests that local government expenditures have a larger impact on output growth than central government expenditures or net taxes. In addition, both government expenditure and net tax multipliers seem to change during the course of a business cycle. However, net tax growth becomes relatively but progressively more influential in the long run. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the relevant literature, Sect. 3 describes the data and methodology, Sect. 4 reports and discusses the empirical results, and Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",9
157,3,Review of World Economics,10 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00408-3,The role of coalitions at international tariff negotiations: a CGE perspective,August 2021,Florian Freund,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Coalitions like the G-10, G-20, G-90, Cairns or the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group form an integral part of tariff negotiations that take place under the aegis of the World Trade Organization (WTO). While there was only a single coalition in the 70s, their number increased to 31 in the year 2005, see Patel (2007). Despite of the apparent proliferation of coalitions in tariff negotiations, surprisingly little research on their theoretical and empirical implications has been produced, see Rolland (2007). In particular, we lack an understanding of efficiency and equity effects of coalitions. On the one hand, coalitions may act as a means to improve the bargaining outcome of weaker countries, see WTO (2012). By giving weaker countries a stronger voice, coalitions should lead to a more equal division of gains from trade. On the other hand, some authors agree that active participation of certain coalitions is one of the main reasons for the Doha stalemate, compare Narlikar (2005), Patel (2007) and Bouët and Laborde (2010). This implies that coalitions act like a stumbling block to broader liberalization which results, in principle, in decreasing overall efficiency. Because of this potential trade-off, a serious evaluation of coalitions should take into account both, equity and efficiency considerations. Tariff negotiations are increasingly complex. The number of WTO members is steadily increasing and amounts to 164 countries in 2020.Footnote 1 Due to the proliferation and differing interests of member states, it is hard to arrive at a conclusion. Moreover, it is not clear which part individual countries play and how to assess coalitions against this background, see Schott and Watal (2000). In early GATT times, the whole process was easier since there was only a small number of countries effectively participating at the negotiations. The so-called Quad countries (EU, USA, Japan, Canada) were dominating the bargaining table and did not insist on the active participation of the remaining members; also coalitions were not present at this time. It was commonplace that tariff reductions were negotiated by the Quad countries which were then transmitted to the remaining countries via the Most Favoured Nations (MFN) principle. Since this procedure allowed the non-participating countries to free-ride on the Quad countries negotiations, they had little incentive to participate actively. The Uruguay Round in 1986 changed the rules of the game by introducing the single undertaking principle. This implies – amongst others – that all countries have to adhere to the policies that have been negotiated by a subset of all member states. As a consequence, the number of countries actively sitting at the bargaining table - including developing countries - was increasing significantly, see Schott (1996) and Hudec (1987). Although many developing countries were now more involved in the activities at the WTO, most of them were facing a problem of marginalization. This is mainly driven by a lack of economic bargaining power which is usually also mirrored by a lack of WTO delegates in Geneva, see Ostry (2009). In principle, all decisions within the WTO have to be decided in consensus and all members have the same voice.Footnote 2 But in practice, the negotiation process is complex and the distribution of economic power plays a key role. This may rationalize the formation of coalitions – another novelty at the Uruguay Round – as a means to give otherwise marginalized countries a voice at the negotiations. Rolland describes this – with a focus on developing countries – as follows: ... in most instances, developing countries have to act in coalitions in order to gain sufficient leverage and some developing country members have little – if any – voice if they do not ally with others. Despite their increased number and activity in the WTO, developing countries still find themselves in a relatively marginalized position and experience difficulties in linking their development agenda to multilateral trade negotiations...Footnote 3 As already mentioned, there is a paucity of literature on the topic, although coalitions have been formally defined in the context of cooperative game theory long time ago, see e.g. Mas-Colell et al. (1995), pp. 673, for the theoretical underpinnings. But there is only a small research community that uses methods from cooperative game theory to analyse coalition formation processes in the context of international tariff negotiations, see e.g. Aghion et al. (2007), Das and Ghosh (2006) and Saggi and Sengul (2009). It has to be mentioned, however, that this literature treats coalitions as formations of preferential trade agreements (Aghion et al. (2007) and Das and Ghosh (2006)) or as clubs that exchange MFN status (Saggi and Sengul (2009)), which is not the mode of action of coalitions in WTO negotiations like the G-90 or Cairns Group where members seek to increase bargaining power in tariff negotiations.Footnote 4 In an empirical context, Costantini et al. (2007) analyse the internal coherence of existing coalitions with a cluster analysis. They identify so called natural members of coalitions that share many characteristics and strategical members that differ in their characteristics. By employing a meta analysis, Cepaluni et al. (2012) find that the probability of success of coalitions is increasing in the number of its members. While the latter two empirical studies focused on the nature of coalitions, there is a study by Bouët and Laborde (2010) that investigates – amongst others – the consequences that existing coalitions might have in economic terms. They employ Modelling International Relationships in Applied General Equilibrium (MIRAGE), a CGE model, with Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) base data version 6.1 to tackle this questions. One of the key findings is that under the circumstances of the underlying assumptions, the appearance of the G-90 empties the core of the game and thereby improves the situation for Sub-Saharan Africa and Bangladesh relative to a no-coalition world. This article aims to shed light on the following questions: (i) (How) Do coalitions help developing countries? and (ii) What is the consequence for the international trading system as a whole, especially in terms of equity and efficiency? To answer these pending questions, we employ a standard computational general equilibrium model which is extended to incorporate bargaining issues. The paper adds to the existing literature by endogenously determining the outcome of multilateral tariff negotiations using a fine grid of reciprocal tariff reductions and thereby exploring the equity-efficiency nexus of coalitions.",

Hafner,Jörn Kleinert,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Productivity growth is a key factor for economic growth and prosperity, because it enables firms to produce each of the goods and services with less resources or more goods and services with the same resources. Generating productivity growth in the firm is a cumbersome, firm-specific trial-and-error process. Consequently, productivity growth differs significantly across countries; even between domestic firms within the same sector. It is not obvious a priori why differences in productivity growth of firms have such a strong country-specific element. There has been an extensive debate over the reasons for Japanese firms’ success in the 1980s, for example. Long-run relationships with suppliers, customers and employees, continuous quality improvements and time-saving logistics have been identified as determinants of their success. Since the mid-1990s, however, US firms have become the benchmark once again, while German firms have more recently regained strength and competitiveness. The success of US firms is often related to their more intensive use of IT. According to Bloom et al. (2012), US firms invest on average more in IT equipment, which has increased their productivity—particularly in the more IT-intensive firms—and allowed aggregate US productivity to outperform European growth in the last two decades. Bloom et al. (2012) analyze foreign affiliates of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the UK and show that productivity differences at the firm level are related not to the place of production but to the headquarters’ country. This study finds that foreign affiliates of US multinationals are more productive than those of non-US multinationals and relate US affiliates’ productivity advantage to higher IT-related firm specific capital stocks. Bloom et al. (2012) incorporates firm-specific IT-related capital stocks but ignores the use of IT-related service trade to explain productivity differences, which are usually provided at the company (headquarter) level and are imported by foreign affiliates in their host countries. According to the theory of the MNE, multi-unit firms have productivity advantages over competitors because of the joint use of a non-rival firm-specific knowledge asset in all their units (Markusen 1995, 2002). Thus, the use of knowledge-intensive services leads to economies of scope in production of multi-unit firms. Knowledge-intensive services are usually supplied by parent companies and serve to link different units of the firm (Zingales (2000)). Adding a new unit does not reduce the marginal return of these services in other units but it does reduce the average cost since fixed costs producing headquarter services can be divided among more units. General equilibrium models with multinational firms relate trade in headquarter services to a trade deficit in goods balanced by a trade surplus in services. An increase in MNEs activities lead to an increase in service exports as service trade provide the network around which operations of multinational firms are organized. Empirical studies of headquarter service flows within multi-unit firms are rare, mainly due to the lack of data. Hortacsu and Syverson (2007) and Atalay et al. (2014) study the flow of goods in different units within firms, compare them to flows between firms and find intra-firm goods flows to be much smaller than expected. Thus, Hortacasu and Syverson (2007) cannot support their conjecture and pass the task of finding the link that connects entities of multi-unit firms to further research: ""…vertical integration is used to facilitate efficient transfers of inputs, but not necessarily (or even usually) physical inputs along a production chain, as is commonly assumed. We expect that managerial oversight and planning is among the most important of these, although marketing and sales know-how might also be readily transferred among integrated establishments in a firm […]. In this way, vertical expansion by a firm may not be altogether different than horizontal expansion."" (Hortacsu and Syverson (2007): 23). Headquarter services are difficult to quantify in statistics or surveys, except when they cross borders and the exchange of services between MNEs and their foreign affiliates is therefore recorded. We study information-related services flows to affiliates of foreign MNEs in Germany and rely on two confidential firm-level datasets collected by the Deutsche Bundesbank. The data gives information on cross-border service transactions and balance sheets of foreign affiliates of MNEs in Germany. Based on the entire population of MNEs active in Germany and their cross-border service transactions, the data covers the period 2001–2015 and includes slightly more than half of the affiliate population in Germany. We search for evidence of headquarter service flows from parent firms to their foreign affiliates in Germany affecting affiliates productivity with a particular focus on IT-related services. We assume that service flows are likely to be traded within the same firm (and can be classified as headquarter services) if they are cross-border service transactions between foreign affiliates and partner firms of the affiliate’s home country. We document the productivity advantage of German affiliates of US firms and compare our results to the study of Bloom et al. (2012). We find that cross-border trade in IT-related services (per employee) has a significant impact on foreign affiliates’ labor productivity in Germany. In particular: (1) if the cross-border service trade relationship is with the home country (i.e. likely to be a headquarter service) and (2) if the trading partner is located in the USA. Doubling IT-related headquarter services, for example, increases foreign affiliates’ labor productivity on average by around 1%. Moreover, we find (3) that US affiliates in Germany show significantly higher labor productivity than foreign affiliates of companies from other countries with an average difference of 10–12%. Estimates confirm that productivity advantages of US affiliates are due to significantly higher IT-service imports (per firm and partner) relative to non-US affiliates. We conclude that US affiliates generates productivity advantages by importing IT headquarter service more intensively. We also estimate the effect of service flows on total factor productivity (TFP) instead of labor productivity. Assessing TFP is conceptually similar to Atkeson and Kehoe (2005) and their definition of productivity in terms of organizational capital. They calculate that 9% of US manufacturing output is not accounted for as payments to either physical capital or labor. Roughly half of it can be accounted for as payments to organizational capital, and much of this organizational capital can be attributed to multi-unit firms. We test whether service flows are (time varying) determinants of firm’s total factor productivity and find that importing IT services from the headquarters has significantly positive impacts on firms’ total factor productivity. Doubling the amount of IT service flows imported from the home country, for example, leads to an increase of the total factor productivity of around 3.5%. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset and its different sources, gives an overview of how the data was constructed, and documents some stylized facts about foreign affiliates of MNEs in Germany. In Sect. 3, we discuss the main assumptions of the underlying theoretical framework, outline the empirical model and describe the estimation techniques. Empirical results of the firm analysis of MNEs in Germany are presented and the results of robustness tests are discussed in Sect. 4. Conclusions appear in Sect. 5.",

However, persistent capital flows also increase the size and alter the composition of the stocks of foreign assets and liabilities, and there is a lack of evidence on the pattern of associated income streams and valuation effects. This paper explores the yield and valuation patterns of the foreign asset and liability positions for a broad sample of countries. Using standard statistical and econometric tools, the paper addresses two main questions. First, how do the yield and valuation patterns of developed economies compare to those of developing economies, and what do these patterns imply for the transfer of resources from developing economies and the positions of these countries in the international monetary and financial system (IMFS)? Second, how are the various layers of the current global financial safety net (GFSN) correlated with the yield differentials in different investment categories? Addressing these questions allows to gauge the overall costs and benefits of rising external assets and liabilities that the current settings of the IMFS and the GFSN imply for developing economies, as well as to indicate what policy measures might reduce these costs. The latter is particularly important for resource mobilization to finance recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The paper is related to several strands of the literature. Most existing studies on the size and structure of external balance sheets emphasize the role of the United States at the centre of the IMFS. Holding risky foreign assets and providing safe and liquid liabilities to the rest of the world (e.g. Gourinchas & Rey, 2014) gives the United States the “exorbitant privilege” of earning excess returns on its external balance sheet in normal times, but makes it also acquire the “exorbitant duty” of suffering valuation losses during crises, when the value of its risky assets plummets and the value of its safe liabilities increases (e.g. Gourinchas et al., 2017). This “exorbitant duty” has been interpreted as the United States providing insurance payments to the rest of the world in form of a wealth transfer during crisis periods.Footnote 1 Gourinchas et al. (2012) show that not all countries benefit equally from this wealth transfer and that cross-country patterns of valuation changes during crisis periods are associated with cross-country differences in the degree of dollar shortages. A second strand indicates that the exorbitant privilege of the United States is reflected in developing economies as the cost of holding foreign-exchange reserves. This cost can be expressed in various ways, depending on a country’s access to international financial markets, but generally reflects the wedge between the low return earned on low-risk and liquid reserve assets and some (typically higher) borrowing or opportunity cost to the domestic economy (e.g. Rodrik, 2006). A third group of studies assesses yield and valuation patterns and emphasizes that valuation channels, rather than the trade balance, increasingly determine the sustainability of countries’ external positions (Adler & Garcia-Macia, 2018; Gourinchas et al., 2019). However, these studies pay little attention to developing economies and their position in the IMFS. Fourth, Darvas and Hüttle (2017) also examine the relative impacts of yield differentials and valuation changes on the sustainability of external positions. They focus on developed economies and disaggregate external asset and liability positions, arguing that foreign direct investment (FDI) is the main determinant of yield differentials between the United States and other countries (see also Curcuru et al., 2013). Finally, Akyüz (2018) provides evidence on the size and composition of external balance sheets of four developed and nine emerging-market economies for the period 2000–2016 and examines the ensuing transfer of resources from emerging-market to developed economies. This paper employs the empirical approaches used by Akyüz (2018), Darvas and Hüttle (2017) and Gourinchas and Rey (2014)  and makes two main contributions. The first novelty is the use of disaggregated external asset and liability positions and related income streams and valuation changes with a focus on developing economies. This exercise reveals several asymmetries in the IMFS that the existing literature does not address. While it is well-known that the United States stands out in combining the exorbitant privilege and the exorbitant duty, this paper shows that several other developed economies also enjoy positive yield differentials but did not suffer valuation losses during the global financial crisis (GFC). It also shows that, by contrast, developing economies generally record negative yield differentials and about two-third of them also experienced valuation losses during the GFC. Negative yield differentials and net valuation changes combined implied a total return differential of about minus three percentage points between developing and developed countries and an average annual resource transfer from the 36 developing economies of about $800 billion over the period 2010–2019, equivalent to about 3.3 per cent of these countries’ combined GDP. As a second novelty, the paper provides an econometric analysis that relates yield differentials on several investment categories to policy options regarding crisis insurance strategies—accumulating reserves, engaging in swap arrangements, and adhering to regional financial arrangements (RFAs)—and that applies the concept of “currency hierarchy”. This concept starts from the recognition that currencies of developing economies do usually not, or only marginally, perform the three international functions of money, i.e. unit of account (invoicing currency), means of payment (transaction currency) and store of value (investment and reserve currency). Differences in the ability of currencies to perform these three functions make them assume different degrees of liquidity, with the dollar being the most liquid currency and positioned at the top of what has been called “currency pyramid” (Cohen, 1998) or “currency hierarchy” (Andrade & Prates, 2013). Currencies of other core advanced economies are presumed to occupy intermediate ranks, and currencies of developing economies rungs at the bottom. To compensate for differences in liquidity, assets in less liquid currencies need to offer higher total returns to be attractive to international investors. Developing economies can achieve this by offering higher yields or higher valuation gains than developed economies. The results of this analysis indicate a positive relationship between reserves and yield differentials on both total and safe investment categories, as well as a positive correlation of permanent swap arrangements and regional monetary arrangements (such as the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization, CMIM) with yield differentials on total external assets and liabilities. This indicates that financial integration by developing economies that allows for riskier investment categories, such as portfolio investment, should be accompanied by institutional reform that includes developing economies in swap arrangements with ready access to dollar liquidity, including through regional monetary arrangements. The analysis of the exorbitant privilege and the exorbitant duty focuses on a broad sample of 76 economies during 1995–2019. The main motivation for starting the sample period in 1995 is evidence that points to the mid-1990s as the beginning of the functioning of the IMFS as an insurance scheme with sizable resource transfers between countries: while the net external position of the United States became increasingly long in risky and short in safe assets starting in the mid-1980s, it is only since the mid-1990s that the net external position of the rest of world has been long in safe and short in risky assets (Gourinchas et al., 2019), and it was for the first time in 1995 when the share of risky assets in all assets exceeded the share of liquid liabilities in the total liabilities of the United States (Gourinchas & Rey, 2007). Moreover, the current level of global financial integration was essentially reached by the mid-1990s, and the second half of the 1990s marks a surge in the global stock of external assets and liabilities and a change in their composition from debt to equity, as well as a change in the structure of the GFSN with reserve accumulation for precautionary motives and engaging in regional monetary arrangements, such as the CMIM, assuming significant importance. Given that the above literature does not use a standard country sample, the empirical analysis in this paper departs from the 49 country sample used in Adler and Garcia-Macia (2018) and IMF (2017a, 2019) and adds the other countries included in Ghosh et al. (2017), except Lebanon, Panama, Venezuela and Vietnam, for which no comprehensive data are available. Instead, the following developing economies are added to increase the coverage of developing economies on which this paper focuses: Bangladesh, Ghana, Madagascar, Mauritius, Senegal, and the United Republic of Tanzania. As a result, the current sample comprises 76 economies—36 developing economies, 7 transition economies, and 33 developed economies of which 11 in Central and Eastern Europe (see the “Appendix” for detail).Footnote 2 This country sample covers about 94 per cent of global output in 2019. It contains all the major advanced economies, a broad set of developing and transition economies that includes all the major ones (such as Brazil, China, India, Russian Federation, and South Africa), as well as developed economies that experienced large capital flow reversals during the GFC and for which comprehensive data are available (such as the Baltics and Hungary). It also contains all the major countries included in the MSCI ACWI + Frontier Markets Index and those included in the Institute of International Finance Capital Flows report country sample. The sample does not include many small developing economies as these tend to remain financially closed and would bias the overall results. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology. Section 3 presents statistical patterns regarding the size and composition of external asset and liability positions and their return characteristics. Section 4 undertakes the econometric estimation, and Section 5 concludes. The “Appendix”  details the country sample and data sources, and the online appendix provides additional tables and charts, as well as country-specific evidence.",

158,1,Review of World Economics,22 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00410-9,"Genetic distance, cultural differences, and the formation of regional trade agreements",February 2022,Benedikt Heid,Wenxi Lu,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The number of regional trade agreements (RTAs) has steadily increased during the last decades: Whereas less than 2% of country pairs had an RTA in 1970, and 4% around the end of the Cold War in 1990, more than 16% had in 2012, see Fig. 1. With the stalled multilateral negotiations of the Doha Round within the World Trade Organization, the pace of newly concluded RTAs further increased, and is likely to continue to do so in the near future. This trend highlights the increasing need for bilateral and regional trade negotiations between potential member countries. The negotiations to obtain these are typically time-consuming and do not always succeed. Understanding the determinants of successfully concluded agreements can help to identify drivers and potential pitfalls for future trade agreements. The formation of trade agreements may be difficult due to a lack of trust and communication difficulties arising from ethnic or cultural differences between potential members.Footnote 1 Differences in cultural norms and expectations about the behavior of the other party can lead to misunderstandings and negatively affect negotiations.Footnote 2 Individuals from different cultural backgrounds differ in their level of trust, differ in how they act when confronting social dilemmas such as, e.g., prisoner’s dilemmas or contributing to public goods, and have differing degrees of willingness to punish others when they free-ride.Footnote 3 Establishing trust, escaping the prisoner’s dilemma of strategic trade policy and how to deal with free riders are well-known key problems of international trade negotiations.Footnote 4 More specifically, negotiation and bargaining styles differ across countries, and cultural differences are more pronounced in bargaining settings.Footnote 5 Trade negotiations are particularly affected by cultural differences as they involve infrequent, high stakes interactions between often changing high-level politicians or bureaucrats where establishing trust and a common understanding may be difficult. Cultural differences may also reflect different preferences for policy outcomes in the countries’ populations, making it harder for negotiators to reach a consensus and hence successfully conclude a trade agreement. Total number of country pairs with RTAs, 1970–2012. Note: Graph depicts the total number of distinct country pairs which are covered by an RTA (free trade agreement and/or customs union). Number of countries is \({N}=133\), hence the total number of distinct country pairs is \({N}\times \left(N-1\right)/2=8778\) These cultural differences and associated costs are difficult to measure, particularly at a bilateral level between a large set of countries. We propose to use Spolaore and Wacziarg’s (2009) genetic distance, a measure of how genetically related populations are in terms of their last common ancestor, as a readily available proxy for communication and negotiation costs arising from differences in culture and norms as a determinant of trade agreements. Anthropologic studies have shown that genetic distance can help to identify common cultural groups, in addition to geographic distance and shared language, two measures of cultural difference routinely used in the trade literature.Footnote 6 Similarly, Desmet et al. (2011) find that genetic distance correlates well with measures of cultural distances based on survey responses. We use an (unbalanced) panel of 133 countries and 43 years and a battery of control variables to examine the role of genetic distance in establishing RTAs across countries. Our results show that genetic distance has a significant, negative and economically meaningful influence on the probability of forming an RTA. Importantly, we find that genetic distance helps to predict RTA formation even after controlling for a battery of other proxies of cultural differences such as geographic distance, linguistic distance, religious distance, colonial past, and differences in legal systems typically used in the literature. Genetic distance seems to correlate with some aspect of cultural differences that is not captured by other measures of cultural differences that would otherwise be omitted when explaining RTA formation. We would like to stress that our results should not and cannot be construed as to imply that countries should not engage in trade negotiations with countries with which they have a larger genetic distance, nor do we argue for a biological determinism of trade policy. Instead, insofar as genetic distance proxies cultural differences, our results highlight the potential usefulness of heightened awareness of possible misunderstandings which may arise during trade negotiations due to cultural differences. We contribute to the literature which has documented the effect of genetic distance on economic outcomes. The seminal contribution is Spolaore and Wacziarg (2009) who show that genetic distance between countries can explain cross-country differences in income per capita. The larger these cultural differences, proxied by genetic distance, the more difficult the diffusion and adaptation of the frontier technology. We complement this literature on the influence of genetic distance on economic growth by focusing on the influence of genetic distance on economic policy, particularly RTA formation. Our interpretation of genetic distance as a proxy for certain unobserved barriers to economic integration such as cultural heterogeneity is in line with a broader literature which links ethnic diversity measured by genetic distance and cultural heterogeneity.Footnote 7 Desmet et al. (2011) document that genetic distance allows better predictions of similarity of individuals’ survey responses on cultural values than those resting on only geographic and linguistic information. Using the example of Yugoslavia, they find that genetic distance as a proxy for cultural heterogeneity predicts the disintegration of culturally diverse nation states, i.e., a particularly deep form of economic integration. We find that genetic distance also affects economic integration through RTAs. RTAs can create aggregate welfare gains when signatory parties act cooperatively. To establish an RTA and reap its welfare gains, signatories must overcome differences in norms and preferences as well as coordinate differences in socio-economic policies. Guiso et al. (2009) also use genetic distance as a proxy for cultural difference. They show that respondents in the Eurobarometer survey trust individuals less with whom they have a higher genetic distance. This lower trust at the individual level is correlated with lower trade and portfolio investment between countries. Bove and Gokmen (2018) replicate Spolaore and Wacziarg (2009) and show that the impact of genetic distance on income differences between countries is stable over time. Melitz and Toubal (2019) show that somatic distance as well as genetic distance correlate with trade flows when controlling for measures of bilateral trust between countries. Our study finds that genetic distance has a stable and significant impact on RTA formation over more than four decades. Davies and Guillin (2014) use genetic distance as a proxy for communication barriers and find that US outbound services FDI is correlated between countries with low genetic distance. Leblang (2010) does not find a significant effect of genetic distance on bilateral FDI and portfolio investment in a single cross-section of countries.Footnote 8 Finally, Chaudhry and Ikram (2015) find that long-run GDP growth is correlated between countries with lower genetic distance. Our paper also contributes to the literature on the determinants of RTAs, see, e.g., Magee (2003), Baier and Bergstrand (2004), Chen and Joshi (2010), and Egger et al. (2011).Footnote 9 With the exception of Martin et al. (2012), who use genetic distance in one specification for a cross-sectional regression for the year 2000, none of these papers studies the impact of genetic distance. Using panel data, we can analyze the impact of genetic distance while controlling for time-varying country-specific unobserved drivers of trade policy. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes our data. Section 3 describes our empirical strategy and results. Section 4 discusses several robustness checks. Section 5 provides a discussion of our main findings. Section 6 concludes.",2
158,1,Review of World Economics,07 July 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00421-6,Intra-African trade,February 2022,William W. Olney,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Africa accounts for 21.2% of the world’s land and 13.7% of the world’s people, but only 2.6% of the world’s economic activity.Footnote 1 Understanding the causes of this disparity is one of the most important questions in economics (Collier & Gunning, 1999; Acemoglu & Robinson, 2010). One explanation is that Africa’s lack of international trade slows economic development (Sachs & Warner, 1997; Bosker & Garretsen, 2012), for instance by limiting specialization, economies of scale, competition, and technology diffusion. As former UN Secretary General Kofi Anan said “the main losers in today’s very unequal world are not those who are too much exposed to globalization. They are those who have been left out.”Footnote 2 This is a concern for Africa, which accounts for only 2.7% of world trade. A closer look at the data reveals that the share of trade between African countries is especially small. The intra-continental trade share in Africa is only 12%, compared to 47% in North America, 53% in Asia, and 69% in Europe over the 1984-2016 period. This paper investigates why intra-African trade is relatively low. According to the World Economic Forum and the African Development Bank, increasing intra-continental trade is one of the best ways of promoting economic development and growth in Africa.Footnote 3 With this goal in mind, resources are devoted to reducing inefficiencies, negotiating trade agreements like the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), and building roads ($4.6 billion per year).Footnote 4 Despite the important policy implications and the significant time, money, and political capital dedicated to promoting economic integration within Africa, there is relatively little empirical evidence guiding these endeavors. This paper examines the determinants of intra-African trade and the results can inform efforts to alleviate the binding constraints to trade and growth (Hallaert & Munro, 2009; Hausmann et al., 2008). The empirical analysis explores how changing conditions within African countries affects not only total exports but also bilateral exports to African and non-African countries. A comprehensive data set is assembled which covers 54 African countries, includes their trade with all 236 countries in the world, and spans the past three decades. Results show that intra-African trade has increased from 2% in 1984 to 15% in 2016. In addition, there are important differences across countries, with 35% of Kenyan exports but only 9% of Nigerian exports going to other African countries. The paper examines factors that can explain these differences in the intra-African trade share, including trade agreements, infrastructure, the composition of the economy, trade inefficiencies, conflict, and former colonial relationships. This incorporates common hypotheses for the lack of African trade (Brookings 2012).Footnote 5 The empirical analysis utilizes a panel-data set, a gravity empirical specification, and a rich set of fixed effects, which improves upon the cross-sectional studies common in this literature. In addition, the results have important policy implications.Footnote 6 The first result shows that the lack of intra-African trade is not simply due to the fact that Africa is a large continent with many developing countries. In other words, the common gravity terms of distance and economic size alone cannot explain the lack of trade between African countries. For example, distance is a larger impediment to trade between two African countries than between an African and a non-African country. The paper examines possible explanations for these findings and identifies ways to increase intra-African trade. Trade agreements can increase bilateral trade flows by reducing tariff barriers (Baier & Bergstrand, 2007), which may be especially important in Africa (Rodrik, 1998; Carrere, 2004). The analysis examines how different types of trade agreements (i.e. non-reciprocal, preferential, and customs unions) affect bilateral exports to African and non-African countries. The results show that exports to African countries increase with preferential trade agreements, but exports to non-African countries do not. This indicates that trade agreements between African countries may be an effective way of promoting intra-continental trade. Poor infrastructure can impede trade (Donaldson, 2018) especially in Africa (Limao & Venables 2001). Underdeveloped communication and transportation infrastructure linking African countries may explain why distance is a larger impediment to intra-African trade.Footnote 7 The findings confirm that exports to African countries increase with infrastructure improvements. Specifically, one of the strongest results to emerge from this analysis is the large positive relationship between the network of roads and exports to other African countries. Roads have an important effect on exports in both the pre- and post-2000 periods. Exports to both African and non-African countries also increase with cell-phones.Footnote 8 The composition of the domestic economy may influence African trade flows (Imbs & Wacziarg, 2003; Cadot et al., 2011, Brookings, 2012). The results show that growth in the natural resource and agricultural sectors is positively related to overall exports, and in particular exports to non-African countries. However, exports to other African countries decline with the natural resource sector. Production of a similar set of homogeneous natural resource products, which are in high global demand, seem to provide little incentive to export to a neighboring African country. On the other hand, countries that specialize in services tend to export relatively more to other African countries. Furthermore, results indicate that exports have become more sensitive to the composition of the domestic economy recently (i.e. in the post-2000 period). Overall, these findings indicate that diversifying the economy out of natural resources and into services is one way to promote intra-African trade.Footnote 9 Inefficiencies, corruption, and conflict generate an uncertain business environment which can adversely affect international trade (Dutt & Traca, 2010). The results show that these factors decrease African exports overall. Exploiting the bilateral nature of the data set, there is also evidence that exports to African countries disproportionately decline with trade costs and to a lesser extent conflict deaths. These findings suggest that trade inefficiencies are an important impediment to intra-African trade.Footnote 10 European colonialism has lasting economic implications (Acemoglu et al., 2001), which can influence trade flows (Head et al., 2010). The findings in this paper show that African exports to a former European colonizer are initially larger after independence but they steadily decline over time. Forty years after independence, African countries no longer disproportionately export to their former colonizer. As the impact of extractive institutions and infrastructure fade and trade networks with the former colonial power dissipate, African trade slowly evolves away from the European colonizer. Utilizing a comprehensive data set and a rigorous empirical specification, these findings provide new insight into ways to effectively promote intra-African trade. Exports to other African countries disproportionately increase with roads, trade agreements, diversification away from natural resources and into services, and declining trade costs. These results can guide efforts to promote African economic integration. This paper makes a number of contributions to the existing literature. First, studies have identified a lack of market access and trade as an important impediment to African growth (Sachs & Warner, 1997; Collier & Gunning, 1999; Bosker & Garretsen, 2012). This paper contributes to this broader literature by examining why African countries do not trade more.Footnote 11 The analysis pinpoints the component of trade that is lacking (i.e. intra-African trade) and identifies the factors that are most successful at promoting trade between African countries. Second, the lack of African trade according to some papers is explained by economic size and distance (Foroutan & Pritchett, 1993, Coe & Hoffmaister, 1998, Rodrik, 1998), while others find that intra-African trade is less than these gravity terms predict (Limao & Venables, 2001; Redding & Venables, 2004). One feature of this literature, which may contribute to the conflicting results, is that these studies rely on cross-sectional gravity specifications where confounding factors are more problematic.Footnote 12 Instead, this paper utilizes a panel data set to examine how changing conditions in African countries affects bilateral exports after accounting for a rich set of fixed effects (including country-pair fixed effects, year fixed effects, and in some specifications exporter*year and importer*year fixed effects as well). The results contribute to this literature by showing that intra-African exports fall more rapidly with distance, compared to exports to non-African countries.Footnote 13 Third, to the best of my knowledge this is the first analysis that incorporates a variety of explanations for the lack of intra-African trade into a unified empirical analysis.Footnote 14 Recent improvements in the availability and quality of African data make this type of unified analysis feasible and it means more sophisticated estimation strategies can be used. An appealing aspect of this empirical approach is that it is possible to identify the most effective ways of promoting intra-African trade, which may be useful to policy makers who often face constraints on the set of possible reforms. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section discusses the data used in this analysis, including the bilateral trade data and measures of economic conditions within African countries. Section 3 presents a variety of descriptive statistics that show how Africa compares to other continents, how intra-African trade differs across countries, and how intra-African trade has evolved over time. The empirical strategy and estimating equation is outlined in Sect. 4. Section 5 reports the main results and identifies the factors that are found to be important determinants of intra-African trade. Finally, Sect. 6 provides some concluding thoughts.",1

This fact renewed the interest in studying the relation between commodity prices and inflation. It has been well established in the literature that commodity prices could affect inflation through the first-round effects, either the direct effects on consumers (e.g., more expensive energy bills) or the indirect ones on producers (e.g., higher production costs due to higher energy costs), and the second-round effects related to consumer and producer expectations that may impact negatively on consumption and investment (Castro et al., 2017; ECB, 2010). The related literature has highlighted different reasons why it may be relevant to analyse the relation between commodity prices and producer/consumer prices. Among them, we can point out the following: (i) monetary authorities may use commodity prices as leading indicators of inflation (Ciner, 2011; Mossa, 1998) and so anticipate their monetary policies to counteract the negative impact that changes in commodity prices may have on the economy; (ii) higher commodity prices lead to higher production costs (Garner, 1989; Marquis & Cunningham, 1990), which may cause higher consumer prices if producers do not absorb totally these changes in the costs and may also reduce investment of firms due to these higher costs; (iii) higher commodity prices may reduce disposable income of consumers when producers transfer price pressure to consumers (FAO, 2017); and (iv) higher flexibility of commodity prices with respect to the price of other goods and services allows them to adjust quickly after suffering a shock, but the impact of such a shock on the price of other goods and services is long-lasting (Cheung, 2009), which gives rise to important consequences on real economic activity. The previous empirical literature has mostly focused on analysing the macroeconomic effects of changes in commodity prices. The first strand of this literature has studied the impact of commodity price shocks on economic growth. Thus, commodity price changes seem to affect long-run economic growth, with commodity price volatility increasing both uncertainty and risk, and so leading to decrease investment (UNCTAD, 2012). Countries that rely heavily on a commodity that shows high price volatility have more volatile terms of trade and so less direct investment, leading to less economic growth rates (Blattman et al., 2007; UNCTAD, 2012). In particular, previous evidence shows that commodity price changes particularly affect the economic growth rates in low-income countries (Bredenkamp & Bersch, 2012; International Monetary Fund, 2012; UNCTAD, 2012). The second strand of the literature focuses on the effects of commodity prices on inflation. Thus, Blomberg and Harris (1995) analyse the link between commodity prices and consumer prices by considering five major U.S. commodity indices (the Commodity Research Bureau—CRB—spot index, the Journal of Commerce index, the crude Producer Price Index—PPI, the National Association of Purchasing price index and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s prices paid index) and three subgroups of commodities (gold, oil, food). They obtain that there is no long-run link between the level of commodity prices and the level of consumer prices, but there is a connection between the level of commodity prices and the rate of consumer price inflation. Adams and Ichino (1995) study the effects of the prices of five primary commodity categories (agricultural raw materials, beverages, foods, metals and petroleum) on inflation in the industrial world and they obtain that increases in commodity prices have little effect on inflation unless strong shocks happen in the commodity market. Ciner (2011) analyses contemporaneous and causal linkages between commodity prices (measured as the CRB commodity futures index, which includes 19 commodities in the version 2005) and U.S. consumer inflation using domain statistical methods. His results show that there is a long-run positive relation between commodity prices and inflation. Cecchetti and Moessner (2008) and Liu and Weidner (2011) find that the second-round effects were very weak for a large number of countries and, consequently, headline inflation tended to converge to core inflation. Hobijn (2008) studies the effects of grain and oil prices on the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures index of inflation for the period 2006–2008 and obtains that the impact is modest. Likewise, Ajmera et al. (2012) show the modest effects that changes in the price of four commodities (crops, animal slaughter and processing, dairy, and oil and natural gas) have on the overall U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation over the period 2003–2008. Fernández (2014) considers four U.S. price indices (CPI Urban Consumers-All items, the U.S. CPI Urban Consumer Commodities, the PPI Finished Goods and the PPI Crude Materials for Further Processing) and 31 commodity prices and she obtains that not only shocks in commodity prices can impact on aggregate price indices, but also shocks in aggregate price indices can impact on commodity prices. Chen et al. (2014) explore five small commodity-exporting countries under inflation targeting and obtain that commodity price aggregates have predictive power for their CPI and PPI inflation. Ramalhete-Moreira (2014) finds that changes in commodity prices are important for explaining consumer inflation in developed and emerging countries. Finally, Sekine and Tsuruga (2016) examine the effects of commodity prices on headline inflation by using a panel of 144 countries and find that the effects of commodity price shocks on inflation are transitory, giving support to the small role of the second-round effects on inflation. Within the second line of the literature, we find authors who explicitly study the degree of commodity price pass-through to inflation. For example, De Gregorio et al. (2007) study the pass-through from oil prices to the general price level for 34 countries and conclude that the pass-through has fallen worldwide during the last 30 years. Chen (2009) analyses the oil price pass-through to inflation for 19 industrialized countries and obtains evidence in favour of a decline in the oil price pass-through. Rigobon (2010) analyses the pass-through from commodity prices to retail prices using micro price data for 50 countries. His results show that the response of countries to shocks is different and that sectors respond differently across countries and commodities, with sectoral characteristics explaining a third of all the explained variation. Ferrucci et al. (2012) analyse the pass-through of food commodity prices to final consumer prices in the euro area and obtain that commodity prices are the main determinant of the increase in CPI and PPI. Gelos and Ustyugova (2017) consider a broad range of structural characteristics and policy benchmarks in 31 advanced and 60 emerging and developing countries, and obtain that countries with higher food shares in CPI baskets, fuel intensities, and with previous high inflation levels were more susceptible to develop inflationary effects from commodity prices shocks. More recently, Comunalea and Simolab (2018) study the pass-through of nominal exchange rates and commodity prices to consumer prices in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and obtain that the pass-through of commodity prices is explicitly significant. This paper contributes to this specific strand of the literature. It is our aim to provide new evidence on the pass-through of commodity prices to producer and consumer prices. In doing so, we study the commodity price pass-through along the pricing chain for the global commodity price index and the indices of its main categories (agricultural raw materials, food and beverages, energy and metals) in the world, advanced and emerging economies by estimating country-by-country VAR models and pooling the results by taking weighted means for the corresponding group of countries. Notice that we use individual countries’ PPI and CPI indices and country-specific commodity price indices with time-varying weights. The contribution of this paper could be summarized in answering the next four key questions: (i) is the degree of commodity price pass-through to producer and consumer prices similar in advanced and emerging economies?; (ii) which group of countries (advanced or emerging countries) is leading the pass-through in the world?; (iii) do energy prices have the most important consequences on producer and consumer prices?; and (iv) which category of the global price index of all commodities (i.e., agricultural raw materials, food and beverages, energy and metals) exhibits higher effects? The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the econometric methodology. Section 3 presents the estimation results. Finally, Sect. 4 includes the concluding remarks.",3
158,1,Review of World Economics,16 August 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00429-y,Modeling complex network patterns in international trade,February 2022,Peter R. Herman,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Understanding the determinants of trade has long been a significant interest in the field of international trade. Most research has focused on the ways in which trade between two countries is affected by the individual and bilateral characteristics of those two countries, such as their market sizes and the frictions between them. However, this research rarely examines other potential dependencies such as the pair’s relationships to third parties, opting instead to summarize these influences in the form of price indexes or “multilateral resistances”. Some recent trade literature has looked at these types of complex trade dependencies through the lens of network analysis. By thinking about trade between two countries as a small component of a much bigger network, it is possible to identify relationships between each bilateral trade flow and other complex network patterns that are typically overlooked. This paper describes two methodologies for modeling complex network patterns in international trade. These methodologies provide a way to identify and measure the ways in which bilateral trade is dependent on the full structure of the world trade network, such as the common third-party partners that countries share or the total number of trading relationships they maintain. The first methodology extends standard gravity models of trade to include network variables that reflect certain types of network relationships. The second methodology uses exponential random graph models (ERGMs), which are a powerful and flexible empirical tool for studying networks, to estimate similar types of relationships. Both models provide insight into the ways in which network relationships affect the trade between two countries. Further, both models have advantages in terms of the types of patterns that they are able to capture. In the application considered, the ERGM approach better captures the number of non-zero trade partnerships and performs relatively well at modeling shared third-party relationships. Meanwhile, the gravity approach is better able to capture the number of importing and exporting partners that each country maintains. Taken together, these results demonstrate that complex network patterns are an important determinant of trade, that gravity models can capture much of this dependency even if not explicitly controlled for, and that other network models such as ERGMs can be valuable tools for capturing some types of network dependencies. To illustrate the notion of complex network patterns in international trade, Fig. 1 depicts the trade flows between the United States (USA), El Salvador (SLV), Trinidad and Tobago (TTO), Bolivia (BOL), and Nepal (NPL) in 1999 as a network. A link pointing from one country to another indicates that the originating country exported to the destination country. Consider the exports from El Salvador to Trinidad and Tobago (drawn in red). A typical trade model, such as a gravity equation, will model that trade flow as being dependent on certain unilateral characteristics of the two countries, such as their GDPs or MFN tariffs (or, more commonly, via country fixed effects), and bilateral characteristics, such as the distances between the markets or their preferential trade arrangements. However, there are other relationships in the network that might also affect this trade flow. For example, Trinidad and Tobago export to El Salvador, implying that their trade is reciprocal. Similarly, both countries have multiple other import and export partners, which may create network externalities in both markets. Finally, both countries trade with common third parties, such as the United States, which might impact trade though things like supply chains or information spillovers. Network relationships are even more prevalent and extensive when considering the full world trade network, as is presented in Fig. 2. These types of network patterns have a significant impact on trade but are rarely analyzed directly within trade models, resulting in important nuances in how trade flows arise being often overlooked. Trade flows between the United States (USA), El Salvador (SLV), Trinidad and Tobago
(TTO), Bolivia (BOL), and Nepal (NPL) in 1999 The World Trade Network (2006) In recent years, research on the determinants of bilateral trade has largely been based on the estimation of gravity trade models. Through this work, authors have identified the importance of many types relationships within international trade. Much of this research has worked to properly identify the effects of a wide range of bilateral dependencies such as distance, common borders, common languages, and cultural ties. For example, Rauch (1999)—who actually referred to these types of bilateral relationships as network relationships—found broad evidence that they have a significant impact on trade. Following this work, many papers have built on these findings by providing deeper analysis and alternative measurements for each of these bilateral relationships. For example, Brun et al. (2005) and Berthelon and Freund (2008) examine the role of geographic distance between countries. Hutchinson (2005), Ku and Zussman (2010), Melitz (2008), and Melitz and Toubal (2014) study the ways in which countries relate through common language networks. Rauch and Trindade (2002), Linders et al. (2005), Hofstede (1980), and Felbermayr and Toubal (2010) analyze the effect of cultural networks on trade. In addition to modeling bilateral dependencies, most recent gravity research has attempted to control for a broad number of other dependencies through the incorporation of multilateral resistance terms (MRTs). Originally introduced by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003), MRTs capture unobserved aspects of countries that affect the relative prices of traded goods in each market. Part of the beauty of these terms is that they compress an extraordinary number of influences into a single importer and exporter price index for each country. MRTs implicitly reflect aspects of the world trade network and many of the dependencies therein. For example, Bernard and Moxnes (2018) highlight the link between networks and similar international price indexes in their Melitz (2003) inspired network trade model, which is informative of the influences that are likely present within multilateral resistances. The limitation of using MRTs or price indexes, however, is that this simplification naturally abstracts away from their underlying factors. Thus, when estimated empirically using standard approaches, little insight can be gained into the nature of potential network influences. In light of this, many recent papers have looked at the structure of the international trade network in order to gain better insight into the ways that network dependencies shape trade patterns.Footnote 1 Most of this work is primarily focused on identifying certain patterns in the trade network and not necessarily on how trade is dependent on those patterns. For example, work by De Benedictis and Tajoli (2011), De Benedictis et al. (2013), and Deguchi et al. (2014) all identify typical network features of world trade such as density, clustering, and centrality measures. De Benedictis and Tajoli (2011) compare centrality measures that reflect how well connected nodes are across a variety of countries or regions and identify the countries that operate as major trade “hubs”. Among their findings, the authors show that the WTO was effective in increasing the density of the trade network (i.e. increasing the number of country-pairs trading). De Benedictis et al. (2013) provide a similar but deeper analysis of several centrality measures. They find that degree centrality, which reflects how well connected a given country is, may be a strong indicator of trade surpluses or deficits. Closeness centrality or geodesic distance, which both reflect the minimum number of links separating two countries, can measure how directly connected a country is to the rest of the world. Finally, eigenvalue centrality, which reflects how well connected a country’s partners are, can offer insight into the role of indirect relationships among trading partners. Deguchi et al. (2014) follow this line of research on centrality by ranking countries based on their centrality. Using this ranking, they observe changes in the positions of countries within the list and find, for example, that China has grown to become the highest value trade hub while Japan has dropped in ranking over time. These papers and others analyzing trade using empirical network methods offer an important perspective on trade that is typically not apparent from standard modeling approaches. Other recent research has looked at relationships between the trade network and other types of networks. For example, Fagiolo and Mastrorillo (2013a) find significant correlations between the world trade network and immigration networks, which is consistent with the earlier but less network-intensive work of Rauch and Trindade (2002). Pan (2018) examines interdependencies between trade and intergovernmental organizations using ERGMs. They find that trade agreement membership is associated with more complex trading relationships but membership in many other types of organizations is not. Smith et al. (2019) use micro-level networks of firm ownership to identify complex relationships between firm behavior and country-level trade. Each of these papers finds significant evidence that trade networks depend on the structure of other networks. Some papers have gone beyond the statistical analysis of trade patterns and incorporated types of network dependencies into models of trade. One such example is the work by Chaney (2014). Chaney utilizes a network model to describe how firms expand to new export markets by using existing trade partners to match with new, more distant partners. If the distance between firms increases the difficulty of them matching, firms may use current partners to connect to distant firms in order to reduce that barrier and shorten the effective distance to the new firm. Using firm-level French data, Chaney finds that firms trade to increasingly distant markets at an accelerating rate, providing evidence that firms utilize network relationships to trade. A second example is the work of Morales et al. (2019), who model a different type of network dependency that they refer to as extended gravity. They find that bilateral trading relationships between two partners often create spillovers for third parties. Firms tend to import from or export to countries that are similar to ones with which they have prior experience. Thus, trade between partners is often impacted by the network of third-party trade links maintained by each partner. Their empirical tests suggest that these network dependencies are present and reduce trade costs significantly between partners. Of particular relevance is the work of Dueñas and Fagiolo (2013), who study properties of the world trade network through a gravity framework. The authors estimate standard gravity models and use the estimated parameters to predict link formation and generate simulated trade networks. These trade networks are compared to observed trade networks in order to determine if gravity models are capable of explaining customary topological features of trade networks. They find that gravity models are often effective at replicating some aspects of trade networks such as the average number of trading partners each country maintains. However, they perform poorly at predicting more complex patterns such as clustering unless the presence of links is fixed and only the weights are predicted. Much of their difficulty in generating similar networks stems from a general inability to accurately replicate binary link formation.Footnote 2 My work builds on that of Dueñas and Fagiolo (2013) in several ways. It augments standard gravity frameworks by including network-based covariates in an effort to better capture certain network influences. It also compares gravity simulated networks to those produced by ERGM models and demonstrates the relative strengths and weaknesses of both. Ward et al. (2013) provide what is likely the most direct study of complex network influences in international trade. Similar to the present paper, the authors assert that dependencies exist between bilateral trade and the patterns of the entire network. However, rather than the ERGM methodology proposed here, they model these dependencies using a general bi-linear mixed effects model (GBME) based on the work of Hoff (2005). A GBME model studies the structure of a network through a process similar to ANOVA. Links between nodes are estimated such that the error terms are modeled as being composed of country-level random effects. Using these variance decompositions, many types of network dependencies can be identified, including reciprocity, sender and receiver effects, and shared third-party effects. Ward et al. find that the inclusion of complex network patterns improves the explanatory power of the gravity model and results in significantly higher \(R^2\) values. The work in this paper extends this line of research studying complex network dependencies in trade. I propose two methodologies for modeling these dependencies that each exhibit some advantages. The first uses gravity models in a similar vein as Dueñas and Fagiolo (2013). I modify standard gravity models to include a collection of variables reflecting aspects of the world trade network. This is done for two types of models. The first is a typical gravity model using bilateral trade values and a PPML estimation approach. The second examines only the presence of trade and not its value, similar to the extensive-margin stage of the two-stage gravity model of Helpman et al. (2008) or the analysis of Baldwin and Harrigan (2011). The first approach more closely follows the work in the gravity literature while the second approach is more representative of much of the work in the network literature, which often focuses on the presence of trade rather than the value. The second approach also compliments a notable weakness of the first, which is that most gravity models of trade values—despite being effective at modeling bilateral trade overall—are largely unable to predict zero trade occurrences. Both types of gravity models provide evidence that bilateral trade patterns are significantly influenced by certain network patterns. I find that reciprocity between countries, common third-party trading partners, and the number of import and export relationships maintained by each country are significant determinants of bilateral trade. In most cases, these empirical findings are consistent with many of the theoretical predictions of the past literature. The second methodology uses an empirical network approach known as an exponential random graph model. ERGMs are relatively new to the field of economics but have gained some popularity in recent years. For example, both Pan (2018) and Smith et al. (2019) used ERGMs to models aspects of trade. ERGMs estimate the likelihood of each bilateral trade relationship forming within the network, conditional on the structure of the rest of the network and other factors. Parameters relating to the assumed dependencies are estimated using a maximum likelihood approach. The estimated model is that which makes the observed trade network the most likely network to have formed from among all possible trade networks. Compared to other network methodologies, such as the the GBME models used by Ward et al. (2013), ERGMs offer a great deal of flexibility in terms of the types of network dependencies that they can include. GBME models identify network dependencies by decomposing error terms into specific functional forms, which necessitate a considerable amount of model structure. ERGMs, by comparison, include network dependencies in an additive way, making it easier to alter the types of dependencies included in the model. Thus, while there may be considerable overlaps in the objectives of the present paper and Ward et al. (2013), the work presented here intends to not only provide additional affirmation of the importance of network dependencies in international trade but also demonstrate alternative methods for studying them. The ERGM estimations provide new evidence that network patterns significantly affect international trade. The estimates show that reciprocity and shared third-party trading partners are significant determinants of bilateral trade, similar to the results from the gravity models. In addition to estimating the impacts of network dependencies using both gravity models and ERGMs, the models are tested on their ability to reproduce the complex network patterns present in actual trade. Estimated models based on both methodologies are used to simulate samples of predicted trade networks, similar to what is done by Dueñas and Fagiolo (2013). These samples of trade networks are then compared to the actual observed trade network to determine which methodology better captures and replicates important types of network patterns. The tests demonstrate that both approaches perform better at replicating different aspects of the world trade network. In the application considered, the ERGM approach better captures the number of trade links in the network and performs relatively well at replicating the way countries share third-party partners. The gravity approach better captures the number of countries with which each country trades as well as the distance between countries in terms of links. These results indicate that (i) ERGMs are a powerful tool for analyzing aspects of international trade and (ii) structural gravity models are already effective at capturing many complex network patterns. By tying together the gravity literature and the empirical network literature through these comparisons, this work represents a novel contribution to both. The ability to properly model complex network patterns in trade is important. From an ex post perspective, these patterns are influential determinants of trade behavior and integral in understanding bilateral trade. From an ex ante perspective, being able to properly model trade networks and, in particular, the extensive margin of trade is crucial. For example, there is a growing recent literature using structural gravity models to conduct counterfactual analyses of trade policy and other phenomenon (c.f. Yotov et al. (2016), Anderson and Yotov (2016), Baier et al. (2019), Kohl (2019), and Brakman et al. (2018)). These models typically rely on PPML estimations, which—as discussed above—are unable to adequately model zero trade flows and the extensive margin. The network based approaches that I describe could be a useful refinement to these methods and provide a means by which to predict non-trading countries in a counterfactual scenario. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the gravity approach for modeling network dependencies in trade. Section 3 presents the ERGM approach. Section 4 compares both methodologies’ ability to replicate complex network patterns. Section 5 concludes.",7

An indication of the extent to which PTAs have proliferated in the last 3 decades is provided in Fig. 1, which plots the number of country-pairs with a PTA along with the number of country-pairs that formed a PTA in each year from 1970 to 2015. The share of world trade among PTA members increased from 22% in 1965 to 60% in 2010, while the share of World Trade Organisation (WTO) country-pairs with PTAs rose from 2% in 1965 to more than 25% in 2010 and their corresponding trade share within the WTO rose from 30 to 60% (Limao, 2016). Although average tariffs have been negotiated down, there remain a wide range of non-tariff barriers to be negotiated away. With little prospect of full multilateral liberalisation in the foreseeable future, PTAs have become the most important source of trade policy ‘liberalisation’ for most countries, almost by default. Source: Updated from Falvey and Foster-McGregor (2018) Number of new country-pairs with PTAs by year. The membership of PTAs has also changed over this period, both in terms of the number of countries involved and their diversity in income levels and geographical proximity (Falvey & Foster-McGregor, 2018; Kohl et al., 2016). Accompanying this has been an expansion in the ‘breadth’ of PTAs in terms of the coverage of their provisions.Footnote 2 Our evidence for this draws on the database of Hofmann et al (2017), which contains information on the inclusion of 52 policy areas and their legal enforceability for 279 trade agreements signed between 189 countries in the period 1958 to 2015. In Fig. 2 we list the fraction of these agreements that contain each of the 18 ‘core’ economic provisions in 1980 and in 2015. All provisions appear in a higher proportion of PTAs in 2015, except those relating to agriculture, competition policy, state aid and antidumping. Proportion of PTAs that include each core provisions. Notes This figure reports the share of all PTAs that include the relevant provision as a legally enforceable commitment in the text of the agreement. TRIMs refer to trade related investment measures; IPR to intellectual property rights; TRIPs to the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights agreement; SPS to sanitary and phytosanitary standards; STE to state trading enterprises; GATS to the general agreement on trade in services; CVM to counter-veiling measures; TBT to technical barriers to trade; and AD to anti-dumping duties The proliferation of PTAs has prompted a significant empirical literature primarily aimed at determining whether a PTA creates trade between its members and, less frequently, whether this trade has been diverted from non-members. The bulk of this analysis has employed some variant of the ‘gravity equation’, interpreted as a reduced form equation which can be generated by a range of models explaining bilateral trade flows. The typical approach has been to include a dummy variable indicating whether or not a bilateral trade flow was covered by a PTA and to interpret the estimated coefficient on this dummy as indicating its average effect. Results from this literature suggest that PTAs have a positive impact upon trade flows. But there is considerable heterogeneity in the outcomes,Footnote 3 with PTA effects varying across time (Baier & Bergstrand, 2009), across agreements (Eicher & Henn, 2011), by trade partner (Eicher & Henn, 2011; Cheong et al, 2014; Baier et al. 2018) and by the geographical, cultural, institutional and development characteristics of the country-pairs involved (Baier et al. 2018).Footnote 4 One straightforward response to this heterogeneity is to acknowledge that PTAs are not homogenous and to construct individual dummies for specific PTAs. But for more general conclusions regarding PTAs, a ‘deeper’ investigation of the ‘trade liberalisation’ they provide appears necessary. Baier et al. (2014) take a step in this direction by considering various types of economic integration agreements, finding that deeper agreements have larger trade effects, while Baier et al. (2018) further show that the effect of PTAs is found to depend upon proxies capturing the variable and fixed costs of exporting, with these costs impacting upon the intensive and extensive margins differently.Footnote 5 In order to meet their WTO obligations, PTA members must remove barriers on substantially all trade. One can infer from Fig. 2 that this requirement is met if a PTA has provisions dealing with tariff liberalisation and the elimination of non-tariff barriers on industrial goods, as these provisions are present in all agreements. But a glance at the list of other provisions in Fig. 2 reveals that while some (e.g., IPRs and GATS) may be aimed at inducing increased economic interaction among the members, they are not necessarily going to increase international trade in goods. Indeed, the opposite may be the case, if, for example, goods trade and services trade are substitutes (Falvey & Foster-McGregor, 2018). The effects of PTAs on the total value of exports can be decomposed into two channels: changes in the number of products exported (the extensive margin) and changes in the average value of the typical export (the intensive margin). Interpreting changes at the extensive margin is straightforward—does the PTA result in more or fewer products being exported? However, as Head and Mayer (2014) point out, changes in average exports reflect not only changes in the quantity of goods sold by continuing exporters, (which is often interpreted as the intensive margin but which might be better referred to as the ‘continuing margin’), but also changes in the quantity of exports resulting from the entry or exit of exporters (which Head and Mayer (2014) refer to as the ‘compositional margin’). More precisely, changes in average trade values of continuing exporters are likely to be positive for a reduction in trade costs; but changes at the compositional margin could be negative if the trade-cost reduction results in many new exporters with low export volumes. In the present paper, the term ‘intensive margin’ will include both the continuing and the compositional margins.Footnote 6 One finding of the empirical analysis below is that policy changes often seem to have opposing effects on the adjustments at the intensive and extensive margins. This might be attributable to resource constraints. If the production resources required by exporting firms can only be obtained at increasing costs, then an expansion at one margin may well be accompanied by a contraction at the other. For example, suppose that a policy change specifically increases the demand for resources by potential exporters. This causes resource costs to the sector to rise which will squeeze existing exporters (whose optimal export volumes fall). Hence the extensive margin may expand at the expense of the intensive margin.Footnote 7 Even if a reduction in trade costs creates an increase in demand for resources by both existing and potential exporters in the sector, the resulting cost increase could have a differential impact at the two margins.Footnote 8 Other possible explanations for opposing effects at the two margins come through general equilibrium effects in a multi-sector economy. It is highly likely that the PTA provides uneven cost reductions across sectors while still meeting the (self-enforced) mandate to cover ‘substantially all trade’. The PTA will cause resource reallocations among exporting sectors as well as from (largely) import-competing to (largely) exporting sectors. These (potentially opposing) effects of policy changes will presumably influence the provisions selected for inclusion in a PTA. The bilateral negotiations over PTAs are typically motivated by governments seeking better market access for their exporters. Because of firms’ rivalry for domestic resources and because the concessions willing to be offered by the trading partner are limited, the actual mix of PTA provisions may well reflect the ‘competing’ interests of firms in different sectors and at the opposing margins within a sector. Considerable attention has been paid to these margins in recent empirical contributions in international trade.Footnote 9 Partly this reflects the relatively recent availability of disaggregated data, but it also recognizes the key role that new products may play in the dynamic gains from trade (Kehoe & Ruhl, 2013; Kehoe et al., 2015).Footnote 10 Several contributions have examined the impact of specific trade liberalisations or PTAs on the volume and variety of traded goods. There are a small number of relatively recent papers that use the gravity equation to explore the impact of PTAs on aggregate trade flows, intensive (goods) margins, and extensive (goods) margins for many goods, country pairs, and years. Frensch (2010) examines the relationship between import margins and trade liberalisation for 36 countries, finding that the main effect of liberalisation occurs along the extensive margin of imports, with the effects on intermediate and capital imports being stronger than those on consumer goods. Similarly, Foster et al. (2011) find that PTAs tend to work largely by impacting upon the extensive margin of trade. However, Baier et al (2014) reach the opposite conclusion finding that PTAs tend to impact upon the intensive margin to a greater extent than the extensive margin. More generally, Baier et al. (2018) show that the geographic, cultural, institutional, and development characteristics of country-pairs are found to significantly impact upon the relationship between PTAs and the extensive margin, while geographic variables—distance and adjacency—are found to impact upon the relationship between PTAs and the intensive margin. Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) demonstrate that the results are likely to be sensitive to the way the extensive margin is defined, a point we discuss in more detail below. One explanation for these apparently contradictory results could lie in differences in the ‘depth’ of the PTAs examined. Dür et al (2013), Baier et al (2014) find that deeper integration agreements tend to have larger impacts on trade flows than shallower agreements. Most recently, Falvey and Foster-McGregor (2018) used the ‘horizontal depth’ indicator constructed by Hoffman et al. (2017) and a dose response model to examine the impact of PTA depth on trade flows. Results indicate a non-linear effect of PTA depth on trade, which could be loosely traced back to the composition of the provisions in those agreements.Footnote 11 In this paper we extend the recent literature investigating the heterogeneous effects of PTAs (e.g., Baier et al. 2018, 2019; Cipollina & Salvatici, 2010; Eicher & Henn, 2011), by using data on the core economic provisions included in PTAs to examine their impact on aggregate trade (export) flows, and on the intensive and extensive margins of exports. In doing this we extend Baier et al. (2014) who considered the direct and lagged effects of PTAs on aggregate trade and its margins; and Kohl (2014) and Kohl et al. (2016) who considered the effects of the breadth of PTAs on aggregate trade flows. Specifically, we are interested in identifying which core PTA provisions promote goods trade in general and which appear to be aimed at broader economic interactions, how different types of provisions affect exports at the intensive and extensive margins, the sensitivity of these estimated effects to the threshold used to define the extensive margin, and their contemporaneous and decadal (after 10 year) effects on different trade flows. Our results indicate that measures applied at the border or on a preferential basis tend to support existing exporters (large and small) but not new exporters, while measures applied behind the border tend to have the opposite effects. Measures applied on an MFN basis tend to support large and new exporters, but not small exporters. When included individually we find that provisions fall into two categories: those that have similar effects across both margins; and those that can have opposing effects at the two margins depending on the export threshold used to define the extensive margin. The remainder of the paper is set out as follows. Section 2 discusses our empirical methodology and describes the data used; Sect. 3 discusses our main results; while Sect. 4 concludes.",1

Its potential for division of labour, specialisation and efficient use of capital is unmatched by any domestic policy, which would inevitably be faced with rigidities and restrictions in these factors. Nonetheless, the intensity of international trade has been stagnant below assumed efficient levels even before the protectionist trends of the present. The causes for these so-called “dark” trade costs partly remain unknown, preventing both a solution and a more optimal outcome. In response to these anomalies, the trade literature has expanded the concept of economic gravity, based on market size, output and “hard” barriers—i.e. geographic distance and tariffs—by “soft” barriers such as cultural factors. These are based on persistent differences and similarities across countries, ranging from language or colonial history to shared values and even genetic distance. The proposed underlying mechanisms include facilitated communication, reduced informational frictions or historically established ties, but also even less tangible aspects such as shared beliefs and norms, that could foster bilateral trust, for example. By linking data and insights from behavioural economics to the trade context, this paper proposes novel additional mechanisms connecting culture with trade outcomes. To this end, term (patience) and risk preferences as well as reciprocal behaviour are incorporated into a gravity analysis using the novel GPS preference data by Falk et al. (2018). These preferences, likely shaped by culture and society within a given country, might affect negotiations between firms and agents of different nations. They inform their time horizons, influencing discounted values of a deal, their willingness to risk investment into a trade relationship and their responses to (non-)cooperative behaviour. Each of these four aspects could help explain trade outcomes and anomalies in volume between economically similar country pairs. Analytically, this paper is the first—to the best of the authors’ knowledge—to join the gravity model for trade with specific data on such behavioural preferences at the population level. That is, the observed preferences directly relate to economic decisions in the realm of contract theory and incomplete contracts. The paper expands the gravity model by a new dimension of soft barriers, which also provide a possible explanation for the effect of cultural distances on trade outcomes and for “missing trade” as well as “dark trade costs”. Preferences are integrated into the gravity framework using a two-step approach: Distances in preferences across countries are incorporated into a standard gravity model to measure the effects of bilateral differences in reciprocity as well as term and risk transformation considerations. The national preference levels, meanwhile, are analysed by decomposing the multilateral resistance terms of the gravity equation, a country’s overall propensity towards trade, thus discerning potential shifts in trade inclination associated with specific national preference leanings. The GPS is particularly well-suited to this analysis because of its broad scope and quality, covering 76 countries through nationally representative surveys on these preferences and experimental validations for them. This analysis finds that the distance in reciprocity between countries and term and risk orientation levels of a given country affect trade outcomes. Specifically, a distance in negative reciprocity between countries, i.e. the willingness to engage in costly punishment, is detrimental to export volumes by introducing unexpected costs in case of transaction issues. The national level of long-term orientation and higher levels of risk aversion, meanwhile, lower the average trade barriers for differentiated goods, while raising them for non-differentiated ones. Less risk aversion and shorter term orientation have the opposite effects. This reflects term and risk transformation concerns by national players, wherein a product mix is selected whose trade and contract conditions reflect term and risk profiles. That is, the longer the term orientation the more complex and differentiated the product mix, and: the more risk-averse a country, the less volatile and more differentiated the produced goods. Lastly, preference effects are overall stronger for exporters, differentiated goods and OECD-countries, indicating the link between preferences and negotiation intensity as well as the financial risks being placed on the exporter. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 relates the paper to the existing literature, leading into Sect. 3 which summarizes the hypotheses of the analysis. Section 4 introduces the data and the empirical strategy, whose results are reported in Sect. 5. Section 6 discusses a set of robustness checks and their results. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes with a short discussion on the results and considerations for further research.",
158,1,Review of World Economics,28 July 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00432-3,Individual preferences on trade liberalization: evidence from a Japanese household survey,February 2022,Gabriel Felbermayr,Toshihiro Okubo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Investigating the impact of trade liberalization on product/factor prices, income, and welfare across nations, and discussing who are the losers and the winners of international trade has a long history. The recent wave of globalization through trade liberalization resulted in lowering trade and telecommunication costs. It has been believed that globalization benefits overall. However, some groups of people in many developed countries resist the wave of globalization and incline toward protectionism. The current voting behavior such as the UK referendum reveals that no small number of people are against trade liberalization. This paper investigates individual’s preference on trade liberalization using a unique household survey in Japan, the Keio Household Panel Survey (KHPS). The current international trade literature has studied whether an individual’s preference on trade liberalization is determined by the Stolper–Samuelson theorem or new political economy of trade (behavioral effects and noneconomic factors, e.g., risk attitude, identity, experience, and noncognitive aspects). This paper is in this tradition. Although the large benefit of free trade has been explored by many studies on international trade theory, it seems that much of the public does not understand it properly. There is still a large gap between what economists have investigated and the real world revealed by voting behaviors. For instance, a Japanese newspaper article reported it. In a series of newspaper article, “Keizai Kyoushitsu” (Short lecture on Economics) in the Nikkei Newspaper (October 16, 2009), a survey by the Nikkei Newspaper associated with the Japanese Economic Association asked common Japanese people and Japanese economists about whether free trade should be sustained or limited.Footnote 1 While 60% of common people are negative to free trade (restrict free trade in some cases or many cases), 20% are positive (perfectly or generally sustain free trade). By contrast, around 30% of economists are negative to free trade, while around 60% are positive. The newspaper article concludes that many common people do not deeply understand economics (e.g., international trade theory) and public opinion tends to be far from what international trade theory has uncovered. Japan is a good country to investigate this issue. First, Japan has engaged in trade liberalization in the last several decades and promoted many kinds of trade liberalization schemes, including free trade agreements (FTA) and economic partnership agreements (EPAs). Except for agriculture, tariff rates are low enough overall. The Japanese people have enjoyed the benefit of trade liberalization and global value chains.Footnote 2 Thus, it is worthwhile to ask them about their trade preferences. Second, Japan is homogeneous in terms of race and language but has some regional variations in culture, economic/noneconomic behaviors, and preferences. In this sense, whether individual factors and/or regional factors affect an individual’s trade preference can be investigated. Third, we have a unique household panel survey, which asks many questions on household/individual socioeconomic factors (e.g., gender, income, job status, and education) as well as noneconomic factors (e.g., noncognitive and social stance). We can test the impact of noneconomic factors. Lastly, Japan ratified the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) and the timing of our household survey is in the process of the agreement.Footnote 3 Thus, individuals are exposed to a critical moment of trade liberalization, which provides an occasion to think about the pros and cons of free trade. Literature review In the previous literature, some empirical studies uncovered individual behaviors on trade liberalization using individual-level survey data. Early studies mainly focus on an individual’s trade policy preference, skill and occupation to test whether trade theory holds (e.g., Scheve and Slaughter 2001; O’Rourke and Sinnott 2006; Beaulieu et al. 2005; Jakel and Smolka 2013, 2017).Footnote 4 However, more recent empirical studies state that trade policy preferences of individuals are not greatly influenced by traditional economic factors, such as job occupation/industry and income. Rather than these economic factors, some noneconomic factors crucially affect the attitude toward trade liberalization. Blonigen (2011), using a US survey of 5524 individuals, found that educational background is the only significant factor for trade preference. Similar results were also found by Mayda and Rodrik (2005) using the 1995 ISSP (The International Social Survey Programme) data including 28,456 people over 23 countries. Our paper investigates more conventional factors in a more specific event. Using the Japanese household survey, our focus is on Japan’s ratification of the TPP. Through this event, we investigate an individual’s preference on trade liberalization. TPP is a free trade agreement among Asian Pacific nations. Twelve countries including Japan first ratified the TPP agreement in February 2016, but the United States left the TPP in January 2017. In Japan, the National Diet concluded the TPP treaty in December 2016.Footnote 5 Cabinet Office (2010), using the GTAP model, estimated that the Japanese economy will gain 2–3 trillion yen by joining TPP, which is equivalent to 0.5% of GDP. Much closer to our paper, Naoi and Urata (2013) and Tomiura et al. (2016, 2021) investigated Japanese individual preference on trade liberalization. Their data are individual level and a one-shot Internet survey. Naoi and Urata (2013) used a public opinion survey on citizens’ attitudes toward the TPP in January 2012 (one-shot) that had 3,798 respondents from ages 20 to 69 years. The data include gender, age, occupation, education, and political stance. They found that elderly educated males and supporters of the government party tend to be positive toward TPP. Tomiura et al. (2016, 2021) used another unique survey data of 10,000 individuals in Japan (October 2011). The data include attitude to import liberalization, gender, age, annual income, educational attainment, industry of job and occupation, love for his/her hometown and some risk questions. They found that people working for agriculture are substantially more likely to be protectionist and strongly against free trade.Footnote 6 People in managerial occupations with a university degree and/or high-income people tend to be positive to free trade.Footnote 7 A much deeper analysis of noneconomic factors has been explored in experimental methods (Kerner and Sumner 2020; Nguyen 2017; Alfaro et al. 2019), although experimental methods are beyond our scope. Closer to ours, non-experimental study on noneconomic factor is done by Yamamura and Tsutsui (2019). They highlighted noncognitive skills and experiences in childhood using 10,000 individual surveys (in July 2016). They investigated how education and experience in childhood form noncognitive skills and then affect trade preference when they grew up. They also found that sporting and informal education in childhood foster positive feelings on group working, mutual trust, and competition, which ends up affecting their positive preference for free trade. Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, this paper contributes to the literature by providing evidences on the role of various noneconomic factors such as such as non-cognitive skills, behavioral biases, and past experience that have not been fully investigated in the previous studies (e.g. Naoi and Urata 2013; Tomiura et al. 2016; Yamamura and Tsutsui 2019). Second, this paper investigates how noneconomic factors affect individual’s trade preference in three aspects, not only (1) pros and cons of trade liberalization as previous studies have done, but also (2) expectation of increasing income by free trade (3) expectation of improving life quality by free trade, and (4) monetary compensation. As a result of estimations, we find several interesting results. People’s attitude toward trade liberalization is affected by economic factors as well as noneconomic factors such as non-cognitive factors and behavioral biases. For instance, male, educated, and people with smaller family prefer trade liberalization. Furthermore, people who live a happy life, prefer liberty to equality and have less local patriotism, tend to be positive to trade liberalization. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our household data, stylized facts, and empirical strategy. Section 3 reports the result of trade preference and Sect. 4 investigates income change by TPP as well as the quality of life and compensation. The final section is the conclusion.",2
158,1,Review of World Economics,24 August 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00433-2,Productive government expenditure and its impact on income inequality: evidence from international panel data,February 2022,Stephen J. Turnovsky,Iñaki Erauskin,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Many governments throughout the world have undertaken ambitious programs of public investment in order to enhance productivity and their country’s overall growth performance. This has occurred in emerging-market economies such as India, China, and Brazil that have expanded public investment in various forms of infrastructure. It has also been the case that among developed countries a significant fraction of the increase in government stimulus spending following the Financial Crisis of 2007–08 was directed toward infrastructure. At the same time, income inequality has also risen steadily around the world, both in emerging economies and most OECD countries. This raises the important question of the nature of the relationship (if any) between pro-growth infrastructure investment policies and the observed increase in inequality. Indeed, as Anand and Segal (2008) point out, reducing inequality may be an important social objective for a government. The issue then is whether investment in public infrastructure, with its accompanying growth and productivity benefits, is compatible with this objective.Footnote 1 Originating with Arrow and Kurz (1970) and later Barro (1990), the relationship between public investment and growth has been extensively studied, with general agreement that government spending on infrastructure can yield significant productivity and growth benefits.Footnote 2 It is also clear that by interacting with labor and private capital, public investment has a direct impact on relative factor returns, and may therefore have potentially significant redistributive effects as the economy evolves.
 But in contrast to the public investment-growth relationship, empirical evidence on the relationship between infrastructure investment and inequality is sparse and inconclusive. Much of it focuses on developing economies. For instance, Ferranti et al. (2004), Fan and Zhang (2004), and Calderón and. Servén (2004) find that public investment in roads, dams, and telecommunications has contributed toward the alleviation of inequality and poverty in China and Latin America. In contrast, Brakman et al. (2002) find that government spending on infrastructure has increased regional disparities within Europe, and Artadi and Sala-i-Martin (2003) point to excessive public investment as a contributing factor to rising income inequality in Africa. Banerjee and Somanathan (2007) report that in India, access to critical infrastructure services and public goods is in general positively correlated with the dispersion of income and social status, even though the provision of such goods is intended to benefit the poor. A World Bank (2006) report also finds that the quality and performance of state-provided infrastructure services tend to be the worst in India's poorest states. Further, Khandker and Koolwal (2007) find that access to paved roads has had a limited distributional impact in rural Bangladesh. A more recent empirical study by Makmuri (2017), using data from Indonesian provinces, finds that while some forms of infrastructure reduce income inequality, others have an exacerbating effect, which on balance dominates. In their comprehensive overview of this literature, Calderón and Servén (2014) comment on the tentative conclusions with regard to the infrastructure-inequality relationship, and express the need to examine in more detail the precise mechanism through which these two key variables may be linked.Footnote 3 As an initial step in this direction, Chatterjee and Turnovsky (2012) have carried out extensive simulations. Their findings, which tend to be robust, include the following. Government spending on public capital leads to a persistent increase in wealth inequality over time, regardless of how it is financed. In contrast, the time paths of both pre- and post-tax income inequality are sensitive to the financing policy adopted, and in many cases are characterized by sharp intertemporal tradeoffs. The objective of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation of the relationship between government investment and inequality, one that draws directly on the insights provided by an underlying analytical framework. For this purpose, we base our study on the simpler framework of the standard one-sector neoclassical Ramsey and AK-Barro technologies, rather than the Chatterjee-Turnovsky analysis. This is because an essential element of the Chatterjee-Turnovsky setup is the interaction between public and private capital in the process of the evolution of wealth and income distribution, while the dataset we employ pertains to a diverse set of international economies, for many of which the relevant public capital data are unavailable. Despite the parsimonious nature of these basic one-sector models, they still provide useful benchmarks for our empirical study. The crucial mechanism whereby government investment impacts income distribution is by enhancing productivity (as measured by TFP). In this respect, it has been shown that the consequences for long-run income inequality, implied by a standard Ramsey technology, are contrary to those implied by the corresponding one-sector AK technology as in the basic Barro (1990) endogenous growth model.Footnote 4 In the former case, the declining productivity of capital as it accumulates, favors labor income over capital income, and since more capital is owned by the relatively wealthy, income inequality tends to decline. In contrast, the continually growing level of government expenditure associated with the AK technology sustains the productivity of private capital. Provided the intertemporal elasticity of substitution ensures a sufficiently large (but still empirically plausible) equilibrium growth rate, it is possible for the overall effect to favor the owners of capital, the relatively wealthy, so that income inequality actually rises. While the underlying reason is straightforward, this observation is important when it comes to assessing the consequences of public investment, directed toward enhancing private productivity and growth, for wealth and income inequality. It is also of practical importance in an empirical analysis that employs a comprehensive international dataset ranging over a diverse set of economies undergoing diverse growth experiences. As is well known, there are many measures of income inequality, the most prevalent being the Gini coefficient. While most of our analysis also employs this standard measure, we should note that it may be measured in different ways and can be based on different data source, as a result of which it may vary substantially depending on the methods employed to calculate it. The most comprehensive source for actual inequality data is the “All the Ginis” (ATG) database, compiled by Milanovic (2019). This seeks to “standardize” Gini coefficients, in response to variations in its coverage and comparability arising from the different sources among countries. More details of the ATG database, that we choose to use, are provided in Sect. 5. However, the Gini coefficient, being an aggregate measure of inequality, has its limitations. For example, the Gini may remain unchanged in response to government investment (or any other structural change) if different parts of the income distribution respond in exactly compensating ways. Furthermore, it conceals precisely where the policy impacts the income distribution. To obtain further insight as to how different parts of the income distribution are affected by government expenditure we also estimate its impact on the shares of household income across quintiles. Our study employs a dataset of 80 countries over the period 1980–2015, with some basic summary statistics for key variables being reported in Table 1. In specifying the regressions it is necessary to distinguish productive government expenditure as it impacts a stationary neoclassical technology from its impact on an endogenously growing economy. To do this, it is convenient to introduce an aggregate level of government expenditure as appropriate for the former, together with the ratio of government expenditure to GDP, as appropriate for the latter. Using these measures, described in more detail below, the empirical results employing the aggregate Gini strongly support the underlying proposition that productive government expenditure reduces income inequality, if the production function is of the neoclassical form with a declining marginal product of private capital. At the same time, we find that it increases inequality for the growing economy, consistent with the underlying theory, provided the intertemporal elasticity of substitution exceeds some threshold level of around 0.5, well within the estimated range. These results are robust with respect to whether they are estimated using Fixed Effects, or using system GMM estimation. The significance of productive government expenditure as a determinant of income inequality is also supported by the regressions based on quintiles. There are, however, some differences that may be due in part to the fact that these estimates are based on a different data set. When estimated using fixed effects, an increase in the ratio of government investment to GDP increases the income share of the lowest four quintiles significantly, but by decreasing amounts, with the share of the top quintile declining. While the increased income share of the first quintile, coupled with the decline of the top quintile would imply a reduction in overall income inequality, the increased share of the middle groups renders the overall aggregate impact ambiguous. The system GMM estimates of the income shares are more supportive of the inequality estimates based on the Gini coefficient. The fact that an increase in the level of government expenditure increases the income share of the lowest quintile while reducing that of the highest quintile, with little impact on those in between, provides compelling support for the reduction in overall income inequality for the neoclassical technology. Likewise, the finding that increasing the ratio of government expenditure to GDP causes a reduction in the income shares of the lowest quintiles is consistent with the implications of the AK endogenous growth technology. As noted, our study employs an extensive international dataset covering a diverse range of countries at varying stages of development. In fact, both the level of development, and the more recent process of globalization, have played central roles in explaining the evolution of income inequality. The early industrialization of the United Kingdom and the United States provided the original explanation for the inverted-U pattern of income inequality identified in Kuznets’ (1955) original seminal work. In addition, the dramatic increase in globalization that began in the latter part of the 20th century, and is continuing, has also spawned a huge literature focusing on its potential as a source of the recent worldwide increase in income inequality. Our paper is clearly related to both these aspects, which we have focused on in greater detail elsewhere, where we have also related our contribution to the relevant extensive literature; see Erauskin and Turnovsky (2019). Since our earlier work focused primarily on financial globalization, it was based on a stochastic portfolio-based model that is more appropriate to address that issue. Nevertheless, in this paper we take account of these aspects by introducing measures of financial globalization and level of development as appropriate control variables. In both cases, we find them to be highly significant, consistent with our earlier work as well as the broader literature.Footnote 5 The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 sets out the basic model. Section 3 discusses the macroeconomic equilibrium and the relationship between productive government expenditure and wealth and income inequality. In both these sections we focus on the neoclassical production function. Section 4 then summarizes the modifications that arise with the AK technology. Section 5 describes the data sources, in particular discussing the ATG data in more detail. Section 6 describes the empirical adaptation of the model, with the empirical estimates being discussed in Sect. 7. Section 8 concludes, while the Appendix provides some technical details.",2
158,2,Review of World Economics,20 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00437-y,The contribution of immigration from Ukraine to economic growth in Poland,May 2022,Paweł Strzelecki,Jakub Growiec,Robert Wyszyński,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Poland is a converging country. Its catch-up process with Western Europe began around 1992, after the preceding turbulent transition period, and over the next decades it was fueled by rapid capital accumulation, systematic improvements in the educational attainment of the Polish population as well as technology transfer and institutional convergence in the run-up and after Poland’s accession to the European Union in 2004. Despite great improvements, though, until 2013 Poland remained an emigration country. About 1.2 million Poles (3% of the population) left the country between 2002 and 2013, with a particularly remarkable wave of 0.7 million emigrants to the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2004–2008.Footnote 1 This situation reversed abruptly in 2014. From that year onward Poland admitted probably between one and two million immigrants from Ukraine (Fig. 1).Footnote 2 This wave of immigration, of an unprecedented scale in Poland’s modern history, was significant also from the European perspective. In particular “in 2018, one out of five first residence permits was issued in Poland (635,000, or 20% of total permits issued in the EU)”, and conversely “citizens of Ukraine (527,000 beneficiaries, of which almost 78% in Poland) continued to receive the highest number of permits in the EU” (Eurostat 2019). In the years 2016–2018 Poland was also the top OECD destination for temporary labour immigrants (OECD 2020). A vast majority of Ukrainian immigrants arrived in Poland for economic reasons, and they immediately sought (and most of them found) employment here. Their immigration was prompted inter alia by strong labour demand, relatively easy short-term work and residence permits (pull factors) as well as the Russian aggression on Ukraine in 2014 with an ensuing economic crisis there (push factors). In contrast to migrants from Ukraine to Poland before 2014—less than 0.2 million of mostly temporary workers in the agricultural sector—the new immigrants located predominantly in cities and sought work across a broad spectrum of economic sectors. The scale of immigration to Poland from Ukraine according to different data sources Source: Ministry of Labour, Polish Border Guard data. Notes: The numbers for 2018 are not fully comparable with earlier data because of the introduction of an amendment to the Act on Employment Promotion and Labour Market Institutions, which changed the immigration law in Poland in two ways. First, declarations of employers planning to hire foreigners ceased to be only declarations of intention and became declarations on entrusting work. This eliminated unused declarations. Second, seasonal work permits were introduced, issued for a period of up to 9 months and acquired by employers planning to hire a foreigner in agriculture, horticulture, tourist industry and other activities considered seasonal Unfortunately, this massive inflow of Ukrainian workers was only marginally reflected in official Labour Force Survey (LFS) data. This is partly due to definition problems—only migrants staying longer than one year are included in the LFS, whereas the (renewable) legal period of stay based on so-called invitations is typically 6–9 months. Furthermore, immigrants are also statistically less likely to participate in surveys than natives. Crucially, however, this omission—regardless of its causes—has stark consequences for economic growth decompositions using LFS data. The failure to include the inflow of immigrants in estimates of labour supply implies underestimation of growth in the number of workers and total hours worked in the economy and subsequent overestimation of growth in (residual) total factor productivity (TFP). This is a problem that needs to be fixed or otherwise our estimates of sources of economic growth in Poland—and, on principle, anywhere where immigrants are not included in the official calculation of labour supply—will be systematically biased. The contribution of the current paper is to impute the labour of immigrant workers from Ukraine—measured in terms of productivity-adjusted hours worked—to the official LFS labour supply data for Poland which essentially represents the labour of Poles. To this end we first construct an estimate of the actual number of immigrants, using a variety of auxiliary sources from the Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Polish Social Security Institution (ZUS) and the Border Guard, each providing different partial information. Second, to obtain a precise estimate of the productivity-adjusted labour supply of immigrant workers we use information on their hours worked and worker characteristics, allowing us to identify their productivity. We obtain this information from survey datasets on migrant characteristics, collected by NBP among Ukrainians residing in four Polish cities: Warsaw, Lublin, Wrocław and Bydgoszcz (Chmielewska et al. 2019). The data suggest that migrants, compared to the natives, are characterized by more hours worked on average but greater concentration in low-skill, low-wage jobs. In particular, they are often employed in occupations below their formal education level (brain waste). They are also often remunerated less at equal occupations and with prima facie equal skills (Strzelecki 2018), either due to wage discrimination or unmeasured differences between labour productivity and employment costs, which may reflect, e.g., instability of contracts, lower firm- and task-specific human capital, imperfect applicability of knowledge gained abroad to nominally the same occupations in the host country, or linguistic barriers to communication. In the final step, we plug our imputations into a standard growth accounting procedure and thereby identify the contribution of Ukrainian workers to GDP growth in Poland. In our baseline case, we find that in 2013–18 the arrival of migrant workers from Ukraine increased growth in the effective labour supply in Poland by 0.8% per annum on average. Based on this imputation we infer that the (previously unaccounted) contribution of Ukrainian workers to Poland’s GDP growth in 2013–2018 amounted to 0.5 pp. per annum on average, or about 13% of total growth. The same figure should be subtracted from the residual contribution of TFP growth, suggesting that recent growth in Poland has been much more labour-intensive than previously interpreted. As the estimation of magnitude and structure of migration is fraught with uncertainty, we pursue extensive robustness checks of our results. We consider a range of alternative scenarios, making different assumptions regarding the number of migrants, their average hours worked and structure in terms of observable characteristics. This generates a fan chart of possible effects of immigration around the baseline scenario. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the associated literature, referring in particular to the available estimates of the contribution of immigrant workers to GDP growth in other countries (e.g., of Polish immigrants to the UK). Section 3 presents the empirical methodology and discusses the data sources. Section 4 handles the uncertainty in measurement of migration by considering a range of alternative scenarios. Section 5 presents the main results. Section 6 concludes. Robustness checks and supplementary tables are included in the ""Appendix"".",6

This research represents an attempt to study the causal impact on the dependence structure between financial markets by major events or shocks such as, Brexit, Sovereign debt crisis, Subprime crisis, and Covid-19 pandemics. Indeed, the announcement of withdraw of UK from the European Union and the transitional phase, namely pre-Brexit, would have a substantial effect on the linkages between European financial markets. Using data from 28 February 2008 to 11 March 2021, this work takes advantage of the announcement of UK withdraw from the EU and the subsequent transition process to test the impact on the dependence structure between European financial markets. Undoubtedly, Brexit is a major event in the history of EU. Since its announcement, Brexit has urged individuals, businesses, and policy makers to anticipate possible scenarios including threats, opportunities, exit strategies. Brexit is, indeed, associated with a high degree of financial, economic risks and uncertainties that would substantially affect UK, EU markets. The impact of pre-Brexit on the dependence structure of EU markets has received little or no attention of the literature. This work constitutes an attempt to provide findings that carry important implications for the post‐Brexit UK in transition and for European countries. COVID-19 global pandemic exponential spread around the world has caused overwhelming challenges to global public health and left households and businesses counting economic losses. Since its eruption, this global pandemic has increased tremendously uncertainty and fear of human and economic losses. Moreover, it is not clear how full social and economic recovery would take place. The analysis of potential effects of this major pandemic on various economic and financial markets around the globe has received little or no attention from the literature. Our work attempts to shed lights on these fundamental aspects by measuring risk transmission and global market linkages. The analysis of the European sovereign debt crisis of 2009, a major economic event of the recent years, has been the subject of increasing interest in the academic literature. The study of the dependence between eurozone financial markets and in particular the analysis of dependence among sovereign CDS markets represent both a theoretical and an empirical framework that capture sovereign default risk transmission among sovereign European CDS markets. Sovereign Credit Derivative Swap (CDS) is a derivative instrument that allow investors to swap credit risk that a country may go into default or experience substantial difficulties. Sovereign CDS spreads express default sovereign risk. In this regard, high sovereign default risks are expressed by large sovereign CDS spreads. Debt crisis has major adverse effects not only on political stability but also on and economic and financial stability but more importantly on individual welfare and social cohesion. The Greek crisis spreads very quickly to Ireland, Spain, Italy and Portugal. As the turbulence spread over several euro-zone economies. Several reform programs and bailout plans have been proposed to rescue institutions and governments in particular for Greece (Fratzsher et al. 2016, Hryckiewicz 2014 and Kizys et al. 2016). Nonetheless, linkages between financial markets have not received much attention as during the recent European debt crisis. Understanding the nature of linkages between markets and economies is fundamental for effective policy design and rational investment choices and it is not clear whether such model of uncertainty transmission exists or has been used. Contagion is defined as the spread of a crisis from one market, region, or country to another. Because markets, regions or countries are interconnected, major events in one market region or country can impact others. Authors argue that contagion is characterized by an amplification and persistence of spillover effects (see Allen and Gale (2000), Dornbusch et al. (2000), Pericoli and Sbracia (2003) among others). Potential effects of crisis transmission or contagion are measured based on historical data or information on existing relationships or linkages between financial markets. In assessing linkages between financial markets, authors distinguish between crisis period and tranquillity or calm period. In principle, during a crisis or stress period, transmission of uncertainty is supposed to increase in comparison to a calm or normal period. Links change depending upon the level of stress. Authors considers risk contagion is expressed by major co-movements and volatility spillovers (see, e.g., Sachs et al. (1996), Masson (1999a, b, c), Dornbusch et al. (2000), Pericoli and Sbracia (2003) and Dungey et al. (2006)). One might argue that analysing the degree of the co-movement between financial markets during crisis periods, relative to that in calm periods may demonstrate the normal interdependence between financial markets and economies. Distinction is made between contagion and interdependence. Forbes and Rigobon (2002) define contagion as a significant increase in the cross-market linkages during a crisis or a common shock after controlling for fundamentals. Prior to Forbes and Rigobon (2002), authors chiefly address interdependence and not financial contagion. Since the publication of Forbes and Rigobon (2002), financial contagion has been examined mainly around the notion of “correlation breakdown”. Financial contagion could be internal ,i.e., cross-markets but also global ,i.e., cross-borders. External shocks may affect any asset market in an economy, and then spread to asset markets in other countries as well. Internal shocks may spread out by inter-linkages to other domestic asset markets. If a crisis strikes a given financial market around the globe, negative shocks are transmitted from the source to other financial markets. In the case of the European debt crisis, sovereign CDS were initially unaffected but as the crisis evolves the effect spread out to other financial markets. Most of the research studies financial contagion in the context of equity markets (Fry-McKibbin et al., 2021). Few existing empirical works focuses on contagion effect between sovereign CDS and commodity markets during a sovereign debt crisis. Research on sovereign CDS markets, analyses co-movement of sovereign CDS with other assets, mainly stocks and bonds. More recent studies analyse the development of correlations between commodities and financial assets in the aftermath of the global financial crisis (Sun et al., 2020). Authors focus more on contagion effect between commodity and other financial markets (see Sharpe (1964), Grubel and Fadner (1971), King and Wadhwani (1990), Engle et al. (1990), Bekaert and Hodrick (1992), and later from Forbes and Rigobon (2002), Barberis et al. (2005), Hwang et al. (2013), Aloui and Hkiri (2014), Alotaibi and Mishra (2015), Ji et al. (2018a, b, c), Chen et al. (2020)). Most authors have mainly focused on the transmission mechanism of sovereign risk. However, there is absence of consensus on the transmission pattern among the European countries, see Louzis (2015), Alter and Beyer (2014), De Bruyckere et al. (2013), Alter and Schuler (2012), Barth et al. (2012), Arezki et al. (2011), Caceres et al. (2010). For example, Brutti and Saure (2015) find that the exposure to Greek government debt and Greek banks’ assets are main sources of strengthening transmission's risk. Kohonon (2014) argues that sovereign default risk was transmitted from the Greek bonds markets only at the early stage of the crisis. Using VAR, Dieblod and Yilmaz (2012, 2014) examine financial spillovers effects between various economies and markets. Apostolakis and Papadopoulos (2015) analyse the effects between the G7 banking, securities and foreign exchange markets, identifying interactions between them. Grammatikos and Vermeulen (2012) find strong evidence of a crisis transmission from US non-financials to European non-financials. The analysis of the relevant literature shows scarcity of research on sovereign contagion risk between sovereign CDS and financial markets during the European debt crisis. Moreover, the analysis of sovereign contagion between sovereign CDS and commodity markets are even more scarce. Several authors discuss the nature of the co-movement or correlation or time-varying correlation among different sovereign CDS markets or between sovereign CDS and stock markets. Nonetheless, there absence of research on contagion between sovereign CDS and commodity markets. Moreover, authors analyse more global financial contagion and not contagion across domestic financial markets. On technical issues, authors have privileged linear correlations approach to examine the linkages between international financial markets. More recently, researchers have turned to use various techniques to examine the dependence structures between assets across markets and countries, see Chen et al. (2020), Zhang et al. (), Daehler et al. (2021). Indeed, most of the linear correlation analysis is not time varying. In addition, it is difficult to analyse the asymmetric dependency between various markets by applying linear correlation. Also, linear correlation does not capture extreme downside risk spillovers. In contrast, copula methods allow to describe the dynamic and asymmetric dependency structures. The copula approach provides a tool to isolate the dependence pattern from the marginal distributions, and it is possible to obtain more conveniently dependency structure and contagion effects. Durante and Jaworski (2010), use copula methods to show that dependency between financial markets in the crisis period is higher than that of the tranquillity period. In this paper, we attempt to examine the impact of major global crises, pre-Brexit, Covid-19 pandemic, sovereign debt crisis, on the dependence structure between financial markets. A particular focus is given to sovereign risk contagion by providing an alternative measure to linear correlation that go beyond the specification of the crisis and non-crisis periods via suitable thresholds. This measure is computed by non-parametric methods. Also, we provide a detailed account of potential transmission channels sovereign default risk within the peripheral European countries, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. We use the Kendall’s tau correlation instead of Pearson’s correlation to detect the nonlinear dependency structure among financial markets and to examine Sovereign contagion risk during the European debt crisis. Using the Dynamic Conditional Kendall’s tau correlation allow to study the dynamic dependency structure as well as the links between financial markets. Hence, we provide a dynamic dependence measure that shows the degree of dependence and exhibits associations between financial markets over time. Financial contagion is detected when there is a change in the dependence structure between financial markets and not when there is persistent extreme dependence caused more by interdependence and not by contagion. The dependence between two markets is described by using the information contained in the copula and not by the means of the local correlation coefficients as in Bradley and Taqqu (2005) and Durante and Jaworski (2010). First, we compute the daily conditional Kendall’s tau correlation, using the information incorporated in copulas of couples’ sovereign CDS indexes as proxy of sovereign default risk and various other financial markets indexes for stock, bonds, and commodity markets. Second, we use Markov Regime Switching ARMA model for Daily conditional Kendall’s tau correlation of different pairs to examine the changes in dependence structure during the European debt crisis. Dueker (1997), Hamilton and Susmel (1994), Lamoureux, and Lastrapes (1990) argue that Markov Regime Switching (MRS) model is a better to model time varying of the stock market return distribution. We believe that modelling of dynamic daily conditional Kendall’s tau correlation, using the MRS-ARMA model offer a novel approach to show the transmission of sovereign risk from the sovereign CDS markets to various financial markets (stock, government bonds and commodity markets) and indicate the presence of sovereign contagion risk during the European debt crisis. This paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the methodology and describes the various copulas functions and Markov Switching Auto-Regressive Moving Average Model (MS-ARMA) model. Section 3 presents the estimation results. Section 4 provides conclusions.",1

Herman,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the original publication of the article, two figures which were mentioned in the third paragraph of the introduction section below are missed in the article. To illustrate the notion of complex network patterns in international trade, Fig. 1 depicts the trade flows between the United States (USA), El Salvador (SLV), Trinidad and Tobago (TTO), Bolivia (BOL), and Nepal (NPL) in 1999 as a network. A link pointing from one country to another indicates that the originating country exported to the destination country. Consider the exports from El Salvador to Trinidad and Tobago (drawn in red). A typical trade model, such as a gravity equation, will model that trade flow as being dependent on certain unilateral characteristics of the two countries, such as their GDPs or MFN tariffs (or, more commonly, via country fixed effects), and bilateral characteristics, such as the distances between the markets or their preferential trade arrangements. However, there are other relationships in the network that might also affect this trade flow. For example, Trinidad and Tobago export to El Salvador, implying that their trade is reciprocal. Similarly, both countries have multiple other import and export partners, which may create network externalities in both markets. Finally, both countries trade with common third parties, such as the United States, which might impact trade though things like supply chains or information spillovers. Network relationships are even more prevalent and extensive when considering the full world trade network, as is presented in Fig. 2.

158,3,Review of World Economics,17 November 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00443-0,‘Whatever it takes’ to change belief: evidence from Twitter,August 2022,Michael Stiefel,Rémi Vivès,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"(...) we are in a situation now where you have large parts of the euro area in what we call a ‘bad equilibrium’, namely an equilibrium in which you may have self-fulfilling expectations that feed upon themselves and generate very adverse scenarios. So, there is a case for intervening, in a sense, to ‘break’ these expectations (...)—Mario Draghi, September 6, 2012.Footnote 1 In summer 2012, when the eurozone was on the verge of breaking up, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program,Footnote 2 which gives the central bank the possibility to buy an unlimited amount of short-term government debt in secondary markets under certain conditions. Even though such purchases were never made, sovereign yields of the distressed countries (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain) still fell during this time period. Pioneered by Calvo (1988), the sovereign debt literature emphazises the emergence of multiple equilibria when economic fundamentals worsen, namely a fundamental and a self-fulfilling default equilibrium. More precisely, the former equilibrium (i.e. the “good” equilibrium) prices the true level of economic fundamentals, and the latter equilibrium (i.e. the “bad” equilibrium) generates a self-fulfilling debt crisis triggered by pessimistic investors (Cole & Kehoe, 1996, 2000). Applying this framework to the European sovereign debt crisis, Corsetti and Dedola (2016) and Roch and Uhlig (2018) show that this self-fulfilling default crisis can be avoided if markets anticipate that the central bank will act as the lender of last resort. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which changes in belief about an intervention by the ECB explain the sudden reduction of government bond spreads for the distressed countries in the eurozone, as suggested by the literature on self-fulfilling default crises. To study this change, we use a direct approach by extracting belief from Twitter data. First, we document that there were large increases in the volume of tweets around important dates of central bank communication, showing that Twitter was used to both communicate and interpret the ECB’s actions. Then, we create a belief index of the perceived likelihood of central bank intervention using techniques from natural language processing. This analysis reveals that the belief index jumps at two important days of ECB communication: the day of ECB president Mario Draghi’s ‘whatever it takes’ speech and the day of the OMT program announcement. These large increases in our belief index coincide with large decreases in the sovereign spreads of the distressed countries on the same and the following day. We also find that, to a smaller degree, our belief index is sensitive to other events, such as information leaks and rumors. Using a pooled panel estimator, we further show that a one standard deviation increase in the lagged belief index is associated with a six basis point reduction in the spreads of the crisis countries. To corroborate our findings, we also compare changes in beliefs of individual users with several tweets around the dates of ECB communication and also detect strong increases in the belief index at our two identified key dates. Finally, the following robustness checks demonstrate that our results still hold when using alternative data sources and specifications: using spreads of sovereign Credit Default Swaps (CDS), forming alternative versions of our belief index, and controlling for the users’ level of information using the number of followers in line with Gholampour and Van Wincoop (2017) and Gholampour (2019). We make three contributions. First, we demonstrate that we can learn from social media data how the public interprets news announcements and how, in turn, these announcements influence belief formation and confidence building. Second, we show that capturing this belief formation can improve upon typical event studies. Event studies can be problematic if there is anticipation before or a delayed reaction afterwards that is not inside the event window. By creating an index over the full time horizon, our procedure can both capture rumors and information leaks outside the event window as well as distinguish the importance of different announcements. Third, even though we are not formally putting such a model to the data, our results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that a central bank that credibly commits to an intervention as lender of last resort can eliminate self-fulfilling equilibria. The ‘whatever it takes’ episode is widely recognized as a turning point in the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone, a common narrative in the popular press (“5 years ago, Draghi saved the euro in one sentence”, Les Echos, 2017) as well as in the economic literature (e.g. Corsetti, 2015, in his Schumpeter Lecture). We highlight the channel through which this speech has affected bonds, namely a change in belief leading to the perception of the ECB as a central bank that is willing to intervene to reduce government bond spreads. Over this three-month horizon, our analysis associates a 208 basis points reduction in the 10-year bond spreads of distressed countries due to our identified change in belief. This paper is related to three branches of the economic literature. First, studies have analyzed whether sovereign risk is priced according to “fundamentals,” or whether sentiments and market coordination play a role as well. Second, recent work has investigated the effect of central bank communication on financial markets, and more specifically the announcement of central bank programs on government bond spreads. Finally, a new branch of literature has started to use social media data such as Twitter to analyze financial fluctuations and to model the formation of expectations about monetary policy. Several studies have documented that one cannot explain the large increases in government bond spreads that lead to the eurozone crisis only using fundamental factors like debt and GDP dynamics; see for instance De Grauwe and Ji (2012) and Di Cesare et al. (2013). As an explanation, De Grauwe and Ji (2012) highlight miscoordination among market participants, while Di Cesare et al. (2013) point to a perceived break up risk of the eurozone as a potential channel. Bocola and Dovis (2019) provide a quantitative decomposition of the self-fulfilling and fundamental parts of Italy’s sovereign risk. Using the model of Cole and Kehoe (2000), they indirectly infer beliefs from observed changes in the maturity structure of government bonds and find that 12 percent of the Italian spread is explained by rollover risk. Many studies have investigated the effects of unconventional monetary policy measures because of the importance of central bank actions in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Event studies on the eurozone have found that just the announcement of central bank policies leads to sizeable effects on government bond yields (see among others Szczerbowicz, 2015; Falagiarda & Reitz, 2015). Fendel and Neugebauer (2019) analyze various announcements by the ECB and find that the main announcement effects occur with a delay of one day. The closest paper to ours is Altavilla et al. (2016), who study the financial and macroeconomic effects of the OMT program announcements. Focusing on the financial effects in an event study, they show that the OMT announcements triggered a reduction of about 200 basis points in the 2-year government bond yields of Italy and Spain. Furthermore, by using a multi-country VAR model and constructing a counterfactual scenario without bond buying program announcements, they show that the announcements had significant effects on Italian and Spanish growth rates. Our approach differs from the above paper in several dimensions. First, we shed light on the channel through which the OMT announcement affected spreads, namely belief. Second, as has been criticized by D’Amico (2016) in the discussion of Altavilla et al. (2016), estimating the financial effect with event dummies does not take into account the expectation formation process in between and after the days of the ECB announcements. In this paper, we address precisely this concern by modeling belief through the entire event period, which allows us to study the possible effects of anticipation, rumors and information leaks. Another branch of the literature on central bank communication has used tools by computational linguistics to infer various dimensions of central bank communication (Hansen et al., 2018; Hansen & McMahon, 2016). Like these papers, we apply machine learning methods to classify text. We focus, however, on extracting information from responses to the central bank communication, not by applying them to the policymakers directly, and by only investigating a unique and pre-specified dimension of the text instead of modeling different topics. There is a burgeoning literature studying the impact of Twitter sentiment on financial fluctuations. Pioneered by Bollen et al. (2011) and Zhang et al. (2011), this literature shows that the general public mood of Twitter users can predict stock market indices. Gholampour (2019) develops a financial dictionary to proxy the daily sentiment and disagreements of investors to predict financial fluctuations. In the same spirit, Gholampour and Van Wincoop (2017) highlight that Twitter is an important source of information to predict the euro-dollar exchange rate and show that informed traders use the microblogging social networking platform to share their information. Concerning monetary policy, Azar and Lo (2016) perform a sentiment analysis of tweets referring to the Federal Reserve (Fed). They show that Twitter sentiment has a large impact on asset prices. Meinusch and Tillmann (2017) were the first to infer beliefs about monetary policy from Twitter. They investigate the extent to which long-term bond yields and the exchange rate are sensitive to changes in belief about the Federal Reserve’s exit from quantitative easing. In order to proxy those beliefs, the authors label and aggregate tweets from April to October 2013, thereby distinguishing the users’ opinions on whether the Fed will taper soon or late. Using a VAR-X model, they identify a belief shock. Their results show that changes in belief have strong and persistent effects on bond yields and exchanges rates. While our paper is similar in spirit, our extracted belief is not about the timing of a central bank action, but rather about the type of the ECB and its willingness to intervene at all. Moreover, we are interested in the differential effect of this belief on the distressed countries compared to other eurozone countries. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we detail the succession of the ECB key events over summer 2012. Our Twitter and financial data are described in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we present our belief index that is used for the empirical analysis in Sect. 5. We discuss the results and robustness checks in Sect. 6. We look at a different dimension of our Twitter data and compare belief before and after the key dates for individual users in Sect. 7. We then conclude the paper in Sect. 8.",2

The impact of maritime piracy on trade and transport,August 2022,Alexander Sandkamp,Vincent Stamer,Shuyao Yang,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"With around 200 incidents in 2017 which lead to 166 crew members being taken hostage or kidnapped and three killed, maritime piracy remains a real threat to international merchant shipping (ICC IMB 2018).Footnote 1 Beyond the risk faced by the crew, piracy increases the cost carried by shipping companies, including higher wage premia, a rise in insurance payments due to a lower expected value of a shipment (since it may be damaged or sunk with a higher probability), ransom payments, as well as the actual cost of protecting the ship through military escorts, armed guards, electric fencing, razor wire, water cannons, non-lethal laser or acoustic devices (Towergate Insurance 2018; Gilpin 2009). Increased fuel and time cost of altering routes can also be substantial. For example, routing around the Malacca Strait—one of the world’s busiest sea lanes and frequently prone to pirate attacks—would mean a detour of about 1,000 nautical miles (Berg et al. 2006). In 2021, the blockage of the Suez Canal also meant detours around the Cape of Good Hope, amounting to several thousand miles depending on the destination. Estimates for the direct costs of piracy due to re-routing range from 7 billion USD to 12 billion USD in 2010 (Bowden et al. 2010).Footnote 2 This paper investigates the effect of piracy on trade and transport at the product-, firm- and ship-level. In the first part of the analysis, we combine Chinese firm-level customs data with data on maritime piracy to investigate how exporting firms respond to piracy induced costs. China is the world’s largest exporter and its trade routes pass several areas frequently subject to pirate attacks, including the Suez Canal and the Malacca Strait. Since China trades with all world regions, the effects of piracy on Chinese firms can plausibly be generalised to exporters situated in other countries, too. They certainly matter for importers. At the 8-digit-product level, we show that exports from China decline on routes affected by piracy. At the firm level, pirate activity on a set of trade routes reduces the frequency of shipments by vessel and induces exporters to switch transportation mode from ocean to air, while remaining average shipments per firm become larger. Even though overall trade recovers around half a year after the piracy incident, the impact on firm behaviour is long lasting. It is, however, only observable for small firms. In the second part of the paper, we investigate whether piracy indeed induces ships to re-route and to increase cruising speed. To do so, we combine the aforementioned piracy data with high frequency ship position data to show that container ships avoid regions recently subject to pirate attacks. There is also some evidence that if the ships still pass through affected regions, they increase cruising speed. The paper relates to four strands of literature. The first strand concerns the effects of piracy on trade in general and firms’ choice of transport mode in particular. A good overview is provided by Endler et al. (2012), who show that most studies are either descriptive or focus on a particular region. Fu et al. (2010) construct a model of the container liner shipping market in order to investigate the impact of piracy on trade volumes. The authors find that Somali pirates have reduced traffic between Europe and the Far East through the Suez Canal by about 30%. As only some of this traffic is rerouted via the Cape of Good Hope, the annual loss is estimated to be around 30 billion USD. Bensassi and Martínez-Zarzoso (2012) estimate a gravity model, finding that 10 additional vessels being hijacked in a given year reduce exports by 11%. Both studies focus on trade between Europe and Asia. This paper extends the scope by considering the universe of Chinese exports to all destination countries to empirically investigate the effects of piracy on ocean and air trade. Moreover, it uses comprehensive data on global container ship positions to investigate how piracy in a given region affects the number of ships in that area. Bendall (2010) specifically calculates the costs of re-routing ships from the Suez Canal to the Cape of Good Hope using a model of shipping costs. The model incorporates differences between the two routes in the cost of fuel, charter, insurance and transit fees, among others. According to the author, the additional annual costs for commuting vessels amount to around 3.2 million USD for a very large crude carrier or around 2.8 million USD for a 10,040 TEUFootnote 3 container ship. Using annual OECD data on maritime transport costs, Bensassi and Martínez-Zarzoso (2013) estimate the effects of piracy on transport cost. The authors find that the hijacking of one additional ship between Europe and Asia increases transport costs between the two continents by 1.2%. However, the authors do not discuss the implications of such increases in costs on prices and the choice of transport mode. This paper investigates how piracy affects export prices, the choice of shipment mode as well as the size of shipments. The cost of piracy cannot be modelled as iceberg transport costs because piracy is transport mode specific—goods shipped by air are not subject to pirate attacks—and accrues per journey, as one military escort or security staff is required per ship, no matter whether the latter runs at full capacity. We therefore consider piracy to affect fixed costs per shipment. Our paper thus relates to the literature linking this specific type of trade cost to frequency and average size of shipments. In particular, we rely on Kropf and Sauré (2014) for the theoretical underpinning of our empirical strategy. Our work also links to Hornok and Koren (2015a), who investigate administrative barriers as a source of fixed costs per shipment as well as Hornok and Koren (2015b), who find per-shipment costs to be negatively associated with shipment frequency and positively associated with shipments size. More broadly, our approach relates to the literature that departs from modelling trade costs taking the iceberg form (see for example Hummels and Skiba (2004) for evidence on transport costs accruing per unit or Friedt and Wilson (2020) for the endogenous nature of transport costs). Our results are also consistent with Békés et al. (2017) who investigate the relationship between uncertainty and shipping behaviour. The third strand of literature this paper relates to concerns the determinants of firms’ choice of transportation mode and has already attracted significant research attention. At the macro level, Hummels (2007) discusses how declining transport costs such as the spread of containerization have contributed to an increase in international trade. Correspondingly, this paper shows that an increase in transportation costs along a set of ocean routes due to pirate activity reduces bilateral trade flows along affected routes. Harrigan (2010) develops a Ricardian model to investigate the interaction between trade, transport cost and the choice of transport mode and tests its predictions using US import data. Beyond the finding that goods with high unit values are more likely to be shipped by air, the author demonstrates that countries more distant from the destination market have a comparative advantage in lightweight goods. Related to that, Hummels and Schaur (2013) model a firm’s choice between air and ocean transportation, showing that more time sensitive goods are more likely to be shipped by air. Ge et al. (2014) use Chinese customs data to investigate the choice of transport mode at the firm-level. The authors find that high productivity firms are more likely to ship goods by air, indicating that they specialise in time sensitive high value products. Finally, our paper relates to the growing literature exploiting high frequency ship position data derived from the maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS) for economic analysis. Brancaccio et al. (2017) use AIS data to develop a model of bulker shipping that includes search frictions between ships and exporters. Heiland et al. (2019) and Wong and Ziv (2020) use port call data to construct a port network and investigate the effects of a Panama Canal expansion and endogenous trade costs, respectively. Furthermore, Arslanalp et al. (2019), Cerdeiro et al. (2020) and Stamer (2021) use AIS data to approximate international trade flows. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines a theoretical framework in which the cost of piracy can be modelled. Section 3 presents the data used, while Section 4 discusses the empirical strategy. Section 5 presents the baseline results, followed by several extensions and robustness checks. Section 6 concludes.",2
158,3,Review of World Economics,03 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00444-z,Spillovers from foreign business conditions,August 2022,Allan Sørensen,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"How is domestic real income, welfare, and industry structure affected by foreign business conditions? The answer to this question is fundamental to international policy coordination and potential policy disputes since industrial policies shape the business conditions. The contribution of the paper is threefold: first, it shows how foreign business conditions (market size, productivity, export costs, entry costs, exit risk, operating costs) affect domestic income, welfare, and industry structure in a single-sector heterogeneous-firms trade model à la Melitz (2003). The model allows for parametric asymmetries across countries, but it restricts attention to the case of two countries and Pareto-distributed productivities to obtain clear-cut analytical results. Second, it extends a key finding in Arkolakis et al. (2012), namely that the change in the share of domestic expenditureFootnote 1 is a sufficient statistic for the effect of changes in foreign business conditions (foreign variables) on domestic welfare and real income. The paper extends this to the effects on domestic industry structure, i.e., average productivity, number of firms, selection, and share of firms exporting. Third, it highlights that the sign of the spillover from changes in foreign business conditions crucially depends on the modelling of the general equilibrium adjustments (standard home market effects vs. relative wage adjustments). Importantly, pro-competitive improvements in foreign business conditions are shown to raise domestic (and foreign) real income and welfare and to release domestic intra-industry reallocations similar to those released from trade liberalization, i.e. tougher selection, increasing share of exporting firms, and a falling number of firms. Pro-competitive improvements include enlargement of the local market, productivity improvement, reduced variable and fixed costs of exporting, a reduced exit risk, and reduced entry costs. In contrast, a reduction in the fixed costs of serving the local market releases a negative spillover. This negative spillover appears because selection softens and supply shifts toward the local market and away from the trade partner as the extra surviving firms supply the local market only (due to selection into exporting) and absorb resources from exports. Interestingly, this negative spillover only prevails when firms are heterogeneous, and firms select into exporting. In fact, in the absence of selection, the spillover turns positive as the lower cost of serving the local market releases labor, which in turn enlarges export supply. This highlights that selection among heterogeneous firms may have qualitative impacts on the sign of spillovers. The applied modified Melitz (2003) framework builds on two assumptions, namely CES preferences and a single sector, which imply that the non-distorted market equilibrium is first-best and thus eliminate the potential for policies to improve global efficiency. CES preferences imply uniform markups across the heterogeneous firms and, accordingly, a first-best intra-sectoral allocation in the absence of political interference, see Dhingra and Morrow (2019). The single-sector assumption prevents inter-sectoral misallocations. More important for the present paper, the single-sector assumption eliminates the well-known home market effect. In the literature, home market effects frequently appear in two-sector models, where a differentiated goods sector is accompanied by a competitive sector producing a freely traded homogeneous good under constant returns. In such a setting, the differentiated goods sector produces too little—due to a markup distortion—and spillovers from pro-competitive improvements in foreign business conditions in the differentiated goods sector turn negative. This is due to an aggravation of the domestic inter-industrial misallocation as domestic resources shift from the differentiated goods sector toward the homogeneous good sector.Footnote 2 The opposite shift of foreign resources cannot fully compensate domestic welfare, as proximity to production matters in the differentiated goods sector due to trade costs and selection into exporting. The homogeneous good pins down the relative wage, which therefore becomes invariant to business conditions in the differentiated goods sector, and it therefore shuts down an important equilibrium mechanism. In contrast, an improvement in foreign business conditions in the one-sector model reduces the (domestic) relative wage, which in turn improves competitiveness and thus export ability of domestic firms. In a closely related paper, Pflüger and Russek (2014) explore the spillovers from trade policies, infrastructure policies, and industrial policies. They build a two-sector model in which a differentiated goods sector, modelled in accordance with the single sector of the present paper, is added to a competitive sector producing a freely traded homogeneous good under constant returns.Footnote 3 Spillovers run through the above-mentioned home market effect and differ qualitatively and systematically from those derived in the present paper. In particular, they find that improved business conditions improve local welfare and reduce welfare and productivity of the trade partner. Moreover, they show that symmetric trade liberalization may hurt the country with inferior business conditions. In the present setting, spillovers from improved foreign business conditions are generally positive, and trade liberalization of any kind benefits both countries irrespective of potentially asymmetric business conditions. These differences highlight that the general equilibrium modelling is crucial in the assessment of international spillovers and for the alignment of cross-country preferences over business conditions. Whether a setting with a homogeneous good sector, which eliminates adjustments through relative wages and introduces home market effects, is more appropriate than the present one-sector (representative sector) setting is ultimately an empirical question, and the more appropriate setting may differ across countries. More broadly, the paper relates to the literature that explores policies and country asymmetries in two-country one-sector heterogeneous-firms trade models. Felbermayr et al. (2013)—a prominent example of the above-mentioned literature—consider optimal tariffs and tariff wars. In line with the findings in the present paper, it shows that an import tariff (and thus a deterioration in foreign business conditions) softens (toughens) selection into survival (exporting) in both countries. It also shows that the import tariff increases the relative wage, which is consistent with the finding in the present paper that any improvement in local business conditions increases the relative wage. Sørensen (2020) explores publicly provided export promotion which reduces the fixed costs of exporting and shows that export promotion raises the relative wage and export supply. In turn, the higher relative wage and the higher export supply imply a positive spillover as the trade partner as a result observes tougher selection among firms and higher welfare. Jung and Felbermayr (2015) and Felbermayr and Jung (2018) explore the impact of differences in country size (a single-sector home market effect) and show that the larger country has higher wages, weaker selection and a disproportionate share of firms. The equilibrium forces in general and the effects via the relative wage in particular in these papers are identical to those in the present paper. Nevertheless, the present paper contributes to the literature. First, it has a direct focus on spillovers on the trade partner for a wide set of business conditions. Second, it shows that selection may matter for the sign of the policy spillover and stresses that the exact modelling of general equilibrium mechanisms is generally crucial for the qualitative nature of policy spillovers from foreign business conditions and therefore for policy implications. Third, it explores the alignment of interest across countries regarding country-specific business conditions. Finally, it emphasizes the role of the domestic share as a sufficient statistic for spillovers on all variables and not only on welfare. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up the model. Section 3 explores the effects of improved business conditions abroad. Section 4 concludes. Derivations and proofs are in the “Appendix”.",

158,3,Review of World Economics,17 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00446-x,"Domestic product standards, harmonization, and free trade agreements",August 2022,Akihiko Yanase,Hiroshi Kurata,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Non-tariff barriers have played an important role in recent years since tariffs have been considerably reduced as a result of GATT/WTO negotiations as well as due to a surge in regional trade agreements (RTAs).Footnote 1 Among these non-tariff barriers, product standards such as vehicle emissions and safety standards, restrictions on pesticide residues on agricultural goods, regulations on food additives, and the safety standards for electrical products, have become an emerging issue related to trade agreements. Differing product standards can cause trade disputes. They are applied to both domestic and foreign firms in a non-discriminatory way and raise firms’ costs if they are mandatory. At the same time, they are generally different across countries and only the products that meet the standards are allowed to circulate in the market. Consequently, such different standards can be obstacles for foreign exporters.Footnote 2 Moreover, if standards are set arbitrarily to discriminate between domestic and foreign products, they could be used as an excuse for protectionism.Footnote 3 In response to the concerns that standards might be a disguised form of protectionism, the WTO has established two specific agreements that govern standards: the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. Recent RTAs contain articles on non-tariff measures, including product standards, as well.Footnote 4 Thus, the discussion of product standards in the context of RTAs should entail considering standards and RTAs simultaneously. However, most existing studies deal with these two topics separately. With respect to product standards, Fischer and Serra (2000) point out the possibility of the strategic use of standards under international oligopoly; governments can exclude foreign firms by setting a more stringent standard, even though the costs of domestic firms increase. Costinot (2008) compares two different agreements on product standards, one of which is based on the national treatment principle applied in the WTO and the other of which is based on the mutual recognition principle currently employed within the EU. Assuming competition of domestic and foreign producers in the domestic market with the product generating consumption externalities, Marette and Beghin (2010) examine whether product standards chosen by a welfare-maximizing policymaker is protectionist. Takarada et al. (2020) investigate regional and multilateral agreements on standards in a three-country oligopolistic trade model to shed light on how country-specific or region-specific regulations affect multilateralism. Note that these studies focus on the role of standards as non-tariff barriers by assuming economies with no tariff-based protection implemented. Moreover, RTAs are beyond the scope of these studies.Footnote 5 Studies of RTAs under international oligopoly mainly focus on the welfare effects or the possibility of achieving global free trade (Yi 1996, 2000; Krishna 1998; Freund 2000; Ornelas 2005a, b; Saggi 2006), but do not deal with RTAs that include product standards. However, in reality, governments often incorporate product standards within RTAs. In this sense, contemporary RTAs have an aspect of “issue linkage,” in which countries connect two or more types of issues in some way when they try to use international agreements to achieve cooperation on these issues. Although there is growing literature on the economics of issue linkage (see Maggi (2016) for a survey), most of the existing studies focus on global agreements, and thus, RTAs have yet to be analyzed in this way in depth. Most recent RTAs provide a clause aiming at harmonizing the levels of product standards across member countries, as this harmonization is one of the most important issues in implementing product standards within RTAs.Footnote 6 For example, when the EU forms an RTA with other countries, the agreement requests that the partner country harmonize its national standards and conformity assessment procedures with those of the EU (Stoler 2011). Although some studies focus on this harmonization of standards (Chen and Mattoo 2008; Disdier et al. 2015; Tudela-Marco et al. 2017), the incentives that drive forward this harmonization have not been clearly explained in the literature. The aim of this study is two-fold. First, we aim to clarify how product standards are determined in an RTA and whether such RTAs with standards are preferable for member and nonmember countries. Second, we aim to explain the incentive to harmonize standards when countries form RTAs. Of the several forms of RTAs, we focus on free trade agreements (FTAs), in which each member country chooses its external tariffs independently.Footnote 7 More specifically, we address the following questions. Do standards become more or less stringent under an FTA than in the absence of such an agreement? After the formation of the FTA, are member and nonmember countries better off? Do potential FTA members have an incentive to harmonize their standards? In a simple theoretical framework, we attempt to answer these questions. In contrast to the existing studies, we consider both tariffs and non-tariff barriers, namely, standards. In this study, therefore, we take into account the interactions between these “traditional” and “modern” forms of trade protection. The structure of our model is as follows. As with the studies on RTAs where the driver of trade is capturing oligopolistic rents in foreign markets (Brander and Krugman 1983), we consider a three-country model of international oligopoly, and we incorporate the endogenous determination of standards by national governments into the model. More specifically, we consider standards for controlling negative externalities caused by goods consumption;Footnote 8 the national government in the importer country implements product standards, taking into account the negative externalities caused by the consumption of domestic and imported products. To enter the importer’s market, foreign exporters must produce goods that meet the standards of the importer country. Assuming that governments are benevolent and have no political incentives to set their respective standards, we consider the endogenous determination of standards as well as (external) tariffs.Footnote 9 Our main findings are as follows. Compared with the policy game in the absence of FTAs, an FTA leads the member countries to choose more stringent standards. In terms of the national welfare in each country, the FTA member countries may or may not be better off under the formation of an FTA, but the nonmember country does become better off. We compare outcomes under which FTA members independently determine their respective national standards with those under which the FTA member countries harmonize their standards within the FTA. We find that the harmonization of standards leads the member countries to choose less stringent standards and makes the formation of an FTA more favorable. We examine the robustness of these results under asymmetries across countries and under transboundary externalities. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our basic model. In Sect. 3, we derive the equilibrium of the policy game in the absence of FTAs. In Sect. 4, we derive the equilibrium of the policy game under an FTA. In Sect. 5, we examine how the formation of an FTA affects the standards and national welfare in member and nonmember countries. In Sect. 6, we compare the outcomes in the case of national standards with those where standards are harmonized within the FTA. In the basic model, we assume that the FTA member countries are symmetric and that the consumption externalities are local. In Sects. 7 and 8, we extend our basic model by considering asymmetric countries and introducing transboundary externalities, respectively. Section 9 provides brief concluding remarks.",3
158,3,Review of World Economics,18 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00448-9,Trade policy and global value chains: tariffs versus non-tariff measures,August 2022,Mahdi Ghodsi,Robert Stehrer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The focus of this paper is the impact of non-tariff measures (NTMs) along global value chains. NTMs have gained in importance over recent decades, as they play a more and more important role in comprehensive trade agreements. Furthermore, governments in some cases use such measures for various reasons. While the impact of NTMs on trade flows has already been widely covered in the literature, little attempt has been made to trace the footprints of product regulations embedded in NTMs along supply chains and to investigate their accumulated impact on exports. As is well known from the existing literature, the impacts of non-tariff measures in general are not uniform and often have heterogeneous consequences. On the one hand, these measures might constitute a new kind of trade friction: in the context of production networks, a barrier to trade in a specific industry could create additional costs, which are transmitted via backward and forward linkages to the final consumers (as with tariffs). On the other hand, a standard (e.g. technical regulation) might facilitate trade in specific products, particularly those used as intermediate inputs in global production networks. Furthermore, a standard can result in a higher quality of the traded product—e.g. meeting safety and health requirements for the final consumer or having beneficial effects for the environment—which is passed on through the next stages of production in the global value chains, thus inducing externalities in final consumption. Therefore, this paper analyses the impact of non-tariff measures trickling through the various stages of production along GVCs on exports during the period 2000–2014. In undertaking this, we use a measure of the intensity of NTMs imposed on traded products at the Harmonised System (HS) six-digit level to estimate their ad-valorem equivalents (AVE) in percent. This measure allows comparison with traditional tariffs. Doing this at the level of sectors that are compatible with the World Input–Output Database (WIOD) industry classification allows tracking of the impact of the NTMs and tariffs that are accumulated during the upstream stages of production on the exported value added in each sector. From a policy perspective, such an analysis is important. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has established agreements to maintain frictionless trade among its member states and to ensure that ‘trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible’.Footnote 1 However, there are certain legitimate motives for the imposition of NTMs. If an imported product potentially harms the health and safety of domestic consumers, or has a negative impact on animal health or environmental quality, etc., countries are allowed to restrict or regulate the importation of such a product. Specifically, non-discriminatory standards are regulated across trading partners by qualitative NTMs, such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) and technical barriers to trade (TBTs), in order to ensure certain standards and characteristics of imported products. Because the regulations embedded within these measures affect trade flows, they are considered to be trade policy measures. Moreover, they affect the price of products at different stages of production in various ways. For instance, chemicals used in the early stages of production may be the focus of a prohibitive TBT, which might influence the cost of production in downstream industries that use this product as an intermediate input. By contrast, regulations that increase market efficiency—such as mandatory labelling required within TBTs—might reduce transaction costs and thus have a beneficial effect for producers and consumers. Against this backdrop, many studies point to the opaque nature of NTMs. The explanation for the complex nature of NTMs is the diversity of the motives of governments and their differentiated consequences. Safety, health and environmental issues (Ghodsi, 2016; Otsuki et al., 2001) and technological advancement and innovation are often reasons for NTMs that might hamper trade in the short run, but that are expected to have a beneficial long-run effect, due to positive externalities (Beghin et al., 2012). Additionally, substitutability for tariffs (Ghodsi, 2016; Moore & Zanardi, 2011), substitutability for other NTMs (Rosendorff, 1996) and policy retaliation (de Almeida et al., 2012; Vandenbussche & Zanardi, 2008) offer other political motives for the imposition of NTMs that might lead to trade friction. These various reasons for imposing NTMs impede any consensus view on the general impact of NTMs. However, the ability of exporters to comply with such non-discriminatory NTMs differs across countries. So, it may be that countries which are already producing in line with the regulations imposed are not harmed, or may even increase their exports (due to redirection effects or a general increase in demand, thanks to the quality improvements brought about by the NTM). By contrast, the exports of some other countries that are not (yet) geared up to such measures in the destination market may be hampered or even restricted. The consequence of a specific qualitative NTM might even be the absolute prohibition of a specific trade flow until such time as the product complies with the implemented standards. Domestic producers in need of intermediate inputs from abroad then switch to other sources of imports that do comply with the new regulations (or even start sourcing domestically). Therefore, the responses of domestic producers to NTMs that affect their inputs are heterogeneous across the respective sourcing countries, and depend on the exporters’ ability to cope with the standards. In the presence of GVCs, trade policy measures like tariffs or NTMs are amplified via backward and forward linkages. These traces of trade policy measures along GVCs have been the subject of some recent studies, but with a focus on traditional tariffs only (see Rouzet & Miroudot, 2013; Muradov, 2017). Antràs and de Gortari (2017) argue that trade costs are proportional to the gross value of the traded goods. This suggests that, even if tariff rates do not increase in the next stages of production, the gross amount of tariffs levied on the final product with a much larger gross value could be very substantial, which could be due to the accumulation of tariffs at earlier stages. Ferrantino (2012) makes a similar argument for NTMs, arguing that their distorting impact on trade accumulates along GVCs and therefore becomes stronger for goods that have longer supply chains. Therefore, when the product regulations and standards across countries diverge from each other substantially, the costs brought about by NTMs on the trade flows of products lead to additional costs in the next country, in order to meet the new sets of regulations where the next stage of production occurs. These additional costs, which accumulate in the inputs of production and trickle through a GVC, might hinder and reduce global exports. Therefore, the lower the cumulative cost of regulative NTMs, the higher exports could be. This could be especially the case with regulatory divergence between countries, rendering cross-border demand for intermediate inputs of production costlier. However, when the implicit quality of products is ensured by product regulations that are passed on to the next stages of production, i.e. production crosses borders as it nears the final consumer, then the accumulated cost of regulative NTMs may even stimulate exports in value added. Nevertheless, NTMs are not price-based trade policy measures that can easily be measured, and therefore their direct and indirect effects are less obvious. One way to assess the impact of NTMs is to calculate their tariff equivalence or AVE. Kee et al. (2009) were the first to propose a methodology for estimating AVEs for NTMs using cross-sectional trade data at the six-digit level (according to the HS) for 2002. They limited their results to positive AVEs, thus assuming that the effect would be to hamper trade. The same approach was then applied by Beghin et al. (2015), Bratt (2017) and Niu et al. (2018), who also allowed for negative AVEs, meaning that NTMs could have trade-enhancing effects, thanks to positive externalities. Cadot and Gourdon (2016) estimate the impact of NTMs on the unit values of imports. The various types of NTM are included in these studies as a dummy variable, indicating whether or not any type of NTM is in place. Thus, these approaches neither distinguish between the various types of NTM nor take the number of regulations into account. Moreover, such estimates provide only one (average) estimator for the impact of NTMs on a country’s imports across all partner countries at the product level. Some studies (e.g. Bao & Qiu, 2010; Bora et al., 2002; Disdier et al., 2008; Nicita & Gourdon, 2013) also use frequency indices of NTMs, calculated as the number of tariff lines affected by NTMs or weighted by trade, providing coverage ratios within more aggregate categories. However, when NTMs become too trade restrictive and completely prohibit trade, the omitted weight or frequency would cause a bias in the measurement of NTMs for an aggregate category; this would lead to an endogeneity bias (see Ghodsi, 2020). The methodology used in this study to estimate the impact of NTMs at aggregate industry levels allows such a potential measurement bias to be circumvented. These studies took the unilateral elasticities from Kee et al. (2008); by construction, these vary across countries only because of variations in the focal product’s share of import in GDP across countries. The shortcoming of the aforementioned approaches is that the impact of the NTMs imposed by various countries on a single product is assumed to be uniform and is captured by a single estimator. Ghodsi et al. (2016a) extend the approach, allowing the estimated impact of NTMs to vary from one importing country to the next. In this paper, this allows for an empirical strategy that differentiates the impact of NTMs by type, sector, importing country and year. The second building block of our approach is the concept of global value chains.Footnote 2 Trade liberalisation, decreasing tariff rates and the lowering of other trade barriers forced by international and multilateral agreements are leading to an increasingly important role for GVCs in the world economy. Moreover, offshoring strategies, the outsourcing of activities and the global fragmentation of the production of goods and services have all been emerging, thanks to reduced transaction costs—a product of the technological development of recent decades, such as improvements in information and communication technology services. Indeed, the advance in those services has seen the replacement of traditional transport costs (which are also part of the GVC) as a major service sector (Backer & Miroudot, 2013). The importance of GVCs was emphasised in efforts to compile inter-country input–output databases, such as the WIOD by Timmer et al., (2012, 2015), which has been updated (see Timmer et al., 2016). The average distance of non-service sectors from the final user—an indicator of the length of the value chains measured by the upstreamness index suggested in Antràs et al. (2012)—increased from 2.38 in 2000 to 2.81 in 2014.Footnote 3 This evidence suggests that the value added generated in producing a final product spreads over more and more production stages. Backer and Miroudot (2013) also show that the number of stages within the GVC increased during 1995–2008, which indicates a dominant role of trade liberalisation in the global fragmentation of production. This further implies that services and manufacturing are becoming more and more intertwined, and that their shares of value added in each other’s value added are becoming increasingly important in the globalisation process (see Johnson & Noguera, 2012; OECD, 2013; Timmer et al., 2014; Koopman et al., 2014). As globalisation reached its peak in 2012, Miroudot and Nordström (2020) provided evidence that the fragmentation of production along the GVCs has become shorter in recent times, as supply chains have become more regional (due to nearshoring) than global (due to offshoring). The increasingly intertwined international production networks are therefore increasingly vulnerable to cascading trade costs caused by various trade policy measures and regulations (Escaith, 2017). This paper combines these two aspects and analyses the impact of trade policy measures, with a focus on product regulations embedded within NTMs and their transmission in global value chains. The interlinked sectors within GVCs can be referred to as a network of industries, in which a change or shock in one sector cumulates in further effects along the GVC. Considering tariffs as a policy shock to a specific sector, all users of that sector are affected along the GVC. Rouzet and Miroudot (2013) proposed a framework to calculate the cumulative effect of such a shock. In fact, their approach calculates the cumulative cost to an importing country of tariffs, against the inputs of a given sector. Miroudot et al. (2013) use the same methodology to estimate the cumulative tariffs on the inputs of service sectors. In fact, they track the effects of tariffs that target non-service industries on the production and export of services. They find a downward trend of cumulative tariffs on service sectors for the majority of countries from 2000 to 2009, due to liberalisation through WTO commitments. Muradov (2017) also uses this framework to calculate the accumulated tariffs crossing borders.Footnote 4 This contribution adds to these previous studies in several ways. It aims at studying the impacts of product regulations embedded within trade policy measures and the way they trickle through GVCs across 44 economies over the period 2000–2014. Specifically, the main goals of this paper are to study the direct and indirect effects of NTMs, by estimating their annual AVE in different WIOD sectors through backward and forward linkages, and to assess their role in the exports of industries’ value added by applying a structural gravity framework. To achieve this, the methodological approach is divided into four stages. In the first stage, bilateral import demand elasticities in WIOD non-service sectors are estimated. In the second stage, we estimate the impact of NTMs on bilateral imports. One major contribution of this paper is to use the intensity of NTMs imposed on each six-digit product bilaterally traded at the global level to estimate their AVEs at the aggregated industry level in the second stage. The estimations from these two stages control for zero trade flows and possible sources of endogeneity bias. Together with the elasticities estimated at stage one, this allows us at the third stage to calculate the annual bilateral AVEs of the NTMs for each year. These capture the direct and—by taking into account inter-country and inter-industry linkages—the indirect effects of tariffs and NTMs in each industry. Finally, at the fourth stage, the impact of the trade policy measures on exports via three channels is estimated at the industry level over the period 2000–2014 in a structural gravity model. Exports of value added and gross exports will be used in the structural gravity model to draw conclusions as to whether the greater impact of trade costs accumulated from the upstream stages matters more for the exports of value added or for gross exports. The results indicate that the impact of tariffs is much stronger than the impact of NTMs on exports, since tariffs have been considerably reduced in recent decades and trade has increased as a consequence. Furthermore, the cost of compliance with TBTs, which is accumulated along previous stages of production, has a significant negative impact on exports of value added and gross exports. However, the compliance costs associated with SPS measures have a positive, though insignificant, impact on exports. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the first three stages of the methodological approach and the data used in the analysis. In Sect. 3, some selected descriptive results are presented. Section 4 shows the impact of three channels of trade policy measures on export growth; and finally, Sect. 5 provides a conclusion.",

Furthermore, a number of previously quarterly surveys are now conducted at monthly frequency. Many of these surveys now have a history that is long enough to be considered in the construction of new composite indicators. At the same time, the ever-stronger interconnectedness of consumers, firms and governments across the world has considerably increased the interest in timely and transparent information on the state and the development of the global economy. On this basis, we have constructed two composite indicators for the world economy—the Global Economic Barometers. One is designed as a coincident indicator, the other as leading the world economy by about half a year.Footnote 2 Referring to a broad set of underlying variables aggregated by partial least squares with the world business cycle as response variable, the Barometers extract strong signals from a large global information set, where much of the idiosyncratic noise is cancelled out. We can hence avoid low-pass filtering of both input and output series and the well-known problems associated with it, such as endpoint instability and phase shifts. Another important feature of the Barometers is that contrary to most other composite indicators, where the underlying set of variables rarely changes, the Global Barometers automatically adapt to changing circumstances and relationships, allowing new variables to enter and others to be dismissed; the composition as well as the estimated parameters of the Barometers are adjusted for every release. Our real-time analyses confirm that the new Barometers are indeed often either faster in detecting or better in capturing cyclical movements of the world economy than the few other indicators at the world level that are presently available. Last but not least the Barometers have delivered a reliable real-time reflection of the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. The rest of this paper is set up as follows. After giving an overview of composite indicators at the world level in Sect. 2, the construction of the Global Economic Barometers is explained in Sect. 3. The Barometers, their properties and time series characteristics along with summaries of several robustness checks are presented in Sect. 4. We then compare the Barometers to other major composite indicators for the world economy (Sect. 5). Section 6 looks at how the Barometers picked up the initial Covid-19 pandemic shock and the subsequent infection waves that affected the global economy to various degrees. Section 7 concludes.",3

158,4,Review of World Economics,07 February 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-022-00454-5,International trade and face-to-face diplomacy,November 2022,Emmanuelle Lavallée,Julie Lochard,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"International exchanges involve large costs. According to Anderson and van Wincoop (2004), they represent a tax equivalent of 170% in the case of developed countries and are significantly higher for developing economies. Most of these costs are not attributable to traditional trade costs, such as tariffs and freight (Head and Mayer 2013), but rather to weak institutions and information frictions. A large body of literature shows that the lack of contractual enforcement, insecurity or information problems are the most important trade barriers, especially in developing countries (for instance, Anderson and Marcouiller 2002; Duc et al. 2008; Allen 2014). Given their importance, it is crucial to understand what could mitigate these costs. Networks of firms (e.g., Chaney 2014; Bernard and Moxnes 2018) and international migrants (e.g., Rauch 1999; Rauch and Trindade 2002; Lodefalk 2016; Parsons and Vézina 2018) are found to play a major role in reducing these costs and facilitating transactions.Footnote 1 Recent literature notes that business travels and face-to-face interaction are also key strategies that importers use to alleviate contractual and information frictions. For instance, Cristea (2011) shows that business-class air travels are directly related to trade flows in differentiated goods. Startz (2018) uses an original survey dataset on Nigerian importers, including information on the process of firm-to-firm trade (e.g. travel). She finds that importing without traveling involves that goods are on average 2.5 months behind the frontier and requires paying a price premium of nearly 12%. Other tools to secure international trade and give information about foreign countries are provided by public authorities. Economic diplomacy aims at enabling international trade and investment through the use of government relations and influence. It is based on the network of international representations of the state (embassies, consulates ...), bilateral diplomatic actions (visits) and support to the companies in their international trade and investment activities (Moons and van Bergeijk 2017). Economic diplomacy is expected to impact international trade for several reasons (for a more detailed presentation, see Yakop and van Bergeijk, 2011). The first relates to information. Through its network of representations, the state can provide reliable and impartial information on the market conditions and commercial opportunities for different countries of the world. It can also promote the trustworthiness of its exporters and of the quality of their products. The second deals with trade actors. It is not uncommon for domestic firms to deal directly with states or state enterprises. The support of their government and its officials is a way to equalize the playing field. Finally, government involvement implicitly indicates its support for the transaction and reduces political risk. Most of these mechanisms might be especially prevalent in developing countries with weaker institutions. The existing literature illustrates the impact on trade of different dimensions of economic diplomacy. The importance of a foreign service (the number of embassies, consulates and official foreign missions), as well as export promotion agencies, are generally found to facilitate trade (e.g., Rose 2007; Volpe Martincus and Carballo 2008; Gil-Pareja et al. 2015). In this article, we focus on one of the most controversial dimensions of economic diplomacy: visits of state representatives and their effects on bilateral trade. These visits are debated not only in the public arena but also in the literature. Using data for France, Germany and the United States, Nitsch (2007) shows that state and official visits increase bilateral exports by 8 to 10% (see also Nitsch 2018). Conversely, Head and Ries (2010) find no impact of Canadian trade missions on trade flows. In a meta-analysis of 32 primary studies, Moons and van Bergeijk (2017) obtain a positive and significant effect of economic diplomacy on trade and investment, with the exception of state visits. To examine the effects of bilateral visits on trade, we compute an original database that gathers more than 13,000 visits of French officials abroad and of foreign officials in France over the period 1977–2007. These data encompass bilateral visits at the level of head of state, minister, secretary of state, as well as advisers and unofficial visits. Our dataset is much broader than that used in previous studies. For instance, Nitsch (2007) considers only state visits that amount to 558 external visits for the 1948–2003 period. Our dataset reveals that diplomatic visits are not a rare phenomenon. There are, on average, 2.3 visits per country and per year, and in 60% of the cases (country-year), there is at least one visit. Our baseline estimate indicates that a bilateral visit to a foreign country is associated with an increase in French exports by 8% on average. We provide a set of robustness checks and address reverse causality and omitted variables issues. In particular, we propose original instruments to handle endogeneity in the relation between bilateral visits and international trade, based notably on the well-known role of routine in international politics. We also show that this average effect hides considerable heterogeneity across world regions. For instance, in South America, the increase in French exports after a visit amounts to nearly 15%. Furthermore, analysis at the sectoral level reveals that visits increase French exports of a large variety of products, but their effect is larger for differentiated products, i.e., goods highly exposed to contractual risks. Finally, we provide some evidence on the underlying mechanisms and find that face-to-face visits mitigate trade costs related to contractual enforcement, insecurity and information. Indeed, our results indicate that bilateral visits reinforce trade, particularly in countries characterized by weak contract enforcement, corruption and lower political proximity with France. We also find that bilateral visits induce larger trade flows in countries characterized by a smaller number of French migrants. The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we present our data on bilateral visits and our empirical strategy. Then, in Sect. 3, we discuss empirical evidence on the effect of bilateral visits on trade, provide some robustness checks and investigate endogeneity issues. In Sect. 4, we assess the impact of bilateral visits on sectoral trade and discuss underlying mechanisms. We summarize our findings and add concluding remarks in Sect. 5.",1
158,4,Review of World Economics,07 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-021-00452-z,Do developing countries gain by participating in global value chains? Evidence from India,November 2022,Choorikkad Veeramani,Garima Dhir,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"The period since the first decade of the twenty-first century marked the end of the era of cheap Chinese labour (Li et al., 2012). Since then, China has started moving up the technological ladder while gradually vacating the labour-intensive stages of manufacturing production such as final assembly activities (Cheng et al., 2019; Li et al., 2012; Upward et al., 2013). The US-China trade war and COVID-19 pandemic may provide further impetus to the ongoing realignment of global value chains (GVCs) in different industries (Amiti et al., 2019; Baldwin & Tomiura, 2020; Javorcik, 2020). These developments may provide opportunities for less industrialised labour abundant countries, such as India, to emerge as alternative assembly hubs for manufactured products within the GVCs. Being one of the few countries that can match China in terms of its sheer size and abundance of low skilled labor, India is best positioned to attract multinational enterprises (MNEs) that are looking for new locations to lower costs and to diversify supply chains. However, this raises an important question: Is it in the interest of a developing country to promote strong local linkages for domestic industries or to participate in GVCs wherein linkages are globally dispersed? The answer should be based on the relative magnitude of the impact of these strategies on aggregate value added and employment within the country. The present paper informs this debate by empirically analyzing which one of these strategies would result in higher levels of domestic value added (DVA) and employment in India. Previous studies suggest that the impact of GVCs on domestic outcomes is conditional on the nature and position of the country’s participation in the value chains (Constantinescu et al., 2019; World Bank, 2020). Constantinescu et al. (2019) find that backward GVC participation (use of imported inputs to produce for exports) exerts a more significant and robust positive impact on domestic productivity as compared to forward GVC participation (export of raw materials and intermediate inputs by a given country for further processing and export by other countries). In general, labor abundant developing countries tend to have relatively higher level of backward GVC participation as they mostly specialize in final assembly activities. Clearly, given its relative abundance of low wage labor, India has a natural comparative advantage in backward GVC participation. Therefore, in this paper, our focus is to analyze the employment and output gains for India from backward GVC participation. We make use of a unique panel data on DVA, foreign value added (FVA) and jobs tied to Indian exports from 112 sectors, covering the whole Indian economy, during the period 1999–2000 to 2012–2013.Footnote 1 The database is constructed using Input–Output (IO) method, which enables us to capture the linkage effects of exports from a given sector in India with other domestic sectors.Footnote 2 Following Hummels et al. (2001), the ratio of FVA to gross exports (FVAX ratio) is used as a measure to quantify the extent of an Indian industry’s backward GVC participation. As shown by Borin and Mancini (2019, p. 6), the FVAX ratio “is a good measure of the participation of a country in the downstream phases of international production chains”, i.e., backward GVC participation.Footnote 3 The rationale is that the FVAX ratio measures how much foreign, as opposed to domestic, value-added is generated for a given unit of exports. Sectors with higher FVAX ratios tend to record greater backward GVC participation and vice versa. The regression analysis shows that greater backward GVC participation leads to higher absolute levels of gross exports, DVA and employment. To the best of our knowledge, these relationships have not been estimated before in the context of developing countries. The results are robust to various estimation techniques and instrumental variable approaches to address potential endogeneity concerns due to simultaneity, reverse causality and omitted variables. Our findings imply that labor abundant countries can reap dividends by adopting policies aimed at strengthening their backward participation in GVCs. Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the IO methodology used to estimate DVA, FVA and number of jobs tied to exports. Section 3 presents the estimates of DVA, FVAX ratio and the number of jobs attributable to India’s exports at the aggregate and disaggregated levels. Section 4 carries out a regression analysis to answer our main question—that is, whether greater backward GVC participation leads to higher absolute levels of gross exports, DVA and employment. Finally, Sect. 5 provides the concluding remarks. An online Appendix provides a detailed discussion of data and methodology involved in the preparation of year specific IO matrices for India.",3
158,4,Review of World Economics,12 February 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-022-00453-6,Measuring the relative development and integration of EU countries’ capital markets using composite indicators and cluster analysis,November 2022,Gianluca Gucciardi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"European capital markets have experienced a continuous push towards development and integration in the last decades (Baele et al., 2004). Since the Treaty of Maastricht, the free movement of capital has been the backbone of EU’s single-market mission, aimed at allowing European citizens to complete financial operations (e.g., in terms of investments, banking transactions, shares acquisitions) and companies to invest and raise cheaper capital uniformly across the European Union. A further relevant milestone was the introduction of the euro, which boosted capital market integration in the European Monetary Union until the 2007–2008 financial crisis, when this trend reverted to negative (ECB, 2018). Indeed, the financial crisis and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis (2010–2013) have constituted a restraining factor for the integration process in Europe, both on the banking market (Emter et al., 2019) and in terms of cross-border capital flows (Howarth & Quaglia, 2013). The 2015 Capital Markets Union (CMU) is considered the EU policy response to these negative trends (Quaglia et al., 2016). Specifically, CMU policies were designed to enhance capital markets under several tangential perspectives. First, capital market integration is thought to be prodromal to risk reduction in the overall system. Indeed, more integrated capital markets would enable easier economic risk-sharing among countries (Agenor, 2001; Bekaert et al., 2006; Veron & Wolff, 2016). Second, the ability of companies (and SMEs in particular) to improve their access to finance also depends on capital market development (Bekaert et al., 2005). In particular, more developed markets would extend the financing portfolio from banking loans to capital market instruments (Veron & Wolff, 2016) and fintech opportunities (Demertzis et al., 2018). Moreover, increasing capital in the equity markets would make their access cheaper, further stimulating investments (Dye et al., 2017; Kose et al., 2006). Third, within an integrated context it becomes easier for savers to better exploit investment opportunities, both to look for superior returns and to diversify their investment portfolio (Agenor, 2001; Boldeanu & Tache, 2016). These factors are also corroborated by the promotion of long-term and sustainable investments and by the development of a more structured alternative finance market (e.g., for venture capital/private equity), which is still limited in Europe with respect to the United States (AFME, 2018). Overall, in the case of the CMU all these areas would concur to provide beneficial economic effects, with the development of a stronger connection between individual savings and economic growth through the means of investments (European Commission, 2015). Given the relevance of capital market (CM) development and integration in the EU political agenda, this work is aimed at investigating this process across the 28 EU countriesFootnote 1 from 2007 to 2018. We leverage the CMU Action Plan policy frameworkFootnote 2 and key objectives proposed by the European Commission (2015) to develop a set of metrics based on different quantitative approaches. Despite our research being mostly linked to existing literature measuring financial integration,Footnote 3 this work aims to introduce two main novelties. First, we do not focus our analysis on the standard definition of financial integration but, rather, investigate the broader concept of capital market integration and development as emerging from the definition of the European policymaker. Specifically, we deviate from the most common definition of financial integration—based on the idea that an economic area is integrated if all countries have the same opportunities to access the market (Baele et al., 2004; Lemmen & Eijffinger, 1996)—and we adopt a measure of the development and integration of capital markets more closely related to the approach devised by the policymaker. This approach enables the development of an EU-specific monitoring tool, which could nevertheless be also applied to other geo-political contexts after adapting the underlying policy framework. Second, we conduct a robust statistical analysis adopting a set of different metrics specifically aimed at measuring multi-faceted concepts like capital market development and integration. More specifically, we first use composite indicators: synthetic measures summarizing different relevant and related dimensions into a single comprehensive number (Nardo et al., 2008). The goal of this approach is twofold: on the one hand, to define and provide a simple-to-interpret tool to measure CM development and integration, and on the other hand, to observe the evolution of this indicator for the whole EU-28 and each individual country from 2007 to 2018, both through static comparisons of ranks emerging from composite indicators and through dynamic performance assessments based on data envelopment analysis (DEA; Coelli et al., 2005) and the Malmquist Index (Färe et al., 1994a, 1994b). This latter approach also allows us to disentangle the dynamic performance into country-specific versus more global European Union “environmental” drivers. Then, we cluster countries along different CM-related dimensions, adopting a statistically robust technique, i.e., a robust trimmed clustering model (García-Escudero, Gordaliza, et al., 2008). This analysis helps us capture country-level patterns across clusters in time that could be associated with a change in the progress of the development and integration of their capital markets. Our results indicate that most European Union countries saw their capital markets develop and improve during the last decade, despite the process of convergence to the highest levels of the EU benchmarks being still ongoing. This result seems to suggest that EU common policies towards market integration provide beneficial effects for member states, in line with similar findings by Cherchye et al. (2007) for a broader set of internal markets and by the ECB (2018) for financial markets. Hence, we complement the existing literature by specifically analyzing capital markets, in light of the relevance and policy momentum emerging from the implementation of the Capital Markets Union Action Plan. At the same time, by decomposing the dynamic development of EU capital markets via the Malmquist Index based on Färe et al. (1994b), we find that most of the beneficial effect is not guided by relative shifts towards the European benchmarks but, rather, by changes in the benchmarks for performance themselves. This result, consistent with Cherchye et al.’s (2007) interpretation, communicates that the European Union framework, and more recently the CMU policy, are creating a suitable environment conducive to global performance improvement, which most member states are exploiting to various extents. Our work also contributes to the literature on the relationship between market integration and financial crises, as well as related policy responses in integrated markets such as the European Union (Emter et al., 2019; Howarth & Quaglia, 2013). Our results on capital markets go in the same direction as what has already been found in the literature on cross-border banking (Emter et al., 2019) and highlight a reduction in the integration of capital markets in Europe during the period of the sovereign debt crisis, i.e., between 2010 and 2013. At the same time, after the introduction of the CMU Action Plan the level of capital market development and integration once again settled on the values prior to the crisis. This reaffirms the importance of a single capital market in the EU as a resilient asset to respond to crises, similarly to what has already been experienced for the banking union (Howarth & Quaglia, 2013). At the same time, we find that this more recent leap forward in the integration and development of EU capital markets (contemporary to the launch of the CMU Action Plan) seems to be equally driven by both the catching up of countries lagging behind during the crisis and the further improvement of the top performers, thus suggesting that (additional) policy initiatives at the EU level are becoming increasingly relevant to consolidate an environment that can further boost capital market development and integration. Lastly, our findings show also relevant policy implications on economic growth. Indeed, we find that our CMU indicator is positively correlated to standard global capital market openness measures, i.e. the Financial Openness Index (Chinn & Ito, 2006) and the Capital Control Indicator (Fernández et al., 2016). Hence, our results seem to confirm the CMU Action Plan as a concrete and relevant driver for European mid-term growth, given the positive relationship between financial and capital market openness and economic growth (see, for instance, Bussière & Fratzscher, 2008). The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 includes a description of the theoretical policy-based framework constituting the rationale for the monitoring of the progression of CM integration and of the selection of the associated indicators, as well as a discussion of the performance of EU countries based on a composite indicator approach. In Sect. 3, we move to the dynamic assessment of country performance based on data envelopment analysis and a robust clustering approach. Moreover, leveraging a Malmquist Index analysis we investigate whether these dynamics are driven by an individual country’s ability to catch up to Europe’s top performers (those with the most developed capital markets) or by the benchmarks themselves improving. To corroborate our findings, we then investigate the correlation of our composite metrics with standard de jure capital market openness measures (in Sect. 4) and compare our findings to those obtained with similar metrics in the literature (in Sect. 5). Lastly, Sect. 6 offers some concluding remarks.",1

One of the most contentious debates involves international trade and workers’ rights. Many firms take advantage of globalized trade to produce goods in (southern) countries with fewer legislative or social constraints. For example, Cambodian garments or Chinese cell-phones are manufactured by workers whose fundamental labor rights are largely ignored.Footnote 1 A trading partner that fails to enforce fundamental labor rights harms workers and can unfairly create a comparative advantage and a race to the bottom (Olney 2013). It is now well established that trade sanctions for labor rights purpose are blunt and counter-productive instruments since they harm the workers they are designed to help (Maskus 1999; Granger and Siroen 2006; Brown and Stern 2008). The need for new thinking and problem-solving mechanisms have led to an increase in unconventional politics such as activism (Stolle and Micheletti 2013). Consequently, a rising number of activist campaigns such as anti-sweatshops campaigns or buycott campaigns were launched by activist groups to shed light on complex social issues. To change firms’ behavior and practices, activists have increasingly used private strategies to achieve their objectives. In Baron (2001)’s theory of private politics, although activists can make a choice between public and private politics, the capacity of their targets to avoid public strategies through lobbying, for example, forces them to pursue their goals through private politics. Those private politics include all strategies that lead to a private dispute resolution, without any government intervention. An example of private politics is an activist campaign (Baron 2001, 2002; Baron and Diermeier 2007). Activists have developed an important action repertoire to encourage or force firms to comply with their demands. Activists’ tactics encompass actions such as demonstrations, boycotts, buycotts, or discursive politics that are designed to raise awareness among consumers or persuade them to participate in the protest. In a way, all these tactics referred to as a boycott or a buycott as they directly or indirectlyFootnote 2 spur consumers to buy or prevent them from buying goods for social, environmental or ethical considerationsFootnote 3. While both put pressure on firms to acknowledge their social responsibility and to treat their workers more fairly (Baron 2001), studies suggest buycotting play now a more important role in activists’ strategies as they seem less harmful than boycotts. For consumers, the negative information provided by a boycott is not always well perceived since it lowers their utility unlike a buycott based on positive information. One can also argue that boycotting strategies associated with more agressive campaigns can be more efficient to gain public support (Baron 2001; Stolle and Micheletti 2013). To know whether activists should use one a tactic over another to achieve their objectives needs further investigation. The mechanics of boycotts and buycotts should be analyzed more in depth. So, this article provides an analysis of the effects of two activists’ strategies, i.e., a boycott and a buycott, launched in the North to improve labor conditions in the South. We investigate a number of questions: Are those strategies identical for southern welfare? Should activists choose a strategy over another? What are the effects of these two private strategies? To answer these questions we study the effects of a boycott and a buycott of two goods produced in the South and the North respectively on different variables such as prices, wages, qualities or welfare. Then, we extend our analysis of boycotts and buycotts by modelling strategic interactions between a firm and an activist that seeks to changes firms’ social practices. This extension gives information about the determinants of these strategies such as whom to target or what promise of punishment or reward to make. Existing theoretical frameworks that analyze the relationship between labor standard and international trade largely use HOS-style models (Brown et al. 1996; Dehejia and Yiagadeesen 2004)Footnote 4 and a very limited literature deals with the link between labor conditions and international trade in an imperfectly competitive market (Cardebat and Cassagnard 2010). Although imperfect competition is useful to understand the effects of social consciousness on prices, profits, and trade pattern, we are not aware of models that explicitly incorporate heterogeneity in consumers’ social consciousness to explain consequences on prices, wages, qualities and welfare. Unlike Baron and Diermeier (2007), we analyze boycotts and buycotts under symmetric and perfect information. Innes (2006) argues that, in practice, boycotts may arise despite symmetric information and the existence of one rational player. Innes (2006) cites (Friedman 1999)’s survey of boycotts to explain that campaigns are organized in ""view of known susceptibilities of both a potential boycott target and target consumer audience"" (Innes 2006). Moreover, a variety of websites now provide information on boycott/buycott issuesFootnote 5, so we assume consumers are quite informed but differ in their social consciousness. In this context, we develop an original Bertrand-type duopoly model that will help disentangle the effects of a boycott and a buycott within the triad of consumers, firms, and workers (or unions). The model’s premise is that consumers have a choice to make between a first good (or Firm 1) assessed exclusively through objective factors that leave little room for disagreement and result in all consumers deriving the same utility from this good, and a second good (or Firm 2) for which subjective factors result in all consumers deriving different utilities from this good. Although we have the North-South trade in mind, this asymmetric specification of utilities can describe a variety of situations. For example, a food item may be produced organically by Firm 1 or industrially by Firm 2. A barrel of oil may be produced in an environmentally responsible manner by Firm 1 or irresponsibly by Firm 2. Of interest to us is the example of garments manufactured in the North by Firm 1 constrained by strict labor laws and in the South by Firm 2 with fewer legislative or social limitations. In all three cases we can reasonably say that the first firm is “virtuous"" in some sense, which translates into the common utility. Misgivings concerning farming methods, sources of hydrocarbons or labor laws will create heterogeneity among consumers concerning the second good. This paper aims to analyze how this heterogeneity affects prices, wages (endogeneized by capturing the “tug-of-war"" between workers and managers who wish to maximize total wages and profits respectively), qualities, and welfare. This heterogeneity may for example reflect prosocial consumer behavior (Benabou and Tirole 2005, 2010). Following Garcia-Gallego and Georgantzis (2009)’s approach that identifies two changes in consumers’ social responsibility, i.e., the heterogeneity-reducing case and the heterogeneity-enhancing case, we consider each type corresponds to a boycott and a buycott, respectively. While a boycott aims to raise awareness among those who have the lowest willingness to pay (henceforth WTP) for social attributes, a buycott encourages consumers to increase even more their WTP for non tainted goods. Finally, in an extension of the basic model we endogenize the behavior of activists. following Baron and Diermeier (2007) we introduce a model of private politics that focuses on a conflict between a firm and an activist who compete through an activist campaign. This activist campaign is composed of a demand made by an activist in the North (for higher working conditions in the South), a reward if the target meets the demand and a harm if the firm rejects the demand. In the boycott campaign (buycott campaign), an activist makes a demand to which the firm concedes or not but incurs a harm if practices are left unchanged (receives a reward if practices meet the demand). The basic model and its extension yield similar results. Results show that an activism based on a boycott strategy leads to a decrease in prices, wages, southern quality and welfare. A buycott strategy leads to opposite effects. To achieve their goals, activists should favor a strategy based on positive information rather than a strategy that discloses negative information concerning firms’ practices. While both forms of activism have the same objectives, i.e., improving southern welfare, their effects are quite different and can turn out to be unintended. Based on our analysis of an activist campaign, we consider that the less socially conscious a firm, the higher the likelihood to be targeted either by a boycott or a buycott campaign as in both cases activists’ gains decrease with the level of working conditions. We also propose that a firm with low working conditions is less likely to be targeted by a boycott campaign if it produces a high-quality good. If complying with activists’ demands is more expensive than quality improvements, a firm has an incentive to favor the quality of the good at the expense of workers’ rights. In this case, an activist campaign fails to change firms’ practices and harms those they are designed to help. The reminder of the article is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we model a three-stage game in which northern consumers, firms and southern workers interact. Firms first choose their quality levels, then workers and firms bargain over wages and finally both firms play a one-shot Bertrand-Nash game aimed at finding optimal prices. We incorporate in Sect. 3 the mechanics of boycott and buycott through changes in consumers’ heterogeneity. Equilibria determined in the basic model give us a better understanding of the effects of a boycott and a buycott strategy on prices, wages, qualities, and welfare. An activist campaign is analyzed in Sect. 4. Section 5 summarizes the main findings and discusses extensions.",

158,4,Review of World Economics,04 April 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-022-00459-0,Trade and welfare effects of a potential free trade agreement between Japan and the United States,November 2022,Timo Walter,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the past decades, the value of U.S. exports has risen sharply from $1.3 trillion in 2005 to more than $2.5 trillion in 2019.Footnote 1 In 2019, 52% of U.S. exports went to countries with an established U.S. trade agreement.Footnote 2 It is worth noting that Japan, as the world’s third largest economy (by GDP in 2019), is one of the United States’ most important trading partners without a trade agreement in place. To address this issue, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was sought to structure trade relations between the two countries. However, after the 2016 U.S. election, one of the first steps taken by the new administration was to put TPP negotiations on hold and focus on bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) in order to have greater negotiating power. In October 2019, the U.S. and Japan concluded their negotiations on a “stage one” trade agreement, which includes the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement (USJTA) and the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement. The USJTA accounts for 5% of bilateral trade between the two countries and is therefore considered a rather small trade agreement. The U.S. agreed to reduce its tariffs on goods in the industrial sector, while Japan reduced its tariffs in the agricultural sector. The U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement was established as a precursor to other Digital Trade Agreements to reduce non-discriminatory treatment of digital services and improve the flow of data across countries. Stage two of the bilateral trade agreement is expected to be a deeper and more comprehensive FTA. Moreover, Japan joined the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the TPP successor without the U.S., in late 2018. This resulted in lower Japanese import tariffs for CPTPP countries, putting U.S. exporters at a disadvantage. In addition, China made its first attempt to join the CPTPP in September 2021, which would make the CPTPP a major regional trade agreement. Surprisingly, little research has been done on the trade and welfare implications of a U.S.-Japan trade agreement, particularly with respect to a “stage one” and “stage two” agreement. The ongressional Research Service (2020) provides a good overview of “stage one” developments and recent “stage two” negotiations. To this point, only reports have examined the bilateral FTA from a geopolitical and advisory perspective, but not from the economic side (Scissors & Blumenthal, 2017; Cooper, 2014). Far more research has been conducted on other FTAs such as the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement or the EU-South Korea FTA. Chowdhry and Felbermayr (2021) focus on the EU-South Korea trade agreement from the French perspective, Grübler and Reiter (2021) study the impact of tariffs and non-tariff measures (NTMs) of the EU-South Korea FTA. A comprehensive analysis is done by Civic Consulting and Ifo Institute (2018) who rely on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). Felbermayr et al. (2019) examine the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement and their work is closest to my paper as it has a similar theoretical approach and also uses the WIOD as the main data source. Regarding the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Li and Whalley (2021) use a general equilibrium (GE) model to analyze different scenarios of the CPTPP. Li and Li (2021), disentangle the trade impacts between the CPTPP and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP), while Le (2021) examines the CPTPP from a Vietnamese viewpoint. In this paper, I fill the gap by analyzing a U.S.-Japan FTA using the theoretical model of Caliendo and Parro (2015), which builds on the assumptions of New Quantitative Trade Theory (NQTT).Footnote 3 Applying the model provides several advantages: First, the model solves for a counterfactual equilibrium in relative changes through which structural parameters that are difficult to identify cancel out and do not have to be estimated empirically. Hereby the approach is borrowed from Dekle et al. (2008). Second, their model is a multi-sector multi-country model with intermediate goods. The focus on trade in intermediates (global supply chains) is particularly useful for the investigation of the FTA between Japan and the U.S., as the impact of trade agreements does not only depend on the degree of policy changes but also on the interrelation between industries. The international economy can be seen as an interlinked production network where the output of one sector can become the input for another. An impulse of trade policy can be passed on and impact other sectors as well. A difference between my paper and Caliendo and Parro (2015) is that this paper tries to predict the effect of the potential FTA ex-ante. Several studies use an ex-ante trade policy approach, for example for Brexit (Felbermayr et al., 2018) or on the elimination of EU and U.S. import tariffs in the automotive sector (Jung & Walter, 2018). To solve for the welfare gains I apply the ex-ante empirical strategy of Aichele et al. (2014). The approach is useful as it takes not only tariffs, but also NTMs into account. In general, trade agreements can take on different intensity levels to remove trade impediments. These can vary from reducing tariffs to deeper integration, where NTMs are minimized. The reduction of NTMs can include the standardization of regulatory legislation and industry standards as well as the opening of markets to foreign investments. To estimate the impact of NTMs, I apply the top-down method and use past trade agreements as a benchmark to quantify the possible welfare impact of the FTA.Footnote 4 This paper contributes to the literature in two ways. Not only is it one of the first to address the welfare implications of a FTA between Japan and the U.S., but it also simulates different scenarios by conducting a counterfactual analysis. In particular, I examine the trade and welfare consequences of the “stage one” trade agreement, which comprises the USJTA and the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement. In addition, I explore the impact of a potential “stage two” trade agreement as a deep FTA, in which all bilateral tariffs are reduced to zero and NTMs are sharply reduced. To link my paper to the current discussion, I extend the analysis and examine and compare the welfare effects of the established CPTPP with the scenario of China or the U.S. joining the CPTPP. To exercise the counterfactual simulation, I use the well-established World Input-Output Database (WIOD) (Timmer et al. 2015) as well as the UNCTAD’s TRAINS and the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) database for tariffs as the main data sources. The WIOD contains only data of six CPTPP countries, namely Japan, U.S., Canada, Mexico, Chile and Australia.Footnote 5 However, those countries are responsible for 96% of the CPTPP members’ GDP, through which valid interpretations are possible. I take the WIOD for the most recent year, 2014; to be more current and to take into account developments in trade policy since then, I counterfactually construct a new baseline for 2019. To do this, I use the 2014 input-output data along with the 2014 tariff data as the old baseline. I then counterfactually simulate the new baseline year of 2019, taking into consideration the 2019 tariff data as well as trade policy developments that took place between these years, such as the signing of the EU-Japan trade agreement, thus ensuring the reduction of NTMs that have been reduced since then. A baseline is established for each scenario, i.e., the U.S.-Japan FTA, the established CPTPP and CPTPP with the U.S., and the CPTPP with China. This is necessary because each scenario depends on different circumstances. For example, for the FTA, I consider the fact that the CPTPP already exists. When calculating the impact of the established CPTPP, I do not consider the CPTPP for the new baseline. This is also true for the extended CPTPP with the U.S. or China. My results show that the impact of the “stage one” trade agreement is small. The trade effects of the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement (USJTA) display that the U.S. imports from Japan increase by $5.3 billion and the Japanese imports from the U.S. rise by $2.9 billion. Since the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement mainly targets the services industry, the impact on trade is even smaller. Overall, the “stage one” trade agreement increases welfare by 0.008% for the U.S. and 0.021% for Japan, due to the USJTA. Only a marginal contribution is made by the digital trade agreement. The deep FTA as a “stage two” agreement leads to higher welfare for the U.S. (0.14%) and Japan (0.3%). In Japan, it is primarily the Motor Vehicle sector that benefits most, while in the U.S. the food and agricultural sectors profit from the agreement. Moreover, my results show that it is not a symmetric reduction in NTMs over all sectors that count, but rather that NTM reductions in some sectors are more important for welfare gains than in others. With respect to the CPTPP, I find that the U.S. (0.69%) and Japan (0.44%) benefit more if the U.S. joins the CPTPP than they would under a bilateral FTA. I also find that Japan would benefit even more if China joined the regional trade agreement (1.1%) instead of the U.S. joining the CPTPP. In this case, China’s welfare would increase by (0.51%), while the U.S. would benefit marginally by (0.02%). The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 elaborates on the stylized facts, while Sect. 3 gives a brief overview of the gravity model used in the analysis. Section 4 outlines the strategy for determining the change in trade costs and the parameter identification. Section 5 presents the research results. A conclusion is drawn in Sect. 6.",2

I call it economic statecraft. — former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Nov. 2012 Since the end of the Cold War the geography of economic integration agreements (EIA) is rapidly evolving. Bilateral and multilateral EIAsFootnote 1 have seen a massive boost in numbers since the early 1990’s, before the Brexit vote signaled a possible momentum towards disintegration. While part of the reason for regional and supra-regional trade agreements is grounded in obvious economic benefits, often there appears to be more than “just trade” as incentive. The connection between bilateral political relations and economic integration between partnering countries can be profound, as probably best exemplified by the arguably deepest and most advanced agreement, the European Union. For some country pairs, political motivations may even dominate trade gains altogether, defying the usual logic for how deep a trade agreement should be: Why e.g. has the US deeper agreements in the Middle East than with East Asian countries? Figure 1 underlines the intuition by showing the number of bilateral relations a country has with an underlying EIA. Aside from the highly integrated European continent, the Middle East in particular appears to be not only a politically volatile region, but also a hotbed of EIAs. Figures 2a and b display the changing nature of country pairs that form EIAs. Since the early 1960’s the average distance and ratio of GDPs between countries in active EIAs is growing and accelerating since the 1990’s. Total number of bilateral relations with active EIAs by country in 2006 This paper aims to address the question of how trade policy, in the form of signing a new or deepening of an existing EIA, is influenced by political considerations, and more specifically, why countries negotiate and sign agreements with little economic benefits. Aside from traditional trade gains, bilateral trade policy in the form of EIAs appears to follow a pattern in which larger countries form such agreements with smaller, but potentially geopolitically important countries.Footnote 2 As such, the paper is related to an extensive literature on the determinants and effects of economic integration. Limão (2016) provides comprehensive overviews of the literature on economic and non-economic determinants of preferential trade agreements—as well as their impact on trade. In Limão (2007) he provides the benchmark model on non-traditional determinants of economic integration that incorporates a generic non-trade issue into bilateral trade negotiations and identifies the implications on multilateral trade liberalization. I will build on this model to provide a theoretical intuition for the proposed mechanisms at play. Baier and Bergstrand (2004) and Baier et al. (2014) provide analyses of economic determinants of free trade agreements. In Baier and Bergstrand (2007) they quantify the effect of free trade agreements on trade flows, taking into account potential endogeneity issues of selection into EIAs. Vicard (2009) shows that countries tend to follow different paths of economic integration that he finds, somewhat surprisingly, to exhibit similar trade impacts. Aichele et al. (2014) contribute to the debate on the economic and political effects of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the European Union and the United States. They estimate the impact of economic integration across the North Atlantic on gross trade, trade in value-added and welfare in a structural gravity framework similar in spirit to Caliendo and Parro (2015). This current paper deviates from these prior works by analyzing the impact of the depth of integration, hence moving away from the traditional binary coding of bilateral agreements. Maggi (2014) and Freund and Ornelas (2010) provide comprehensive overviews of the more recent developments since Baldwin and Venables (1995) and draw the frontiers in this field: According to Freund and Ornelas “participation in any [trade agreement] is a political decision,” warranting future research. The average ratio of the GDP (a) and the average distance (b) between two countries in an active EIA is increasing over time Previous work has established links between EIAs and conflict, capturing one facet of political motivations. Martin et al. (2008), in their aptly named paper “Make Trade Not War”, show that the onset of war greatly diminishes the value of traded goods, therefore implying that strong trading relations create higher opportunity costs for war, in turn minimizing the probability of conflict. In Martin et al. (2012) they then go on to show that this effect can be institutionalized by forming a trade agreement within a certain time window after a conflict. Vicard (2012) finds that deep economic integration between countries significantly reduces their probability of conflict, while shallow agreements do not. Other papers study the link between trade and politics in a broader sense. Glick and Taylor (2010) estimate the impact of the two world wars on trade and other economic indicators, using a gravity model approach similar to mine. Umana Dajud (2013) studies the impact of political proximity on trade flows, finding that countries ruled by governments that are similar in terms of their position on the left/right spectrum and degree of authoritarianism/libertarianism, have a greater exchange of goods. Lederman and Ozden (2007) show how US geopolitical interests, as expressed through political alliances, are played out against preferential access to the US market. Berger et al. (2013) reveal another aspect of the mixing of political and commercial interests by showing how CIA interventions lead to an increase in US imports by the affected country. Naturally, the interaction between trade policy and foreign policy has also been studied from the perspective of political science. Waltz (1999) and Nye (1988, 2011) portray the thinking in the two most prominent schools of thought in this respect: the school of realism and that of (neo)liberalism. Others have established the link between domestic politics and trade agreements: Mansfield et al. (2002) show that trade agreements generate information that help leaders “show their constituents their achievements” during their time in power. Liu and Ornelas (2014) find further evidence for this hypothesis, showing that trade agreements can serve as a commitment device for the purpose of stabilizing a democratic regime (Maggi 2014). This resonates also with results from Mansfield et al. (2000), who demonstrate common characteristics of signatories of trade agreements: Democracies set trade barriers reciprocally at lower levels than autocracies. This paper contributes to the literature by seeking to demonstrate the impact of political motivations for EIAs. Building on a modified version of the model introduced by Limão (2007), I show how in a stylized framework a big country may weigh alternative motivations for integration—of economic or political nature—while a smaller country may be indifferent between possible partner countries at the same time. I test these predictions with proxies for economic and political motivations for integration. The economic motivation is proxied by non-realized trade gains from bilateral economic integration computed using general equilibrium counterfactuals from a gravity framework. In the gravity setup I introduce an index of depth of integration that improves upon the customary estimation with a dummy variable, allowing for heterogeneity of effects. The political motivation is proxied by two new indices to describe the state of political relations between two countries—bilateral political importance and mood—harnessing the powers of the GDELT dataset on political events. I find evidence for the hypothesis that there is more to economic integration than “just trade”. Specifically, geopolitical considerations play a determining role in the choice of the contracting partner country and the depth of economic integration. Traditional trade gains and political considerations are substitutes for the choice of the partner country and depth of integration. This can explain, e.g., why the United States has formed deeper economic integration agreements with some geopolitically relevant countries in the Middle East, than with some economically relevant countries in East Asia. The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 I sketch a model that displays the mechanism through which countries choose their contracting partner for an EIA—allowing for economic and political motivations. In Sect. 3 I introduce an index of depth of economic integration, estimate the elasticity of trade to this depth and subsequently calculate the trade gains of existing and hypothetical EIAs between countries. In Sect. 4 I construct two new indices that quantify bilateral political relations: the mood and importance. Finally in Sect. 5 I bring both empirical components together and estimate the effect of political motivations as a determinant of trade policy. Section 6 concludes.",
159,1,Review of World Economics,27 April 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-022-00464-3,"Sectoral reallocations, real estate shocks, and productivity divergence in Europe",February 2023,Thomas Grjebine,Jérôme Héricourt,Fabien Tripier,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The creation of the euro in 1999 was expected to become a catalyst for real convergence in Europe. Far from being the case, real divergence increased as evidenced by low productivity growth in the “periphery” of the euro area relatively to “core” countries. This divergence was accompanied by massive capital flows from the euro area’s core—Germany, Netherlands—to its periphery—e.g., Portugal or Spain—that left peripheral economies with financial and real estate bubbles (Spain being emblematic of the latter), together with a continuously weakening manufacturing sector, while this sector was strengthening in Germany (Krugman, 2013). Figure 1 provides a striking illustration of the divergence process at work in the euro area since the beginning of the 21st century.Footnote 1 It focuses on three countries emblematic of the structural divergences within the euro areaFootnote 2: Germany and Spain, for the previously mentioned reasons, as well as France, often presented as an “in-between” situation. Between 2000 and 2015, whereas Spanish TFP stagnates, French TFP increases half more slowly than the German one. Parallel to this real divergence, European countries experienced heterogeneous real estate price dynamics which took the form, in some economies, of massive boom-bust cycles. These real estate booms occurred in Spain and France notably, and were parallel to the productivity slowdown or even productivity losses, while price increases have been much more moderate in Germany, particularly in the first decade of the sample. Figure 2 compares real estate prices dynamics in Germany, France and Spain.Footnote 3 There is so far little systematic evidence on the links between these two dynamics: This paper investigates the effects of real estate booms on the dynamics of misallocation between countries and on productivity divergence in Europe. A recent, though flourishing, literature studies the role of resources misallocations in explaining international differences in productivity, with a clear focus on within-industry reallocation, i.e. on the (in-)efficiency of resources’ allocation between firms (see e.g., Restuccia & Rogerson, 2008, for the US, Hsieh & Klenow, 2009, for the US, China and India, and Bartelsman et al., 2013, for a cross-country analysis). Based on an exhaustive firm-level dataset, Garcia-Santana et al. (2018) also argue that the source of bad relative TFP performance in Spain was the increase in the within-industry misallocation of production factors across firms. TFP dynamics. Note Country-level TFP (in log, with value set to 0 in 2000) built using historical value added shares by sector as weights. DE: Germany, ES: Spain, FR: France However, sectoral reallocations may have been overlooked in previous research, precisely due to this focus of most papers on within-industry reallocation among firms. In addition, these studies focus on the manufacturing sector due to data coverage, and miss an important aspect of these reallocations which is the growing share of services industries. A few papers have already focused on the importance of sectoral reallocations for macroeconomic divergence (Reis, 2013; Benigno & Fornaro, 2014; Piton, 2018; Choi et al., 2018; Gilbert & Pool, 2020). However, these papers most often focus on reallocations from tradable to non-tradable sectors, for which the aggregate effect on productivity is unclear,Footnote 4 and is very sensitive to the classification of tradable sectors. Dynamics in these two broad sectors might also hide significant reallocations among sub-sectors of the tradable or non-tradable sector—such as the reallocation from manufacturing to business services in the tradable sector. Some recent papers started investigating the links between financial booms and sectoral reallocations. Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2015) and Borio et al. (2015) investigate how credit booms tend to undermine productivity growth by inducing labor reallocations towards lower productivity growth sectors, in particular the construction sector. For example, credit booms in Spain and Ireland coincided with rapid growth of employment in construction at the expense of the more productive manufacturing sector. However, there is so far little systematic evidence on the dynamics of misallocation between countries and the importance of inter-sectoral reallocations in explaining them. Real estate shocks could not only lead to reallocations towards the construction sector but change the whole structure of the economy and the relative size of every sector. Real estate prices. Note Country-level real estate prices (index, with value set to 100 in 2000). DE: Germany, ES: Spain, FR: France In this paper, we investigate how real estate shocks lead to reallocations involving all sectors of the economy, and not only towards construction. We use variations in (real estate) collateral at the country-sector level to identify the impact of real estate shocks on sectoral reallocations. The collateral mechanism is linked to the “financial accelerator” (Bernanke & Gertler, 1989; Kiyotaki & Moore, 1997): with imperfect financial markets, financially constrained sectors (and firms in these sectors) will use their pledgeable assets as collateral to finance their investment (e.g. Chaney et al., 2012). Fougere et al. (2019) replicate Chaney et al. (2012)’s approach on French firm-level data, and find evidence of heterogeneous effects of real estate prices on investment along the sectoral distribution of real estate holdings. A related strand of the literature has proposed models to investigate how financial frictions affect TFP (Buera et al., 2011; Midrigan & Xu, 2014; Moll, 2014; Buera & Moll, 2015). The typical prediction of these models is that a financial liberalization episode is associated with capital inflows, a better allocation of resources across firms, and an increase in TFP growth. However, it seems that this prediction does not match the experience of countries in South Europe where TFP growth declined. Relying on a model with size-dependent financial frictions, Gopinath et al. (2017) quantify the contribution of heterogeneous financing frictions to sectoral misallocation across manufacturing Spanish firms. Based on US data for listed firms, Catherine et al. (2021) show collateral constraints induce aggregate output losses of 7.1%, and TFP (misallocation) losses of 1.4%. We take stock of this firm-level literature, by adapting Chaney et al. (2012)’s approach to a country-sector environment. Consistently, we expect an increase in the value of the collateral will allow sectors to increase their investment, the more so if the sector has relatively more collateral (which we measure through the amount of real estate capital owned by the sector). More specifically, we identify exogenous shocks to domestic real estate prices through a combination of (world) demand shocks and (country-level) supply constraints on the real estate market. This allows us to recover the causal impact of real estate sectoral intensity on investment, share of total value added (as a proxy for sectoral size) and TFP growth at the country-sector level. It is worth mentioning that besides the dynamics of the real estate sector per se, we are interested in the use of real estate capital in other sectors (excluding the real estate one).Footnote 5 Our results notably show that exogenous real estate prices shocks increase sectoral investment and size: a 10 percentage points (pp) increase of real estate sectoral holdings brings an additional 0.8 pp in the ratio of investment to capital stock, and an additional 6 pp to the ratio of gross value added to capital stock. Conversely, we find no significant impact on sectoral TFP.Footnote 6 Put differently, real estate shocks (identified through real estate price variations) may affect aggregate TFP exclusively through a sectoral reallocation mechanism. To quantify the latter, we build a counterfactual TFP at the country level which corresponds to the TFP that would have been observed in the economy if its sectoral composition was entirely determined by real estate prices shocks. Then, this TFP is compared with the TFP that would have been observed if the sectoral composition of the economy had remained unchanged. Interestingly, we find that these productivity effects of real estate price shocks are not only quantitatively non negligible but also point to a greater divergence between these European countries. Going back to the three countries mentioned above, these effects generate productivity gains in Germany, while they generate productivity losses in France and Spain. The next section presents the data and some stylized facts on the role of sectoral reallocations in productivity dynamics in Europe. Section 3 details our identification strategy for estimating the impact of sectoral real estate holdings on sector-level investment, size and TFP.

For example, nearly half of the total imports of the U.S. result from intrafirm trade.Footnote 1 In examining U.S. firm-level data, Ramondo et al. (2016) report that only a limited fraction of overseas affiliates are involved in intrafirm trade despite our understanding of intrafirm trade linked with vertical foreign direct investment (FDI). The incompleteness of contracts should be among the determinants for trade to cross beyond firm boundaries. This paper reexamines whether vertical linkage is related to intrafirm trade by considering contractual frictions based on affiliate-level data of Japanese multinational enterprises (MNEs). As is discussed in the literature on contract theory (e.g., Antràs, 2003, in the international trade context), an incomplete contract environment tends to deter transactions with unrelated parties. This argument suggests that affiliates and parents are actively engaged in intrafirm trade especially in industries susceptible to contractual frictions. If firms depend more on differentiated inputs that are neither traded on organized exchanges nor under reference prices (Nunn, 2007), or on inputs sourced from diverse sectors (Levchenko, 2007), firms have stronger incentives to trade inputs within firm boundaries to alleviate incomplete contract problems. We investigate this hypothesis by disaggregating intrafirm trade data into sectors with varying contractibility. The two measures used in this paper for sector-specific contractibility are (1) Nunn-type measure, which subtracts from the value one the weighted average of the proportion of inputs that are neither sold on an organized exchange nor reference priced, and (2) Levchenko-type measure of sectoral concentration, which is the Herfindahl index of input use. Our work is related to previous studies of the impact of contractual frictions on intrafirm trade. Bernard et al. (2010) find that intrafirm trade is negatively correlated with product contractibility, for which they use the share of wholesale employment in each firm as a proxy of intermediation based on U.S. firm-level data. Corcos et al. (2013) use disaggregated country–product data for MNE parents in France and find that intrafirm trade tends to be active for products that are neither sold on an organized exchange nor reference priced, but they did not control for affiliate attributes. Blanas and Seric (2018) investigate foreign-owned affiliates in 19 Sub-Saharan African countries and found that a sector’s contract intensity interacted with the country’s judicial quality has a significant effect on intrafirm trade intensity, but they do not control for characteristics of MNE parents. Compared with previous work, our research focuses on vertical linkage and controls for the effects of affiliate characteristics as well as those of MNEs.Footnote 2 We estimate our model by Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML). The inclusion of affiliates with zero intrafirm trade into our regressions is important because an overwhelming majority of affiliates are not involved in any intrafirm trade at all as repeatedly confirmed. This paper is also related to previous studies of vertical FDI with production stage fragmentation. Alfaro and Charlton (2009) emphasize the prevalence of vertical FDI in “close” industries by reporting that nearly a quarter of offshore affiliates operate in the same two-digit industry, not four-digit, as their parents in their global ownership database, but industrial classifications may not be informative for examining closeness or linkages of industries.Footnote 3 Antràs and Chor (2013) conclude that under incomplete contracts, intrafirm trade share increase with the upstreamness of firms in sequential production stages, and they provide supportive evidence from U.S. aggregated sector-level data. Although they do not directly examine intrafirm trade, Alfaro et al. (2019) report that integrated inputs (produced in industries within firm boundaries) tend to be positioned more upstream than outsourced inputs (sourced from other industries) in worldwide establishment-level data. We introduce sectoral contractibility interacted with input–output linkages between parents and offshore affiliates in countries with a different contracting environment. To preview our principal results, we find that input–output linkages are positively related to intrafirm trade share especially for affiliates’ exports to their parents in sectors with low contractibility, and for affiliates located in East Asia, where Japanese overseas affiliates are agglomerated. No such relationship is detected for affiliated in developed countries: member countries of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In other words, MNE parents and their vertically linked affiliates are likely to engage in intrafirm trade to mitigate contract problems, but the negative impact of incomplete contracts appears to be diluted in sectors that are not seriously vulnerable to contractual frictions and in countries with a developed contracting environment. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our affiliate-level data. Section 3 summarizes patterns of Japanese intrafirm trade. After the explanation of our empirical framework in Sect. 4, the regression results are presented in Sect. 5. Section 6 reports robustness check results. Section 7 adds some concluding comments.",1

Urbina,Gabriel Rodríguez,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The dynamics of commodity prices constitutes an important issue for the development of resource dependent countries since it affects not only the real activity but also fiscal variables. Shocks in commodity prices can generate noticeable fluctuations in tax revenues from the natural resources sector, which in turn generates uncertainty about the availability of funds for government spending, thus affecting fiscal policy, social services and public investment. When commodity prices are rising, as in the commodities boom, tax revenues have substantial increases and this can lead to overspending, which aggravates fiscal procyclicality. In turn, when commodity prices are decreasing, as during the Great Recession or at the end of the commodities super cycle, government revenues and expenditures also tend to decrease. Consequently, several resource-rich economies have adopted different fiscal policy rules in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations on fiscal variables. Nevertheless, the results are not always as expected since the fiscal rules may be too lax or are not followed in practice. This problem is particularly relevant for mineral-dependent economies. As García and Guzmán (2019) note, the commodity price volatility is a critical characteristic of mineral markets since many mineral commodities fluctuate remarkably in the short term and, in fact, it is not unusual for mineral prices to double or fall by half within a year or two. This has motivated research on the fiscal effects of fluctuations in international prices in mineral economies like Chile, Niger and Zambia; see De Mello (2008), Adam and Simpasa (2010), De Gregorio and Labbé (2011), Go et al. (2016). In the case of Peru, we have that it is an economy in which the mining sector is clearly relevant. Mining accounts for nearly 10% of Peruvian GDP and 60% of Peruvian total exports; see Ernst and Peru (2019). This is similar to the case of Chile, another relevant mining country, where the mining sector accounts for around 10% of GDP and 55% of total exports; see Videla (2019). In fact, Peru is a significant global mining player since it is among the largest producers of copper, silver and zinc around the world. In turn, it is the largest exporter of copper to China, which is the world’s largest consumer of this metal. Besides, Peru scores 80.1 out of 100 in the Mining Contribution Index, which measures the relative importance of mining to the economy of a country, so that it is qualified as resource-dependent. In this way, according to Consejo Fiscal (2019), the dependence on commodity prices, especially mineral prices, is the main intrinsic characteristic of Peruvian economy, both in macroeconomic and fiscal terms. Given this, Peru constitutes an appealing case to study the fiscal effects of mining dependency. It is also important to note that there have been important changes in the fiscal framework in Peru. On 1 January 2000 the Law of Fiscal Prudence and Transparency (Law N° 27245) came into effect with the objective of ensuring fiscal balance by reducing public debt and avoiding deficits in periods of recession. Furthermore, considering the importance of stability in public finances, the Law N° 27245 was substituted by the Law to Strengthen Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency (Law N° 30099) which came into effect on 1 January 2015 with the objective of guaranteeing the stability in government spending by financing it with structural fiscal revenues, thus sheltering public finances from volatility in commodity prices. Besides, Mendoza and De Echave (2016) show that there have been relevant changes in the taxation of the Peruvian mining sector. In turn, there were also changes in the mining canon, which is defined as fiscal revenues from mining activity that are destined for regions and localities where mining exploitation takes place with the aim of promoting their economic and social development. As Aspillaga (2006) reports, between January 1997 and May 2002 the mining canon was 20% of the income tax from the holders of the mining activity but from June 2002 this percentage was raised to 50% in accordance with Law of Canon (Law N \({{}^\circ }\) 27506). Given this, the present paper adds to the literature by analyzing the evolution of the effects of mineral commodity prices on fiscal variables in the Peruvian economy by means of a time-varying parameters vector autoregression with stochastic volatility (TVP-VAR-SV). In specific, our study is primarily focused on analyzing the impacts of shocks in mineral commodity prices on fiscal revenue variables, namely, taxes from mining and mining canon. The application of a TVP-VAR-SV methodology is particularly suitable for our purpose as compared with the conventional constant VAR approach. First, because there have been important changes in the economic context, so that we should consider the possibility of parameters with changes over time. Second, because it would be unreasonable to assume that volatility is constant in a model that incorporates variables with a remarkable and changing volatility like mineral commodity prices. In this way, the results show that considering stochastic volatility is essential in order to properly capture the dynamics of the system. In turn, it is found that the responses of taxes from mining and mining canon to shocks in mineral commodity vary over time so that they become increasingly more pronounced until reaching a peak around 2009 and then decrease. It is noted that these responses are more than proportional, thus reflecting a remarkable sensitivity of Peruvian fiscal revenues to external shocks. Besides, the importance of shocks in mineral commodity prices in explaining fluctuations in taxes from mining and mining canon increases until reaching a peak around 2009 and then decrease, which is in line with the dynamics of the commodities boom. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 describes the methodology for estimation and model comparison. Section 4 presents the data and the empirical results with the respective interpretation and discussions. Section 5 concludes.

159,1,Review of World Economics,12 May 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-022-00466-1,Monetary policy in an oil-dependent economy in the presence of multiple shocks,February 2023,Andrej Drygalla,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"After Russian GDP growth already slowed down in 2013, increased political uncertainty and sanctions related to the annexation of the Crimean peninsula have amplified capital outflows and the economic downturn in 2014. In addition, the sharp fall in oil prices in the second half of the year reduced capital inflows and output growth even further. In order to prevent a sharp depreciation of the ruble and an increase in domestic inflation as a result thereof, the central bank raised its key policy rate in six steps by 1150 basis points during 2014. In addition, it directly intervened in the foreign exchange (FX) market by selling parts of its currency reserves until it officially allowed the ruble to freely float. Whereas a strong devaluation could not have been prevented and the exchange rate management has been eventually given up, raised interest rates might have posed an additional obstacle for the already weak economy. Against this background, this work aims at analyzing and assessing the monetary policy of the Russian central bank in the presence of simultaneously occurring shocks to the oil price and capital outflows. To correctly account for specific features of the Russian economy, the oil sector as well as a mirco-founded foreign exchange market are introduced into a small open economy DSGE model estimated for Russia. Simulations are conducted for different alternative policy strategies that are subsequently assessed on the basis of the effects they have on particular variables of interest. The importance of the fuel sector for the Russian economy is huge. According to data from the Bank of Russia, exports of oil, oil products and natural gas constituted on average more than 60 percent of total goods exports from 2001 until 2015. Their share in total output averaged 16 percent over the same period. The high correlation of 0.88 (0.94 when expressed in ruble terms) between changes in the price of oil and GDP growth suggests that fluctuations in the revenues from fuel exports that are caused by price dynamics have a substantial impact on the domestic economic activity. By the same token, the Russian trade balance is strongly affected by the oil price leading to appreciation (depreciation) pressures on the ruble in the wake of rising (falling) oil prices. In order to smooth their impact on the domestic economy, the Bank of Russia (CBR) has implemented a managed floating exchange rate regime in 1999 under which it conducted operations on the foreign exchange market. Over the following years, the CBR’s exchange rate policy underwent gradual changes. Most importantly, the operational target for the dollar/euro dual-currency basket has been changed from a fixed to a floating band. In general, the exchange rate management to limit ruble exchange rate fluctuations via interventions remained officially in place until November 2014 after not being able to counteract the ongoing large capital outflows. However, it still engaged in FX interventions during 2015. This study analyzes the managed floating exchange rate regime within a framework that considers relevant aspects for the Russian economy and its monetary policy in particular. In doing so, we add to the literature on the optimal reaction of monetary policy in the presence of commodity price shocks and the implementation of foreign exchange interventions into dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. Bernanke et al. (1997) and Gertler et al. (1999) argue that an insufficient monetary policy reaction to oil price shocks amplifies the negative influences of the shock. Their conclusion stems from the empirical evidence of the 1970s when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates too little to curb the impact of the oil price shocks on inflation and inflation expectations. On the other hand, the policy tightening was too strong that it led to adverse implications for the real economy. While these conclusions can be applied to other oil-importing economies, implications on the effects of commodity price shocks and optimal monetary policy would differ for exporting countries such as Russia. In an estimated DSGE model for Canada, Dib (2008) finds that commodity price shocks significantly contribute to real business cycle dynamics. In that context, flexible exchange rates can offset some of the negative effects from external shocks. Sosunov and Zamulin (2007) and Semko (2013) employ DSGE models calibrated as well as estimated for the Russian economy to conclude that a monetary policy reaction to oil price shocks is redundant if oil revenues can be saved in some stabilization fund. Sosunov and Zamulin (2007) find consumer price inflation (CPI) targeting to be the optimal monetary policy in the case of Russia. Herz et al. (2015) calibrate the model by Ratto et al. (2009) to the Russian economy to conclude that CPI targeting is superior to the alternative of targeting the ruble price of oil, a strategy following the idea proposed by Frankel (2005) to target the price of the most important export commodity expressed in local currency. The most recent and detailed work on the Russian economy within a DSGE framework is the one by Malakhovskaya and Minabutdinov (2014). They find evidence for commodity export shocks affecting domestic production in the short-run as well as the long-term. However, although the authors account for many important features of the Russian economy, they assume a completely floating exchange rate and by that ignore the implications that exchange rate management might has on the transmission of shocks. To address this deficiency, the framework of this study is designed to explicitly account for the exchange rate policy of the CBR that has been described as a strategy to smooth the behavior of the ruble’s exchange rate against the US dollar and later a dual-currency basket consisting of the dollar and the euro. Whereas the inclusion of the nominal exchange rate in the policy rate reaction function is a common feature of small open economy (SOE) models, little work has been done so far to take into account direct central bank interventions on the foreign exchange market that are characteristic for most of the economies targeting the dynamics of their nominal exchange rate. Benes et al. (2015) built on a financial sector following Edwards and Vegh (1997) and construct a model in which sterilized central bank interventions stabilize the exchange rate but also change the portfolio composition of domestic commercial banks that entail further macroeconomic consequences via changes in the domestic credit rates. Herrera et al. (2013) extend their framework by considering an oil-exporting sector and calibrate the model parameters to the Colombian economy to argue that foreign exchange intervention increases the volatility of credit supply and consumption compared to the alternative policy strategy of inflation targeting via an interest rate rule. Another approach to account for foreign exchange interventions has been proposed by Montoro and Ortiz (2016) who built on Bacchetta and Van Wincoop (2006) to incorporate market microstructure of exchange rate determination into a SOE model. In particular, they assume that the foreign exchange market is operated by risk-averse dealers that process sale and purchase orders for foreign securities in exchange for domestic bonds from foreign investors and the domestic central bank. Interventions of the latter will cause the ratio of domestic to foreign assets held by the dealers and their demanded risk premium to change causing immediate movements in the nominal exchange rate. Based on their calibrated model, they argue that intervention can shelter the domestic economy from external shocks, in particular if they are rule-based. Malovana (2015) conducts a similar analysis for the Czech Republic. However, she excludes rule-based interventions from the estimated model specifications and analyzes their implication for the transmission of shocks in calibrated simulations only. We build on the idea proposed by Montoro and Ortiz (2016) and further expand their model by an oil-exporting sector as well as productive capital. The resulting framework exhibits all necessary features of the Russian economy in general and the monetary policy in particular and enables the analysis of the effects that shocks to the oil price and capital flows, two key external disturbances, have on domestic variables in the presence of different monetary policy strategies. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 presents the derivation of the model equations. Details on the estimation are outlined in Sect. 3.2. Estimation results and an analysis of the vulnerability of the domestic economy based on the estimated parameters and shocks are presented in Sect. 4, whereas Sect. 5 analyzes alternative policy strategies to cope with external shocks based on the estimated model parameters and the policy strategy in place. Section 6 concludes.",
159,1,Review of World Economics,05 April 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-022-00463-4,Local-currency debt and currency internationalization dynamics: A nonlinear framework,February 2023,Delphine Lahet,Stéphanie Prat,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The economic and financial integration of emerging economies over the past three decades, which is inherent to the process of globalization, has supported the dynamics of development and catch-up in these countries. This growing financial integration has also been accompanied by the process of internationalization of currencies, which have been attractive to international investors for the settlement of commercial transactions and the purchase of financial assets, notably bond securities. However, in the context of growing public debt in emerging countries following the COVID-19 crisis, some countries, such as Brazil in June 2020 and China in October 2020, have recently issued massive sovereign bonds in hard currency. The question of the currency in which the bonds are denominated is crucial for these countries because it impacts the structure of their debt—public or private—and is accompanied by a financial vulnerability that exposes them more severely to exogenous shocks. The purpose of this article is to precisely examine the link between the process of internationalization of emerging countries’ currencies and their ability to take on debt in international markets in their own currency. The process of currency internationalization refers to the progressive use by nonresidents of a currency outside the issuer’s borders for trade and financial transactions in international markets (Kenen, 2011). While the international monetary system is still dominated by a small number of hard currencies (the US dollar, the euro, sterling, and yen, among others), the latest IMF report on the composition of foreign exchange reserves (2020) seems to show that emerging currencies have played an increasingly important role in this system over the past decade. From a general perspective, the process of internationalization is supported by national authorities and liberalization reforms as supply factors. However, this process may also depend on markets as demand factors for trade and financial transactions. As this process for emerging currencies is not complete, it is necessary to think about the degree of achievement. The degree of internationalization is measured with respect to the three functions of an international currency established by Kenen (1983): store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. The indicators of this internationalization processFootnote 1 could be direct measures of the fulfillment of functions, such as the composition of international reserves, the use for foreign exchange interventions and transactions, and the denomination and payment of trade and financial operations. Alternatively, in a broader view, they can be drivers of the process as the economic size of the issuing country, its trade share, capital account openness, and financial depth. Network effects as economies of scale are often mentioned as an acceleration vector in this process (Eichengreen, 2014; Frankel, 2011; Genberg, 2012; Park & Shin, 2012). Krugman (1984) indicated that the functions of an international currency are seldom separable and generate a self-reinforcing dynamic among them. In this way, as internationalization progresses in one of the three functions, transaction costs are lower, and convertibility is higher, it becomes relevant to use the currency in other functions, reinforcing the use in the function that originally gave international status. The economic size of the issuing country is also a way to express network effects (Eichengreen, 2014; Lee, 2014; Engel & Park, 2018): the larger a country is, the more its currency is employed for several functions. Network effects could also lead to a phenomenon of inertia (Chitu et al., 2014; Frankel, 2011). After an acceleration phase in the process of internationalization, a currency can become and remain dominant in one or several functions (US dollars) even if other currencies emerge at an international level over time. This process is actually lengthy and progressive and comes in various degrees and dimensions with occasional phases of strong progression fulfilling the functions (Ma & Villar, 2014; Maziad et al., 2011). The question of the currency structure of the debt for emerging countries is essential in understanding the risks to which they are exposed in the event of exogenous financial shocks. This will depend on the willingness of investors to lend to these countries in local currency. History has shown that emerging countries often have difficulty issuing local currency bonds on international markets, which is known in the literature as the original sin of emerging countries. This concept was first described in the late 1990s by Eichengreen and Hausmann (1999) and defined as the country’s inability to issue debt in local currencies on international markets (Eichengreen et al., 2004, 2007).Footnote 2 From a sectoral perspective, original sin impacts the currency structure of both public and private sector debt. The exposure of emerging countries to the phenomenon of original sin is therefore reflected in the currency structure of their debt: the larger the share of hard currency debt in the balance sheets of domestic entities, the more the country appears to be vulnerable to original sin. The consequences for emerging market countries are manifold. In particular, when borrowers are exposed to original sin, they suffer from currency mismatches in their balance sheets. In the case of an exogenous shock leading to large currency depreciation, negative wealth effects increase the cost of financial crises for a country in times of economic contraction (Cespedes et al., 2004; Goldstein & Turner, 2004; Krugman, 1999; Snowden, 2006). These negative balance sheet effects tend to weaken the effectiveness of exchange rate adjustments intended to ease the effects of external shocks (Frankel, 2005). The inability of emerging countries to issue bonds in their own currency seems to be linked to various elements. The literature mentions the incompleteness of international financial markets (lack of hedging instruments against exchange rate risk and high transaction costs) as well as macroeconomic instability (debt sustainability, structural current account deficit, and high inflation) (Calvo & Guidotti, 1990; Eichengreen et al., 2007; Levy-Yeyati, 2006; Reinhart et al., 2003). An additional argument that may reinforce the dynamics of original sin concerns the weakness of institutions (the poor rule of law or regulatory enforcement) (Eichengreen et al., 2002; Hausmann & Panizza, 2003). Some authors empirically prove that this institutional quality helps develop local currency issuance, whether for public (Claessens et al., 2007) or corporate securities (Kowalewski & Pisany, 2019). Still, others go further and have argued more recently that institutional quality can amplify the positive role of capital flows in emerging markets (Arya et al., 2019) and that foreign investors make their investment decisions on the basis of institutional pull factors that create a market-friendly environment (Osina, 2021). In this context, the purpose of our article is to better understand how the dynamics of the internationalization process, which refers to the use of a currency by foreign investors, impact the structure of debt in emerging countries. Indeed, a currency that is internationalizing through network effects is thought to attract foreign investors, especially on the bonds issued by the borrowers, thus avoiding the formation of currency imbalances in the balance sheets. We attempt to investigate this complex mechanism here. Currency internationalization and network effects have been extensively addressed in the literature for developed countries’ currencies, such as Eichengreen and Flandreau (2008), Eichengreen (2014) and Eichengreen et al., (2014) who show that inertia and network effects, measured by economic size of the issuing country in particular, are determinants of the currency composition of central bank foreign reserves. But in itself, the internationalization of emerging currencies has not received as much attention in an empirical framework. In a previous paper (Lahet and Prat, 2021), we filled this gap and showed that measures of internationalization such as the economic size of the issuing country and FX turnover of the currency, as a measure of the means of payment function, but also institutional quality, are the major determinants of local currency external debt. This variable defined as the share of local currency external debt to the total external debt is a way to quantify the original sin phenomenon and is also a measure of the function store of value (Kenen, 1983; Krugman, 1984). Consequently, we supported the existence of network effects, both through economic size, as shown in the literature, but also between two functions of a currency. These network effects, which have been identified in a linear empirical framework, would, however, deserve to be further explored in a nonlinear empirical framework given the positive externalities they generate. Positive externalities, by definition, can indeed amplify the impact of some determinants. Previous studies have also shown nonlinear effects of the use of a currency in one of its functions (Lee, 2014 for the international reserve currency; Lai & Yu, 2015 for trade invoicing; He & Yu, 2016 for foreign exchange turnover). These analyses are based on steady-state equilibrium projections and predictions of the evolution of certain determinants (GDP share in world GDP, trade share in world trade, and financial depth), grounded on different empirical specifications (panel with GMM, OLS, and sometimes with the inclusion of the squared term of an explicative variable). However, the nonlinear aspects are only considered graphically (scatter plots that show convex relations) and not in a nonlinear econometric model. Their works lead to a broad/rough determination of a threshold point at which the dynamic evolution begins to accelerate. For example, Lee (2014) indicates that the renminbi, the Chinese currency, could make up between 3 and 12% of foreign exchange reserves in 2035 once its GDP share in the world GDP is above 25%.Footnote 3 Our approach goes further to understand how the dynamics of network effects impact original sin. Following these studies, we propose to adopt a nonlinear empirical framework to investigate the determinants of the function store of value (apprehended by the share of local currency external debt) and define the existence of a threshold at which currency internationalization accelerates the issuance of local currency debt and purchase by foreign investors. Our article focuses on a panel of 12 emerging countries, and our database consists of quarterly data over the period between 2005Q4 and 2018Q3. We use two complementary empirical methodologies to shed light on the dynamics of the determinants of original sin linked to the internationalization process of emerging currencies. First, we explore a multiplicative interaction model to capture the behavior of the main determinants and their impact on the ability of emerging countries to issue debt in local currency. This empirical strategy allows us to focus on the interaction process of the main determinants and to estimate their conditional or marginal effects (following Alfaro et al., 2004; Brambor et al., 2006; Hainmueller et al., 2019; Tran et al., 2020). Second, we implement a dynamic panel threshold model to check for the existence of a threshold in the relationship currency internationalization–original sin following the approach of Kremer et al. (2013) and Baum et al. (2013) and as in Osei and Kim (2020). Our results of the multiplicative interaction analysis and the estimated marginal effects show nonlinear amplifying effects for the Economic size of emerging countries and the FX turnover of their currency, with a stronger impact on the original sin phenomenon as Economic size or the FX turnover increases. Moreover, the quality of institutions in emerging countries also plays an important role in this dynamic. Indeed, the impact of Economic size and FX turnover is actually stronger as institutional quality improves. When we explore threshold methodology, we find a nonlinear role for Economic size and the Governance index with an accelerating effect on the share of local currency external debt. Finally, the inertia phenomenon is a strong result regardless of the specification. This phenomenon reflects foreign investors’ habits when buying bonds from year to year and that the difficulty for emerging countries is to issue in their own currency for the first time. The contribution of our article to the literature is threefold. First, we implement two complementary methodologies–multiplicative interaction and dynamic panel threshold models–that, to the best of our knowledge, have never been adopted for the analysis of the currency internationalization process and the determinants of the function store of value. These approaches allow us to deepen our comprehension of the currency internationalization process—original sin relationship and emphasize its nonlinear nature. Second, we highlight three main determinants that crucially intervene in this dynamic of nonlinearities. Economic size and FX turnover, at the origin of network effects in the literature, and institutional quality, which the literature highlights for local currency securities issuance, are now identified as factors of nonlinearities. Third, our results can be expressed in terms of recommendations. It seems essential for emerging countries to improve their economic size and governance as they become financially integrated. Indeed, these determinants, as supply factors, are relevant to them for both issuing bonds in local currency and stimulating demand from foreign investors for these emerging market securities. As the quality of institutions amplifies the role of these main determinants, enhancing the regulatory quality and governance effectiveness is all the more important for attracting foreign lenders. The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the data. In Sect. 3, we explain the empirical strategy. The results are analyzed in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes the paper.",1

In particular, Goal 2 “Zero hunger” calls for ending hunger and ensuring “access by all people to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round” (UN, 2015, Target 2.1). This specific target is mainly measured through the percentage of undernourished population (SDG Indicator 2.1.1, UN, 2019b)Footnote 2 and is highly interconnected to the other SDGs through important synergies (Fader et al., 2018; UN, 2019a). Since the beginning of the new millennium remarkable improvements have been recorded in the prevalence of undernourishment, with most countries now presenting lower percentages than at the beginning of the 2000s (see also Fig. 1). However, in absolute terms, the number of undernourished people is increasing again and, currently, nearly 768 million people (corresponding to 9.9% of the world population) suffer from hunger globally. Moreover, the first FAO’s estimates suggested that the Covid-19 pandemic could have caused an additional 83–132 million people in the ranks of the undernourished (FAO et al., 2020). The outbreak is also causing important changes in global food supply chains and in the agricultural trade policies of many countries, which resorted to temporary export restrictions (FAO, 2020; Kerr, 2020; WTO, 2020). These figures pose challenges related to all dimensions of food security (food availability, food accessibility, food utilization, and stability: FAO et al., 2020) and to the resilience of food systems (Béné, 2020; Hansen et al., 2020). Source: Own elaborations on FAO data Prevalence of undernourishment (2001–2016). This created further constraints to free trade along with the US-China trade war and the subsequent resurgence of protectionism (Fajgelbaum et al., 2020). While trade policies are considered strategic to shape national food systems and promote food security, the ultimate impact of trade openness on hunger is still highly debated. Moreover, the empirical evidence is relatively scarce and fragmented if compared to the large literature about the effects of trade on economic growth, poverty, inequality and other aspects of development (see Ravallion, 2018; Irwin, 2019; Lechthaler & Mileva, 2019; Ramirez-Rondàn et al., 2020). Most of the literature on food security and trade, in fact, is either qualitative (see, for example, FAO, 2015) or mainly focused on very specific aspects—such as agricultural prices (among others, Flachsbarth & Garrido, 2014; Headey, 2011)—or on single countries (Davalos et al., 2020; Dorosh & Rashid, 2013; Dorosh et al., 2009; Montalbano et al., 2018; Porteous, 2017). Only recently two important cross-country studies have aimed to estimate the average impact that trade openness has on food security. On a panel of 151 developed and developing countries (1980–2007), Dithmer and Abdulai (2017) find that trade openness is positively related to both average dietary energy and diversity. Mary (2019) better delineates the scope of the analysis by only focusing on developing countries and distinguishing between the effects of food and non-food trade. Using a sample of 52 developing countries (1990–2013), he finds that food trade openness is positively related to undernourishment prevalence. In general, while these studies represent important contributions to depict the impact of trade on food security at a macro level, their results do not fully converge and there is still large room for further investigation. Using a sample of 81 developing countries over the period 2001–2016 and principally focusing on the prevalence of undernourishment (SDG Indicator 2.1.1, UN, 2019b), our study aims at providing new empirical evidence and contributes to the debate in four ways. First, it starts by estimating the impact of total trade openness disentangling the effects that pass through changes in real per capita income—i.e. the effects on the economic access to food-from the residual effects that it directly has on the other dimensions of food security. Second, since these latter effects seem to prevail, the paper further deepens the focus by concentrating on food trade and, specifically, on cereals trade. The importance of focusing on cereals trade is based on the relevance of staple food in the overall calorie intake as well as in food trade (Brooks & Mattews, 2015; Traverso & Schiavo, 2020; Wright, 2012) and in related restrictions, as shown by the centrality of cereals in recent export bans (Porteous, 2017). Third, the paper explores the different effects of cereals trade in terms of imports and exports. The two sides of trade can in fact have diverging effects on food security, as it will be discussed in Sect. 2. For example, based on economic theory, imports can impact on undernourishment through food inflows and changes in domestic food markets caused by higher competition and lower prices, while exports can give rise to food outflows and changes in income due to greater access to global markets and higher prices. This can also be reflected in a different effect of trade in net cereals-importing and exporting countries. To this purpose, after estimating the main models for the full sample, the analysis is separately carried out for the two groups of countries.Footnote 3Fourth, from a methodological point of view, by taking inspiration from Romalis (2007), the analysis accounts for potential endogeneity by instrumenting trade openness with the trade openness of the rest of the world, after its validity is discussed and tested in Sect. 3. The paper is structured as follows. Drawing from the existing micro and macro literature, Sect. 2 theoretically discusses the potential positive and negative effects that trade can have on the different dimensions of food security. Section 3 describes data and methodology. Section 4 presents the empirical results, while Sect. 5 concludes and points out the policy implications.",2

Lower transport costs and new information technology have enabled industries to divide the manufacturing process into multiple parts, each of which fabricates a tradable output. Consequently, some production steps are offshored to benefit from international price differences. Specifically, relatively labor-intensive parts are moved to low-wage countries, whereas human-capital-intensive inputs are manufactured in high-wage countries (e.g., Carluccio et al., 2019). The resulting international value chain exploits comparative advantages through greater specialization in particular sets of tasks in source and destination countries. For the domestic labor market, this development emphasizes two counteracting forces. On the one hand, importing inputs substitutes for tasks formerly performed by domestic workers and thus places pressure on associated wages. On the other hand, it also reduces an industry's costs and boosts its productivity. Therefore, the industry's output expands, which, in turn, increases the demand for the remaining tasks in more specialized production and raises associated wages (Grossman & Rossi-Hansberg, 2008, 2012). In essence, any analysis of labor effects needs to consider the tasks substituted by imported inputs and the tasks that are allocated to complementary production. Assuming that high-wage countries are skill abundant and specialize in particular human-capital-intensive goods, offshoring to these countries has different effects in terms of job substitution than offshoring to low-wage countries. Motivated by a steep increase in historically small trade flows (Fig. 1, or Krugman 2000), these effects have been the subject of fruitful discussion in recent decades. The literature has largely reached consensus that when not considering the characteristics of offshore production, offshoring lowers the relative demand for onshore workers without a college degree or for jobs with routine task profiles (e.g., Feenstra & Hanson, 1999; Becker et al., 2013; Baumgarten et al., 2013; Ebenstein et al., 2014; Hummels et al., 2014; Dauth et al., 2021).Footnote 1 Disagreement persists about the effects of offshored labor that is human-capital intensive, which is particularly surprising since the bulk of offshoring is between high-income countries and this type of trade has increased dramatically (Fig. 1). While Hummels et al. (2014, p. 1618 ff.) find a negative impact of offshoring to high-income countries on the Danish wages of low-skilled workers or routine jobs, Ebenstein et al. (2014, p. 588) reveal a positive wage impact on routine jobs in the US. Additionally, Mion & Zhu (2013) provide evidence from Belgian firms showing that imports from OECD countries negatively impact these firms' share of highly educated workers. Offshoring Intensity by Destination Region in German Manufacturing. Source: I-O Tables of the Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Fachserie 18, Reihe 2, Years: 1996–2007) and WIOT (2013), (Timmer et al., 2015). Notes: Offshoring intensity in German manufacturing is defined as the ratio of imported, intra-industry inputs relative to output. The left panel depicts region-specific offshoring from 1996 to 2007. The right panel displays the same shares less their 1996 values. From 1996 to 2002, offshoring to Central and Eastern Europe and offshoring to Western Europe increased by approximately 0.8 percentage points. As sudden access to CEECs also poses a supply shock from the perspective of (other) Western European countries, the expansion of offshoring to Western Europe constitutes a remarkable increase These studies show that it is essential to distinguish the type of labor in onshore and offshore (the type/origin of imported inputs) production when estimating the heterogeneous impact of offshoring on wages. In earlier studies, onshore labor has been distinguished by a worker's education, whereas more contemporary works, such as Autor & Handel (2013), have shown that a job's task profile is more relevant when estimating wage compensation. Moreover, the task approach is used to distinguish labor by the costs of moving the job offshore, a characteristic that Blinder (2009) has named offshorability. In a more recent contribution, Blinder & Krueger (2013) find that well-paid workers and college graduates tend to hold jobs with higher offshorability and that they perform rather nonroutine tasks (e.g., mathematicians or programmers who can directly transfer their output via the Internet). While offshorable jobs are indeed prone to substitution with offshore labor (Goos et al., 2014), this vulnerability seems to be at odds with the fact that they are also the main gainers in terms of wages (e.g., Baumgarten et al., 2013). It is therefore doubtful whether the costs of moving a job offshore are the proper proxy for the manufacturing industry. In this sector, virtually every job is offshorable, as its tasks create a tangible good that can be sent to other regions (Blinder, 2006, p. 120). Then, the determining factor may again be the countries' comparative advantage in the production of goods that intensively require a specific set of tasks or type of labor. Regarding the wage effect of offshoring, these task inputs will then determine the substitutability of jobs. The present paper makes important contributions to the existing literature in several regards. First, it adds to Baumgarten et al. (2013) and distinguishes offshoring with respect to the income level of its destination to approximate the human-capital intensity in imported inputs. New stylized facts show that these imports have crucially distinct effects on factor intensity in production. Complex-task intensive industries offshore to high-income countries and become less complex-task intensive over time, while the opposite is true for offshoring to low-income countries. Second, this paper combines existing complexity indices by Becker et al. (2013) and Brändle & Koch (2017), so that a single measure is able to distinguish groups of heterogeneous labor that respond differently to the substituting and complementary forces of typical inputs from high- or low-wage countries. Third, this paper sheds light on the underexplored topic on wage effects of offshoring to other high-income countries. Using an instrumental variable (IV) approach, this paper finds that offshoring to high-income countries has negative wage effects for complex jobs, while it positively affects wages for simple jobs. The detailed analysis is feasible, because this study merges rich administrative data on workers in the West German manufacturing sector during the 1995-2007 period with plant-level information, micro-level data on tasks from the German Qualification and Career Survey (BIBB-IAB work survey), and offshoring data from federal input-output tables. To quantify the wage effects for very nuanced types of labor, I use an index of job complexity, which builds on data from the BIBB-IAB work survey and combines a wide variety of job information about the versatility of tasks, performance requirements (such as responsibility), and the required level of various skills and abilities (similar to Ottaviano et al., 2013). Across manufacturing jobs, the index is not intended to approximate the costs of moving a specific task set offshore; rather, it approximates the relative human-capital intensity (e.g., skill, knowledge, and abilities) imparted in production at a fine occupational level. The measure for offshoring intensity uses data from the German Federal Statistical Office, which—in contrast to UN Comtrade data or the World Input-Output Tables—directly record the industries' imports of inputs or purchases from a domestic supplier. Combining this source with the WIOT distinguishes offshoring destinations with respect to their income levels and approximates the complexity-intensity of imported inputs (see Table 1). Thereby, the paper focuses on Germany's most prominent destinations for vertical integration and groups them into economically relatively homogeneous units: the (human-)capital intensive European Union in the late 1990s (EU15) and the labor-intensive Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs).Footnote 2 How does offshoring to these country groups impacts changes in the price of occupational task bundles? This question is answered by estimating Mincer-type wage equations, at which wages are determined at the industry or occupation level. Specifically, the large employer-employee dataset makes it possible to include worker-plant, occupation, and plant-year fixed effects to extract offshoring's wage impact within worker-plant matches while capturing endogenous plant-specific shocks (e.g., the exporter wage premium and new technology) of heterogeneous firms (e.g., Melitz, 2003) and asynchronous offshoring decisions within industries. Despite the multidimensional fixed effects, wages and offshoring remain simultaneously determined, for example, because offshoring affects wages and wages affect the vulnerability to offshoring (e.g., offshoring activities could be more likely in relatively high-wage industries or occupations). This will bias the estimated coefficient of the causal wage impact of offshoring on wages. The analysis remedies these concerns by applying an IV regression, which extracts the exogenous variation in the offshoring variables. The choice of instruments builds on Autor et al. (2013), Baumgarten et al. (2013) and Hummels et al. (2014). It includes time-varying and region-specific instruments to suit the analysis with multiple trade partners. Accordingly, it utilizes the intermediate goods export supply of Germany's main offshoring destinations to other high-income countries. In the presence of the numerous fixed effects, these instruments depict an exogenous source of variation that is correlated with offshoring but independent of the wage-setting process in Germany. The results confirm that offshoring has heterogeneous wage effects for manufacturing jobs that differ in complexity. Simple jobs benefit in terms of higher wage increases if domestic production expands the use of inputs from high-wage countries (EU15), while the relative wages of complex jobs suffer. Conversely, imported inputs from low-wage countries raise the wages of complex jobs but lower the wages of simple jobs. The overall effect adds up to a 4.2 percent increase in wages for a job with high complexity, while a low-complexity job sees a 3.9 percent decrease in wages. Germany is a very suitable case to explore the wage effects of region-specific offshoring, particularly in the late 1990s and 2000s. First, the country is very representative because it is Europe's largest economy. Second, it ranks among the countries with the highest trade volumes worldwide and experienced a steep rise in offshoring intensity in the late 1990s and 2000s (less though in the 2010s, see Figure C1 in the appendix).Footnote 3 Third, the fall of the Iron Curtain placed the country in a central position between an established trade bloc of high-wage, human-capital intensive countries in the west, the EU15, and low-wage, labor intensive countries in the east, that is, the CEECs (see, e.g., groupwise differences in the share of high-skilled workers in labor share in Table 1). Suddenly, Germany's geographic position became excellent to exploit international price differences within a short distance. This feature together with other political developments, that I describe in the following, vastly reduced the costs of offshoring and paved the way for the expansion of international value chains. Eastward, the formerly separated CEECs featured relatively similar industrial and educational structures at substantially lower labor costs.Footnote 4Footnote 5 This phenomenon placed the German economy in a more competitive environment that was bolstered by several reductions in trade costs: In the early 1990s, the CEECs signed association agreements with the EU, which vastly cut tariffs. Trade flows, however, did not substantially increase until EU accession talks began in 1997. These negotiations endorsed the market system and institutions of the newly established democracies and, hence, gradually stabilized the investment climate. Moreover, it gave rise to the installation of foreign affiliates, even before these countries entered the EU in 2004. With these firms bringing in new production technology from their parent companies (Dustmann et al., 2014), the internal productivity and international competitiveness of suppliers in the CEECs rose steeply, resulting in vast expansions of imports from those regions to Germany. Simultaneously, the EU politically reinforced the value chains among the EU15 countries. Beyond the already existing advantages of a customs union, the EU suppressed internal nontariff barriers by harmonizing regulations, laws, standards, and economic practices. European infrastructure projects and the establishment of the Schengen Area in 1995 lowered the costs of transportation, e.g., through new cross-border roads or time savings due to the abandonment of border controls. Furthermore, in 1999, the introduction of a common currency, the euro, abolished exchange rate fluctuations. Together, these measures vastly reduced the costs of offshoring. How these events come along with offshoring from Germany to these destinations is depicted in Fig. 1. It clearly shows that offshoring to the EU15 exhibits substantially higher offshoring intensities than to any other country group. From 1996 to 2007, the share of inputs from the EU15 relative to industry output in Germany grew by 0.91 percentage points, or 25 percent of its initial value (Table C1 in the appendix). The right panel emphasizes the increasing relevance of CEECs as offshoring destinations. While this country group exhibits low initial values of economic integration with Germany, from 1996 to 2007, offshoring to these countries increased by 1.1 percentage points, or 318 percent.Footnote 6 While the German goods market is characterized by large and growing trade volumes, the increase in output demand did not immediately translate into growth of the labor market. In fact, the labor market has instead been characterized by rather high rates of unemployment and wage polarization.Footnote 7 It seems that the evolution of trade comes along with a change in the demand for (or the marginal product of) certain types of labor. Wage Divergence between Terciles of Job Complexity. Source: BIBB-IAB Work Survey, LIAB. Notes: Indexed wage growth of terciles of the task index, West Germany, manufacturing, 1996–2007, 85 percent sample Figure 2 illustrates the divergence in average real wages for the terciles of the complexity distribution. It reveals that income growth is unequally distributed and varies by job complexity. While the wages of complex jobs rise by 13 percent, the compensation for intermediate jobs rises by approximately 8 percent, and wages of simple jobs increase by less than 5 percent.Footnote 8 The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the various datasets employed in the analysis. Then, Sect. 3 explains the estimating equation and the identification strategy for the empirical analysis. Section 4 compiles the results, which are checked for robustness in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",1
159,2,Review of World Economics,28 June 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-022-00472-3,Does import competition drive productivity growth? Evidence from Hungary’s pre-accession import tariffs,May 2023,Franklin Maduko,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"How do manufacturing firms react when faced with increased competition from imports? Do they tend to eliminate inefficiencies in order to be competitive when faced with such competition? While most existing papers focus on the effects of exporting or imported intermediate inputs on firm-level outcomes,Footnote 1 only very few papers have studied the effect of increased competition from imports. An example is De Loecker (2011), which studied the effect of import competition, arising from import quota reduction, on efficiency of Belgian textile manufacturers. However, it is not clear whether import competition arising from tariffs reduction will be similar to that arising from quota reduction, as tariffs reduction reduces trade costs which may have a direct impact on market prices. Additionally, it is also not clear whether the effect of import competition on firms in a developed country (i.e. Belgium) will be the same as the case of an emerging economy. Another issue with most existing studies is with the method productivity is estimated from sales revenue data. Most papersFootnote 2 typically rely on productivity estimates from a revenue production function as sales quantity is unobserved. In these studies, firm-level prices are unobserved, so firm-level sales revenue is deflated using an industry price index and used as the dependent variable in the productivity estimation. This leads to estimates of efficiency with two shortcomings (Levinsohn & Melitz, 2002; De Loecker, 2011). First, the coefficients of the inputs may be biased if the price error defined as the difference between a firm’s price and the industry’s price index is correlated with any production input. This price error is expected to be larger in industries with larger scope of product differentiation. Second, even if this bias is absent, the productivity estimates will reflect true efficiency and components of unobserved prices and demand conditions which may bias the true productivity. In this paper, we offer two contributions to the literature. First, we study the impact of the gradual reduction in import tariffs charged on EU imports on manufacturing firm’s efficiency in Hungary during the period (1996–2003) leading to Hungary’s accession into the EU. Second, we propose an empirical model that offers less noisy estimates of productivity from revenue data, thus improving on the drawbacks from revenue productivity already mentioned above. The proposed model nests De Loecker (2011) empirical modelFootnote 3 and revenue productivity model, and we show that each of these models is a special case of our framework under certain conditions, thus offering a more general empirical model for estimating physical productivity from revenue data. The key difference between our model and De Loecker (2011) is that we extend their framework by integrating both the domestic and foreign markets demand conditions (i.e. foreign and domestic demand shocks) to the supply function of the firm, while De Loecker (2011) makes no distinction between foreign and domestic demand shock. This is particularly important given the recent empirical evidence on the strong relationship between exporting and firm-level prices (Garcia-Marin and Voigtländer, 2019). Infact, we show that neglecting the export markets may bias productivity estimates for exporters.Footnote 4 Our paper offers better identification of the effects of import competition on productivity. Unlike other similar studies that identify tariffs at the industry level and argues for exogeneity of tariffs, we identify import tariffs at the firm-product level. In reality, it is difficult to argue that average industry level tariffs negotiations are exogenous (i.e. not influenced by industrial policies, or lobbying by organized sectors etc.), so we leverage on our approach by constructing firm-level exposure to tariffs on imports from the EU and control for time-varying industry effects. This is necessary in our setting for two reasons. First, since export and import tariffs are likely correlated at the industry-level (Trefler, 2004), the industry-year fixed effects, controls for the industry-level export and import tariffs at the 2-digit level. Second, it is possible that some industries received subsidies during this period or were protected due to political lobbying or other unobserved considerations. Thus, our approach enables us control for unobserved time-varying industry effects which may bias our results. By applying our empirical model, we recover the productivity estimates which we call quality-adjusted productivity (QA productivity).Footnote 5 For comparison, we also recover revenue productivity and productivity from De Loecker (2011) model. Our findings imply that a 10 percentage point reduction in import tariffsFootnote 6 increase QA productivity by 1.40%. We show that De Loecker (2011) model offers a more precise estimate of the effect of import competition on productivity than revenue productivity; however, both models overstate this effect when compared to our framework. Our empirical model consists of conventional variables (labour, capital, material inputs) and a proxy for unobserved firm-level prices—domestic market share in its industry. We verify that our price proxy replicates similar pattern in studies that observe firm-level prices. In the spirit of Foster et al. (2008), we examine the correlation between our price proxy, revenue productivity and quality-adjusted productivity. While we find a strong positive correlation between our proxy for prices and revenue productivity, the correlation between the proxy and quality-adjusted productivity is negative, consistent with Foster et al. (2008) in their study for the US. We begin our analysis in Sect. 2 where we present our simple empirical setup and derive a new structural econometric equation for the estimation of productivity from revenue data. We consider the demand side of a two-country world—home and foreign with a representative consumer in each that faces a standard CES utility function and chooses varieties to consume subject to a budget constraint. The usual demand system for each variety emerges which depends negatively on the price and positively on quality of the variety. On the supply side, we consider a firm which produces with a Cobb-Douglas technology, sells in the domestic market and then decides whether to export. The firm’s problem is to choose prices in domestic and export markets (if it exports). We derive the total revenue that emerges in equilibrium and show how to recover productivity. Our productivity estimate is the conventional revenue productivity adjusted with the domestic market share of the firm within its industry. In Sect. 3, we present our data and discuss several cleaning procedures and restrictions on our sample. We also provide detailed descriptive statistics of the datasets. While in Sect. 4, we estimate our empirical model, the standard revenue productivity model, and De Loecker (2011) model using standard proxy methods pioneered by Olley and Pakes (1996) and extended in Levinsohn and Petrin (2000) and Ackerberg et al. (2015) (henceforth OP, LP and ACF respectively). In Sect. 5, we estimate the effect of the reduction in import tariffs charged on EU imports on the efficiency of Hungarian manufacturing firms. One of the main strengths of our methodology is that we construct variations in tariffs at the firm-level. By doing this, we are able to control for possible unobserved time-varying industry (NACE 2 digits) effects that jointly affect average industry tariffs and productivity. However, our analysis in this section poses a potential shortcoming. We focus only on exporters because we do not observe products sold by non-exporters. So, we assume that products sold in the export markets are the same as those sold in the domestic market. If exporters have different product mix in the export and domestic markets, it is likely that such patterns exist at a highly disaggregated level of product definition.Footnote 7. This assumption is not likely a concern given the evidence that firms sell same products, but of different quality (taste) across markets (Manova and Zhang, 2012; Crozet et al., 2012). We identify the tariffs faced by a firm by computing the simple average of the tariffs on products the firm produced and sold in the domestic market in each period,Footnote 8 and employ two empirical strategies. The first strategy is a direct method as in Fernandes (2007) where we estimate the effect of tariffs on productivity directly in a single production function estimation.Footnote 9 The second strategy which we call the two-step approach follows a non-parametric form where we start with estimating the productivity as residuals from a production function estimation and then we project the productivity estimates on tariffs while controlling for some variables of interest as discussed later. We sum up the discussions in Sect. 6 and provide additional information and results in both the online appendix and supplementary online appendix. We build on the vast and growing literature on production function estimation at the firm level. Starting with Olley and Pakes (1996) (OP) which shows how to control for the simultaneity bias when estimating production functions by relying on investments as proxy for unobserved productivity. Given the lumpy nature of investment data, Levinsohn and Petrin (2000) (LP) showed that material inputs (which are less lumpy) could be used as proxy for productivity in the Olley and Pakes (1996) framework. Their work has been extended by Ackerberg et al. (2015) (ACF) which argued that the coefficient of labor cannot be identified in the first stage of OP and LP framework and shows how to identify labor in the second stage. Other literatures have proposed an adjustment to this framework. For example, Bond and Söderbom ((2005)) have shown (for the Cobb-Douglas production function) that under the scaler unobservable assumptions in the LP and OP framework, using gross output function cannot identify coefficients of perfectly variable inputs without input price variation except further assumptions are imposed. Thus, they propose estimation of a value-added production function. De Loecker (2013) suggests including lagged export dummy in the productivity process of the OP and LP procedure, as lag of export status may be correlated with lag of productivity. These literatures typically rely on deflating sales revenue with industry price index which poses a threat to identification of production inputs and may bias productivity estimates in industries with high scope of product differentiation. Relative to these literatures, we propose a new production function estimation equation that controls for unobserved prices and demand shifters. Our paper is not the first to integrate the demand-side of the economy to the supply-side in estimating a production function. Klette and Griliches (1996) developed the framework to integrate the demand-side with the supply-side of the economy, thus, addressing the problems caused by deflated sales proxy for firm-level production function estimation in differentiated products. Their focus was on estimating the returns to scale and not productivity. Levinsohn and Melitz (2002) build on this framework, to obtain and interpret credible estimates of productivity. They show that productivity estimates based solely on sales revenue are bias as they reflects price and demand shifters, however they offer no application to their procedure. De Loecker (2011) is the first to apply this methodology in the study of the effect of quota reduction on efficiency of Belgian textile manufacturers. Their estimating equation is a reduced form expression of deflated sales revenue on production inputs (capital, labour and materials), industry output, unobserved demand shifter and productivity. They recover the elasticity of substitution from the coefficient of industry output which they use to back-out quantity productivity from their reduced-form estimates of productivity. Their framework assumes that the unobserved demand shifter can be summarised by a product and sector fixed effect, a proxy for prices and an unobserved error term which they assume to be exogenous. They exploit the multi-products nature of their data and construct a proxy for prices which reflects the extent to which a firm is exposed to the rapid easing of quotas in the EU during the period 1994 to 2002. They find that their methodology predicts weaker effect of trade liberalization on firm-level productivity compared to revenue productivity. Relative to these papers, we offer a general framework for addressing this problem of unobserved prices. Our model nests De Loecker (2011)’s model and shows that their main estimating equation is a special case of ours under the assumption that firms do not export. By allowing for exporting, we show that our estimating equation is equivalent to De Loecker (2011) model with an additional term which reflects the firms’ export intensity. Unlike their framework, ours do not rely on estimates of the industry elasticity of substitution or precise observation of industry output variable to back out physical productivity. Our paper is also related to Rho and Rodrigue (2016). The main similarity is that both papers estimate a model-consistent productivity under the assumption that firms endogenously respond to idiosyncratic demand shocks in the foreign market. While their paper focuses on understanding the impact of investment on exporting, we focus on how increased import competition faced by firms affects physical productivity. In addition, they normalize domestic demand shocks to one, while we assume it to be different across firms and time. This is important in our setting as our objective is to investigate the relationship between firm-level variation in domestic demand shocks and productivity. Demidova et al. (2012) use a similar estimation approach as ours in studying the effects of productivity and country-specific export demand shocks on export destination. While theirs introduces destination-specific export demand shocks non-parametrically in their material function, we incorporate both domestic and export demand shocks addressed to a firm in a structural empirical model. Besides, our focus is different from theirs. While we are interested in a more precise estimate of productivity and how import competition impacts it, they focus on the effects of interaction between productivity and country-specific export demand shocks on a firm’s export destination. Our paper is also related to Foster et al. (2008) which investigates the distinction between quantity and revenue productivity. In their framework, they observed both physical output and sales revenue at the firm level in addition to input variables. They estimate quantity and revenue productivity and perform a number of comparative analysis between their estimates. One finding that emerges from their study is that the correlation between plant prices and revenue productivity is positive with a correlation coefficient of 0.16, however this correlation with physical productivity is negative with a coefficient of \(-0.54\). The findings in our paper is consistent with theirs. Our proxy for prices is negatively correlated with quality-adjusted productivity and positively correlated with revenue productivity. The similarity between both findings supports the notion that revenue productivity may reflect rising firm-level prices and also implies that domestic market shares of a firm within its industry is strongly correlated with unobserved prices. This paper is also related to the vast and growing literature studying the impact of trade liberalization on productivity of firms (Topalova and Khandelwal, 2011)—Indian firms; Fernandes (2007)—Colombian firms; Lileeva and Trefler (2010)—Canadian firms; Bustos (2011)—Argentine firms; De Loecker et al. (2016)—Indian firms; Trefler (2004)—Canadian firms; among many). Some of these papers use either revenue productivity (Topalova and Khandelwal 2011; Fernandes 2007) or labor productivity (Trefler, 2004) and find a positive effect of trade liberalization on productivity. We argue that using revenue productivity may overestimate the effect of trade liberalization, and we introduce a methodology that corrects for this potential bias. A number of recent studies have analyzed the impact of import competition on firm-level or firm-product efficiency (Bräuer et al., 2019)—German manufacturing firms; Dhyne et al. (2017)—Belgian manufacturing firms; etc.). In these studies, import competition is measured as a firm’s exposure to imports of similar products that they manufacture; and find efficiency gains from import competition. We differ from these studies in the measurement of import competition and a focus on an emerging economy. Shu and Steinwender (2019) provide a detailed review of the empirical literature on the impact of trade shocks (import competition, export opportunities, access to imported intermediate inputs, and foreign input competition) on firm-level efficiency. Some other studies analyzed the effect of import competition on product quality and prices such as Amiti and Khandelwal (2013) and Bas and Strauss-Kahn (2015); both find a positive effect of import competition on quality upgrading. McManus and Schaur (2016) find a positive effect of import competition on workplace injury rates in the US. Our paper differs as we focus on physical productivity. This work is also related to Khandelwal (2010). Both papers use market shares as proxy for quality conditional on pricesFootnote 10 and investigate different questions. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to consider the effect of foreign demand shocks on firm-level productivity estimates using sales revenue data.",

159,2,Review of World Economics,24 August 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-022-00474-1,Time changing effects of external shocks on macroeconomic fluctuations in Peru: empirical application using regime-switching VAR models with stochastic volatility,May 2023,Paulo Chávez,Gabriel Rodríguez,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"External shocks on Latin American developing economies, like Peru, are considered the main source of variability in output fluctuations, according to Izquierdo et al. (2008). Greater trade and financial integration in recent years has magnified this effect in countries that depend heavily on commodity exports. Since the 1990s, several financial crises, the commodity supercycle, and China’s high growth (and subsequent deceleration) have been the object of intense study and a source of concern in academia; see Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2013), Gruss (2014), and Bing et al. (2019). In this context, a crucial issue is the severity of external shock effects on macroeconomic variables in boom-bust cycles; see Calvo et al. (1993). This evolving international environment has led policymakers to revise their responses over time via new instruments or even institutional changes related to the role of monetary and fiscal authorities. Peru’s case is relevant, given its role as a major supplier of metal commodities to industrialized economies like China and the U.S. Moreover, with sound macroeconomic indicators resulting from fiscal and monetary discipline (IMF 2020), Peru has become an attractive destination for international investors. At the same time, in this context, fluctuations in domestic aggregate variables are exposed to shocks from various sources: (i) real or external demand shocks, mainly from the U.S. and China, Peru’s main trading partners; (ii) the financial channel; i.e., movements in the international interest rate affecting investment returns and financial costs; and (iii) nominal or commodity price shocks; i.e., movements in the prices of Peru’s exports and imports. The stylized facts for Peru’s economy show a growing level of trade integration. Peru’s trade as a percentage of GDP was around 32.5% in 1994-2002 and 49% in 2002-2018. China and the U.S. are the main destinations for Peru’s exports (27% and 16% of total exports in 2018, respectively). Total exports can be broken down mainly into commodities and intermediate goods (50% and 32% in 2018, respectively). Additionally, Peru’s de factoFootnote 1 and de jureFootnote 2 financial integration indicators have performed well. Total external assets (excluding reserves and external liabilities) as percentage of GDP were around 88% in 1994-2008 and 106% in 2009-2018. The de jure financial openness indicator shows that Peru has respected free capital movements since 1997. In contrast with China’s predominance in the trade channel, the U.S. is Peru’s main portfolio investment destination and its main source of direct investment. In this context, movements in the Fed policy rate have implications for Peru’s security market and financing costs for new investment projects. Regarding the nominal channel, commodity prices evolved exponentially in 2000-2014, with a cumulative 72% increase in the S &P GSCI. Cumulative growth for metal commodities (mainly copper) was 235% over that period, mainly driven by the industrial push in countries like China and India. Exports of other commodities, like gold, silver, and zinc, also grew considerably. This study seeks to examine empirically the effect and evolution of external shocks and their transmission to output growth, inflation, and the interest rate in Peru. Our specification considers three transmission channels (real demand, the financial channel, and the nominal channel). The period of analysis is 1994Q1-2019Q4, which captures a number of international events, like the 1998 and 2008 crises and the Asian and Russian financial crises, as well as episodes of high domestic uncertainty caused by the 2001 political crisis and the 2006 and 2011 presidential elections.Footnote 3 This period of analysis also captures the adoption of inflation targeting (IT) by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) in 2002. In sum, evolving developments throughout Peru’s recent history tend to modify the underlying economic parameters. For instance, global financial integration has increased over time, thereby exacerbating Peru’s exposure to external shocks. In our view, a VAR methodology with regime-switching and stochastic volatility (RS-VAR-SV), following Chan and Eisenstat (2018), properly addresses this issue. The results indicate that the best fit for Peru is a VAR model with constant coefficients and regime-switching variances (RS-VAR-SV-R1) instead of a traditional VAR with constant coefficients (CVAR) and other restricted RS-VAR-SV models. Additionally, we identify two regimes before and after 2002, the pre- and post-IT regimes, where the latter is more persistent. Regarding the response of domestic variables to external shocks, China’s growth has the most significant impact on domestic growth; i.e., a 1% China growth shock results in a 0.8% increase in domestic growth after one year. In contrast, a 1% surge in financial shocks has a contractionary impact on growth (a 0.3% fall after one year). Another interesting result is the increasing uncertainty around external shocks in predicting growth under regime 2; i.e., 70% of growth variability, mainly resulting from China growth shocks (34%) and commodity price shocks (30%). Regarding the historic contribution of external shocks, we underscore that the contribution of a China growth shock to the increase in domestic growth under regime 2 was considerable (89%). Moreover, the regime change shows that lower interest rates and inflation under regime 2 are explained by the moderation of monetary shocks. The remainder of the paper is divided as follows. Section 2 provides a comprehensive review of the literature on external shocks in emerging market economies (EMEs).Footnote 4 Section 3 describes the methodology used to estimate the model, the estimation algorithm, and the selection criterion proposed by Chan and Eisenstat (2018). Section 4 presents the data, the identification scheme, the priors, the selection of models, the model’s regimes, the analysis of the impulse-response functions (IRFs), the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD), and the historical decomposition (HD). Finally, Sect. 5 discusses the robustness exercises and Sect. 6 presents the conclusions.",1

Remittance flows are considered more stable than other forms of private capital flows.Footnote 1 Nevertheless, remittances exhibit a cyclical pattern. Migrant workers respond to macroeconomic conditions in both their home as well as their host economy.Footnote 2 One key driver of the business cycle in the host economy is monetary policy. Hence, monetary policy shocks should be a source of fluctuations of remittance flows. A large literature shows that if the Fed tightens its policy stance, income falls and unemployment increases. Both variables should also drive migrant workers’ ability to transfer money to their families at home. A monetary tightening of the Fed could lower the inflows of remittances, thus contributing to business cycle volatility in developing economies. We refer to this as the remittance-channel of cross-border monetary policy transmission. Against this backdrop, this paper studies the effect of US monetary policy on remittance inflows into economies in Latin America and the Caribbean. We concentrate on Latin America and the Caribbean because for our eight sample countries, the majority of oversees workers reside in the US, such that we can clearly identify the U.S. as the host economy. Since the U.S. is the main source of flows, we can treat inflows into, say, Mexico, as U.S. outflows. We use quarterly data on remittance inflows between 2000 and 2020 into Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, Jamaica and Colombia. A second criterion for the selection of countries is the availability of quarterly remittance data. We estimate a series of panel local projection models. This class of models is used widely in order to quantify the impact of US monetary policy and other shocks on business cycle variables. Hence, we draw on the established literature and investigate the sensitivity of remittance inflows to unexpected changes in US monetary conditions. As a key contribution, we find that remittance inflows are highly sensitive to monetary policy shocks. An unexpected tightening of Fed policy reduces the inflow of remittances. A policy surprise one standard deviation in size reduces the inflow of remittances by about 0.8%. Hence, monetary policy affects foreign business cycles through its effect on remittance flows. This result survives when we end the sample in 2019, i.e. before the Great Lockdown imposed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, or when we use an alternative definition of the dependent variable. We also show that the results remain unchanged if we control for natural disasters in migrants’ home countries. The impact of monetary policy is also symmetric with respect to tightening and easing shocks. We find that the response of remittance flows is similar in terms of magnitude to the response of inflows of foreign direct investment 4FDI), which is the second most important type of private capital inflows into our sample countries besides the inflow of remittances. Finally, we shed light on the role of the real exchange rate. A US policy tightening leads to a real depreciation of the dollar, which should ceteris paribus raise remittance inflows, as migrant workers need to sacrifice fewer US goods in order to transfer resources to their families in the home countries. Controlling for the response of the real exchange rate, however, leaves our key results unaffected. Hence, we establish firm evidence for an economically relevant remittance-channel of monetary policy. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: in Sect. 2, we survey the related literature. Section 3 provides stylized facts on remittance flows for our sample countries. The empirical model is introduced in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 discusses the results. Section 6 focuses on the role of the real exchange rate response for remittance flows and Sect. 7 concludes.",
159,3,Review of World Economics,02 August 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-022-00475-0,Social ties and home bias in mergers and acquisitions,August 2023,Federico Carril-Caccia,Aitor Garmendia-Lazcano,Asier Minondo,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The value of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) was multiplied by 10 between 1995 and 2019. Cross-border M&As also grew in relative terms, rising its share in foreign direct investment (FDI) from 31% in 1995 to 44% in 2019.Footnote 1 The increase in the absolute and relative size of cross-border M&As have prompted scholars to explore their determinants (di Giovanni, 2005; Neary, 2007; Head & Ries, 2008; Hijzen et al., 2008; Alviarez et al., 2020) and investigate why some firms choose this internationalization strategy over others (Nocke & Yeaple, 2007; Neary, 2009). Despite its increase, the value of M&As across borders is still lower than that within borders. Figure 1 illustrates that during the 1995–2019 period, on average, the value of domestic M&As was approximately three times larger than that of cross-border M&As. To measure whether this difference was explained by firms’ preference to acquire or merge with local firms over foreign firms, Carril-Caccia et al. (2022) estimated a gravity equation for M&A flows and determined that the number and value of within-country M&As was five times larger than between-country M&As. Value of domestic and cross-border M&As, 1995–2019 (billions of US dollars). Note: Authors’ own elaboration based on the Eikon Thomson Reuters database The goal of this paper is to explore whether social ties are positively related with M&As. Furthermore, we investigate whether social ties can explain a country’s preference to conduct M&As within their own borders. We proxy social ties with the number of friendship links between Facebook users across and within countries. We expect this variable to be strongly positively correlated with other forms of social ties and, hence, represent a good proxy for the intensity of the social linkages between two countries or regions. For brevity, in the rest of the paper, we will refer to Facebook friendship links as social ties. Combining data on the number and value of M&As with social ties between and within countries for the 2015-2019 period, we find that social ties have a strong positive correlation with the number and value of M&As. Specifically, a 10% increase in social ties raises the number and value of M&As by 5%. We further demonstrate that the home bias in M&As greatly reduces, and even disappears in some estimations, once we control for differences in social ties between and within countries. To further support our results, we exploit the fact that a firm is more likely to invest in related industries than in unrelated activities, and industries are unevenly distributed geographically in a country. We build a new social ties index that takes into account these two elements. This new index should be more powerful in explaining the industry-level M&As than the standard, population-based, social ties index. When we introduce the industry-level and the standard social ties indexes in the regression equation, we find that the former is positive and statistically significant whereas the latter is statistically insignificant. However, this result should be taken with caution. There are two caveats to the narrative that social ties facilitate M&As. First, there might be a reverse causality problem in which M&As explain social ties rather than friendship ties explaining M&As. Following similar arguments as those used in Bailey et al. (2021), we argue that the number of Facebook friendship links attributable to M&A negotiations is very small relative to the total number of friendship links. Therefore, the quantitative impact of the reverse causality should be very small. Second, the correlation between social ties and M&As might stem from an omitted variable that is positively correlated with both social ties and M&As. For example, having similar preferences can explain two countries having many Facebook friendship links and M&As. To address this concern, we analyze whether the positive relationship between social ties and M&As remains when we use more granular fixed effects. First, we regionally disaggregate our M&A flow and social ties data and re-estimate our empirical specifications with acquirer region × target country × year and acquirer country × target region × year fixed effects. These granular fixed effects control for all omitted variables specific to an acquirer country-target country-year triad. Second, using data on managers’ city of birth, we build an acquirer firm-destination region specific social ties index. This enables us to control for acquirer region-destination region specific fixed effects. In both analyses, we still find a significant positive correlation between social ties and M&As. Next, we explore the mechanisms by which social ties facilitate M&As. First, social ties allow a firm to overcome the transaction costs involved in acquiring or merging with another firm. These obstacles are larger when the institutional quality of the target country is low. Thus, social ties should be particularly important in facilitating M&A operations in those countries. We proxy institutional quality with the level of corruption and discover that social ties have a stronger positive effect on the number and value of M&As when the corruption level is high in the target country. Second, social ties provide a firm with information about a target-country’s events and government policies that might determine the value of an asset. This information source will be particularly relevant in target countries in which press freedom is limited. In line with this argument, we find that social ties have a stronger positive effect on the number and value of M&As when press freedom is limited in the target country. Third, Head and Ries (2008) argued that cultural distance increases headquarters’ costs of monitoring subsidiary managers. Additionally, M&As prompt to organizational changes that could be more difficult to implement when cultural distances are great. Social ties can reduce the cultural distance between the acquirer and target countries and therefore attenuate organizational change and monitoring costs. We classify country pairs as low-distance or high-distance pairs using Hofstede’s (1980) cultural dimensions. We determine that social ties have a stronger positive effect on the number and value of M&As the greater the cultural distance between the acquirer and target countries. Our paper contributes to the literature analyzing home bias in M&As. Mayer et al. (2010) analyzed the determinants of French firm investment during the 1992–2002 period and determined that domestic investment was 2.6 times higher than foreign investment. Umber et al. (2014) examined the border effect on cross-border M&As among European Union’s (EU) 15 countries during the 1991–2007 period and found that on average, the value of M&As within a specific EU country was six times larger than that between EU countries. Using a sample of 95 countries for the 1995-2015 period, Carril-Caccia et al. (2022) showed that the number and value of within-country M&As was five times larger than between-country M&As. We contribute to this literature by illustrating that the home bias in M&As is greatly reduced, and in many specifications disappears, when one controls for differences in social ties within and between countries. Our paper is closely related to the work of Bailey et al. (2021), who revealed that social ties positively impact trade flows. They also found that the home bias in trade decreases significantly once differences in social ties within and between countries are considered. Our work is also linked to literature that has highlighted the positive effect of social ties on FDI. Previous research has concluded that immigrants facilitate firms’ access to foreign markets by reducing the transaction costs related to cultural and institutional differences and easing access to foreign market information (Docquier & Lodigiani, 2010; De Simone & Manchin, 2012; Gao et al., 2013; Kugler & Rapoport, 2007; Burchardi et al., 2018). In a similar vein, Lien et al. (2012) showed that the establishment of the Confucius Institutes fostered Chinese FDI into developing countries. These institutes not only fostered FDI by increasing the number of non-native Chinese speakers, but also by providing market access information to Chinese investors. From a different perspective, Paniagua et al. (2017) showed that firms’ participation in online social networks could promote their internationalization, enhancing their capabilities abroad by favoring their transfer of reputation and identity and reducing the liability of their foreignness. Additionally, social networks can serve as a tool for acquiring knowledge from the host country or transferring it to subsidiaries abroad. We contribute to this literature by using a measure of social ties based on actual Facebook friendship links, as opposed to other measures such as migration which cannot ensure whether a relationship exists between the migrant and an individual in his or her homeland. Furthermore, we show that social ties facilitate M&As by smoothing the transaction costs to acquire and merge with other firms, providing additional information about events and policies that might determine the value of the target asset, and reducing the cultural distance between the acquirer and target countries. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section presents the different sets of data used in our study, explains how information on Facebook friendship links is used to build a bilateral social ties index, and presents examples of how this index varies between countries and regions. Section 3 presents the regression analyses used to estimate the impact of social ties on the number and value of bilateral M&As using country, industry, regional, and firm-level data. Section 4 explores the mechanisms by which social ties facilitate M&As. The last section concludes.",

Some studies have emphasized the risks associated with exchange rate variability, which should discourage economic agents from international trading. Other studies have emphasized that exchange rate volatility should have no impact on cross-border transactions because of the availability of instruments with which to hedge against risks of this type. The question of the effect of exchange rate variability on trade is therefore an empirical matter. The literature dealing with cross-border trade in goods and services has been rather mixed (McKenzie, 1999; Tenreyro, 2007), and, also in regard to financial markets, empirical analyses have reported controversial results (Jorion, 1991; Fidora et al., 2007; Sandoval & Vàsquez, 2009; Borensztein & Loungani, 2011; Caporale et al., 2015; Dyakov & Wipplinger, 2018). The above-mentioned literature encompasses analyses that rely on different exchange rate volatility measures, bilateral or effective exchange rates, nominal or real exchange rates, and that span different time periods and country samples.Footnote 1 The first contribution of this paper is its investigation of the impact of exchange rate volatility on financial transactions across borders in a wide perspective. Indeed, we analyze the role played by bilateral nominal and real exchange rate volatility in bilateral foreign portfolio equity investments, in 68 developed and emerging markets, in the period 2001–2017, which encompasses a pre-crisis, a crisis, and a post-crisis period. We find that exchange rate volatility negatively and significantly affected cross-border portfolio investments, when considering either nominal or real exchange rates, using either a continuous or a dichotomic definition of volatility with different time lags. The literature studying the impact of the exchange rate on cross-border trade of goods and services has identified a multi-dimensional heterogeneity in this effect. The survey by McKenzie (1999) concluded that exchange rate volatility may have a different impacts on different markets. Exchange rate volatility has been found to affect trade flows asymmetrically, with a very different impact of extremely large versus extremely small changes in volatility (Chang et al., 2020). The effect is found to be larger for smaller and developing economies (Micco et al., 2003; Baldwin, 2006; Santos Silva & Tenreyro, 2010), and to vary over time (De Sousa, 2012). In particular, Sandoval & Vàsquez (2009) highlighted an asymmetry in pricing exchange rate risk, with a small and insignificant risk premium of exchange rate exposure in up-market periods, and a significant one in down-market periods. The paper’s second contribution is therefore its search for the presence of heterogeneity in the impact of exchange rate volatility on financial markets, as already found in regard to trade of goods. Indeed, the controversial results in financial markets may hide a significant heterogeneity which might have generated an aggregation bias similar to the one found, across countries or sectors, in the trade literature (Péridy, 2003; Bahmani-Oskooee & Hegerty, 2007). The empirical evidence points to the presence of a source of heterogeneity between emerging and developed economies: the exchange rate has become more volatile in the major emerging market economies, as a consequence of the global financial stress (Coudert et al., 2011; Ilzetzki et al., 2019), while major currency exchange volatility has substantially decreased. Ilzetzki et al. (2019), for instance, demonstrate a visible secular decline in exchange rate volatility in the dollar-Deutschmark cross-rate from the end of the Bretton Woods system to 2018, despite the volatility’s counter-cyclical nature. We find that the negative association between bilateral foreign portfolio investments and the volatility of the exchange rate crucially depends upon both the time period and the groups of countries considered. Indeed, it significantly weakened after 2012—that is, after the crisis—with an especially strong and significant effect for large economies, the ones experiencing the most visible decline in exchange rate volatility. These findings may have had important implications also in regard to bilateral cross-border portfolio equity holdings within the European Monetary Union. The assumption of a negative nexus between exchange rate volatility and trade was one of the pillars of the creation of the European Monetary Union (Commission, 1990): the adoption of a common currency was indeed expected to lead to an increase in the volume of trade among member countries, as reviewed in Glick & Rose (2016).Footnote 2 Interestingly, De Sousa (2012) found that the currency union’s impact on trade was decreasing over time. Similarly, Giofré & Sokolenko (2022), for equity holdings, highlighted that the crisis has drastically weakened the linkages among the original members: a marked decline of economic development and, more importantly, a deterioration of the control of corruption standards by periphery countries, those hardest hit by the European sovereign debt crisis, induced a sharp decrease of their inward investments from the Euro area as a whole. The third contribution of the paper lies in the investigation and discussion of this specific point. We conjecture that the declining global effect of exchange rate volatility in the post-crisis period can be adduced as one of the main drivers of the fall in bilateral equity investment in the Euro area in that period. The data do not reject this hypothesis: it is indeed likely that a lower responsiveness of international investment to exchange rate volatility challenged the relevance of the full exchange risk hedging system represented by the common currency area in the post-crisis period, when the countercyclical spikes of exchange rate volatility were absorbed. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature on the linkage between exchange rate volatility and trade in goods and financial transactions. In Sect. 3, we outline the estimable equation. In Sect. 4, we describe the data and discuss some descriptive statistics. In Sect. 5, we perform the empirical analysis. Section 6 summarizes and concludes.",1

159,3,Review of World Economics,22 August 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-022-00479-w,Multiple preference regimes and rules of origin,August 2023,Kazunobu Hayakawa,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Rules of origin (RoOs) are considered a crucial factor in the low utilization of preference tariff regimes—e.g., regional trade agreements (RTAs). RoOs establish criteria to certify that exported products have originated from their exporting countries. To receive preferential treatment for tariff payments, exporting firms must comply with the RoOs within the preference regime. RoO compliance may require exporters to change their procurement sources. For example, to comply with RoOs, some exporters may be forced to switch from intermediate inputs sourced from an unqualified origin to local inputs and therefore suffer increased procurement costs. Owing to these potential cost increases, not all exporters utilize preference regimes. Indeed, some studies have reported many products for which preference utilization is extremely low or zero despite the availability of reciprocal or unilateral preference regimes (e.g., Keck and Lendle, 2012; Hayakawa et al., 2019; Sytsma, 2022). This study empirically examines the effect of RoO reform on trade. Some studies have investigated this issue by exploiting RoO reform in the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) of the European Union (EU) during 2011. Specifically, RoOs for apparel products have been relaxed from the so-called two-stage processing (or double transformation) to a single-stage processing (or single transformation) rule. The former requires that fabrics for garment manufacturing are produced within the exporting country to qualify for preferential treatment, whereas the latter imposes no restrictions on the source of materials in garment production. Tanaka (2021) found that this reform increased the total exports of apparel products from Cambodia to the EU by 112%. That is, the relaxation of RoOs has a trade creation effect. Such an effect has also been found at the firm level (Sytsma, 2022). Sytsma (2021) showed that it raised the preference utilization rates of apparel exports from the least developed countries (LDCs) to the EU. In sum, these studies have determined that the relaxation of RoOs has increased the relative magnitudes of both preference and total exports.Footnote 1 Against this backdrop, our study is a more detailed examination of the effect of RoO reform on trade. Unlike that data used in existing studies, we examine Japan’s imports of apparel products from two LDCs (i.e., Cambodia and Myanmar) from 2013 to 2018. Like the GSP of the EU, the Japanese government revised its RoOs for knitted apparel in the GSP for LDCs (GSP-LDC) from a two-stage to a single-stage processing rule in April 2015. Although existing studies have examined preference utilization rates and total exports, our study investigates the level of exports under each tariff regime—that is, the GSP-LDC or most favored nation (MFN) regime—in addition to total exports (i.e., the sum of exports under all available tariff regimes).Footnote 2 This examination enables us to uncover the tariff regime for which exports contribute to increases in total exports. Indeed, in the existing studies, it is unclear whether the increase in total exports to the EU was driven by increases in exports by existing GSP users or the switch from the MFN to the GSP regime. Our identification strategy is as follows. The products examined in the empirical analysis include both knitted and woven apparel. For Cambodia and Myanmar, Japan was the sixth- and second-largest export destination for knitted apparel, respectively, in 2018. The corresponding rankings for woven apparel are second for Cambodia and first for Myanmar. From Japan’s perspective, imports of knitted and woven apparel from these two LDCs account for only 5% and 9% of the total imports in 2018, respectively. Knitted and woven apparel share similar production materials, differing by being knitted (or crocheted) or woven. However, only the RoOs for knitted products were relaxed during our sample period. Therefore, we conduct a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis by setting Japan’s imports of knitted apparel as a treatment group and imports of woven apparel as a control group. Indeed, we show that imports of knitted and woven apparel before the relaxation of RoOs under each tariff regime exhibit very similar trends. The reason for focusing on Japan’s imports from Cambodia and Myanmar is to enjoy an additional advantage in terms of data. In this flow, the GSP-LDC regime and one RTA regime are available.Footnote 3 The latter is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)–Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership (AJCEP), a plurilateral RTA between Japan and ASEAN member states that includes the above two LDCs. Exporters from these countries to Japan can choose their tariff regime from two preference regimes (i.e., the AJCEP or GSP regime) and one nonpreference regime (i.e., the MFN regime). As summarized in Table 1, the RoOs in the GSP-LDC for knitted apparel became less restrictive during our sample period. However, the RoOs in the AJCEP did not change, and the two-stage processing rule remained. In addition, the RoOs in the GSP-LDC and AJCEP for woven apparel feature single-stage and two-stage processing rules, respectively, and did not change during our sample period.Footnote 4 We examine the effect of GSP-LDC RoO reform on imports under the AJCEP. This examination enables us to determine whether RoO reform can trigger existing AJCEP users to switch to the GSP-LDC regime. Because both the AJCEP and GSP-LDC regimes grant duty-free exports, exporters have no tariff advantage between the two regimes. Conversely, RoOs became less restrictive in the GSP-LDC than the AJCEP following their reform in 2015. Thus, switching to the GSP-LDC regime could reduce materials costs and thus lead to increased exports. However, if preference use exhibits strong inertia, existing AJCEP users will neither switch their tariff regime nor enjoy the potential benefit of reduced material costs. To examine their switch, we separately regress imports under the GSP-LDC, AJCEP, and MFN regimes. Our empirical findings can be summarized as follows. First, we show that RoO reform significantly increased Japan’s total imports from Cambodia and Myanmar. Thus, RoO relaxation in Japan had a trade creation effect, as found for the EU in the work of Tanaka (2021). Second, by closely examining the import effects under each regime, we found that RoO reform dramatically increased imports under the GSP-LDC regime, whereas imports under the AJCEP and MFN regimes decreased. These results suggest that at least some AJCEP and MFN users switched to the GSP-LDC regime after the relaxation of RoOs. Third, we found a significant lagged effect on imports. That is, the increase in imports under the GSP-LDC regime was greater over time, whereas the decrease in exports under the AJCEP and MFN regimes was greater. Specifically, the effect on imports under the AJCEP regime was insignificant just after RoO reform. Lastly, we discovered indirect evidence that the RoO relaxation induced the study LDCs to change their import sources for the materials used to produce apparel products. As mentioned above, this paper contributes mainly to the literature on the effect of RoO reform on trade by determining how such a reform changes trade under each tariff regime. Our study is broadly related to various other studies. First, the role of RoOs has been investigated in several contexts. Some empirical studies have evaluated the restrictiveness of RoOs by employing the index proposed by Estevadeordal (2000) (see, for example, Cadot et al. (2006) and Estevadeordal and Suominen (2004)). Conconi et al. (2018) examined Mexican imports and found that RoOs in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have a trade diversion effect on inputs. Carrere and de Melo (2006) examined the various effects of RoOs on preference utilization according to their type. They found that the negative effect of the regional value content rule on NAFTA utilization rates was larger than the negative effect of the change-in-chapter rule. Second, like our study, some papers have explored the case in which multiple preference regimes are available (Bureau et al., 2007; Hayakawa et al., 2019, 2021; Manchin, 2006). Hayakawa et al. (2019) shed light on the difference in preferential tariff rates, rather than RoOs, between preference regimes by examining the choice between AJCEP and bilateral RTAs in Japan’s imports from Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. They determined that a change in preferential tariff rates in one RTA affected the utilization of both that RTA and other RTAs. Hayakawa et al. (2021) explored the case in which six tariff regimes were available for Thailand’s imports. They simulated the effect of tariff reduction or RoO reform in one regime on the utilization of all regimes. Whereas these studies investigated the effects on preferential utilization rates, we study the effects of tariff regimes on the level of trade value. This enables us to uncover how exports under each tariff regime change preferential utilization rates. Third, our paper belongs to a large body of literature that evaluates trade creation in nonreciprocal preferential trade agreements (NRPTAs), including GSPs. Recent examples include the work of Frazer and Van Biesebroeck (2010), Aiello and Demaria (2010), Herz and Wagner (2011), Gil-Pareja et al. (2014), and Ito and Aoyagi (2019). The trade creation effect under NRPTAs is still controversial in these existing studies. A small or no trade creation effect might be due to the low utilization of NRPTA regimes, as mentioned at the beginning of this section. Because their analyses are based on data on total trade values rather than trade values under NRPTA regimes, those studies could not investigate the mechanism underlying changes in total trade value.Footnote 5 Using data on trade values by tariff regime, we can determine how the trade value under each tariff regime changes. There is a clear advantage in using such data when evaluating trade creation in preference regimes, including NRPTAs. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the AJCEP and Japan’s GSP. Specifically, we discuss some differences between the two tariff regimes. After presenting our empirical framework in Sect. 3, we report our estimation results on the effect of relaxing RoOs on imports under each tariff regime in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes this paper.",1
159,3,Review of World Economics,19 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-022-00480-3,Export failure and its consequences: evidence from Colombian exporters,August 2023,Jesse Mora,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Exporting allows firms to reach more consumers, potentially earn higher profits, and diversify against risk in the home market. Yet, few firms export (Bernard and Bradford Jensen, 2004; Brooks, 2006). While several factors affect the costs and benefits of exporting, fixed export costs are particularly important in limiting international trade. These costs are estimated to be around half a million US dollars for a single firm in Latin America (Das et al., 2007; Morales et al., 2011), and often exceed export revenue in the first years of exporting.Footnote 1 In Colombia, for example, foreign revenue for first-time exporters is about US $200,000 on average and US $13,000 for the median firm in the 1996–2010 period. Since the majority of firms do not export beyond one year (Eaton et al., 2007), it is likely exporting resulted in profit losses for unsuccessful exporters. What happens to those firms that try to export but stop after one year? The trade literature often views exporting as a simple exercise based on a cost-benefit analysis of foreign profits, where the most productive firms export and there is no uncertainty in export success. And, from this perspective, there is no additional cost or benefit to a failed export attempt. However, this attempt can have an effect on domestic production: it can be positive if firms learn from exporting, or negative if the attempt has a negative feedback effect. There are economic reasons to believe that for some firms the negative effect dominates. Firms tend to rely more on external financing for export sales than for domestic sales (Amiti and Weinstein, 2011), so an unsuccessful exporter cannot simply refocus its resources towards domestic production and ignore foreign losses. Moreover, a firm’s financial constraint might tighten due to the addition of debt but little or no foreign revenue. A tightened financial constraint may mean fewer financing options for domestic operations, limiting hiring, marketing, capital investments, and even operating cash flow. This differential effect on financially-constrained firms means that the negative consequences of export failure, not just the probability of export failure, lower expected returns from exporting. In this paper, I examine export attempts and their consequences. I develop a partial-equilibrium model that explains how a failed export attempt when accompanied with financial frictions can have a negative feedback on existing domestic operations. The model with heterogeneous firms shows that there exists a set of exporters for which export failure can have lasting negative consequences, including firm death. In addition, I find empirical support for this model. Using Colombian firm-level data and two identification techniques (difference-in-difference and instrumental variable methods), I show that exporting only once and then exiting is indeed associated with reduced economic performance in the domestic market. I find that financially-constrained unsuccessful exporters have a higher probability of default after exporting, and those that survive have lower revenue and lower revenue growth. The effect, just as expected from the theoretical model, is robust to comparisons with similar successful exporters and even non-exporters. The estimates are also robust to various definitions of export success and financially constraint classifications, as well as various other robustness tests. To my knowledge, I am the first to focus on firms with failed export attempts, provide stylized facts about these firms, and link failed export attempts with poor domestic market performance. The theoretical model builds the intuition for the empirical analysis. Since I am interested in the ex-post effects of entering a foreign market, I model the firm’s profit-maximization problem after export failure has been determined.Footnote 2 The model focuses on failed exporters, but also compares these firms with successful exporters and non-exporters; successful exporters and non-exporting firms provide counterfactuals for the failed exporters. Exporting has a differential impact on domestic operations because of financing needs and because of the existence of financial frictions. I assume firms borrow twice to pay upfront costs: the first loan pays for the export fixed cost and the second pays for domestic operations (marketing and upfront labor costs). Firms use their production-entry expenditure as collateral for the loans; this collateral is an asset necessary for production. I follow Manova (2013) in modeling financial frictions and Arkolakis (2010) in modeling marketing costs. To these I add an element of uncertainty in export success. Uncertainty is resolved after paying a search fee (an export fixed costs); the search fee gives the firm a chance to randomly match with a foreign distributor. Since a foreign distributor is necessary to sell any quantity in a foreign country, export failure takes place when a firm is unable to find a suitable match. The probability of export failure is known and exogenous to the model, therefore similar-productivity firms may differ in export success. Furthermore, since export failure results in new debt but no additional revenue, it tightens the liquidity constraint and diminishes the maximum amount firms can borrow to pay for domestic operations. In the model, I demonstrate how small and medium-sized firms can become financially constrained, decrease domestic sales, or default because of a failed export attempt. I test the model empirically and provide robust evidence that a failed exporting attempt has a negative impact on a firm’s domestic market performance. A firm may pay the ultimate price and go out of business because of its failed export attempt. Specifically, export failure results in worse cash flow to total assets, lower domestic revenue, and a higher probability of going out of business. The association is strong even when comparing unsuccessful exporters with matched non-exporters and successful exporters. To address additional endogeneity concerns, I follow Hummels et al. (2014) and Aghion et al. (2018) to instrument for export success based on plausibly exogenous market changes at the product level in foreign markets. The instrument contains rich variation across products and destinations, so its impact on a firm varies considerably. The work in this paper complements various strands of the literature. It contributes to the firm heterogeneity literature by providing a better understanding of exporting costs, and thus of the firm export-entry decision.Footnote 3 This paper also contributes to the literature quantifying export costs. Das et al. (2007) and Morales et al. (2011) calculate a dollar amount to export fixed costs, and Smeets et al. (2010) quantify how a home-country’s institutions can effect these costs. These studies differ from this work in that I focus on the prolonged costs—measured by the loss of domestic revenue and increased probability of going out of business—associated with export failure. Integrating the costs found in this paper into estimates of fixed costs may explain why the estimated fixed export costs are so high. This paper also contributes to the literature on export survival.Footnote 4 The export survival literature includes studies using bilateral trade-flow data (Nicita et al., 2013; Besedeš and Prusa, 2011, 2006a, b) and firm-level data (Stirbat et al., 2013; Cadot et al., 2013; Esteve-Pérez et al., 2007; Tovar and Martínez, 2011; Albornoz et al., 2012). The focus of the existing literature is on understanding export survival, rather than understanding the consequences of export failure. Albornoz et al. (2012) develop a model that explains why firms have low export survival; in their model a firm can only infer its profitability abroad after exporting and there are no consequences to export failure. Besedeš and Prusa (2011) show that differences in export survival at the country level explain differences in long-run export performance. I construct a model and implement an empirical strategy using firm-level data that directly links export failure and firm performance in the domestic market. Thus, my work identifies a channel through which firm export survival can have welfare effects at the national level. More generally, this paper contributes to the literature on financial frictions and international trade. This literature explains how financial frictions affect a firm’s decision to enter a foreign market. Manova (2013), Feenstra et al. (2013), and Chaney (2013) identify a mechanism by which financial frictions can affect trade. Manova (2013) shows how financial frictions can affect which firms export and how much they export. Feenstra et al. (2013) find that banks impose more stringent credit constraints on exporting firms when compared with non-exporting firms. Antunes et al. (2014) examine the riskiness involved in financing exporting firms. They find that exporters, compared with non-exporters, are less likely to go out of business, and conditional on going out of business, more likely to default. The export failure results found in my paper explain another reason why exporters are more likely to default. Finally, this paper adds to the literature on linkages between domestic and export markets. Ahn and McQuoid (2013) find that export and domestic revenue are substitutes. They find that capacity-constrained firms lower domestic sales when experiencing a positive export shock. McQuoid and Rubini (2014) differentiate between successful and unsuccessful exporters and find that “transitory” exporters have a larger drop in sales than “perennial” exporters in the domestic market when exporting. They focus on the immediate, short-run opportunity costs of exporting. I add to this literature by showing that this linkage does not end when a firm stops exporting; I show that the effect is prolonged and larger when an unsuccessful exporter is financially constrained. Rho and Rodrigue (2010) find that exporters have slower domestic revenue growth than non-exporting firms. They argue that previous models overestimate the size of fixed export costs. My work differs in that I focus on the prolonged effects on financially-constrained unsuccessful exporters, while Rho and Rodrigue (2010) study the linkages for continuous exporters. Lastly, other papers identify trade-offs between the home and foreign market due to a firm’s investment decision (Spearot, 2013), entry and exit decision (Blum et al., 2013), and pricing decision (Soderbery, 2014). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces a partial-equilibrium model, demonstrating how export failure can have repercussions in the home market. Section 3 describes the data and provides stylized facts about new exporters. Section 4 implements the identification strategy and provides robustness checks. Section 5 concludes.",

159,3,Review of World Economics,26 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-022-00482-1,Economic missions and firm internationalization: evidence from the Netherlands,August 2023,Ahmed Boutorat,Loe Franssen,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Netherlands has always been an open economy, largely relying on international trade as an important contributor to economic growth. In 2019, international trade contributed to roughly a third of the Dutch GDP while one in three firms was internationally active (Statistics Netherlands (CBS) 2021). These firms typically have a higher productivity, generating a productivity sorting as known from Melitz (2003) and shown recently in Van Den Berg et al. (2022) for Dutch exporters. Inspired by these potential productivity gains, publicly funded trade and investment promotion agencies aim to stimulate international trade (Lederman et al., 2016). The economic justification for such a government intervention is the existence of a market failure in terms of information asymmetries about the international market between incumbent and non-incumbent firms (Hausmann & Rodrik, 2003). Overcoming these asymmetries involves a significant sunk cost, such that only the most productive firms are able to enter international markets. Once the market has been entered, firms have no incentive to share their new knowledge with non-exporters. This is where promotion agencies can come in, as they can provide firms with various tools to simplify overcoming information asymmetries and entering international markets. While such tools can help both existing (Bernard & Jensen, 2004; Görg et al., 2008) and new traders, the literature seems to be converging towards a consensus that export promotion particularly benefits the extensive margin of trade (Volpe Martincus et al., 2011; Van Biesebroeck et al., 2015; Lederman et al., 2016; Broocks & Van Biesebroeck, 2017). It is, however, harder to investigate the effect on the extensive margin of trade. As described in Broocks and Van Biesebroeck (2017), this requires three types of primary data: (1) the incidence and timing of the mission, (2) export status preferably by destination and (3) data on firm control variables. To measure the effect on the extensive margin of trade, it is further critical to collect this information not only for firms already active on international markets, but on the entire population of firms. In addition, the issue of self-selection is far less of a problem when investigating the intensive than the extensive margin. Besides dealing with a smaller number of firms, comparing exporters with non-exporters comes with the added difficulty of controlling for internationalization appetite. This cannot be done solely on the basis of observable (and even unobservable) differences between firms’ abilities.
 We combine information from the Netherlands Enterprise Agency, which is the largest Trade and Investment Support Institution (TISI) in the Netherlands, on the incidence and timing of firms’ participation in economic missions with data from Statistics Netherlands on the full population of Dutch firms for the period 2008–2017. This detailed information allows us to investigate the effect of an economic mission on the export and import of firms’ goods and services, as well as their engagement in foreign direct investment (FDI) while controlling for firm specific observable and unobservable quality-characteristics as well as differences in internationalization appetite. To examine the effect of missions on the extensive margin,Footnote 1 we first pre-select firms that may indeed want to internationalize. While typically overlooked in the literature, Broocks and Van Biesebroeck (2017) have addressed the likely upward bias in treatment effects that results from ignoring such differences in appetite. We therefore proxy for internationalization appetite in three different ways. First, we only look at firms that engaged internationally at least once in the entire research period and thus exclude any firm that never showed any intention or ability to operate across borders. We will refer to this as our baseline estimation. Second, we only look at firms that are already active in a particular world region but not in the specific country of the mission. Doing so ensures that a firm is both interested and able to export to the region of the mission. Third, we use information on whether a firm ever did a so called Inquiry on trade, technology or investment, or inquiry for short, with the Dutch TISI. Inquiries provide general information about a foreign destination and ensures the firm has a certain interest in expanding there. After pre-selecting firms with similar internationalization appetite, we then use a fixed effect linear probability model to control for differences in their abilities to investigate whether treatment firms are more likely to internationalize than control firms within one or two years after the treatment. This approach allows us to contribute to the literature on trade and investment promotion by not only providing a detailed impact evaluation on trade in goods, but also on trade in services and on foreign direct investment. In addition, we are able to open the black box of trade and investment promotion by investigating the determinants of a successful mission, and to establish whether stated effects are durable or not. Our baseline estimation suggests that a firm is 5.4 and 5.8 percentage points more likely to start exporting and importing goods, respectively, within two years of the mission than firms that do not go on this mission. These results are robust to the different forms of pre-selection that control for internationalization appetite mentioned above. We also look at the longer term by showing that firms that internationalized as a result of the mission are no more or less likely to still be active in that market two years later than firms that internationalized to that country without partaking in the mission. So while Cadot et al. (2015) found that the benefits of export support on the intensive margin of trade can wear off, our findings suggests that the benefits for market entry remain present for at least two years. While the effects of trade promotion on exports of goods have been extensively documented in previous literature, research on its effectiveness on other forms of international activities such as trade in services or foreign direct investment is - with the notable and recent exception of Makioka (2021)—virtually nonexistent. Fortunately, the broad nature of our instrument and the richness of our data allow us to look into these activities as well. We find that economic missions also improve the chances of foreign direct investment, as mission participants are 2.3% points more likely to invest in the target country within two years of the mission than their non-participating peers. Regarding services, however, we find no significant effects, not at the intensive nor at the extensive margin. We hypothesize that this may be an indication that trade in services faces different obstacles to internationalize than trade in goods or FDI. Knowing that missions can have a particularly significant effect on market entry for firms looking to trade goods or invest abroad, the question of interest for policy makers becomes: when or how does it work? To that extent, we contribute to the literature by opening the “black box” of economic missions, i.e. we investigate the determinants of successful missions. Although such insights are critical in order to design future missions, there is only limited information available on this topic. On the firm level, we find that smaller firms are more likely to internationalize after mission participation than larger firms. We also find that a second mission by the same firm to the same country in a later year significantly increases the chances of entering that market relative to partaking in only one mission and that missions with a thematic focus are more successful than missions with a broad focus. Destination characteristics, such as business climate and development status, also play a critical role. Missions to the least developed countries (LDCs) do not have a significant effect while missions to developed, OECD countries have the highest chance of being followed up by market entry. The insignificant findings on LDCs might be explained by the potential development angle of these missions. However, it might also have to do with the overall business climate in those countries, as destinations with the lowest scores on the World Bank’s composite “Trading across Borders” or “Ease of Doing Business” indicators show no sign of positive impacts. Together, these results point to the critical role that economic missions can play in reducing information asymmetries. This interpretation is further strengthened by the results of a qualitative evaluation executed by Blauw Research (Uskalelier & Nijholt, 2018; Nijholt & van den Broek, 2019). They showed that mission participants have a far wider set of goals than the ones typically measured in the economics literature. For example, 45% of mission participants did not expect to achieve any sort of agreement as a result from the mission. Instead, their goals were more tacit in nature, focusing particularly on networking. Together with our black box findings, we interpret this as evidence that missions can play a key role in the step wise internationalization process of firms. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section looks more closely at export promotion and economic missions. The data, empirical strategy, results and discussion are presented after that, before concluding.",
