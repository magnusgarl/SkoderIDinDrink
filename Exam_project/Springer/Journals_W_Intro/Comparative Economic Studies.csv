(1997a) presented a paper analysing patterns of transition, including growth, to that date. Their econometric analysis of growth provided a clear new direction for subsequent efforts to explain recovery and growth in transition, by showing that while inflation stabilisation was a necessary condition, as emphasised by Fischer et al. (1996), an equally important condition was progress on economic liberalisation. In later work, de Melo et al. (1997b) added a detailed analysis of the role of initial conditions. Broadly similar results are obtained in Fischer et al. (1996). The now much larger literature on recovery in transitionFootnote 1 tries to explain growth differences in terms of three main categories of explanatory factors: (i) macroeconomic variables, such as the level of inflation and the size of the budget deficit; (ii) variables describing progress made with structural reforms, in particular liberalisation and privatisation; and (iii) variables characterising initial conditions, such as the degree of macroeconomic and structural distortions at the beginning of transition, or wars and internal conflict. Subsequent studies such as those of Wolf (1997), Havrylyshyn et al. (1998), and Berg et al. (1999) have combined these three categories and extended the period of study to determine their relative importance in explaining both the U-shaped time profile of output as well as the cross-country differences in growth performance. These more recent studies broadly confirm earlier conclusions about the need for stabilisation and the crucial importance of economic liberalisation, and also reach new conclusions on the importance of initial conditions and on time-lag effects. Thus, while de Melo et al. showed a strong effect of initial conditions, both Berg et al. and Havrylyshyn et al. conclude that the effect has declined over time. The latter further demonstrate that any negative effect of initial conditions (such as a high degree of industrialisation) can be easily compensated by slightly more progress on reforms.Footnote 2 These later studies also show that negative effects on output of early and rapid liberalisation are more than compensated by lagged positive effects.Footnote 3 However, this growing body of econometric analysis has not yet gone very far to include a fourth category of factors, which are increasingly cited in other writings on transition – and growth in general – namely development of institutions that enhance the market environment. There is, on the one hand, a large literature on the importance of institutions, and there exists, on the other hand, a large number of synthetic indicators of the business-friendly environment: political or business risk; degree of corruption, effectiveness of governance; economic freedom; effectiveness of legal system and protection of property rights; political freedom, etc. The main objectives of our paper are to compile available institutional indicators for transition economies, and carry out a first simple econometric test of how much explanatory value is added by such institutional indicators in regressions of growth in transition economies. We do not pretend here to build a comprehensive theory of transition or even a theory of growth in transition that incorporates institutional development. Our aim is simpler; given the growing consensus that market-friendly institutions do matter, and that many cardinal measures of the degree of development of such institutions exist, we ask: is the statistical analysis of growth improved by including these variables? It is worth noting some important differences between the above transition studies and the standard growth equation specification à la Barrow and Sala-I-Martin. The classic specification includes something like initial income levels to capture convergence effects, and proxies for factor inputs and technology. Virtually all specifications for transition countries differ from this because they consider not a long-run equilibrium path of growth, but a short- to medium-term adjustment of the economy from a high degree of central plan period inefficiency, as well as recovery from the initial output decline. In this framework, as outlined in Havrylyshyn (2001), initial condition variables (including inter alia per capita income) should not be considered as capturing long-run convergence; rather, more typically, they are intended to reflect the negative burden of overindustrialisation. Factor inputs are thought by most authors to matter little as the early recovery is largely based on efficiency benefits of resource reallocation, improved incentives, and corrected price signals. Indeed, investment variables when tried, give negative and/or insignificant results. The same logic suggests non-relevance of any trend technology variables. Of course, in the microsense, there may be a number of small technological and capital stock changes (plus employment expansion) for firms/sectors that are new growth points. However, the large disinvestments in the inefficient soviet-period capital stock overwhelm this; hence, aggregate growth is not positively related to aggregate factor input changes. The next section of the paper reviews selectively the use of such indicators in growth regressions for nontransition countries. Then, we describe and assess 10 data series of institutional development that we collected, which cover a large number of transition countries. Consequently, we present the results of econometric analysis of growth in 25 transition countries in the period 1991–98, adding to a conventional formulation the different institutional variables described here. Finally, we summarise our findings and suggest further directions for research.",64

Although the early view was that ‘privatization in … agriculture mainly concerns the breaking up of large units…’ (World Bank, 1995, p. 2), as early as in 1994 it could be noted that ‘already now it is clear that the process of farm restructuring … is taking a course which appears to be different from the original expectations of many Western European observers. … It is remarkable that farm enterprises … choose to reorganize as whole entities, without dismantling the collective structure’ (Csaki and Lerman, 1994, pp. 566, 573). In most Central and Eastern European countries except Albania, such structures still cultivate considerable shares of agricultural land. This share is 89% in Slovakia, 62% in the Czech Republic, 48% in Bulgaria, 46% in Hungary, 37% in Estonia, 33% in Romania and Lithuania, and 5% in Latvia (Lerman et al., 2002).Footnote 1 In the (other) countries of the former Soviet Union, market-oriented family farming is typically even more marginal (see, for instance, Prosterman et al. (1998) and OECD (1998) for figures on Russia). Various reasons for this development have been suggested (Sarris et al., 1999; Mathijs et al., 1999; Bezemer, 2002b). Oft-mentioned is the lack of functioning credit markets, which is a problem particularly in the agricultural sectors of transition economies (for a detailed discussion of the reasons, see Bezemer, 2002a). De novo and relatively small enterprises, such as most family farms are, are thought to be typically more sensitive to this than established farm structures. This link between the limited role of commercial family farming and hampering credit markets has been suggested in several empirical studies (Wolz, 1996; Swinnen and Gow, 1999; Davis et al., 1998; Shrieder and Heidhues, 1998; Pederson and Khitarishvili, 1997). More limited credit allocation may be one reason for the limited importance of individual farms in the Czech Republic and elsewhere in the economies in transition. A level playing field in this and other areas of farm operations would facilitate competition between different organisational alternatives in agricultural production, which, in turn, might lead to further improvements in allocative efficiency (as suggested by eg Mathijs and Swinnen, 2001). This level playing field was, and is, the official aim of structural policies in most transition economies – see OECD (1995, p. 90) and Ratinger and Rabinowicz (1997, p. 96) for the Czech case. Reality, however, may be different. In this paper, the relation between credit allocation and farm structures is investigated on the basis of primary farm-level data for the case of the Czech Republic in the mid-1990s.",11

The ideas supporting this view of decentralisation have a long history in the public finance, public choice, and public management literatures (see, eg, Tiebout, 1956; Bish and Kirk, 1974). Decentralisation makes the decisions of public servants more transparent, permits citizens to participate at low cost, and most importantly, participate more effectively (Oates, 1998). Still, many approach decentralisation with caution, citing the inability especially of small, poorly endowed governments to provide services. Critics claim that, as provided service benefits spill over into areas beyond those doing the funding, local governments will respond in their narrowly perceived self-interest by reducing (in a welfare sense, under-providing) those services. Successful decentralisation requires effective performance of a whole set of complex tasks. As the World Bank (1996, p. 110) notes, ‘the state has to move from doing many things badly to doing fewer core tasks well’. The reassignment of personnel and responsibilities, often with a reduction in services, is not always easy for citizens to understand and support (Amsden et al., 1994). Fiscal decentralisation, the public sector counterpart of privatisation, also requires that local governments have access to an independent and autonomous source of tax revenue (Bird et al., 1995). Local activity increases the visibility of choices made by elected and appointed public officials, and accountability increases pari passu with visibility (Litvak et al., 1998). The literature suggests that the property tax embodies the positive characteristics required of a local tax, because it is immobile, stable, potentially neutral, and (as a direct tax) visible to taxpayers (Musgrave, 1993; Oates, 1996). As is true of decentralisation generally, the design and implementation of an effective property tax is challenging. Since it is direct and visible, it makes citizens and officials less comfortable than do indirect taxes such as the VAT (Youngman and Malme, 1994). Both citizens and officials usually prefer the use of excise taxes and fees on a variety of transactions (Shleifer and Vishny, 1998), since the property tax too often generates political problems for local officials (Paugam, 1999). There are also administrative and practical problems with property tax implementation (Bahl and Linn, 1992). Examples of the latter include the difficulty of establishing market-oriented property values in the absence of a functioning real estate market (Bertaud and Renaud, 1994) and the uneven distribution of the property tax base (Netzer, 1966). As a consequence of political and practical issues, the property tax remains critically under-used (Dunn and Wetzel, 2000).Footnote 1 Especially in the transition countries, this can be an impediment to successful decentralisation and undermine the welfare gains expected from that process. In this article, we compare the implementation and administration of the property tax in the transitional Czech and Slovak republics. In indicating that access to independently generated funds can help make fiscal autonomy possible, we do not argue that one can gauge fiscal autonomy by measuring property tax receipts. There are other independent sources of revenue for subnational governments such as the local user fees collected for public services and the proceeds from privatisation. The property tax, however, still offers largely untapped potential (Bird, 1999). The effectiveness of collective efforts cannot, of course, provide an actual measure of local autonomy. However, the fiscal effort applied, as we will see in the Slovak case, is an important element in the attempt to develop fiscal independence. There are significant differences in the importance and growth of the property tax between these two countries. In Slovakia, the property tax is increasing in importance at a rate that will cause associated revenues to double approximately every 6 years. Conversely, in the Czech Republic the property tax as a local revenue source is declining in relative importance. These differing trends are interesting, because the two countries have uniquely common roots extending back to the early 20th century, including a 40-year period when they shared a united government. Further, the commonality of the two fiscal systems in the Czechoslovak federation continued through the Velvet Revolution of 1989, and even beyond the 1993 ‘Velvet Divorce’ that created the new Slovak and Czech republics. It would be easy to assume that the difference in the fiscal importance of the property tax is due to a difference in the tax base and tax rates. However, it is notable that the two republics have retained identical property tax laws, identical area-based valuation methods, and even identical rates that have remained unchanged since the Velvet Divorce in 1993 (Bryson and Cornia, 2001a,2001b). Why, then, do we observe the divergent rates of growth in Czech and Slovak property tax revenues? At least part of the answer to this question can be found in basic tax administration, which we assume, along with Bird and Slack (1991), Hubbard et al. (1993), and Shah (1994), makes an important difference in how successful a tax will be. In this article, we focus on three policy decisions that have had significant fiscal consequences for the Czech and Slovak property taxes. First, which level of government, central or subnational, should have responsibility for the policy design of the property tax? Second, which level of government should have administrative responsibility? Third, what level of funding should the centre provide to subnational governments or municipalities? Both countries centralised property tax policy issues, but the Czechs centralised property tax administration and the Slovaks decentralised it. With respect to the third issue, the level of funds transferred, the two republics have also performed differently: The Czech central government has been far more generous with respect to the aggregate of funds transferred to local governments. These sister republics, with their common origins, provide a rare opportunity for a study of fiscal decentralisation. They permit comparisons for which other things actually are equal, and we can ‘control’ for some administrative and policy decisions made after the Velvet Divorce in 1993 that appear to have had a direct effect on the property tax. The examination of these issues should add insight into more general problems of fiscal decentralisation, since the issues involved have important implications for transition processes across the region and in other parts of the developed and developing world. Having briefly revisited in this introduction some of the issues pertaining to fiscal decentralisation and the need for an independent revenue source for the achievement of local self-government, the paper will proceed as follows. We review in the next section the formation of local governments and the history of fiscal federalism in the two republics since the beginning of the transition era. In the subsequent section, the level of government responsible for property tax policy and administration from the perspective of principal-agent relations is discussed. In doing so, we will take into consideration the moral hazard problems such relations imply for property tax systems. In the context of both national and local budgets of the twin republics, municipal revenues derived from the property tax and other fiscal transfers are addressed in the penultimate section. The last section briefly summarises our conclusions.",4

In this respect Russia faces an especially grave danger, as 300,000 Russians die each year from smoking-related illnesses. The country's population is in absolute decline with low male life expectancy, in part, because of smoking (Stone, 2000). Further, smoking may increase the risk of certain anxiety disorders among young men (Johnson et al., 2000) leading to the higher stress believed to contribute to higher mortality (Stone, 2000). In the literature, smoking has been found to negatively impact health and mortality in several developed countries (Chaloupka and Warner, 1999). For example, smoking-related illnesses are the leading preventable cause of death in the US. Americans who smoke live about 6 years less than those who have never smoked. Including quitters, the medical cost for smokers in the US is roughly $70 billion and 2.4 million life years. From the conspicuous cigarette billboards by the roads to the lack of non-smoking areas at public facilities and retail businesses, Russia is one of the most smoker friendly countries in the world. A national household survey used here reveals about 176 billion cigarettes consumed each year. In 1998, Russian households spent 2.6% of their disposable income on tobacco, which is more than they spent on alcohol (Monitoring Economic Conditions in the Russian Federation, 2002). Young people in Russia exhibit the same naiveté towards smoking as that found in the West (Gruber and Zinman, 2000). Russian men become regular smokers before high school graduation (Prokhorov and Alexandrov, 1992). Mandatory military service for men, with cigarettes as part of the ‘food’ ration, contributed to several generations of young male addiction similar to the ‘Lucky Strike’ generation of US GIs. Until the early 1990s, the mass advertising and brand proliferation of a market economy were absent but so was any effective anti-smoking effort. While Soviet anti-smoking ‘campaigns’ and propaganda existed, they were largely ignored. In the second half of the 1990s, despite increased awareness of health effects with warnings on cigarette packs and anti-smoking advertising, smoking is believed to be dangerously on the rise especially with the younger portion of the population (Prokhorov, 1997). Western tobacco companies with declining markets in developed countries see Russia as a prime unregulated area to target to make up for declining demand elsewhere. According to the WHO, 50 billion cigarettes are being imported by Russia each year (Interfax, 2001). Although the literature on the economics of smoking is quite large for developed countries, formal analysis of smoking in developing and transition economies is quite new. New insights on the issue of smoking in Russia can draw on the methods and models already developed elsewhere (Chaloupka and Warner, 1999) and the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS), a national household survey, provides a limited longitudinal data set on smoking. This paper presents an exploratory study of risk factors and the economics of adult smoking in Russia in the second half of the 1990s. Our results are consistent with earlier work using a different survey (McKee et al., 1998). The next section describes the data used, then subsequent section describes the patterns of smoking, the penultimate section analyses the influences on the decision to smoke using a probit model, and the last section provides the conclusion.",18

This is probably because of the geo-political significance of the Russian Federation, including its size, military capacity and resource endowment, as well as its political leadership across the region. However, transition in Russia has always been viewed as being likely to prove more difficult than in the small, relatively more open and reform-minded economies like Hungary or Poland (see Blanchard et al., 1991; Portes, 1993). The huge scale and long communist traditions of Russia made the obstacles to reform seem almost insurmountable: a view apparently confirmed when the reform process appeared to founder at the time of 1998 financial crisis (see EBRD, 1999). The economic outlook for Russia is currently perceived in a more positive way (see Hanson, 2002), in no small part because of the relatively high oil price and its positive impact on economic growth and the government's fiscal position. However, even the most recent analyses suggest that country still has some way to go to eradicate profound problems with corporate governance, as well as with broader institutional development (see EBRD, 2002). An evaluation of progress in these areas at the enterprise level is the subject of this Special Issue.Footnote 1 We use evidence from a survey of privatised Russian enterprises to chart progress in corporate governance, the business environment and company performance from the time of privatisation until 2000. Reforms in Russia since 1992 have centred upon the privatisation process (see Boycko et al., 1995), which transferred ownership in tens of thousands of companies across the country (see Earle and Estrin, 1997). Initial evidence about the impact of this privatisation, however, has been worrying. While ownership was successfully shifted away from the state to the private sector, the emergence and entrenchment of widespread insider ownership, combined with the poor development of capital market institutions (see EBRD, 1999), meant that privatisation had proved to have only limited impact on company performance up until the mid-1990s. This finding was deduced in a number of studies (eg Blasi et al., 1997; Earle and Estrin, 1997; Estrin and Wright, 1999; Brown and Earle, 2001) and is the standard conclusion in several authoritative surveys (eg Nellis, 2000; Djankov and Murrell, 2002). However, the conclusion that Russian privatisation has had little effect on enterprise performance was derived from data collected only a few years after the ownership changes. This timing was not ideal because other things were changing in the economic environment simultaneously. For example, this was also the period when firms were seeking to recover from disorganisation: the collapse of supply relationships governed by a central planning process but prior to the establishment of business to business relationships intermediated through the market (see Blanchard and Kremer, 1997). Data on enterprise performance were also noisy because of widespread use of barter in transactions (see Ledeneva, 1998). Given the long heritage of communism and planning, some of these studies were probably undertaken too soon to deduce definitive conclusions about the impact of the new ownership, incentive and information systems on the performance of companies.Footnote 2 We were therefore encouraged to undertake a new large-scale enterprise survey, which drew inspiration from the study undertaken by the World Bank in 1994 (see Commander et al., 1996).Footnote 3
The survey was organised through the Russian Bureau of Economic Analysis between mid-1998 and 1999, and was carefully constructed to be a random sample within the population of firms considered. The sample was relatively large – 437 firms – but given the size of Russia still needed to be stratified to six two-digit manufacturing industries; to firms employing between 100 and 5,000 workers; and to 11 regions within the four main economic zones. Comparison with Goskomstat data (1990–1999) confirms that our sample is reasonably representative of the relevant national patterns. Sampling methodology and comparisons between the sample and the population are presented in the Appendix. We based our study on the following organising framework. Enterprise performance in transition economies has been associated in the literature (see eg Djankov and Murrell, 2002) with four broad aspects of the economic environment: ownership (state versus private; insider versus outsider); governance (ownership versus control); market structure and competition (domestic and international); and financial constraints (eg access to equity or debt). Much of the questionnaire addresses ways to measure enterprise and the business environment. One can conceive of enterprises, pre-reform, as operating away from the profit maximising equilibrium in two senses. First, levels of output, employment and perhaps capital would exceed those implied by a profit-maximising rule, because of planners' preference for gigantism (see eg Bennett, 1989). Second, firms would operate within their production possibility frontiers because of weak or inappropriate managerial incentives and poor monitoring by owners (see Ellman, 1989). The ‘Washington consensus’ reform package – stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation - can be viewed as changing the economic environment in which enterprises operate in the following ways. Privatisation would fundamentally alter the balance of ownership away from the state and towards the private sector. This should lead to improved enterprise performance, in the sense of higher TFP, because of enhanced monitoring of managers and sharper managerial incentives (see Vickers and Yarrow, 1988; Nickell, 1996; Megginson and Netter, 2001). It should also lead to profit maximising behaviour, and, given the starting conditions, therefore probably a reduction in output and factor inputs. As we have seen, the situation was not quite so straightforward in Russia. Privatisation was mainly to insiders – workers and managers – whose incentives to improve performance were more ambiguous than those of outsiders (see Earle and Estrin, 1996). Indeed, perhaps the fundamental problem for reform in Russia has been that the privatisation process started by giving control to managers. The majority owners were dispersed insiders (workers) or outsiders (investment funds, former workers, banks). Privatisation did not give the managers sufficient ownership – typically less than 10% of the total stock at the outset – to motivate improved performance (see Earle and Estrin, 1997); rather the incentives to restructure and improve profitability were often outweighed by incentives to do nothing or even to expropriate assets (see Stiglitz, 1999). This was perhaps an inevitable starting point for private ownership in a country with limited private savings and a long tradition of communism (see Boycko et al., 1995). The crucial question is whether the ownership structure began to evolve through market forces towards one more conducive to enhance corporate governance and improved performance. Our survey instrument was designed to allow us to address issues of ownership and ownership evolution in some detail, and relate these to a variety of measures of company performance, both quantitative, such as economic or financial performance (productivity, profitability), and qualitative indicators of restructuring activity (See Estrin et al., 1995). We also explore indicators of corporate governance, including managerial turnover. At the same time, reforms will influence the economic environment in which firms are trading. Stabilisation will provide a reduction of risk and clarity of economic signal to managers. Liberalisation impacts on enterprise performance by enhancing the competition faced by firms in their product markets. Even when corporate governance is weak, enterprises can be forced to improve performance by tough competition in their domestic or international markets. The effect of this on company performance, of course, depends in part on ownership structure. However, restructuring is likely to be an expensive activity, requiring investment in new technologies, methods and systems. The capacity of firms to finance these activities internally, and the availability of resources from capital markets, is the final area of analysis. Much of the literature on restructuring and enterprise performance implicitly assumes that capital is available at a fixed interest rate with infinitely elastic supply. In practice, this was not true in Russia – capital was scarce and allocated more by rationing than by price. In the Russian literature, this has been regarded as a major constraint on economic development. It also relates to issues of ownership and governance because management will not be able to raise additional funds from the owners if shareholders are insufficiently protected. This may lead to binding financial constraints on enterprise behaviour, which can hold back restructuring and influence total factor productivity and company performance. Our main purpose in this Special Issue is therefore to use the data from our sample to look separately at these influences on company performance. We first consider the effects of ownership and competition on enterprise performance, and then of corporate governance by investigating the determinants of CEO turnover. The third paper examines the financial environment and its impact on restructuring and firm performance. In the concluding paper, we bring together our findings to evaluate as a whole the determinants of enterprise performance in Russia in 2000. The first paper, by Estrin and Angelucci, examines the effect of competition and its interaction with ownership structure on improvement in enterprise performance in Russia. The survey finds that ownership of Russian firms has been moving away from insiders to outsiders in the second half of the 1990s. Within the insider group, ownership has become more concentrated in the hands of managers, who have increased their control by almost 30%. Using a variety of measures of performance, the paper finds that insider-owned firms have slightly higher productivity and a slightly smaller fall in employment and investment share. Insider-owned firms more often undertook ‘deep’ restructuring. However, none of these differences are significant at even a 90% level, implying that ownership change has still not begun to have a significant effect on quantitatively measured company performance by 2000. However, the paper does provide evidence of a positive association between qualitative measures of restructuring firm and competitive pressures. Firms in highly competitive markets undertake more deep restructuring than those in highly concentrated markets. The paper confirms a significant joint role of private ownership and competition; competition has a larger effect on performance in privately owned firms than in state owned ones. The issue of corporate governance and accountability of Russian managers is examined by Alexander Muravyev by studying the dynamics and determinants of CEO turnover, which is found to approach 12% per annum. This rate places Russia above developed countries but below some transition countries. CEO turnover is found to be guided by the same forces as in developed countries. Crucially, company performance does play a role in determining CEO's tenure, as managers whose companies under perform their respective industries face a higher probability of replacement. This relationship is strengthened by the presence of a regional government as an owner or by a small size of the board. However, there is a difference in turnover, which depends on the ownership of the firm. The paper shows that insider ownership inhibits CEO turnover, while both state and private outsider ownership are associated with higher turnover rates. The financial environment is the subject of the third paper by Bevan and Fennema, which investigates the relationship between finance, restructuring and performance. The paper identifies the extent to which Russian enterprises are financially constrained in access to bank loans, state support and equity markets. It then analyses how financial constraints are affected by the firm's size, location and industry sector. The results confirm that size, region and industry matter in obtaining finance: small firms are more financially constrained then large and medium ones; regions such as Moscow city, St Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Volgograd face lower financial constraints, as do the food and chemical industries. The paper finds that there is a positive correlation between barter and credit constraint and a negative one between investment and financial constraints, but there is only limited evidence to support the notion that financially unconstrained firms are better at restructuring. The final paper in the Special Issue by Bevan and Estrin brings together the analysis by estimating regressions linking enterprise performance to the four categories of determinant examined in the papers: ownership, governance, competition and financial constraints. These independent variables are entered interactively to control for the possibility that pressures on firms to improve their performance operate jointly rather than separately. We find financial constraints to be the main determinant of most economic measures of performance, for example, profitability and productivity. However, competition is found to increase investment rates as well. Interactive effects are in fact not significant. There are stronger results for the qualitative measures of performance, restructuring, which are found to be significantly influenced by ownership and monopoly power, as well as by financial constraints. There is also evidence for joint determination of performance; restructuring is less in state-owned monopolies while financial constraints are not binding on performance in state-owned firms. Overall, therefore, the survey indicates that enterprise behaviour was not markedly different in 2000 from 1996, in terms of the ways that economic factors were influencing behaviour. Although the conditions for improved performance were beginning to emerge – increased competition, outsider ownership, effective governance – they were not yet having much systematic effect on quantitative measures of performance like profitability. The major role of financial constraints in preventing firms from performing well is also very worrying, given the underdeveloped state of Russian capital markets. An important policy conclusion is that effective reform of capital markets and corporate governance must be implemented to facilitate the flow of funds into the enterprise sector. However, there were also indications that things may still improve in the future. Restructuring activity is increasing and appears to be determined by the factors predicted by theory – private ownership, competition and good governance – although even this is also constrained by the firm's financial position. Moreover, the underlying structures of the economy, most markedly the ownership pattern, appear to be improving. In the longer term, one might reasonably expect these factors to begin to impact on the traditional financial measures of performance.",2

While privatisation has led to the transfer of ownership from state to private hands, investment in physical capital is fundamental if enterprises are to restructure in a manner that will enable their long-term viability. Unfortunately, available evidence suggests that enterprises in transition economies have frequently been subjected to acute financial constraints that have hindered the restructuring process (see eg, Commander et al., 1996; Cornelli et al., 1998; Bevan et al., 1999). In recent years, however, the financial sectors of the more advanced transition economies have begun to approach those of middle-income countries, and hence provide finance of a more appropriate volume and tenor to enable enterprise restructuring. As a consequence, these leading transition economies have been able to develop robust enterprise sectors with improved levels of corporate performance. Unfortunately, financial sectors in the Former Soviet Union generally remain thin and do not yet constitute an ‘enabling environment’. Although the financial environment in Russia may be somewhat more developed than in many of the satellite states, it was severely weakened by the August 1998 crisis. At the same time, the crisis induced a demonetisation of the economy and led to the emergence of barter – a phenomenon that has been largely confined to the FSU (see Commander and Mumssen, 1999). Evidence suggests that the resultant limited scope of financial intermediation has constrained investment activity and inhibited the restructuring of the corporate sector. This paper uses the results of a large-scale enterprise survey to consider the relation between finance, restructuring and performance in a sample of privatised Russian enterprises. Our dataset – which covers the period 1997 – 1999 – includes both financial and qualitative panel information, together with some time-invariant information, particularly in terms of ‘managerial perceptions’ responses, that is effectively dated at the time of sampling. The paper begins by considering the extent to which enterprises are financially constrained and the forms in which these constraints manifest themselves. The subsequent section then provides more detail by considering the extent to which financial constraints differ according to characteristics of the enterprise such as size, region of location, sector of activity and so on. In order to ease the analysis, we then combine the individual constraints to construct an overall credit constraint, and examine the variation of this constraint across units of observation. The penultimate section considers the consequences of aggregate financial constraint in terms of the impact on barter, restructuring and investment activity. The section continues to examine the influence that these factors have over company performance in our sample. The last section summarises and draws conclusions.",3

Remedies vary accordingly: replacing incumbents with more capable managers, introducing the right incentives or a combination of the two. In contemporary literature these changes are often viewed as complementary. Little can be gained from improving incentives if managers are incompetent in the first place. Similarly, good managers may slack off under badly structured incentives (McMillan, 1996). Changes in managers and changes in incentives have been of particular importance for improving enterprise efficiency and performance in transition countries. The reason is huge imperfections in the allocation of managers as well as distorted incentives, which these countries inherited from the era of centralised planning (Roland, 2000). In addition, the mechanisms that could improve matching between productive assets and managers and provide the latter with adequate incentives – the internal corporate control system, the discipline of competition in the product market, the capital market and the market for managers – were weak or virtually non-existent in these countries at the start of transition. Empirical evidence on whether transition economies have succeeded in replacing bad executives and establishing appropriate incentives is limited. In particular, little is known about the role of ‘negative’ incentives, including dismissals for poor performance (Djankov and Murrell, 2002). Few existing papers on managerial turnover typically focus on its outcomes rather than determinants. For example, Barberis et al. (1996) find that the presence of new owners and new managers raises the likelihood of restructuring of privatised shops in Russia, while providing equity incentives for old managers does not affect restructuring. A similar result pointing out the importance of new human capital is reported by Claessens and Djankov (1999) for Czech firms. For Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, Frydman et al. (2000) find that the turnover of managers improves the performance of both state-owned and privatised firms, but the effect is only significant in the latter case. This paper contributes to the field by studying determinants of CEO turnover in Russian privatised firms. Among such determinants, past performance is of particular interest. The existence of a negative link between performance and turnover would imply that poorly performing managers are systematically dismissed, which is a necessary condition both for obtaining better managers and for ensuring ‘negative’ incentives for incumbents. Besides, the paper investigates the role of various mechanisms that underlie the performance–turnover relationship in Russian companies. The paper does not study the effect of management change on enterprise performance. This topic is omitted for two main reasons. One is the absence of an indicator that could reliably capture the effect of management change. In developed countries with a well-functioning stock market, such an effect is best revealed in the company stock prices that summarise the implications of management decisions for the expected long-run performance of a firm (Bevan et al., 1999). In transition countries, this measure is not available. Accounting measures may be misleading as it is unclear, for example, what time should pass in order for management change to be reflected in corporate profit. Another reason is that the effect of management change is difficult to separate from that of ownership change. This is particularly true if new owners become the new managers (Djankov and Murrell, 2002). The paper is organised as follows. Firstly, it focuses on factors that underlie decisions involving CEO turnover in developed countries. Then it explains the role of management turnover in transition economies and outlines major institutional differences between developed and transition countries that may have impact on managerial turnover. These sections are followed by empirical analysis of managerial turnover in Russian privatised enterprises. The last section concludes.",20

This rationale, together with the restricted number of enterprises surveyed (around 400 enterprises were to be interviewed), determined the character of the sample. It is clearly impossible to seek representativeness of ‘Russian industry’ in a country so regionally diverse as Russia with such a small sample. We therefore stratified by region, size, industry, ownership form and age, and then undertook random sampling within each sampling frame. The initial list of enterprises from which the sample was drawn was based on the Goskomstat Enterprise Registry data included in ALBA-Y database. The registry includes information for about 30,000 medium and large Russian industrial enterprises, accounting for 65%–85% of output and employment in the selected industries. Utilising this database enabled us to use historical time series data in the analysis and at the same time did not significantly narrow the population of firms from which to select. We based our work on the population of firms in the following manufacturing industries according to Russian Industrial Classification (OKONH).Footnote 3
We judged that the economic issues arising from privatisation and restructuring were illustrated most clearly in the manufacturing sector. The following two-digit industries were selected: 13 – Chemical and oil-chemical industry; 14 – Machinery building and metal-working industry; 15 – Wood and paper industry; 16 – Stone and clay (production of building materials) industry; 17 – Light industry; 18 – Food industry. Our sampling was meant to ensure that the firms were evenly distributed across the chosen two-digit industries. However, in practice, it proved difficult to meet these quotas in some industries, given the need to sample only privatised enterprises and to adhere to the size and regional stratification criteria as well. The actual distribution slightly over-represents the machinery sector relative to the industrial population (see Table A1) but there are sufficient observations in each industry to control for industry-specific factors in our analysis. We restricted the size of our sampled firms to be between 100 and 5,000 employees. Small enterprises with below 100 employees were excluded because: (a) they work under specific tax and accounting rules that often make them incomparable with others; (b) although extremely important for market institutions in the long run, during this period they accounted for less than four percent of industrial output in Russia, and (c) the SME sector necessitates larger, more specific samples. The upper size limit of 5,000 employees was chosen because in Russia, although a small number of very big firms operate in most industries, these have unique features that make them more suitable for case studies.Footnote 4
For example, very large firms are often located in ‘mono-towns’ (see Commander et al, 1996), or develop a special kind of relationship with the local or national authorities. Table A1 shows that the sample was distributed more or less evenly across the three size categories. The average firm employed 891 workers, rising from 265 in the smallest category to 1820 in the group of firms employing more than 1,000 workers. The choice of regions was based on two considerations. The relatively small size sample meant that we could not achieve representative sub-samples for all or even the majority of 89 regions (oblast, kray, republics) of Russia. On the other hand, given the regional diversity of the business and economic environment in Russia, the regional dimension has to be explicit in any analysis (see Brown and Earle, 2001). We decided, therefore, to select a limited number of regions belonging to four macro-zones: European Russia, the Volga, the Urals and Siberia. European Russia is represented by two Russian capitals – Moscow and St Petersburg – together with their respective oblasts (Moscow oblast and St Petersburg oblast); three regions belong to Volga macro-zone – Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Volgograd; the Ural macro-zone is also represented by three regions – Chelyabinsk, Perm, Ekaterinburg (Sverdlovskaya oblast), while the Siberia macro-zone includes enterprises from Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk and Omsk. We recognise that our approach does not permit reliable analysis of all regional specifics; regional policies can differ significantly within one macro-zone (Tatarstan, Uliyanovsk and Nizhny Novgorod regions in Volga zone provide well-known examples). Nevertheless, in many cases the geographical position itself and the distance from Moscow are likely to be factors contributing to the macro-zone economic environment and enterprise behaviour. We did not apply strict regional quotas because for the purposes of this study, we regarded size and industrial stratifications as the most important criteria. Indeed, we intended initially to survey in only eight regions, with one region in each macro-zone ‘reserved’ in case the size and industry quotas could not be otherwise met. This resulted in some ‘reserved’ regions having a smaller number of observations. Table A2 reports the regional distribution of the sample. Our research explores questions concern post-privatisation behaviour in former Soviet industrial enterprises, so only firms existing before 1992 (the beginning of transitional reforms in Russia) were eligible for selection. In practice, the vast majority of de novo firms were anyway excluded as a result of the lower size restriction. We also excluded fully state-owned enterprises though our population contained some ‘mixed’ state–private joint-stock companies including a few where the controlling stake belongs to Federal or Regional authorities.",

The author is also grateful to Christian Thimann, Paul Wachtel and an anonymous referee for helpful comments. Currency substitution is a particularly interesting issue in the broad geographical neighbourhood of the euro area, as in some countries in south-east Europe the euro is circulating as a parallel currency. This means that the euro is either used in fiduciary or scriptural form by private agents together with, and even instead of, the domestic currencies. While many contributions have covered this topic from the perspective of the countries concerned, this contribution refers to the ‘mirror image’ of the phenomenon, namely the perspective of the central bank that issues the euro. The Euro goes East. As its title suggests, the contribution takes a broad perspective and focuses on ‘eastern’ Europe in a wide sense, embracing all the regions to the east of the European Union (EU). Of course, this geographical reference is somewhat deceptive. Hence, the notion of ‘east’ should be taken as nothing more than a label of convenience for where most of the action is taking place, namely in central, eastern and south-east Europe. Against this background, the main messages of this contribution are as follows:
 The evidence suggests that the euro has smoothly and successfully replaced the legacy currencies, notably the Deutsche Mark (DM), in eastern Europe. A large proportion of the legacy currency banknotes circulating outside the euro area were converted into euro banknotes, whereas only a limited volume of the legacy currency banknotes may have been converted into banknotes denominated in currencies other than the euro. The euro circulates increasingly in scriptural form outside the euro area, in particular in eastern Europe, as quite unexpectedly, a significant share of the legacy currency banknotes that used to circulate outside the euro area has been deposited in euro-denominated accounts. The euro's role as a parallel currency reflects the strong financial, economic and institutional links between eastern Europe and the euro area, which are likely to become even stronger in the future.",4

The question of what exchange rate regime is optimal for emerging market countries (EMCs) becoming integrated with the international capital market has attracted special attention. The fact that all of the EMCs suffering a financial crisis in the 1990s had some kind of fixed exchange rate arrangement has discredited the so-called soft peg as a preferable or even a viable exchange rate arrangement. Even though views continued to differ about what exchange rate arrangements are appropriate for EMCs,Footnote 1 a consensus seemed to be emerging favouring the so-called corner solutions, either a flexible regime or a hard peg such as a currency board arrangement (CBA), dollarisation, or creation of a monetary union. The collapse of Argentina's CBA, accompanied by a serious currency, banking, and debt crisis, will probably have important effects on the debate about what exchange rate regimes are appropriate for EMCs. For most of the 1990s, Argentina was considered a successful economy. The view seemed widely be held that the CBA had contributed much to Argentina's successful stabilisation and resumption of growth. However, after its collapse in late 2001, history will probably judge its CBA less kindly. In this paper, I will highlight the link between the inherent vulnerability of the EMCs (the so-called original sin hypothesis) and the operation of different exchange rate regimes. I will begin with a brief review of the latest discussion about exchange rate arrangements for EMCs following the recent financial crises. Then I will discuss the structural weaknesses that typically make EMCs vulnerable to negative external shocks. I will illustrate how these weaknesses affect different currency regimes, using examples such as Argentina with its CBA, Brazil with its floating currency, and Panama with dollarisation. In the last part, I will discuss why the accession countries in Central and Eastern Europe are much less sensitive to external shocks no matter what their exchange rate regime. I will argue that the main reasons for this difference are smaller role of debt-creating flows in the financing of current account deficits, higher domestic savings, and – most important of all – the prospect of accession to the European Union (EU) and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), which provides an important anchor for market expectations and sends a credible signal of countries’ commitment to disciplined economic policies.",1

War and establishment of a new country combined with transition to a market economy in the early 1990s. The country also faced a legacy of high inflation and a high level of dollarisation. Despite this, Croatia was able to stabilise inflation in October 1993, and has maintained single-digit inflation since then. This paper will focus on the implications of high levels of dollarisation on monetary policy. I provide evidence that the level of dollarisation, which was high when Croatia became an independent country, has not significantly decreased since, despite successful stabilisation and rapid development of the banking system. Furthermore, thanks to the Euro conversion process, we now have fairly reliable estimates of the amount of foreign currency banknotes circulating in Croatia. These estimates show that the quantity of such banknotes was far greater than the quantity of domestic currency in circulation. This high level of dollarisation strongly limits the prudent degree of exchange rate flexibility. Limited exchange rate flexibility in turn limits monetary policy's ability to achieve any objectives other than price stability. First, due to balance sheet currency mismatches in the banking sector and the resulting practice of indexing credits to the exchange rate, exchange rate fluctuations have the potential to create credit quality shocks. These shocks could severely impair bank soundness and real activity in the case of substantial currency depreciation. Second, exchange rate fluctuations may cause changes in the composition of total savings. A large depreciation would risk a flight from the kuna, with strong destabilising effects. Third, exchange rate changes can pass-through to prices, although here I provide evidence that the pass-through is strongest between exchange rates and producer prices, and is actually softened by greater exchange rate volatility. Given the limits of exchange rate flexibility, one can ask whether an independent monetary policy makes sense at all. Some authors have in fact argued for an early adoption of the Euro. I argue that, at this point, early adoption of the Euro seems a very mixed bag. Its main attraction, lower inflation, is not especially relevant for Croatia. Its costs in terms of loss of lender of last reserve functions, loss of the ability to trade off between exchange rate changes and price level changes, and loss of seignorage would not be entirely negligible. The other major alternative, inflation targeting, would require tight exchange rate management, at least at the beginning. Thus inflation targeting, while perhaps a somewhat more attractive option than euroisation, would not initially represent a major change. In some ways, therefore, it seems that a ‘if it ain't broke, don't fix it’ attitude is appropriate. The paper is structured as follows. The next section provides a background on Croatia's monetary history. The subsequent section analyses empirical aspects of dollarisation and its expression in monetary policy. The last section discusses policy alternatives.",18

Israel's long experience with chronic, moderate inflation, along with a shorter period of high inflation, has generated the development of a variety of substitutes for domestic, unindexed assets. Most of these substitutes have been of the home-made variety, rather than imported, so that Israel has not experienced the kind of massive and damaging currency substitution and dollarisation that has occurred in a number of emerging market and transition economies. The Israeli government has collaborated actively in the development of indexation and foreign exchange linkage, but Israel never adopted a policy of official dollarisation. However, some conventional dollarisation has occurred in Israel. For example, cash dollars did circulate in place of local currency as means of payment and were stuffed in mattresses in place of local currency deposits and other financial assets as a store of value, but these phenomena were quite limited in scope and in duration. They took place mainly in the first half of the 1980s, when inflation reached triple-digit levels and a serious financial crisis loomed. Milder forms of currency substitution have prevailed throughout most of Israel's economic history and are the type of phenomena that continue to this day, even though Israel's inflation rate has been at single-digit levels for nearly 7 years now. These include some holding of assets abroad but the predominant form of currency substitution – and the feature that makes the Israeli case of considerable interest – is the variety of ‘home-made’ substitutes for domestic, nominally denominated assets that have been developed over the years. These include extensive indexation of assets and other contracts to the CPI and some other price indexes, as well as linkage of domestic assets to some exchange rate, mostly, but not exclusively, to the US dollar rate. The willingness of the Israeli public to hold these home-made substitutes for domestic, unindexed assets suggests that the main issue of concern was uncertainty about future returns, including inflation, real interest and the real exchange rate, while the possibility of outright expropriation by taxation or hyper-inflation was, in general, not a major concern.Footnote 1 An important feature of the currency substitution and indexation infrastructure that prevails in Israel is its inception well before the onset of a major inflationary episode. A significant period of very high or chronic inflation did not occur in Israel until the 1970s, by which time many of the key forms of indexation or dollarisation in both financial and labour markets had been in place for nearly two decades or more. The paper addresses the question of why currency substitution and indexation predated any significant inflationary episode by such a long time span. We argue that the main issue of concern to financial asset holders in Israel appears to have been significant uncertainty about moderately large swings in returns on domestic, unindexed assets, relative to alternatives while there was far less concern about the more drastic losses that would occur in the case of high inflation or expropriatory taxation of some sort. The response of policy makers to this concern was to provide Israeli households with a menu of assets that addressed this concern. In a paper entitled ‘Should Governments Learn to Live With Inflation’, Stanley Fischer and Lawrence Summers (1989) pointed out that… ‘Indexation is widespread in high inflation countries. But, despite their experience of non-negligible inflation, most industrialized countries do relatively little to mitigate its adverse affects’ (p. 382). These authors then argue that indexation has short run benefits in countries experiencing moderate to high inflation, for example, because it helps to encourage savings by providing protection from inflationary erosion. In the long run, however, indexation is no panacea. Partial alleviation of the discomfort of inflation encourages its acceleration to extremes that often get out of hand. The present paper does not elaborate on the normative question of whether it was a good idea for the Israeli government to promote the development of the indexation infrastructure as it did. Instead, we focus on the positive question of analysing the behaviour of the private sector, given that this infrastructure existed and we give an example of how our suggested analysis can be used to derive useful information for the formulation of monetary policy. Accordingly, the analytical part of the paper argues that currency substitution in Israel is best thought about as being motivated by the public's desire to diversify their asset portfolio in the face of the aforementioned uncertainty about relative returns. The type of models in the economist's tool box that best deals with this issue is the portfolio allocation and asset pricing models from finance that focus on the trade-off between risk and return. This is in contrast with more conventional approaches to currency substitution and dollarisation that emphasise money demand, that is, they focus on some non-pecuniary return, embodied in the means of payment function, that is provided more efficiently by a more stable currency than the local one. This latter approach would appear to be more useful for the more extreme forms of currency substitution, including cash dollarisation, rather than for the Israeli case. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: the next section briefly elaborates on some of the conceptual distinctions mentioned above; the subsequent section provides some history of Israel's experience with inflation and disinflation and with related features of financial repression and liberalisation, including some details on indexation and foreign exchange linkage arrangements in various sectors of the economy; further example of economic analysis related to the portfolio diversification aspect of currency substitution are presented, with implications for monetary policy analysis that are discussed in later. The final section concludes with an explanation of the sub-title of this paper.",2

Evolution of inflation in Turkey differs from other high inflation episodes in one important respect. Contrary to many other high inflation episodes, high persistent inflation in Turkey never spiralled into hyperinflation. This, coupled with macroeconomic instability and failed stabilisation efforts, in turn, led to one of the highest dollarised economies where, by the end of 2001, foreign currency deposits accounted for roughly 60 percent of total deposits (Table 1). The high level of foreign currency deposits in Turkey raises questions concerning the design, implementation and effectiveness of monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate policies. Existing studies show that dollarisation: (i) reduces the yield of the inflation tax and results in higher and more volatile inflation, for a given level of budget deficit (Nicholas, 1974; Rojas-Suarez, 1992);Footnote 1 (ii) reduces the monetary authorities' control over domestic liquidity both by increasing the component over which little direct influence can be exerted and by rendering money demand less stable (IMF, 2000); (iii) affects the choice of exchange rate regime (Berg and Borenzstein, 2000);Footnote 2 and (iv) increases the exposure of the banking system to additional risks on account of uncovered foreign liabilities.Footnote 3 Although the phenomenon of dollarisation raises many questions, investigations of policy alternatives offer few clear-cut solutions. The lack of simple policy answers is attributed to, inter alia, two factors.Footnote 4 First, the analytical work in this area has not been able to produce clear guidance in many important issues. Second, at the empirical level the absence of data on the stock of foreign currency circulating in the economy has emerged as a serious hindrance. As a consequence, empirical studies can only investigate the importance of dollarisation (foreign currency as a store of value) but not necessarily currency substitution (foreign currency as a medium of exchange). The distinction between medium of exchange substitutability and store of value substitutability is also important in assessing the stages of the dollarisation process. In this respect, casual evidence suggests that in high-inflation countries foreign currency is used initially as a store of value or unit of account, and only later as a medium exchange. As such, currency substitution can be viewed as the last stage of the dollarisation process.Footnote 5 Although several studies have investigated the dynamics of inflation in Turkey, to the best of our knowledge, existing empirical work has not explored the role of dollarisation in the inflation process. This paper attempts to fill this void in the literature on Turkey by empirically investigating the importance of dollarisation in the dynamics of inflation. The investigation also attempts to provide a brief descriptive analysis of the main macroeconomic and institutional factors affecting the evolution of the dollarisation process in Turkey. The principal conclusions that emerge from our study corroborate the importance of dollarisation in the dynamics of inflation in Turkey. The empirical findings suggest that shocks to dollarisation lead to a decline in the monetary base as the public switches from domestic to foreign money holdings. However, the monetary base increases after 5 months to generate the required inflation tax for a given budget deficit. The results also indicate that the fiscal authority tries to compensate part of the decline in inflation tax through raising administered prices. As expected, the exchange rate responds positively to shocks to dollarisation owing to the high elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign currency. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The following section provides a brief description of the main macroeconomic and institutional factors affecting the dollarisation process in Turkey. The dynamics of inflation in Turkey is discussed and the empirical results are presented later on. The final section concludes the paper.",23

It has its roots in macroeconomic instability, in particular high inflation and depreciating exchange rates, which reduce credibility in the local currency. High dollarisation – short of full, official dollarisation – is usually considered costly because of loss of seigniorage (since the demand for domestic money is lower); forgone tax revenue (as dollarisation enables underground economy activity); and a facilitation of crime and corruption, although the cause and effect here is circular. High dollarisation also exacerbates banking system vulnerabilities, with deposit dollarisation typically leading to loan dollarisation and complicating management of a crisis. However, dollarisation occurs as a free choice by rational economic agents, and therefore has a beneficial side. It is a classical inflation-beating strategy, thus it reduces the potential for inflationary finance, and allows for better portfolio diversification, which can in turn reduce or even reverse capital flight. At the outset of transition, there was very limited use of foreign currency in the countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU). As restrictions on holding foreign currency were loosened and most economies experienced high and volatile inflation rates along with sharply depreciating exchange rates, which severely hindered the basic functions of money, this encouraged dollarisation as an inflation hedge. However, despite successful stabilisation from the mid-1990s and a rapid recovery from the 1998 Russia financial crisis, the degree of dollarisation remains high. This raises several questions that motivate this paper: (i) What is the most suitable statistical measure of the dollarisation phenomenon in FSU countries? (ii) Why is the degree of dollarisation still high in FSU countries? (iii) Does high dollarisation impede effective monetary and exchange rate policy? (iv) What can and should be done (or should not be done) to reduce dollarisation? To address these, the paper is organised as follows. First, some key definitions are reviewed and measurement issues are discussed. Next, the relation between macroeconomic developments and dollarisation in FSU countries is presented. Then the monetary policy implications of dollarisation and de-dollarisation strategies are discussed. Finally, the findings are summarized.",23
45,3,Comparative Economic Studies,15 September 2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100019,"Dynamics of Currency Substitution, Asset Substitution and De facto Dollarisation and Euroisation in Transition Countries",September 2003,Edgar L Feige,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Dollarisation is the process of substituting a foreign currency for a domestic currency to fulfil the essential functions of money as a medium of exchange (currency substitution) and/or as a store of value (asset substitution). Dollarisation is official when a nation adopts de jure the currency of a foreign nation to wholly replace its domestic currency. The foreign currency thus becomes the authorised transaction medium, the store of value and the unit of account. When, in the absence of such sanctions, firms and individuals, nevertheless, voluntarily substitute a foreign currency for the domestic currency as a means of payment (currency substitution) and/or choose to hold foreign rather than domestic denominated monetary assets as stores of value (asset substitution), the dollarisation process is described as unofficial, spontaneous or de facto dollarisation. De facto dollarisation is typically the rational response of economic agents to a loss of confidence in the domestic currency, often resulting from episodes of inflation, currency devaluations and/or currency confiscations. It may also be related to the growth of underground or ‘unrecorded’ economic activities since currency, particularly foreign currency, is often the preferred medium of exchange for such transactions. De facto dollarisation leads to a loss of seigniorage, thwarts the monetary authority from pursuing inflationary finance and inhibits its effectiveness in controlling exchange rates. It also lowers the costs of tax evasion and thereby reduces the ability of the fiscal authority to command real resources from the private sector. By facilitating underground activities, de facto dollarisation can also lead to a distortion in various measures of macroeconomic activity making the formulation of macroeconomic policy more difficult. However, since de facto dollarisation represents a revealed preference for holding foreign currency as a means of reducing the risks of domestic inflation and exchange rate devaluations, its salutatory consequences include the efficiency gain from portfolio diversification, as well as reduced incentives for inflationary finance and capital flight. The dollarisation literature is replete with normative discussions concerning the wisdom of official dollarisation, but has suffered from a fundamental empirical problem when attempting to assess positive issues concerning the causes, consequences, costs and benefits of currency, and asset substitution. Calvo and Vegh (1992) observed that this ‘fundamental problem’ was due to the fact that ‘there are usually no data available on foreign currency circulating in an economy’ and hence, ‘the importance of currency substitution’ was ‘basically unobservable’. In the absence of empirical estimates of foreign currency in circulation, the profession lacked a comprehensive measure of de facto dollarisation, as well as separate empirical measures of currency substitution and asset substitution. This paper attempts to overcome these measurement issues by presenting new time series evidence on the extent to which residents of transition countries choose to use foreign currency denominated monetary assets as substitutes for domestic currency and deposits, both as a means of payment (currency substitution) and as a store of value (asset substitution).Footnote 1 In particular, I develop estimates of the amount of foreign cash (foreign currency in circulation (FCC) held in the form of dollars and euros (European legacy currencies) in transition countries. These estimates of FCC are first used to develop a comprehensive dollarisation index (CDI), defined as the percentage of the total effective broad money supply (M2+FCC) composed of foreign currency in circulation and foreign currency deposits (FCC+FCD). The resulting CDI is then compared to the traditional dollarisation index (DI) defined as the percentage of the broad money supply (M2) composed of FCDs. The traditional dollarisation measure, widely employed in dollarisation studies of the IMF, understates the magnitude of dollarisation because it relies exclusively on FCD to proxy the extent to which a nation is dollarised without taking account of FCC holdings. The following section of the paper evaluates the available evidence on the total amount of US dollars held abroad, and concludes that roughly 50 percent of US currency was held abroad at the end of 2001. We then cumulate estimates of net dollar outflows to specific transition countries (the difference between gross outflows and inflows) to obtain the amount of US dollars circulating in each transition country at the end of the year 2001. We find that roughly 29 percent of US currency in circulation was held in the transition countries. These dollar holdings comprise the major component of the FCC in FSU countries. Additionally, we employ available survey data to obtain estimates of the amounts of European legacy currenciesFootnote 2 in circulation in several CEE countries. In total, 11 of the transition countries are shown to have more than 50 percent of their total currency supply in the form of foreign currency. The subsequent section employs these FCC estimates to obtain a CDI of the extent of de facto dollarisation in each transition country and to determine the temporal trend of dollarisation over the last 5 years. These CDI measures are then compared to the traditional IMF measures of dollarisation (DI). Both measures suggest that levels of de facto dollarisation are higher in the FSU countries than in the CEE countries. Both measures indicate rising dollarisation trends in all the FSU countries and in some of the CEE countries. I also identify declining dollarisation trends in some of CEE countries with the lowest levels of dollarisation. Across CEE countries, the correlation between the CDI and DI is 0.988, however, for the more highly dollarised FSU countries, the correlation drops to 0.657. The temporal correlations between CDI and DI within countries are consistently high for the CEE countries, but highly variable among the FSU countries, ranging from 0.222 for Russia to 0.997 for Belarus. In the section thereafter, we construct temporal indices of currency substitution and asset substitution for each of the transition countries. The currency substitution index (CSI) is defined as the fraction of a nation's total effective currency supply (local plus foreign currency in circulation) that is comprised of foreign currency. The asset substitution index (ASI) is defined as the ratio of FCD to total domestic deposits. The magnitudes and temporal trends of the estimated CSI and ASI are then examined for different countries over timeFootnote 3 and space. Although currency substitution and asset substitution might be thought to be highly positively correlated over time, dominated by an income effect, it appears that for some countries, the substitution effect dominates, leading to a negative correlation between CSI and ASI measures. Indeed, the relationship between currency substitution and asset substitution appears to be much more complex and varied than is usually thought to be the case, requiring more detailed country analysis to fully understand the relationship between the two phenomena. The main purpose of this exercise is to provide the empirical underpinnings for subsequent substantive analyses of the causes and consequences of the dollarisation phenomenon and to more fully understand the motives and the implications of currency and asset substitution in both a temporal and cross-section context. Interestingly, although the currency and asset substitution processes are both believed to be driven by similar forces (ie instability), we find that empirically they need not move hand in hand, and may therefore be driven by different incentive mechanisms. This finding is reinforced when the dollarisation indices are related to currency and asset substitution indices. The final section contains a summary of our findings and conclusions as well as suggestions for further extensions of this work, particularly into the domain of monetary estimates of the unrecorded economies of transition countries. To anticipate some of our key findings, we observe that for the CEE countries, the extent of understatement of the DI is only a few percentage points on average, whereas for some of the FSU countries, the DI understates the CDI by as much as 20–40 percentage points. Our CDI measure suggests that many of the transition countries are so highly dollarised that network externalities are likely to make the dollarisation process very costly to reverse.Footnote 4 We find that in 2001, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Russia exhibit the highest degree of de facto dollarisation of the FSU countries with more than 70 percent of their effective broad money supply held in the form of foreign denominated assets (currency plus deposits). For the CEE countries, only Croatia, Macedonia and Romania have comprehensive dollarisation ratios in excess of 50 percent. The lowest de facto dollarisation (CDI<20%) is found in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the Slovak Republic.",44

Indeed, Montenegro, Kosovo, Ecuador, El Salvador and East Timor have in recent years adopted the euro or the US dollar as their currency.Footnote 1 Moreover, euroisation/dollarisation proposals have been discussed for other countries in Latin America and central and eastern Europe.Footnote 2 While most of the recent cases of euroisation/dollarisation were motivated by short-term macroeconomic stabilisation benefits, integration among currency union (CU) members is seen as a key prerequisite for the long-term sustainability of a common currency. In Europe, the question whether integration was deep enough to cope with asymmetric shocks has even been at the core of the debate on pros and cons of monetary union (Bayoumi and Eichengreen, 1993). According to the endogeneity view on optimum currency areas (OCA), however, integration can be seen as a consequence rather prerequisite for a sustainable currency union, because due to lower transaction costs a common currency itself may endogenously lead to a large increase in trade among union members. This view received support from studies by Rose (2000) and co-authors, who found that trade among countries with a common currency far exceeds trade between countries using different currencies. This paper takes a closer look at the set of countries and jurisdictions that have been members of a currency union, either in the form of unilateral euroisation/dollarisation or in the form of a multilateral currency union. In particular, the paper investigates whether they have followed additional policies fostering integration, thereby supporting the sustainability of their exchange rate regime. The findings suggest that in addition to possible trade effects of a single currency, three policies have been at work in most cases considered: (1) substantial fiscal transfers from the anchor country; (2) financial integration via the establishment of offshore financial centres; and (3) real integration via tourism. These policies largely relied on factors exogenous to the monetary regime – such as strong historical and political ties with the anchor country, size, geographical location and political stability. As these factors cannot be assumed to be given for many other countries, the paper concludes that some caution might indeed be warranted when using the experience of sustained cases of euroisation/dollarisation as an example supporting the endogeneity view of optimum currency areas. The paper is structured as follows. The main issues of the current debate on euroisation/dollarisation are summarised. Then an overview of the sustained cases of euroisation/dollarisation is provided. Next the three specific features mentioned above are reviewed: financial dependence through official development assistance or outright subsidies; offshore financial centres; and tourism.

Table 1 provides summary data of the economic situation on the eve of independence. Together with Azerbaijan, the Central Asian republics were the poorest Soviet republics. Although inequality, as measured by Gini coefficients did not differ much from the Soviet norm, poverty was higher. Human capital measures, such as life expectancy or literacy, were high for the income level. The Central Asian republics' economic role in the USSR had been as suppliers of primary products, mainly cotton, oil and natural gas, and minerals, although the specific resource endowment varied from country to country. The terms of trade calculations reflect the underpricing of energy and overpricing of manufactured goods in the Soviet economy; Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan as major exporters of oil and natural gas benefited substantially from the shift to world prices, while the other Central Asian successor states gained sufficiently from improved prices for cotton and minerals and lower prices for manufactured goods to more or less offset the higher prices of energy imports. At independence, the five countries faced three major economic challenges: (1) the transition from central planning, (2) the dissolution of the Soviet economy (and of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance) and need to construct national institutions, and (3) hyperinflation (Table 2). Four of them have experienced political continuity, with Gorbachev-appointed First Secretaries becoming Presidents and retaining power through elections which were, to varying degrees, unfree. Tajikistan is the exception, with a civil war for much of the 1990s, and even after the 1997 peace accord the central government does not control the entire country (and its policy implementation is universally weak). Despite the common backgrounds and problems, the countries have adopted surprisingly diverse economic policies. I will briefly indicate the principal elements, especially those relevant for measuring economic performance, without pretending to provide a full account. The Kyrgyz Republic is by some measures the most economically liberal of all Soviet successor states; in 1998, for example, it became the first to join the World Trade Organization. On the other hand, markets do not always function well in this small and poor country. The institutional support for market mechanisms is weak, and the key markets for forex and capital are thin. The country's adverse initial conditions included a manufacturing sector that was exceptionally integrated into the Soviet network, with a heavy emphasis on military equipment and the largest single enterprise processed Cuban sugarcane. Manufacturing output fell substantially during the 1990s, and the increased share of agriculture in GDP primarily reflected urban–rural migration as unemployed urban workers returned to their family's village (Table 3). The only major growth pole has been the Kumtor gold mine.Footnote 1 After a banking crisis in 1998, reforms were put on hold, but the economy (and the political environment) remains open relative to the rest of Central Asia. Turkmenistan is at the opposite extreme in terms of liberalism. A personalised autocracy has limited economic change, while using the resource rents for populist policies (free utilities and other necessities) and monument-building (Ochs, 1997; Lubin, 1999; Pomfret, 2001). Prices remain distorted, favouring import-substitution projects, especially in textiles and petrochemicals, and hurting farmers (Pastor and van Rooden, 2000). The currency is not convertible, and the official exchange rate is artificial, with a black market premium of around 300%.Footnote 2 Privatisation has been limited to small-scale enterprises and few new enterprises have emerged. Economic performance has depended heavily on natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil exports, which benefited from the shift to world prices in the early 1990s but have been hampered by the inherited pipeline network and slow progress on constructing new pipelines. Several CIS customers fell behind in payments for their gas and in 1997 Turkmenistan responded by cutting off deliveries with dramatic impact on GDP (Table 4); deliveries were only resumed in 1999. Kazakhstan is also energy rich, and had perhaps the most favourable initial conditions of the five countries due to its relatively high initial income and human capital. The regime was initially seen as liberal, but in the mid-1990s doubts arose over the quality of governance (Kalyuzhnova, 1998; Olcott, 2002). Mineral production and processing has been disrupted by the breakdown of Soviet-era links to Russian users, and a striking phenomenon is the three dozen or more “company towns” dependent on a single large enterprise which has been in dire straits since independence. Continued close economic ties to Russia contributed to negative growth in 1998, following the Russian crisis. A subsequent currency devaluation and increased oil prices underlay the accelerated growth in 2000. In Uzbekistan, although the political regime is authoritarian and illiberal, the government has moved albeit cautiously to establish a market economy and it has provided good governance in moderating corruption, providing infrastructure and maintaining social expenditures (Pomfret and Anderson, 1997; Spechler, 1999; Pomfret, 2000c). Macro-economic control was achieved more slowly than in the Kyrgyz Republic or Kazakhstan, with inflation only dropping below 50% in 1998 (Table 2). Price and enterprise reform proceeded slowly, but by 1996 practically all prices had been liberalised and housing and small enterprises have been privatised. Cotton and wheat, however, remain subject to state orders (Pomfret, 2000b), and privatisation of large enterprises has proceeded at a glacial speed. Trade policy is liberal as export taxes imposed in the early 1990s have been removed, but its impact has been negated since October 1996 when, in response to balance of payments problems following a decline in world cotton prices, stringent foreign exchange controls were re-introduced. The consequence in the remainder of the 1990s was a steadily widening gap between the official and the black market exchange rates, leading to substantial resource misallocation (Rosenberg and de Zeeuw, 2000).Footnote 3 Import-substituting industrialisation projects were favoured, although there were signs in the early 2000s that the government was reversing this strategy and taking a more hands-off approach to economic development.Footnote 4 Tajikistan is sometimes viewed as having made progress towards establishing a market-based economy, but implementation of consistent economic policies has been frustrated by the intermittent civil war throughout the 1990s. The economic disruption is captured in the huge decline in per capita output during the first half of the 1990s (Table 4), and even after peace was negotiated in 1997 the political situation remained fragile and economic progress difficult. The poor security situation discouraged investment, and lack of unified control also deterred economic activity because separate agencies seek to raise revenue by taxes and fees.Footnote 5 The government was kept afloat in the early and mid-1990s by military loans from Russia and after 1997 by aid from the multilateral international financial institutions and from other donors. Since 1997 legislation has been liberal, but implementation is poor, and it is difficult to judge whether current policies should be assessed on the basis of the former or the latter.",10

The list included 232 schools, roughly equally divided between colleges and universities. We received responses from 80 different schools, 43 liberal arts colleges and 37 universities. These included those that offer courses in our area of interest and those that do not. Our e-mails were addressed to either department chairs or to the individual who we had learned from the departmental website was teaching a course on comparative systems or transition economies. The e-mail described the survey and included a link to the website on which it could be taken.Footnote 2
If the initial recipient felt there was another member of their department better able to answer questions about course offerings in our area of interest, we asked that they not complete the survey but send us the contact information for that colleague. For those at schools offering courses in comparative systems and/or transitioning economies, the survey was designed to last roughly 20 mins. Most questions focused on the instructors' backgrounds and their current course offerings, but some addressed their attitudes and thoughts about future changes in course content. For respondents at institutions not offering courses in the area, the survey could be completed in 5 mins. Given that most respondents do empirical research and thus understand the need for accurate answers, we feel that non-sampling error due to incorrect information is limited. Non-response, however, was a potential source of error in the data. As mentioned, we did not obtain a full census of the population, thus introducing the possibility of sampling error. There may, for instance, have been some selection bias with respect to the individuals or the schools that answered our survey. Were we more likely to receive responses from schools that continue to offer courses in these areas? In this regard, there is little reason to believe that our sample is biased. An extensive examination of departmental course offerings via their websites found that of the 152 colleges and universities who did not respond to our survey, 83 currently offer courses in our area of interest. That is, 55% of the non-responding schools offer such courses. This closely mirrors the 57% of the responding schools that do.Footnote 3
Roughly, 63% of the responding liberal arts schools offer a course in these areas, whereas only half of the responding national universities do. Among non-responding schools, these numbers are 51% and 56%, respectively.Footnote 4 Finally, there is potential bias regarding item non-response since some respondents did not answer every single question. This is most relevant for those reporting that they did teach at least one course exclusively devoted to post-communist economies, the economics of transition or comparative systems. For these schools, there was some non-response on questions about their course offerings. However, the amount of missing data was not significant, nor does non-response appear to be systematically related to respondent characteristics.Footnote 5 We should note that ours is not the first such survey to be conducted since the collapse of socialist systems. In the spring of 1993, Clark Ross sent a shorter but similarly themed questionnaire to 92 leading liberal arts colleges and universities and received responses from 32 (Ross, 1995). Later in this paper, we use Ross' analysis and exploit the passage of time to help assess trends in instruction over the past decade.",5

Rather than engaging in a wide range of economic activities as under central planning, the government should be shifting its focus towards providing public goods and services, achieving society's distributive goals, and ensuring macroeconomic stability – the so-called classical functions of government (Tanzi and Schuknecht, 2000). Not only should the structure of government be changing in terms of its expenditure and revenue mobilisation roles at different levels, but new institutions (eg, in the budget area) should be emerging to shape the interface with the rest of the economy. This paper assesses the changes observed so far in the size and scope of government in transition economies and the extent to which these changes are appropriate and adequate. It has often been argued that governments in transition economies are trying to do too much relative to their limited capacity for raising revenue. While there are several indicators suggesting a decline in the size of government in transition economies, this paper finds that the size continues to be large and the scope, inappropriate, in many cases. An analysis of the size and scope of government in transition economies is complicated by at least four factors. First, the coverage of government accounts as reported in the budget is often incomplete and may vary across time.Footnote 1 Second, a full record of commitments entered into by all spending units is usually not available. Third, the use of noncash transactions by the government (eg, tax offsets or ‘netting operations’, and in-kind payments) to settle accounts with the private sector further complicates the analysis. Finally, governments in some cases influence private sector activities in ways that are difficult to capture in reported statistics. For example, many governments in transition economies engage in quasifiscal activities and impose regulations to support public programmes and activities in order to cope with falling revenues (Tanzi, 1998). The rest of this paper is organised as follows. The following section surveys the literature. The next section describes recent trends and indicators of government size. Finally, policy lessons are drawn in the last section.",9

We argue that the observed real appreciation of the last few years can be partially ascribed in most cases to the workings of the Balassa–Samuelson effect. We also found that the real appreciation trend results from higher domestic inflation rather than a nominal appreciation of the exchange rate. Interestingly, inflationary pressures seem to arise irrespective of the exchange rate regime and could be partially attributed to rigidities in the non-tradable sectors in transition economies. However, neither the Balassa–Samuelson effect nor these rigidities can be considered a justification for flexible exchange rates. Indeed, wage and price setters internalise the exchange rate accommodation rule and a higher inflation rate would arise. A non-accommodating stance of the exchange rate policy – for instance, an early adoption of the euro – would avoid this outcome, although the resulting benefits may not be the same for every country (Nuti, 2000). Output in the non-tradable sector would decline temporarily, but the adverse effects of monopoly power on welfare would be contained as the rate of inflation declines. The effects on price setting in the non-tradable sector are likely to more than compensate for the Balassa–Samuelson effects. Nevertheless, if the Balassa–Samuelson effects were predominant, a change in the Maastricht criteria would be advisable (Buiter and Grafe, 2002). The paper proceeds as follows. Next section contains a short overview of stylised facts and different interpretations of the real exchange rate appreciation in transition economies, including evidence on the Balassa–Samuelson effect in transition economies. Section on A simple analytical framework and econometric results presents a simple analytical framework and econometric results on determinants of real exchange rate behaviour. It is argued that structural reforms implemented in transition economies have indeed determined the level of real exchange rate during the transition process. These results are used to draw conclusions on the implications for Maastricht criteria and the choice of an exchange rate regime. Finally, the conclusions are presented.",1

EMU candidate countries must adhere to the new exchange mechanism, ERM II, and maintain parity between their currency and the euro within a ±15% margin. This margin needs to be maintained for at least 2 years before they can qualify to join the euro area (Stage III of EMU). Along with this requirement, the candidate countries have to follow credible monetary and fiscal policies toward EMU reference values for inflation and interest rates, and government deficit and debt, respectively. Leading candidate countries like Hungary face a severe conflict. Although stable exchange rates may bring about more rapid integration into the EU and relatively rapid nominal convergence, stable rates are likely to delay the catch-up process with the EU member countries in terms of productivity, income, wages, and wealth. The catch-up process implies that productivity, income, and wages levels in candidate countries must rise faster than those in member countries. Exchange rates in these countries must adjust to reflect these developments. If exchange rates cannot adjust, this will put pressure on the balance of payments and the real exchange rate, thus delaying the catch-up process (van Brabant, 2002). Thus candidate countries need to choose an optimal exchange rate management policy during the interim period. In this paper, we focus on ‘monetary policy’ convergence issues. These issues should be relevant to policy-makers who are attempting to choose the optimal interim exchange rate policy.Footnote 1 More specifically, we measure the effect of shifts in Euro-area monetary policy during the 1990s, proxied by shifts in German interest rates and euro-area interest rates, on Hungarian industrial production and prices.Footnote 2 Although the discussion focuses on Hungary, the main points are likely to be applicable to other advanced candidate countries. Our basic thesis is that if Hungarian and Euro-area output and prices respond in a similar way to shifts in Euro-area monetary policy, we would conclude that an early move to a fixed exchange rate with the euro would be feasible and desirable. If the Hungarian economy appears to be hypersensitive to shifts in Euro-area monetary policy, then a more flexible exchange rate regime would help insulate the Hungarian economy from the effects of Euro-zone monetary policy. If the Hungarian economy appears to be relatively insensitive to shifts in Euro-zone monetary policy, then Hungary has a long way to go before it will be ready to join the Stage II of the EMU, for the process of joining the Euro will require a lengthy transition period during which macroeconomic institutions such as wage- and price-setting structures and trade and capital flows adjust to a new regime of Euro dominance (Kutan and Brada, 2000). A move toward a harder peg would be the recommended policy in this case. The paper proceeds as follows: first we provide an overview of exchange rate policy in Hungary since the beginning of economic reforms in 1990. Next we offer historical and theoretical background for the exchange rate policy choices facing Hungary. Then we briefly describe our methodology and discuss our results along with the policy implications. The last section concludes the paper.",10

Adoption of the euro, in turn, will promote the integration of the acceding economies with the rest of the euro area. While these Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) are likely to gain in the long run from the reduced transaction costs, the loss of monetary sovereignty may create problems in the near term as they attempt to catch up with the economic standard of other euro participants. Given the relatively low weight of CEECs compared to the current members of the euro area, these countries are likely to bear the brunt of necessary adjustments to the euro area's common monetary policy. The costs of participation in the EMU depend to a certain extent on the similarity between business cycles in the euro area and acceding countries.Footnote 1 Numerous studies assess the potential gains and problems related to CEEC participation in the euro area, and our survey of this literature finds that a surprisingly large majority support the view that acceding countries have business cycles already fairly well synchronised with the EU area – a criterion they need to meet under the optimum currency area (OCA) theory. Fidrmuc (2001a) questions this view, however, arguing that the available time period needed to establish such synchronisation is too short to base such an assumption reliably. Indeed, many of these studies review periods of 7 years or less, implying that only a single business cycle is covered by the available data. For this reason, the slowdown of the EU economy in 2000–2002 may provide useful information on the similarity of business cycles between countries in the euro area and CEECs. We thus examine the correlation of supply and demand shocks between the CEECs and the euro area, including the recent slowdown of the economy. Our purpose is to assess whether the EU acceding countries belong to the same optimum currency area as current members of the monetary union. In particular, we update the data used by Fidrmuc and Korhonen (2003) for the second half of the 1990s. Frenkel and Nickel (2002), using a different source of data for a slightly more recent period, also follow this approach. Next, we compare our results to these two studies. In general, we find that the recent slowdown has increased the heterogeneity within the EU, as well as within CEECs. This is particularly true for demand shocks. Nevertheless, several transition countries (especially Poland and Hungary) display comparably high correlations of supply shocks. As a result, these countries likely face lower costs than other acceding countries from participation in the euro area. More flexible policies appear desirable for the remaining CEECs. We recover the supply and demand shocks from two-variable (output and inflation) vector autoregressive (VAR) models with the help of the decomposition developed by Blanchard and Quah (1989). Different shocks are identified from the VAR residuals with the help of a restriction that demand shocks cannot have a permanent effect on output. The same procedure has been used before to assess whether the current European monetary union constitutes an optimum currency area, by e.g. Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1993). A priori, it seems reasonable to expect a high correlation of business cycles. Most CEEC foreign trade is conducted with EU countries (see Fidrmuc, 2001a). We see that the synchronisation of business cycles, especially that of supply shocks, positively correlates with certain indicators on transition progress and integration into the EU. The paper is organised as follows: the next section reviews the literature on optimum currency area theory as it relates to the acceding countries of Central and Eastern Europe.Footnote 2 Then the data used to recover supply and demand shocks are described. Next, we estimate shocks and assess their nature across countries. Subsequently, we look at the potential factors affecting the synchronisation of business cycles in the CEECs with the EU in the penultimate section. The final section offers concluding remarks.",36
46,1,Comparative Economic Studies,03 March 2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100041,The Balassa–Samuelson Effect in Central Europe: A Disaggregated Analysis,March 2004,Dubravko Mihaljek,Marc Klau,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper provides estimates of the Balassa–Samuelson effect – the extent to which differences in productivity growth between tradable and non-tradable industries explain the observed differences in inflation between central European countries and the euro area. The Balassa–Samuelson effect has major implications for interpretation of the inflation and exchange rate criteria for membership in the European monetary union (EMU). If the productivity growth differential between the traded and non-traded goods sectors is larger in the accession countries than in the euro area, the relative price of non-traded to traded goods will be rising faster in the accession countries than in the euro area. Under a fixed exchange rate regime, the Balassa–Samuelson effect will result in CPI inflation and real exchange rate appreciation. Under a flexible exchange rate regime, it will result in some combination of nominal appreciation and CPI inflation. If the Balassa–Samuelson effect is strong, the authorities in countries with fixed exchange rate regimes might feel compelled to maintain very restrictive monetary and fiscal policies in order to meet the Maastricht inflation criterion, putting at risk growth and employment. On the other hand, the authorities in countries with flexible exchange rate regimes might feel compelled to allow the exchange rate to appreciate rapidly, which may attract volatile capital inflows and hurt competitiveness. The available estimates of the Balassa–Samuelson effect in central European countries range from zero to 4 percentage points per annum (see Table 1). However, most of the studies do not test the extent to which productivity differentials explain the differences in inflation between accession countries and the euro area. Rather, they test a related ‘domestic’ version of this hypothesis developed by Baumol and Bowen (1966), according to which service prices grow faster than manufactured goods prices due to faster productivity growth in manufacturing industries. Such estimates do not shed any light on the policy issue noted above – whether, and to what extent, productivity growth differentials can account for CPI increases above the Maastricht inflation criterion. The additional inflation can be explained in terms of underlying productivity developments only if the productivity growth differential (between traded and non-traded industries) is sufficiently higher in accession countries than in the euro area. Against this background, this paper aims to assess, with some degree of accuracy, the empirical relevance of the Balassa–Samuelson effect in six central European countries – Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. The paper extends previous work by clarifying testable hypotheses, that is, the international and domestic versions of the Balassa–Samuelson effect, and by considering a disaggregated set of tradable and non-tradable industries as well as larger data samples. The paper finds clear evidence of the Balassa–Samuelson effect – in both its international and domestic versions – in all six countries. However, the size of the effect is found to be relatively small. Productivity differentials vis-à-vis the euro area explain on average only between 0.2 and 2.0 percentage points in annual inflation differentials, considerably less than the observed inflation differentials. Likewise, sectoral productivity growth differentials explain a relatively small proportion of domestic CPI inflation in individual countries. The paper argues that many previous studies had obtained higher estimates of the Balassa–Samuelson effect because they had neglected to consider inflation and sectoral productivity growth relative to the euro area, focusing instead only on the impact of productivity differentials on domestic inflation. Moreover, many studies had neglected to take into account relatively high productivity growth in non-tradable industries. The next two sections lay out the analytical and empirical framework used in the paper. Then historical trends in inflation and productivity differentials are looked at. Next, econometric estimates of international and domestic versions of the Balassa–Samuelson effects are provided. The concluding section discusses some policy implications of the results.",55

Lessons from the Hungarian Experiences in the pre-EU period,March 2004,Agnes Csermely,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Hungary's preparedness for Eurozone membership should be assessed both in terms of real and nominal convergence. The level of real convergence reveals whether joining the euro area will increase or mitigate the volatility of business cycles, and whether the monetary policy in the euro area is capable of taking the place of independent Hungarian monetary policy in smoothing out cyclical fluctuations. Prior to Eurozone entry, nominal convergence means the fulfillment of the Maastricht criteria in terms of a low and stable inflationary environment, sustainable fiscal position and exchange rate stability. In this section, we briefly summarise Hungary's current position in the convergence process and further steps required for Eurozone accession. Per capita GDP measured on a PPP basis in Hungary was roughly half the EU level in 2002 (53%), significantly (12% points) below that of Greece, the least developed Eurozone member. However, from a monetary policy standpoint, real convergence required by introduction of the euro can be best analysed within the optimal currency area (OCA) theory framework. The five major OCA criteria are: openness, trade integration, cyclical harmonisation and structural similarities of the economies; and the flexibility of labour and goods markets. A recent Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) studyFootnote 1 has analysed these criteria in depth, with the following conclusions. Hungary's openness and trade integration with the euro area is already high both in terms of quantitative measures such as the share of euro area trade in GDP, and on the basis of more qualitative indicators such as the share of intra-industry trade or the penetration of high value-added markets (Figure 1). Openness. Source: MNB. The structure of the Hungarian economy, that is the shares of different sectors in employment and GDP, is broadly similar to the Eurozone average. In other words, the Hungarian economy has made significant progress in structural convergence towards the euro area over the past decade. Thus, sector-specific shocks tend to have a similar effect in the euro area as in Hungary. Hence, common monetary policy responses to such sectoral shocks at the euro area level also appear to be appropriate in the case of Hungary. There exists a certain degree of asymmetry in a few specific industries within manufacturing, but this does not exceed the asymmetry experienced by the current smaller euro-area members. The flexibility of labour and goods markets is also in line with that of the Eurozone countries. Wage adjustments in Hungary are relatively flexible and performed within a similar institutional framework to that in the EMU, while price adjustments are frequent without major rigidities. There is also some evidence that, since the mid-1990s, the business cycle in Hungary has become largely synchronised with the cycle in the EMU, at least as much as the business cycles of peripheral euro area members (Figure 2). Provided that this trend is permanent, the anti-cyclical monetary policy of the European Central Bank will have the desirable cyclical smoothing effect on the Hungarian economy. Cyclical harmonisation. Source: MNB. All in all, assessment of the traditional OCA criteria shows that the loss of monetary independence as a stabilisation tool will not be a significant cost, as Hungary and the Eurozone form at least as optimal a currency area as the less developed euro member countries. Furthermore, foregoing an independent currency will bring about significant gains in GDP growth through the following key channels: reduced transaction costs, expansion of foreign trade, a drop in real interest rates and the easing of the current account constraint. In addition, by joining monetary union, the country would be less vulnerable to sudden reversals of capital flows, which make the implementation of independent monetary policy more costly and less successful than a more or less appropriate imported policy. These arguments support an early euro area entry strategy for Hungary. Although euro area membership would bring about significant welfare gains in the longer term, meeting the nominal convergence criteria requires further adjustments both in inflation and the fiscal position, which may entail economic costs related to the speed of the convergence process. Assessing the feasibility of rapid adjustment one should consider that Hungary's progress in nominal convergence is in many respects similar to that of the ‘peripheral’ Eurozone members five years prior to their entry (Figure 3). The only exception is the Hungarian budget deficit, which was quite close to the 3% of GDP level required by Maastricht in 2000, but deteriorated significantly in 2001–2002. Meeting the inflation criteria also requires further efforts from economic policy. Even if the deviation from the inflation criterion does not seem large in comparison to the peripheral countries, Hungary has not yet achieved an established low-inflation environment. The results of rapid disinflation experienced in the period of 2001–2002 appear to be rather fragile as they were accompanied by large appreciation of the currency, and households' inflation expectations are still stuck in the double-digit range.

The purpose of this paper is to provide such a cost–benefit analysis for Poland. Opponents of currency unions usually emphasise the costs of relinquishing monetary policy autonomy leading to potentially greater output fluctuations arising from idiosyncratic shocks. Proponents often point to the higher output in the long run as a major benefit stemming from monetary integration. This paper attempts to assess the costs and benefits of the euro adoption in Poland by gauging the potential for rising output volatility after joining the euro area and calibrating the growth effects triggered by monetary integration. The result of this assessment is that – given the advanced process of economic integration between Poland and the euro area – the costs of abandoning autonomous monetary policy are likely to be modest. Furthermore, it is shown that in the long run the adoption of the euro will raise GDP per capita in Poland by 4%–7%. This effect is likely to be magnified by the intangible gains from monetary integration. Therefore, the chief finding of the paper is that in the long run Poland is likely to benefit significantly from adopting the euro. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, a brief overview of potential costs arising from Poland's EMU accession is given. In this section emphasis is placed on the issue of asymmetric shock exposure of the Polish economy and the attendant risk of rising output variability after the introduction of the euro. Further in this section, the efficiency of the exchange rate adjustment mechanism and the role of a floating exchange rate as a shock-generator rather than a shock-absorber is discussed. In the section following the next, the benefits of joining the euro area are addressed. Here the three most frequently discussed issues, namely the transaction costs, trade and interest rate channels, are analysed. These considerations are accompanied by a tentative assessment of the long-run growth effects arising from the euro adoption in Poland. In the penultimate section an overall balance of potential costs and benefits arising from Poland's EMU accession is presented. The last section concludes the paper.",8

Therefore, Croatia is in the third row as far as euro adoption is concerned, after the eurozone countries and three non-eurozone countries of the EU and the first-wave candidate countries, which will join the EU in 2004. Croatia differs from the first-wave accession countries in at least two important ways. First, it will have the opportunity to introduce the euro later, at the end of this decade at the earliest. Second, Croatia is already much more euroised than any of the first-wave accession countries. This paper will demonstrate that Croatia, as a highly euroised economy, has a strong incentive to adopt euro as soon as it becomes feasible. Costs of doing so are smaller because the degrees of freedom for an independent monetary policy-making are already reduced, while the benefits are higher. A special benefit that a heavily euroised economy derives from formally adopting the euro is removal of relatively high costs of prudential regulation connected to balance sheet risk and a possible run on the foreign exchange liabilities of the banking system. The paper is organised as follows. First, we describe the extent of de facto euroisation of the Croatian economy. Then, we discuss its implications for the financial stability and monetary policy. We describe constraints it puts on the policy-makers and need for tight regulatory standards due to high balance sheet risks. In the fifth part, we look at the incentives to adopt the euro, at how well Croatia fulfills OCA criteria and at its readiness to fulfill the Maastricht criteria. Then we conclude.",4

The four papers included in this section provide a very good picture of this discussion. In fact, they are important and highly pertinent contributions to the ongoing debate. At the same time, the four papers offer a striking illustration of the varieties of factors related to Monetary Union and the diversity of perspectives and aspects considered important in different countries. For example, where Borowski bases his argument on the overall macroeconomic cost–benefit story, Vujc̆ic̆ stresses the financial market dimension. These differences are, of course, justified given the variety of starting points and the varying weights policymakers in different countries have given to these policy problems. On the other hand, the effects of monetary integration will impact these countries with varying degrees of intensity. This creates two problems, perhaps more from a political than an economic point of view, that may be important as the process of integration proceeds. (i) The first problem is the gap between existing expectations and future developments. If the integration runs smoothly and there are no additional disturbances, monetary integration should generate positive benefits, but it will not solve all the problems. The requirement to satisfy pre-specified criteria to participate in monetary union can serve as a powerful policy instrument to address a wide number of policy issues. But flexibility must be maintained. In both the medium and long term, the programme to join the Monetary Union should not be treated as a ‘deus ex machina’. To do so may lead to a dangerous underestimation of policy needs and create a large gap between expectations and the reality of Monetary Union, which may lead to disappointment and a weaker commitment from the population. Borowski provides a good example of this problem, the important benefit of creating/joining a Monetary Union comes from the ‘dynamic effects’ on investment and growth (Baldwin, 1992). Unfortunately, these large effects are uncertain and depend on how a country creates opportunities. Empirical estimates of these effects vary widely and are sometimes close to zero. Presently, we understand little about the size of the long-term net benefits, or how long it will take for these benefits to materialise.
Footnote 1 Care should therefore be exercised in advertising that there will be sizable benefits from Monetary Union, as the potential benefits are not automatic and will take time and effort to develop. (ii) The second problem is implicit in the fact that these countries have given different weights to the economic problems they face. It is a strong indication that the risk of asymmetric shocks may be much more pronounced than usually expected. Under these conditions, much more effort and flexibility will be needed to adjust economic structures. Care must be taken in analysing the differences between countries and in drawing general conclusions from this about the integration process. A useful approach to further explore monetary policy and monetary integration of current and prospective EU accession countries is to ask where is the common ground in the discussion on these matters and what are the open issues. It is generally agreed that the endpoint of the monetary integration process is the adoption of the euro, upon having achieved a high degree of sustainable convergence. In economic terms, there is widespread agreement that the long-term net benefits of future participation in the single currency area should be positive, given that the new member states are small open economies, and the EU is the focal point in terms of trade and financial integration. The institutional framework that will govern the monetary integration of current and future acceding countries was agreed in the accession negotiations, based on EU Treaty provisions, and is described well in the four papers. Previous convergence assessments, in conjunction with Ecofin reports on the exchange rate aspects of enlargement, provide guidance on the practical application of the convergence criteria that have to be met for the adoption of the euro. As pointed out in several other contributions to this volume, for countries entering the EU in May 2004 the earliest possible date for joining the euro area presumably is January 2007. This follows from the required minimum stay of 2 years in ERM II without severe tensions, which is a pre-condition for a positive convergence assessment.",

Let us consider four different concepts of debt that all have an important role in our economy, which is becoming more and more open and interconnected with world markets each day. We need to distinguish between private (enterprise and household sector) debt and state (central budget, social security, local governments) debt. Likewise, external debt should be clearly distinguished from domestic debt. 12. In a small, open and underdeveloped economy the most important engine of real convergence is the rapid growth of productive investments. These are realized in and by the enterprise sector. Investments are financed not only by internally generated funds, that is, accumulated profit, of enterprises and additional equity capital but also from funds borrowed from other sectors through bank loans and bond issues, that is to say, by debt. The more successful an enterprise, the more of its own funds will become available and the more the enterprise can invest. More rapid growth will generate more future income and the enterprise will be able to borrow more from the banking sector and on capital markets. 13. Growing indebtedness of the enterprise sector is, therefore, beneficial because this is the primary motor of rapid economic growth. If financial resources are intermediated in an efficient way by the banks and capital markets then indebtedness of individual enterprises has a natural limit and massive bankruptcy of enterprises and a subsequent implosion of the whole economy can well be avoided. 14. In order for the enterprises to raise more and more outside funds, it is indispensable that these funds be available. There is a need for savings to exist in the economy generated by agents willing to lend these funds for investment by way of intermediation through the banking sector and capital markets. Outside the enterprises there are three such economic agents: households, the state and the external sector. 15. In the previous non-market system households typically saved a lot because many expensive consumer goods could be purchased only after a long period of (voluntary) savings. Many other consumer goods, however, were in short supply so that real and symbolic queues were formed with forced savings and a monetary overhang. In a market economy, people save for lifetime investments (pension, education of their children, health insurance, etc.), but it is also likely that they will borrow because an increasing number of expensive items – for example, houses, cars, etc. – can be purchased by retail loans. 16. In the present phase of convergence, households tend to save less in the transition economies because it is the first time in 50 years that people can buy houses and cars by using loans. This is obviously an option only for those who have sufficient disposable income to repay their loans. If their savings go down, then the aggregate savings of the entire household sector will also decline because low-income people cannot save. This is exactly what is happening now in Central Europe: while enterprises need more and more external funds for investments, household savings can finance less and less of these needs. 17. One might wonder whether the state could rally to the support of the enterprises. It would be conceivable only if the state saved, if its income exceeded its expenditure, that is, if the fiscal sector had a surplus. But the state typically spends more than its revenue. The very existence of a fiscal deficit, therefore, reduces further investment and growth in the enterprise sector. 18. In the market for savings we now have two economic agents with patterns of regular overspending: the enterprises and the state. If household savings are insufficient to cover even the borrowing requirements of the enterprise sector, not to speak of the financing needs of the government, there is only one way out: the importation of foreign savings. The deficit of the current account shows exactly this relationship in the savings–investment balance. 19. As we argued in paragraph 8, the regular injection of foreign savings into the financial circulation of the domestic economy is not only beneficial but also sustainable if it is primarily in the form of direct investment rather than borrowing. But even enterprise borrowing can be beneficial and sustainable if funds are used efficiently for investments that would generate more exports. Is this what is happening in Hungary today ?",1

Integration involves liberalising both foreign trade and investment. The benefits of integration include growth in the gains from trade according to comparative advantage, increased foreign investment, and access to the world's best technology and management practices. Trade liberalisation involves ending the state's monopoly on foreign trade, as well as reducing domestic price controls and barriers to trade. Lessening these controls results in world market prices becoming the dominant factor in determining domestic prices. The movement in relative domestic prices (price ratios) to relative world prices becomes the very means by which countries gain from trade according to comparative advantage. Countries benefit from producing for export those goods whose domestic prices (reflecting costs) initially are less than world prices (at existing exchange rates), and from producing less and importing more of those goods whose domestic prices are initially above world prices. Russia has strengthened its policy of trade liberalisation by moving to (generally) floating exchange rates, such that rates are determined mainly by flows in trade and capital investment. This paper examines the transmission between changes in both world trade prices and Russian exchange rates and changes in Russian consumer retail prices for meat. The empirical focus of the paper is estimation of price and exchange rate transmission elasticities (TEs) for Russia during 1994–1999 for beef and pork. The estimated TEs are useful for two reasons. The first is as indicators of Russia's progress toward its reform goal of integrating its agricultural and food economy into the world agricultural economy. As implied earlier, the degree to which world prices determine domestic prices is a good indicator of an economy's integration into world markets. The transmission of changes in world prices to domestic prices is in turn a strong indicator that world prices are largely determining domestic prices (an example of good transmission being that a 10 percent rise in the world price for wheat raises Russia's domestic prices for wheat by 10 percent). If transmission for Russia is poor, domestic agriculture and food prices will likely deviate from world prices, such that the country's commodity volumes and mix of trade will be suboptimal (not at the levels that maximise the gains from trade). The second reason TE estimates are useful is for forecasting. Predicting changes in Russian agricultural and food production, consumption, and trade, as well as how such changes would affect world agricultural prices and trade volumes, requires knowledge of price and exchange rate transmission. Commodity forecasting models for Russian agriculture, such as those of the Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, explicitly require values for price and exchange rate transmission elasticities. A number of studies (Gardner and Brooks, 1994; DeMasi and Koen, 1996; Berkowitz et al., 1998; Goodwin et al., 1999; Loy and Wehrheim, 1999; Berkowitz and DeJong, 2001) have examined price integration for foodstuffs within Russia – that is, how well domestic food markets work to eliminate price differences between regions. These studies are related to the issue of price and exchange rate transmission, in that the factors that segment domestic regional markets are also likely to weaken transmission between world and domestic prices. The studies, in general, find that Russian domestic price integration is far from complete – that is, that regional agricultural and food markets within Russia are segmented from each other. Gardner and Brooks, DeMasi and Koen, and Loy and Wehrheim find that price cointegration between regions has been poor – that is, substantial variation in food prices has existed between regions that cannot be explained by distance and transport costs. The results of Goodwin et al. are more mixed, as prices in retail stores are more integrated than those in farmers' markets. Berkowitz et al. finds the greatest degree of price integration, though it is still not strong. Although these studies can help in gauging the general magnitude of price and exchange rate transmission in Russian agriculture, they do not specifically measure transmission. Also, with the exception of the work by Berkowitz and DeJong, which covers the second half of the 1990s, these works encompass only the early transition years (not going beyond 1995). Our study, on the other hand, covers 1994–99. Lastly, our study estimates TE for 31 cities within Russia, and thereby allows us to determine which cities (or regions) have stronger transmission, reflecting better policies and infrastructure for linking the domestic agricultural economy to world agricultural markets. The next section examines why price and exchange rate transmission in Russian agriculture might be weak. The following section discusses the method and data used in estimating price and exchange rate TEs. The subsequent section examines the results, and the last section presents the paper's main conclusions.",5

That is why the crisis problem is often seen as one of the dominant problems of the 1990s (Bordo et al., 2001, p. 53). It is thus not surprising that interest in financial crises recently increased considerably. In this paper, we analyse a crisis that has received relatively little attention in the (international) financial crisis literature: the Bulgarian Financial Crisis of 1996/1997.Footnote 1 In spite of this, we suggest that the Bulgarian crisis is a good example of a twin crisis where a banking and a currency crisis occur almost simultaneously. Twin crises have been the focus of many third-generation crisis models. While most of these models, among them the moral hazard models of Dooley (2000) and Krugman (1998), were inspired by the Asian Crisis of 1997, recently some doubts have been expressed about how well these models explain important features of the crisis (see eg Krugman, 1999). We argue that these models are nevertheless quite useful since they explain important features of crises like the one in Bulgaria in 1996/1997. We argue that the Bulgarian crisis has some features of a fundamental crisis since Bulgaria's authorities followed an inconsistent policy mix by monetising fiscal losses while trying to stabilise the exchange rate. However, the severity of the Bulgarian crisis was primarily, but not only, due to substantial moral hazard behaviour in the banking sector. This behaviour was partially the result of the former political system and partially induced by the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB), which acted more like a lender of first resort than a lender of last resort (LOLR). The Bulgarian example is also useful with respect to learning about the possibilities to overcome a financial crisis and the design of a financial system in a transition country that is less prone to financial crises. Bulgaria decided to introduce a second-generation currency board (CB) arrangement. Different from orthodox CB arrangements, the Bulgarian CB allows for a strictly limited LOLR function of the central bank. Thus, Bulgaria's experiences with the 1996/1997 crisis finally led to a switch from a system with a lender of first resort to a system with a strictly limited LOLR. This paper is organised as follows. The second section briefly reviews the theoretical literature on financial crises. In the third section, we describe the development of the Bulgarian economy since 1990, which finally culminated in the crisis of 1996/1997. We also make an attempt at classifying the Bulgarian crisis with respect to the theoretical literature. We argue that the crisis can be explained by combining elements of first-generation models and third-generation moral hazard models in the tradition of Dooley (2000) and especially Krugman (1998). The fourth section describes the second-generation CB Bulgaria introduced in the aftermath of the crisis. Special attention is attached to the peculiarities of the Bulgarian CB arrangement that retained some flexibility in order to fulfil a strictly limited role as a LOLR. The paper closes with a summary of the main arguments and some conclusions.",24

Additionally, the economic catching-up process will inevitably be accompanied by fundamental structural changes. For example, it may be expected that the sectoral employment structure will become more similar to that of the present EU. In all three countries, the share of industrial employment is still much higher than in the EU. Hungary and especially Poland also have a larger share of agricultural employment. Furthermore, in the course of the economic catching-up process the employment structure will change considerably within the three sectors as well. In particular, it will tend to shift towards more demanding occupations. In the service sector, for example, the three accession countries' employment rates in finance and business services still are far below the EU average. The accession countries' foreign trade will shift more and more from processing work to the export of human capital-intensive goods. Foreign investors will probably contribute decisively to this structural change. Accession to the EU will make the environment for foreign direct investment in the new member countries more secure. Therefore, the strong inflow of foreign direct investment into Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic since the removal of the Iron Curtain is expected to continue after accession and may even intensify. The changes to be expected in foreign trade and foreign direct investment patterns will foster further structural change within the accession countries' economies. The economic adjustment processes that will take place in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as a result of their accession to the EU require a high degree of labour market flexibility. This paper analyses whether their labour markets are flexible enough for these processes to take place smoothly.Footnote 2 It surveys the existing literature and analyses the following factors influencing labour market flexibility: labour force participation, qualification and regional mobility of the labour force, wage-setting systems and statutory minimum wages, labour taxes, government regulations affecting working time and protection against dismissal, and public job-placement services. All three countries suffer from persistent, structurally entrenched unemployment, although to varying extents. Poland has experienced double-digit unemployment rates since the beginning of the 1990s. Between 1997 and 2002, its unemployment rate was 14.9% on average. The Czech unemployment rate has continuously been in the range of 7%–9% since 1999. The Hungarian unemployment rate was a comparatively modest 7.0% between 1997 and 2002. However, according to the OECD (2000a, p. 29), unemployment in Hungary may be almost completely structural in nature. All three countries have had large shares of long-term unemployment and very high youth unemployment rates for many years, irrespective of their overall unemployment rates. Between 1997 and 2002, the share of long-term unemployment (12 months and over) in total unemployment was around 40% in Poland and the Czech Republic and almost 50% in Hungary (Table 1). This share was about the same as in the EU (46.7%) but much higher than in the US (7.4%). In Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as well as in the US and in most EU countries, youth unemployment rates are about twice as high as overall unemployment rates (Table 1). Between 1997 and 2002, they were 13.1% in Hungary, 14.6% in the Czech Republic and 33.0% in Poland. These indicators suggest that there are major impediments to flexibility in the labour markets of all three accession countries.",12
46,2,Comparative Economic Studies,09 June 2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100037,Efficiency of Chinese Township and Village Enterprises and Property Rights in the 1990s: Case Study of Wuxi,June 2004,Go Yano,Maho Shiraishi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"We study below whether the relative technical efficiency of collective-owned township and village enterprises (TVEs) declined shortly before massive privatisation began in China. In particular, we test whether these enterprises remained more efficient technically than other types of enterprises in the later 1990s, taking into account their net work rate and input, equipment and machines. Chinese TVEs have generally been accepted as successful from the inception of economic reform up to the first half of the 1990s. The production share of TVEs in the manufacturing sector increased from 9% in 1979 to 30% in 1990. The press has reported on successful TVEs. The strong performance of Chinese TVEs, particularly enterprises owned by township and village governments (collective-owned TVEs), has posed a challenge to traditional property right theory. This theory asserts that public ownership of property is inconsistent with productive efficiency, especially technical efficiency. Since the rights involved in these enterprises are often not clearly specified, publicly owned enterprises should be unable to motivate their managers and workers (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972). Such claims led economists to measure the productivity and efficiency of TVEs, especially collective-owned TVEs, using micro-level data. They reported favourably on the efficiency of collective-owned TVEs. For example, Murakami et al. (1994) showed that collective-owned TVEs were technically and allocatively more efficient than state-owned enterprises and urban collective-owned enterprises, and that some collective-owned TVEs were as technically and allocatively efficient as joint ventures. Svejnar (1990), Dong and Putterman (1997) and Pitt and Putterman (1999) found no significant difference in productivity between collective-owned TVEs and private enterprises or joint ventures. These authors provided econometric verification that vaguely specified property rights are not necessarily a serious problem for collective-owned TVEs, contrary to standard economic theory. Jefferson (1999) compared the total factor productivity in state-owned enterprises with that in collective-owned TVEs, and found higher productivity in the collective-owned TVEs. Other economists, motivated by press reports and empirical studies of collective-owned TVEs, have tried to explain their success theoretically, focusing on property rights and the role of the local government (Weitzman and Xu, 1994; Chang and Wang, 1994; Li, 1996; Che and Qian, 1998a, 1998b; Hsiao et al., 1998). Unfortunately, none of these empirical studies used up-to-date micro data for the TVEs (including collective-owned TVEs). All data came from before 1990.Footnote 1 More than a decade later, can the success of TVEs still be taken for granted? More specifically, are the vaguely specified property rights of collective-owned enterprises now inconsistent with productive efficiency or technical efficiency, as orthodox property right theory supposes? The press and several academic studies in China have recently reported that TVEs are declining in performance. Lu (1999) states that the total deficit of TVEs has increased since 1997, and that 30% of TVEs have been forced to cease or reduce production. Collective-owned TVEs have frequently had their declining performance highlighted; private enterprises are now expected to play an important continuing role in the Chinese economy. Li and Yan (1998) assert that productivity in collective-owned TVEs having a deficit has remained low because these enterprises have received bailouts from the local government, at least in southern Jiangsu province. Southern Jiangsu province is a typical area in which the success of collective-owned TVEs has been supported by local governments. It includes Wuxi City, for which the micro data are used below. Several studies have proposed that the declining fund efficiency and high debt ratio of TVEs are related to subsidies, bailouts and other protection offered to collective-owned TVEs by the local governments in overall charge of them (Pan et al., 1997; Xu and Zhang, 1997; Jiang C, 2000). These forms of protection are a direct consequence of the vaguely specified property rights of the TVEs (Jiang G, 2000). Do these studies show that the efficiency of such TVEs is in decline? To find whether the vaguely specified property rights of Chinese collective-owned TVEs have become inconsistent with productive efficiency or technical efficiency since the first half of the 1990s, we measured the relative technical efficiency of collective-owned TVEs in every year during our sample periods.Footnote 2 We used firm-level micro data, including data from TVEs, for Wuxi CityFootnote 3 from 1991 to 1997. If the vaguely specified property rights of collective-owned TVEs have caused a reduction in their technical efficiency after the mid-1990s in Wuxi City, this should show in a comparison of their technical efficiency with that of joint venture firms, private enterprises and share-holding enterprises in subsequent years. These three types of enterprises have more clearly specified property rights than collective-owned TVEs. We employ the production function approach. Massive privatisation of collective-owned TVEs has been underway in Wuxi City and Jiangsu province since 1998. Privatisation is a remedy based on the belief by Chinese central or Jiangsu local governments that the vaguely specified property rights of collective-owned TVEs cause problems, including declining technical efficiency and productivity. In evaluating this massive privatisation programme, it is important to measure the relative technical efficiency of collective-owned TVEs in Wuxi City before 1998, when massive privatisation had not begun and property rights remained vague. In measuring the relative technical efficiency of collective-owned TVEs, it is necessary to take into account the net work rate for equipment and machines. The net work rate is an important explanatory factor for the output and productivity of enterprises in the modern Chinese economy. From the mid-1990s, enterprises in China have suffered from recession or economic retrenchment, and the net work rate for equipment and machines has declined (Yang, 1997). Our recent field surveys and econometric measurements suggest that the net work rate for equipment and machines (or labour) is an important factor in determining the output or productivity of enterprises in China.Footnote 4 Since the start of economic reform, the reduction in the net work rate for equipment and machines in Chinese enterprises has stemmed from three factors: (1) redundant equipment and machines caused by excessive demand for investment due to soft budget constraints, elaborated by Kornai (1980); (2) underuse of equipment and machines as a result of effective demand deficiency; (3) underuse of equipment and machines due to a shortage of working capital to finance the purchase of intermediate inputs. In the recession and financial retrenchment beginning in the mid-1990s, factors (2) and (3) have become more important than (1). We believe that the true relative technical efficiency of collective-owned TVEs must take into account the net work rate for equipment and machines. We then measure whether collective-owned TVEs remained more efficient technically than other types of enterprises in the later 1990s. We also consider the influence of the net work rate on the output and productivity, net work rate differences between types of enterprises and rate of change of net work in time series. The next section classifies and discusses the types of enterprise in the Chinese economy. The subsequent section describes our empirical model, and the next section sets out and explains the estimation procedure and results. Finally, conclusions are presented.",5
46,2,Comparative Economic Studies,09 June 2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100038,Effect of Enterprise Ownership and Foreign Competition on Internet Diffusion in the Transition Economies,June 2004,George R G Clarke,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"After several decades of slow economic growth and modest improvements in productivity, growth accelerated in the United States in the mid- to late 1990s. Whereas output increased by only 2.8 percent per year and output per labour hour increased by only 1.0 percent per year between 1972 and 1995, they increased by 4.9 percent and 2.7 percent per year respectively between 1995 and 1999 (Gordon, 2000, p. 53). Although there is considerable uncertainty regarding the reason for the increase in growth, many observers attributed it to growing investment in information technology in general and to the Internet in particular.Footnote 1 Although the benefits of information technology are still in dispute, these changes led to considerable discussion about whether countries that failed to make similar investments would be left behind as growth in technologically more advanced economies accelerated. This concern was especially marked for low- and middle-income countries, where Internet access and the use of information technology is far less common. The digital divide between the rich developed world and the poor developing world is visible even when comparing the mainly middle-income economies of Eastern Europe and Central Asia with high-income OECD countries. Over 25 percent of the inhabitants of high-income OECD countries had Internet access in 1999, compared to about 6–7 percent of people in Central Europe and the Baltics, and 1–2 percent of people in South Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The importance of foreign investment as a source of technological transfers suggests that encouraging foreign investors from developed countries to invest in developing countries might reduce the disparity between rich and poor countries.Footnote 2 In addition to increasing the use of information technology among enterprises that directly receive inflows of foreign investment, several mechanisms might encourage diffusion among domestically owned enterprises in the host economy. For example, workers and managers who leave foreign-owned enterprises to join existing domestic firms might encourage their new employers to copy the techniques used by foreign-owned enterprises (including more intensive use of information technology). Alternatively, domestic enterprises, including competitors and upstream and downstream firms, might simply observe and copy the foreign-owned enterprises’ business techniques. Since the benefits associated with network industries are greater when coverage is higher, enterprises that use the Internet will generally have an incentive to encourage up- and downstream firms to adopt it. Further, although foreign-owned enterprises have strong incentives to prevent domestic competitors from copying their business models, some leakage, especially of generic knowledge such as use of information technology, seems inevitable. Finally, foreign-owned enterprises’ demand for Internet services might encourage the formation of support companies (eg, web-hosting or web-design companies) that can then sell their services to other companies in the host country. Using enterprise-level data from 21 low and middle income economies in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, this paper looks at whether foreign investment increases Internet access in host countries. First, it looks at whether foreign-owned firms appear to be more likely to have Internet access than their domestic counterparts. Second, it looks at whether domestically owned enterprises competing either with foreign-owned enterprises operating in the host country or with imports also appear more likely to have access to the Internet – something that might indicate diffusion due to foreign trade or investment. Finally, the paper looks at whether foreign direct investment (FDI) appears to increase Internet access for enterprises other than the foreign-owned firms and their direct competitors in the host country. In general, there appears to be strong evidence that foreign trade and investment encourage higher levels of Internet access throughout the host economy. Although the recent discussion on the ‘digital divide’ between developing and developed countries makes the question of Internet access interesting in its own right, the topic is also of interest because of its relationship with more general questions about international transfers of technology between developing and developed countries. Over the past decade, a large literature has emerged looking at how enterprises in developing countries gain access to new technologies, often focusing on the role of foreign investment and trade. In general, although foreign investment appears to result in improved productivity in the enterprises that receive the investment, there is less evidence of broad spillovers to the economy as a whole. However, since most studies have focused on the effect of foreign investment on productivity, it is possible that the negative results regarding spillovers are due to the short-term pressure that foreign entry puts on domestic enterprises through product market competition, rather than a lack of technological transfers.Footnote 3 Since this study looks at the adoption of a new technology directly, it is a useful complement to the existing literature since it avoids the possibility that pecuniary externalities will obscure technological spillovers.",7

This often requires bringing the budget under control: first, fiscal profligacy often causes current account deficits and, second, even if the initial budgetary position is sustainable, additional fiscal tightening may be needed if the domestic currency comes under pressure (Ghosh et al., 2002). This adjustment has been part of broader medium–term macroeconomic programmes that also encompass supply side structural reforms relevant for external stability. This paper examines post-programme fiscal developments in countries with and without an IMF-supported programme. It finds significant differences in the composition of adjustment between programme and nonprogramme countries as well as large differences among programme countries. In nonprogramme countries, revenue increased modestly and expenditure declined sharply, while in programme countries both revenue and expenditure declined during the post-programme period. Moreover, in IMF-supported programmes that included structural conditions, the adjustment was effected primarily through sharp expenditure compression in order to offset revenue declines. We did not find any evidence that fiscal structural conditions improved revenue performance after the end of the programme. Fiscal developments were strongly affected by the business cycle and, to some extent, by the general stance of macroeconomic policies. This paper is organised as follows. First, we review the stylised facts and define the sample. Second, we describe the techniques used in our estimations. Third, we present and discuss our results. The final section concludes.",13

A key function of the IMF is to make loans to countries facing shortages of foreign exchange. The IMF's financial support gives countries breathing room, while they adjust their economic policies to solve their external payment difficulties. To ensure that borrowing governments follow policies that are consistent with the IMF's purposes, its financial resources are disbursed gradually and on condition that borrowers avoid measures that are destructive to national and international prosperity. The IMF's rules for disbursing assistance have evolved gradually and have been continuously adapted to solve emerging problems – recycling petrodollars in the 1970s, overcoming the debt crisis in the 1980s, and integrating the transition countries and dealing with capital-account crises in the 1990s. While necessary, conditionality has become somewhat controversial over the years, leading to periodic reviews – within the IMF and by the broader academic community – of the analytical principles underlying it and the practical ways in which it has been applied. The most recent such internal review was conducted during 2000–2002, with extensive external input and participation. The review highlighted the critical importance of country ownership, defined as the ability and willingness of country authorities and other key stakeholders to implement policy programmes agreed with the IMF, which was underscored by the poor record of some programmes that were not based on reasonably broad coalitions in recipient countries. It concluded that while country ownership of policies depends in the first place on the borrowing countries' domestic political economy, it can be influenced by the IMF's methods of interaction with these countries. Reforms in the IMF's processes now under way, including the streamlining and focusing of conditionality and greater tailoring of programmes to the circumstances of member countries, will ensure that IMF-supported reforms will enjoy greater domestic ownership. The importance of promoting country ownership and of limiting conditionality to measures that are critical to the success of programmes is reflected in the revised IMF conditionality guidelines (IMF, 2002). This paper presents some analytics of IMF conditionality based on the theory of special interest politics (Grossman and Helpman, 2001). This theory appeals to lobbying by special interest groups in order to explain why policymakers in the real world often prefer to use distortionary policies. The next section presents our political–economy model of the IMF, which applies the theory of special interest politics to understand the role of IMF conditionality in shaping economic policies of recipient governments (Mayer and Mourmouras, 2002). The subsequent section discusses how conditionality helps matters in the presence of various domestic and international conflicts of interest. The last section concludes.",9

More recently, it has also come under attack from some on the right who claim that conditions are seldom enforced. Thus, rather than imposing excessive adjustment, IMF programmes are seen by them as postponing adjustment.Footnote 1 Academic commentators pointed to the escalation in IMF conditionality during the 1980s and early 1990s and suggested that this may have discouraged governments from implementing programmes (Bird, 2001b). Certainly, a number of studies, including ones conducted by the IMF itself, have found that the track record of implementation has been poor.Footnote 2 This in turn has raised questions about the value of the IMF's seal of approval and its value as a catalytic agent to influence private capital flows. Some critics, such as the majority of a commission appointed by the US Congress and chaired by Allen Meltzer (International Financial Institution Advisory Commission (IFIAC), 2000) have gone so far as to propose that IMF conditionality should be entirely abandoned and replaced with ex ante rules for eligibly to borrow. Others have proposed a wider range of reforms relating to conditionality. Faced with these criticisms, the Fund undertook a review in which it broadly accepted that conditionality had been expanded excessively and expressed a desire to return to a focus on its core responsibilities for macroeconomic and exchange rate policies. Conditionality was to be ‘streamlined’.Footnote 3 There has also been a second strand of recent reform. This has placed increasing emphasis on the notion of ‘ownership’. The basic idea here is that governments are more likely to implement programmes that they ‘own’, rather than those that they feel have been imposed on them. The link to the first strand is that the feeling of ownership is likely to decline as the number of conditions rises. Hence, streamlining is presented by the Fund as contributing to ownership. The Fund has also sought to involve more elements of society in the discussions that culminate in an agreed programme. The thrust of recent IMF policy towards conditionality is therefore reasonably straightforward. The Fund retains the view that conditionality is useful. However, as a modality for encouraging economic reform its effectiveness has been impaired by poor implementation. This, in turn, has been associated with a lack of ownership. By streamlining conditionality, and in addition, by involving more elements of society in the discussions that result in IMF-approved programmes, ownership may be strengthened. As a result, implementation may be improved and effectiveness enhanced. But is this an appropriate strategy and will it work? The basic purpose of this paper is to examine this question. As the IMF has recognised, ownership is a fuzzy concept; it means rather different things to different people. At one extreme its meaning can be so broad as to be amorphous; at the other it can be turned into a non-operational tautology that equates ownership and implementation. We review this literature and suggest that, for the IMF's purposes, a narrow definition of ownership that is directly related to the prospects for programme implementation is the most appropriate.Footnote 4 Broad concepts related to good governance and the roles of civil society may well be worth discussing, but, in the context of IMF-backed programmes, could be unhelpful. They could run counter to the efforts to streamline IMF conditionality. Focusing on implementation highlights the need for the IMF to consider political economy as well as technical economic aspects of conditionality. From this perspective, a technically less desirable programme but one that has a substantially higher probability of implementation should be preferred to a technically superior programme that, however, has little chance of being accepted by a national government and of being successfully implemented. The operational focus should be on implementation. The Fund needs to consider ways in which it can analyse and encourage this. In our view, programme ownership should be viewed only as a means to an end, not an end in itself. The organisation of the paper is as follows. The following section briefly examines the various purposes behind conditionality. The subsequent section goes on to evaluate the effectiveness of conditionality and in particular the record on its implementation. The section thereafter analyses the concept of ownership and examines the extent to which it is compatible with conditionality and connected to implementation. In the light of this, the next section critically evaluates recent policy reforms and goes on to put forward a number of complementary or alternative proposals. The last section offers concluding remarks.",48

The rise in the scrutiny of Fund activities is due in part to the IMF's heightened profile. The IMF played a prominent role in dealing with the Asian currency crisis of 1997, as well as the subsequent crises in Russia, Brazil and, most recently, Turkey and Argentina. A number of studies were undertaken in response to criticisms of the IMF's policies, which resulted in proposals for changes in its response to crises. The increase in public notice has been accompanied by a rise in scholarly work on the Fund. New questions about the adoption, implementation and outcome of the IMF's lending programmes have been raised, while the political dimensions of these arrangements have received increased examination. Economists and political scientists have utilised innovative tools of theoretical and empirical analysis, such as game theory and duration models, to address these issues. This paper reviews the recent literature on the IMF's lending programmes, and outlines the advances that have been made and the issues that merit future analysis. It does not address all aspects of the Fund's activities, many of which have been examined in other surveys, such as Krueger (1998).Footnote 1 Rather, it assesses the state of our knowledge about IMF-sponsored programmes, and points to promising areas of further work. The next section reviews the research that has been undertaken on the factors that affect the decision to initiate a program. The third section surveys issues relating to the design and implementation of IMF programmes, including the changing nature of conditionality and programme completion. The fourth section reviews the literature on the economic impact of Fund-sponsored policies. The fifth section deals with the response of private capital markets to IMF programmes. The last section summarises our understanding of Fund programmes and delineates issues that need to be further explored.",32

The circumstances that lead to such a situation have been studied extensively and have been found more often than not to involve a combination of domestic macroeconomic mismanagement and external shocks.Footnote 1 Crises during the 1990s, however, demonstrated that referral to the Fund could have as much to do with sharp capital reversals, implying that current account deficits could no longer be financed by capital inflows, as with any marked deterioration in the current account itself. The IMF responded to these events as well, despite the presence of Article VI of the Fund's Articles of Agreement precluding it from providing resources merely to finance capital outflows. When approached after the onset of unfavourable economic events, the basic purpose of the Fund's involvement is to restore balance of payments viability, thereby enabling the borrowing country to eventually disengage from the Fund. The programmes supported by the Fund combine balance of payments adjustment with external financing. Financial assistance from the Fund comes with policy strings attached; the so-called IMF conditionality. An IMF programme is supposed to balance the adjustment process with external finance in an optimal way. If financing inflows on the capital account fall short of the expected and desired amount, the speed of adjustment on the current account will be greater than expected. There is, of course, the opposite problem of diluted adjustment when financing is excessive. As two IMF researchers put it, ‘the availability of external financing, the first component of the strategy, determines the magnitude and pace of the necessary adjustment period’ (Mussa and Savastano, 1999, p. 20). The trade-off between external financing and the speed of adjustment is likely to be a source of tension between the Fund and the country concerned, and striking the right balance requires to reflect both economic and political realities. The Fund recognises that the resources it provides may be far from adequate on their own to finance the adjustment programmes that it approves, even when it has violated its original quota-based lending limits. The difference between the resources required to finance an adjustment programme and those which the IMF provides is supposed to come from other public and private sources. Specifically, the Fund has traditionally claimed that its programmes perform a catalysing role, encouraging others to lend more than they would otherwise have done. The view of the Fund is represented by the following quote: In most cases, the IMF, when it lends, provides only a small portion of a country's external financing requirements. But because the approval of IMF lending signals that a country's economic policies are on the right track, it reassures investors and the official community and helps generate additional financing from these sources. Thus, IMF financing can act as an important lever, or catalyst, for attracting other funds. The IMF's ability to perform this catalytic role is based on confidence that other lenders have in its operations and especially in the credibility of the policy conditionality attached to its lending. (IMF, 2002) Similarly in the Prague Framework launched by the IMF's Managing Director, Horst Kohler, in September 2000, the catalytic effect of IMF lending was seen as an important element in enhancing crisis resolution. The above quote from the IMF's website is useful because not only does it say something about the assumed quantitative significance of the catalytic effect but it also explains the mechanism through which the effect is intended to work.Footnote 2 This paper reviews what we know about the catalytic effect of IMF lending. The next section briefly explores the analytical basis for believing that there will be a catalytic effect, and reviews the empirical evidence. The subsequent section then examines ways in which IMF programmes might be strengthened in terms of achieving the desired balance between financing and adjustment. A final section places the discussion within the broader context of current trends in terms of capital flows to emerging and developing economies.",4

Not surprisingly, there is a rapidly growing literature on this subject. With some reservations, it can be divided into three broad categories. First, there are normative papers that seek to put Russian experience into the international context and to design a system of equalisation payments that is most appropriate for Russian conditions (Batkibekov et al., 2000 (http://www.iet.ru/papers/papers_r.htm); Lavrov, 2000 (http://www.iet.ru/papers/papers_r.htm); Martinez and Boex, 1997a, 1997b, 1997c, 1999; Morozov, 1999; Kadotchnikov et al., 1999 (http://www.iet.ru/papers/papers_r.htm); Trounin, 1999; Minfin, 2001). Second, there are papers that examine the actual factors that affect intergovernmental transfers in the transition period (Freinkman and Haney, 1997; McAuley, 1997; Popov, 2001; Stewart, 1997; Tabata, 1998, 2000; Triesman, 1996, 1998a, 1998b; Zhuravskaya, 2000). The main question discussed in these papers is to what extent actual transfers are really equalising and to what extent they are used as an instrument of federal–regional politics (rewarding either pro-centre governors or troublemakers). Third, there are studies of broader scope, mostly political science papers about the nature of Russian federalism that incorporate fiscal intergovernmental flows into a general model of centre–regional relations and explain the decentralisation or centralisation tendencies in the Russian Federation that occurred during the 1990s and the behaviour of regions and central authorities in the ‘bargaining federalism game’. (Petrov, 2000; Polishchuk, 1998; Solnick, 1999; Speckhard, 2000; Stoner-Weiss, 2000). This paper belongs to second stream of literature and seeks to identify economic and political factors affecting financial flows between the centre and the regions in the 1990s and the early 2000s. Whereas there is a near-consensus that the Russian system of fiscal federalism in the 1990s was far from being perfect, there seems to be little agreement between scholars on what the key determinants of intergovernmental financial flows have been. As documented by Triesman (1996, 1998a, b), financial transfers from the federal budget to the regions in 1992 and 1994 depended mostly on the lobbying power of the regions, which in turn was determined by their ability to threaten and create trouble for the federal government.Footnote 1 Stoner-Weiss (2000), however, questions the ability of the weakened and disintegrating central government to act adroitly and resolutely. She also demonstrates that control by the centre over fiscal flows was an imprecise and clumsy instrument in curbing many regional challenges to central state governing capacity. Freinkman and Haney (1997) have shown that federal transfers to the regions do matter in explaining national economy expenditures funded by Russian regions, especially in explaining housing subsidies, but they were careful not to claim that the neediest regions have received the most in transfers. Stewart (1997) and Hanson (2000) have argued that federal government transfers to the regions – contrary to what many analysts claimed – are roughly compatible with the regional needs because they go mostly to the neediest regions. They believe, however, these transfers are too small and too thinly spread to make a difference. Popov (2001) has shown that net intergovernmental financial transfers are largely of the ‘Robin Hood’ type, that is, going mostly from rich to poor regions, but they are more than counterweighted by private business transfers going in the opposite direction. Zhuravskaya (2000) provides evidence that in Russia, unlike in China, every time the municipalities are starting to earn greater revenues, the regional authorities tend to change rules about sharing taxes and providing transfers to municipalities in such a way as to appropriate these greater revenues for themselves. It is logical to expect that the federal government may exercise the same policy vis-à-vis the regions. Speckhard (2000) looked at the degree of the assertiveness of the particular regions, measured by their ability to gain privileges, including financial ones, from the centre. He concluded that among other factors (size, economic potential, consolidation of the regional elite) the ability to deliver a majority vote for Yeltsin during 1996 presidential elections did provide particular regions with a bargaining chip in their relations with the centre. Finally, as many authors have observed (for instance, Solnick, 1999; Stoner-Weiss, 2000; Petrov, 2000), the federal approach to the regions in general and to intergovernmental transfers in particular did not stay the same throughout the 1990s. Whereas in the first half of the decade, following famous Yeltsin's appeal to the provinces – ‘take as much independence as you can swallow’ – the balance of power in the Russian Federation shifted in favour of the regions, in the second half of the 1990s centralising tendencies were evidently at play. Many observers considered Putin's rise to power (1999 parliamentary and 2000 presidential elections) as victory of poor regions over wealthy ones. The latter were united into a Primakov-Luzhkov ‘Fatherland–All Russia’ electoral bloc that did not do well in the elections. Whether the centre succeeded in recent years in centralising the Federation is an open question, but there is no doubt that the centre has tried to take a tougher stand on the regional autonomy.",33

This is particularly evident in their changes in per capita consumption of food. Despite country differences and the sometimes chaotic nature of the transition process, we explore the proposition that there are identifiable stages of transition through which each country passes in terms of its underlying food resource consumption, which when quantified can help inform food and agricultural policy decisions. This region has a strong agricultural base and has historically been an important producer of agricultural products for both domestic food consumption and export. During the centrally planned years, however, a number of price and structural distortions were introduced into the food production and consumption sectors, resulting in a decidedly atypical food consumption pattern when compared to free market economies. In short, low- and medium-income populations in these pre-transition economies were eating high-income diets, composed of significant quantities of livestock products. Price distortions (low food prices) and production subsidies and quotas were introduced to bring production and consumption into balance. The transition to market systems has resulted in substantial adjustments in both the food production and consumption sectors. On the consumption side, higher food prices and initially lower incomes have sharply reduced demand for livestock products. Production has suffered initially as well, due to higher input prices (fertiliser) and structural adjustments that have changed dramatically the resource input mixFootnote 2 in production. The recent diet changes away from livestock products have positioned the food consumption patterns of most transition countries midway between poor and rich country diets. Thus, as income levels recover, significant reverse diet changes are probable as these countries return to higher levels of livestock product consumption, with the attendant pressure on agricultural resources to meet the increased demand. Alternatively, given proposed production quotas as conditions of entry to the European Union (EU), there will be a need for greater imports of livestock products. In this paper, we analyse food consumption changes from the perspective of resource use rather than nutrition, calories, or expenditures. We develop a model using the concept of cereal equivalent (CE) factor values to measure progress in the transition to market as seen through the pattern of resource-based food consumption as a function of real income. Using market economy consumption patterns as benchmarks, we identify three turning points in the transition process: turning point 1 is the initial drop in food consumption upon the removal of food subsidies; turning point 2 is the stabilisation of food consumption at the new, lower level; and turning point 3 is the achievement of a market economy consumption level consistent with the level of real income. Resource-based agricultural self-sufficiency measures are then calculated, yielding policy implications as accession to the EU is contemplated for a number of these countries. The income–food consumption relationship during economic development and the CE factor measure are discussed in the second section. A survey of current literature follows in the third section. The specific model and data are presented in the fourth section, with turning points identified in the fifth section. The sixth section extends the analysis to self-sufficiency and policy implications, with a summary presented in the last section.",7

In this regard, the first volume of the special issue, which was published in the September 2004 issue, introduced five papers dealing with issues of conditionality, ownership, and programme performance in developing and emerging economies. The second issue presents three additional papers that complete the special issue. The special characteristic of this second issue is its focus on emerging and transition economies, rather than developing economies. In the first paper, Ayse Evrensel examines the performance of 19 emerging countries that received IMF-supported stabilisation programmes during the 1971–1997 period. Her study is important because it studies the effectiveness of conditionality in emerging countries, while previous studies mainly focus on developing economies. Compared to non-programme countries, she finds that emerging economies with Fund programmes had periodic macroeconomic crises and implemented inconsistent macroeconomic policies. In addition, she finds evidence of temporal moral hazard, which indicates that, as countries receive subsequent programmes, they tend to follow more inconsistent policies during inter-programme years. She concludes that the complex relationship between the IMF and emerging countries should be examined based on the decision-making process that takes place both at the IMF and in programme countries. She therefore emphasizes the need for additional research on these issues. Her results from emerging markets may have implications for the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In the second paper, Eke and Kutan investigate whether IMF programmes are effective in the transition economies of Bulgaria and Poland. They first present historical evidence about the implementation of Fund programmes in both countries during the 1990s and compare their outcomes. Although Poland did not sign new programmes with the Fund after 1994, IMF programmes are still in effect in Bulgaria. They also conduct empirical tests regarding the effectiveness of IMF programmes. The results suggest that IMF programmes were more effective in Bulgaria than Poland, especially in reducing the probability of inflation crises. In interpreting their results, they caution the readers, because the effectiveness of IMF programmes depends on a host of factors, including the nature of IMF programmes and policies, the commitment of the country's officials to perform these programmes, the degree of social and political stability, as well as external and transition-related shocks. The next paper investigates the effectiveness of fiscal structural adjustment programmes in an economy that has been suffering from moderate inflation and political instability for some time. Ebru Voyvoda and Erinc Yeldan investigate the impact of a recent IMF fiscal adjustment programme on growth and welfare in Turkey. In May 2001, Turkey and the IMF signed a new program with the main focus on the long-term sustainability of fiscal adjustment with particular emphasis on budgetary discipline and fiscal surplus. Using an overlapping generation model, the authors simulate the effect of the programme on production, investment, growth and welfare. They find that an alternative policy that focuses on increased public spending on education would produce more sustained economic growth than the 2001 IMF programme, which focused on the stabilisation of debt dynamics through fiscal surpluses. An important lesson here is that the involved parties need to evaluate the trade-offs associated with the implementation of different fiscal adjustment programmes and better assess the particular constraints faced by programme countries. For example, Turkey has insufficient funds for public education, which may hurt economic growth. An important research area that is not explored much in the literature is to examine the possibility of creditor moral hazard in equity markets. Most studies of moral hazard focus on bond markets. Several observers have suggested that the Fund-support to Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand during the recent East Asian crisis may have provided additional implicit guarantees to investors, which would motivate them to take excessive risks. Implicit guarantees to investors indicates domestic moral hazard, which implies that financial intermediaries or their owners were protected by implicit or explicit government guarantees against losses, which reduces financial firms' incentive to manage risk. Domestic moral hazard could become more pronounced, if Fund-support to crisis countries signaled the continuation of domestic implicit guarantees. In countries' financial sectors with domestic creditor moral hazard, does an expected IMF support cause an additional type of moral hazard? This kind of moral hazard could be called IMF-induced creditor moral hazard. Besides Asia, recent financial crises in Turkey, Russia, and elsewhere suggest that the frequency of the IMF's involvement in emerging markets is likely to increase in the future. It is therefore important to understand whether such moral hazard exists in emerging markets. Evrensel and Kutan (2004a, 2004b, 2004c) provide some initial tests of the creditor moral hypothesis.",

This article describes how the farms in these two categories evolve and adapt to market conditions. The term ‘small agricultural business’ is used in this article to denote individual and family farms, as well as small agricultural enterprises – legal persons with up to 60 permanent workers. All other agricultural enterprises (corporate farms) are included in the rubric of ‘large agricultural business’. In market economies, most of the agricultural output is produced by small business. The predominance of small business in market agriculture has been widely discussed in the literature. Economic theory explains the sustainability and efficiency of family farms by the higher motivation of the owner compared with that of a hired worker, by the orientation towards family consumption instead of profit maximization, by the psychological value of working on one's own farm, and by the unity of work and family life. Large agricultural business develops in response to economies of scale. However, the inevitable increase of management difficulties, transaction costs, and ecological hazards with the increase of farm size limits the growth of large business in agriculture. Modern institutional economics describes these limits to size in terms of moral hazard or opportunism of hired workers. Williamson (1985) defined opportunism as ‘self-interest seeking with guile [which] includes but is scarcely limited to more blatant forms, such as lying, stealing, and cheating’. Opportunism can be counteracted by provision of appropriate safeguards in labour contracts and by increased monitoring of the workforce. However, it is impossible to control everything, so the negative consequences of opportunistic behaviour are unavoidable. This is particularly so in agriculture, as farming is a spatially dispersed activity and it is difficult, or virtually impossible, to monitor all contract workers, safeguard all machinery and equipment, and protect all crops and all livestock everywhere. These considerations are highly relevant in modern Russia, where opportunistic behaviour has been inherited from the socialist system and most agricultural workers still regard it as the norm. Family farms are less prone to opportunism than corporate farms, because here the owner is at the same time the manager, the worker, the watchman, and the controller. The number of permanent hired workers in a family farm is usually small, and they all work together with the family members under their watchful eye. During the decades of the Soviet regime, Russian agriculture was dominated by large collective and state farms (kolkhozes and sovkhozes). The predominance of large agricultural business during the socialist era was achieved by a combination of several policy factors. First, rural people were virtually ‘modern-day serfs’: they had no choice but to work in the local farm enterprise. Second, land was allocated to agricultural users by the state, which intentionally created only large farms and restricted individual activity. In this system, opportunism was counteracted by simplifying the farm management system through central planning (top–down assignment of production targets, input deliveries, state prices, exclusive suppliers for each user, etc) and by actually using the legal enforcement apparatus to combat moral hazard among agricultural workers by ensuring compliance with officially imposed behavioural norms. Soft budget constraints were implemented to cover losses and write off debt, ensuring that unprofitable large farms would never go bankrupt. Finally, large farms did not face any competition either from small business (which was ruthlessly suppressed) or from importers (which were not allowed to operate). Most of these factors have not survived the process of transition to market; the influence of others has been dramatically attenuated. Peasants can no longer be forced to work on a farm enterprise, land and other assets have to be leased or purchased, the state is unable to help combat opportunism, managers now have to worry about what to produce, how to sell, and where to buy inputs. If a farm does not meet its financial obligations, it may be forced into bankruptcy. Farm enterprises are under constant pressure from competitors – both domestic (small agricultural business) and external (importers). Can the corporate farm sector retain its dominance under these new conditions?",36

In this section we describe several NAO archetypes – to better define the term by demonstrating variability and to provide motivation for the analysis that follows. 
MTS Olimpia: ‘custom harvester’. In the early 1990s, a group of young Russian entrepreneurs started a firm serving as a debt collector on behalf of energy firms in southern Russia. In 1998, following Russia's financial crisis, they identified some profit opportunities in grain production. However, they also observed that expansion of grain production was constrained by the supply of agricultural machinery, especially combines. Using their connections with financial institutions, they purchased several modern combines. They created a limited liability company named Agricultural Machinery-Technological Station (MTS) Olimpia to provide custom farming services to corporate farms in Krasnodar and Rostov regions of southern Russia. During following several seasons the company was custom farming 3,500–4,500 ha of small grains and row crops. The main client base was independent corporate farms (former collectives) that had experienced significant problems with farm machinery availability. MTS Olimpia charged relatively high custom rates by western standards and earned reasonable rates of return. However, other custom operators have now entered the market reducing custom margins. In early 2003, MTS Olimpia began to seek out opportunities for leasing land and entering agricultural production. 
EFCO: ‘food processor’. During the 1990s, EFCO emerged as one of the leading private oilseed crushing and processing firms in Russia. In the spring of 2000, the company was asked by the governor of Belgorod Oblast to participate in the farm restructuring process. EFCO was primarily interested in securing a reliable source of sunflower seeds for its vegetable-oil operations. The company initially acquired the assets of more than 20 technically bankrupt former collectives and entered into land lease agreements with hundreds of individual land share owners (see Shagaida (2005) for details of this leasing mechanism). As the lease of the land shares shifted from the failing former collectives to EFCO, rural people in Belgorod Oblast began receiving stable in-kind lease payments for the first time since the early 1990s. EFCO also expanded into two neighbouring regions, ultimately leasing more than 100,000 ha for full-scale crop production. EFCO established an agricultural management subsidiary to handle farm operations. All key investment and production decisions, however, had to be approved at headquarters. Since its inception, the company has made significant investments in crop-production machinery and equipment. They have drastically reduced unprofitable livestock operations associated with the former collectives. Each season, they would enter into large-scale purchase agreements with input suppliers. A field and farm security system has been launched to manage the theft issue. The number of farm employees has been gradually reduced. Most of the former farm managers have been replaced. However, EFCO also provides health care, social service programmes, and technical training for workers. Recently, EFCO has organised cooperatives in each former collective farm's area to manage the social services. The land rental payments plus fixed company contributions have been used to create a ‘social benefits’ package. The local cooperative decides how to spend this money. The first results of this innovative social scheme are promising. 
Agrovoronezh: ‘agricultural venture entrepreneur’. In 2003, a group of private investors formed an agricultural production company in Voronezh Oblast in the fertile central chernozem region. The investor group consisted of several local and Moscow-based individuals with ties to the oil and gas and construction business. During the next several months, the company negotiated with the local administration to acquire the non-land assets of bankrupt former collective farms in one of the districts. At the same time, the firm organised the purchase of land shares from the employees of these former collective farms. By the autumn of 2004, some 10,000 ha of land had been purchased and ownership rights had been registered in the local land office. Another 10,000 ha are currently being converted from land lease to land ownership. To facilitate this process, Agrovoronezh has agreed to continue land lease payments for another 4 years. Ultimately, the firm intends to acquire up to 50,000 ha. At the same time, the firm has dramatically restructured the assets, the organisation, and management of the former collective farms. The inefficient livestock herd was cutback sharply. The number of workers was reduced from more than 1,000 to 375. The number of agricultural managers and technical employees was reduced by over one-half, while the company hired better trained agricultural managers and offered salaries and bonuses that were well above local levels. One of the company owners actually relocated from the city to the project site. With the good harvest results expected in 2004, the company owners remain optimistic about further expansion. One of the opportunities under discussion is to pledge company-owned land as collateral for loans from a local bank to finance additional investments. 
Bank Avangard: ‘supply chain management’. Bank Avangard is a large Russian financial group heavily involved in the domestic malting business. The firm requires 300,000 metric tons of malting barley annually. In order to assure a reliable supply, Avangard-Agro, the bank's agricultural entity, contracted with two corporate farms in Orel and Voronezh oblasts to grow malting barley on 10,000 ha. The company provides seeds, pesticides, and fertilisers to these farms; it also guarantees to buy the malting barley at the current market price plus a fixed premium. If the farms fail to deliver malting quality barley due to unfavourable weather, the bank still guarantees to purchase their feed barley at the current market price, but without premium. The bank has entered into an agreement with the Russian subsidiary of Syngenta, a multinational agrochemical company, to provide chemicals and agronomic technical assistance. In 2004, Avangard-Agro leased five additional farms. These four cases illustrate some of the general patterns observed in the emergence of NAOs in Russia.
 The entrepreneurs are responding to perceived profit opportunities in production agriculture – primarily in the former collective sector. The NAOs are founded by outsiders with access to credit, processing services, or end-user markets. The NAOs focus, to a large extent, on overcoming input market imperfections, supplying machinery services, credit, pesticides and fertilisers, managerial services, skilled labor among others. The NAOs make significant investments and technological improvements in production agriculture. Many of the NAO founders work closely with administrative officials in developing and managing their businesses. The social consequences in rural areas appear to be mixed – layoffs are common, yet all firms try to guarantee competitive land lease payments to rural people and some firms have attempted to provide extended packages of social services previously offered by the collectives.",29

The required data can be obtained only through specially designed questionnaire-based surveys. We carried out such surveys in 2003 in three regions that differed by the level of agricultural development and by natural conditions (Rostov, Ivanovo, and Nizhnii Novgorod oblasts). The surveys covered producers of three basic organisational forms – farm enterprises (a corporate form of organization), peasant farms, and household plots (individual forms of organisation). The survey shows that leasing of land is widespread among farm enterprises and peasant farms. Only household plots rely mainly on owned land. In farm enterprises and peasant farms, the share of leased land is on average 60% of the total area of agricultural land used (Table 1), but this leased land originates from different sources. In farm enterprises, three-quarters of the leased land is in the form of land shares that the farm leases from individual owners, and only one-quarter is leased as land plots. Peasant farms, on the other hand, tend to lease land plots to a greater extent (more than 40% of their total leased land). The owned land in peasant farms consists of land shares and land plots allotted without payment to the family members during land privatisation, as well as land shares and land plots purchased over time in the market from other landowners. The owned land of farm enterprises consists of land shares invested by members in the equity capital of the agricultural corporation. The share of owned land in farm enterprises (36%, Table 1) is overestimated in part due to the incorrect interpretation of survey questions by the managers, who improperly regard leased land shares as land shares invested in their corporate farm's equity. According to official all-Russia statistics, the share of owned land in farm enterprises is only 1.3%. In all of Russia, about 5% of agricultural land participates annually in market transactions. The survey showed similar results. Respondents in 553 farms of various organisational forms in three regions reported 86 land transactions during one year. The frequency of transactions was virtually the same in farms of different organisational forms. There were only three cases of buying and selling of land. All other transactions involved land leasing. Strengthening the data in Table 1, this shows that leasing is the dominant form of transaction in land markets across Russia, but unfortunately most of these transactions remain outside the scope of official statistics. The survey did not detect any dependence of the frequency of land transactions on the distance from the regional center. Yet we are witnessing a particularly active land market in areas close to Moscow and in Moscow Oblast, where land is bought for non-agricultural purposes. This subject requires a special study. The survey enabled us to estimate the level of lease payments. The data were analysed separately for agricultural producers leasing in land (56 lessees) and those leasing out land (23 lessors). Most lessees made lease payments in kind; payment in cash was less common. Many lessees assumed the responsibility for the land tax. Lessors also indicated that lease payments were typically a share of output. The mean lease payment was 440–450 rubles/ha (Table 2). Payments estimated separately for the leasing of land shares (as opposed to the leasing of physically surveyed and demarcated land plots) gave a median of 420 rubles/ha, surprisingly somewhat higher than the median of all leasing transactions in the survey (340 rubles/ha). The difference is not statistically significant, and the small size of the sample makes it impossible to decide if surveying and demarcation of land plots (beyond the ‘raw’ land share state) carries any premium in terms of lease payments. The lease payments in the survey range between 350 and 450 rubles/ha, excluding the transactions in state land. The lease payments to the district administration for state land are much lower (about 50 rubles/ha). There were no statistically significant differences in lease payments across farms of different organisational forms.",16

Agriculture employs 11% of the total labour force in Russia, down from 15% in 1995. The prevailing opinion in the media, among politicians, and among many scholars is that agriculture suffers from excess of labour. It is important to explore this issue relative to other sectors of the economy with the objective of developing appropriate policies for agriculture. The changes in agricultural employment between 1990 and 2002 are generally consistent with the overall decline of the Russian workforce (Figure 1). Agricultural employment had declined by 2002 roughly to the same extent as total employment in Russian economy. Yet there are certain notable differences. Up to 1995 agricultural employment displayed certain ‘stickiness’, apparently due to the expansion of the farming activity of rural and especially urban families in that period. Thus, between 1990 and 1995 the number of household plots increased by a factor of 1.6 and their land use grew by a factor of 2.5. This process was strengthened by immigration of Russian nationals from other former Soviet republics, which peaked in 1994 (810,000 immigrants) and 1995 (502,000 immigrants). Agriculture also responded differently to the 1998 financial crisis: while total employment in the national economy shifted to an upward trend in 1998, agriculture continued its decline at an average annual rate of 2.6%. Number of employed by sectors of the economy and in corporate farms. Source: Goskomstat (2001), (2003a)
 The decline of agricultural employment is entirely attributable to the large-farm sector: corporate farms were shedding labour, even faster than the manufacturing industries and construction. The number of employed in corporate farms decreased by 5.6 million or 60% between 1990 and 2002. The labour shed by corporate farms shifted in part to farming on household plots and enabled the emergence of the entirely new sector of peasant farms. Unfortunately, it also contributed to the increase of rural unemployment, which had reached 1.8 million unemployed by 2002. We are witnessing increasing diversification of rural sources of employment, although still mainly within agriculture. By 2002, the number of employed in the commercially oriented individual sector (both household plots and peasant farms) had matched the number of employed remaining in corporate farms (3.8–3.9 million in each farm category; see Figure 2). Agricultural employment by farm type: large corporate farms, household plots, and peasant farms. Source: Goskomstat (2001), (2003a)
 In addition to 7.7 million people employed in commercially oriented agriculture (individual and corporate farms), a very large contingent of rural residents are engaged in subsistence farming. According to Goskomstat (2003b) employment surveys (where the published numbers do not correspond to the full-time equivalents given in Figures 1 and 2), 27.2 million people are employed in the household sector – including both commercially oriented and subsistence oriented household plots. Of these, 3.5 million people work in commercially oriented agriculture and the remaining 23.7 million people (both rural and urban) farm for subsistence purposes, that is, their agricultural output is consumed by the family. Among this army of informal agricultural producers, 10.6 million, or 45%, report that farming the household plot is their main or sole occupation. The labour input of these 23.7 million ‘shadow’ farmers is 12% of the labour input of the entire Russian population, or 9.1 million full-time equivalents (Goskomstat, 2003b). Adding to this estimate 7.7 million officially employed, we obtain that Russian agriculture employs about 16.5 million full-time equivalents. This estimate doubles the share of agricultural employment in the economy from the traditional figure of 11% to 22%.",8

This view is the basis of the national agricultural policy, which emphasises reimbursement of input costs to producers and substitutes government or quasi-government organisations for market institutions. The present article evaluates the availability of purchased farm inputs, the efficiency of their use in agriculture, and the main problems in the development of input markets. It analyses supply and demand, the emergence of market institutions, and the impact of government policies. Purchased farm inputs include a wide range of goods. To keep a proper balance between breadth and depth of analysis, we focus on five groups of purchased inputs: farm machinery (tractors and harvesters), fertilisers, fuel, seeds, and animal feed. Three sources of information were used in the analysis: official national statistics, data from the 2003 BASIS survey of agricultural producers (to evaluate the demand for farm inputs), and data from a 2001 AFE survey of farm machinery and fertiliser manufacturers (to evaluate supply). In the Soviet period, all sectors of the economy, including agriculture, were served by a state supply system, which delivered inputs in centrally planned quantities and provided financing through state banks. The farms paid lower prices for inputs than the manufacturers' wholesale prices, and the difference was covered from the national budget. The relative input/output prices were kept fixed, favouring agricultural producers at the expense of industrial manufacturers as another way of subsidising agriculture. Price liberalisation after 1991 aligned the terms of trade in agriculture with the average world level. The inevitable rise in the relative prices of farm inputs led to shrinking machinery stocks and extensification of production, significantly jeopardising the potential for growth. The declining demand for inputs affected the supply of domestically manufactured farm machinery, while fertiliser manufacturers shifted to exports, reducing their dependence on the domestic market. It is only after the 1998 financial crisis that agricultural recovery has spurred a renewed demand for farm inputs leading to a certain growth in domestically manufactured machinery.",4
47,1,Comparative Economic Studies,21 March 2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100088,"Nonpayments, Bankruptcy and Government Support in Russian Agriculture",March 2005,Olga Yastrebova,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Russian agriculture is characterised by low profitability and high frequency of farms reporting losses.Footnote 1 While the economy as a whole registered profitability rates of 10%–15% of sales between 1995 and 2002, agriculture reported losses of up to 25% of sales during 1996–98 and then recovered to positive profit margins of about 5%–10% of sales. Despite the recovery after 1998, the profit margins in agriculture have remained consistently below the average for the economy. The low profitability has led to an increase in the level of indebtedness. Farm indebtedness, as measured by the debt-to-sales ratio, increased dramatically from 0.8 in 1995 to a peak of 1.6 in 1998, and then declined stabilising at a level of about 1 between 1999 and 2002. Another measure of indebtedness – the ratio of debt to current assets – shows a generally similar pattern. It rose from 82% in 1995 to 122% in 1999 and then dropped to 110% in 2002. The situation since 1999 constitutes a significant improvement by both measures. Today, total liabilities run at about the level of annual sales and exceed by only 10% the highly liquid cushion of current assets (before bringing in the liquidation value of fixed assets). Russian farms do not appear to suffer from a crushing debt burden, and yet nonpayments and overdue liabilities are perceived as a serious problem in Russian agriculture. Indeed, overdue liabilities increased from 40% of total debt to more than 70% in 1998–1999, and declined thereafter to about 60% (the black curve in Figure 1). Most of the overdue liabilities come from accounts payable, and the nonpayment rates for bank credit are substantially lower (compare grey and black bars in Figure 1). Banks apparently manage to impose a much stricter payment discipline on corporate farms than other creditors, which are included in accounts payable. This conclusion is reinforced by the structure of accounts payable shown in Table 1. Here the proportion of overdue supplier credit is less than the proportion of supplier credit in general, whereas the proportion of overdue debt to the state (overdue taxes and social deductions) is higher than the proportion of the state in total payables. These findings suggest that commercial structures (both banks and suppliers) command greater compliance than state creditors. Share of overdue liabilities: total overdue debt, overdue bank loans, and overdue payables. Source: Goskomstat (2002)

47,1,Comparative Economic Studies,21 March 2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100083,Determinants of Access to Credit for Corporate Farms in Russia,March 2005,Aleksandr Subbotin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Based on the available literature, we chose five groups of factors that could potentially affect access to credit for corporate farms (Biais and Gollier, 1997; Cole, 1998). Three groups focus on the activity of the farm: they include current repayment capacity (ie, ability to generate profits); the ‘safety margin’ that enables the borrower to smooth out negative fluctuations of wealth (ie, asset endowments); and creditworthiness (as expressed by the credit history). Two additional groups of factors recognise the dependence of the access to credit on transaction costs (for the farm or the bank) and on regional policies. World experience suggests that both current repayment capacity and asset endowments should have a positive impact on access to credit. Transaction costs and poor credit history, on the other hand, reduce access to credit. The effect of regional policies cannot be anticipated in advance: it depends on local factors and is not generalisable. In the credit rationing paradigm, the effect of current repayment capacity is associated with so-called price rationing, whereas the effect of asset endowments, creditworthiness, and transaction costs is linked to nonprice rationing (Foltz, 2004). These five groups of factors affecting access of credit were operationalised by variables based on survey answers. Current repayment capacity was represented by sales revenue and profit margin (ie, ratio of gross profit to sales revenue). Availability of collateral, or more generally the farm's ability to fall back on its stock of fixed assets for debt repayment in case of insufficient sales or profits, was represented by agricultural land in use, the pool of farm machinery (in horsepower units), and the livestock herd. To avoid potential multicollinearity problems due to the high correlation between the number of animals and sales revenue, the livestock factor was proxied by the share of livestock products in total farm sales as reported in the survey. The farm's credit history was represented by its overdue debt (in absolute amounts).Footnote 3 A location variable qualitatively characterising the farm's distance from the regional centre (far/not far) was used as a proxy for transaction costs on the assumption that farms farther away from the centre face higher transaction costs than farms closer to the centre. Finally, regional policies were characterised by availability of subsidised credit in recent years and by an explicit regional dummy for the three provinces surveyed (Ivanovo, Rostov, Nizhnii Novgorod). The survey variables used in the regression are summarised in Table 1. The expected effect of each variable on the probability of access to credit is characterised as positive (ie, an increase of this factor is expected to increase the probability of access to credit) or negative (an increase of this factor is expected to reduce the probability of access to credit). The last two columns show the sample means for farms with and without access the credit (the means are calculated for 105 of the 142 cases that did not have missing values). Thus, in terms of simple descriptive statistics, sales revenues and profit margins are higher for farms with access to credit than for the rest of the farms. Overdue debt, on the other hand, is higher for farms that do not have access to credit. The impact of transaction costs (represented by the distance of the farm from the regional centre) is also quite clear: among farms without access to credit a higher percentage is located far from the regional centre than among farms enjoying access to credit. The univariate differences between the two categories of farms by each variable separately are generally not statistically significant. Only the two asterisked variables in Table 1 are statistically significantly different for farms with and without access to credit (profit margin and use of subsidised interest-rate credit in recent years). In this setting, it is essential to proceed with a multivariate regression analysis to identify the determinants of access to credit.",4

During the transition the Russian corporate farms have been generally viewed as highly unprofitable and inefficient, with the majority reporting losses and many in a state of technical bankruptcy (Yastrebova, 2005). Surprisingly, there have been relatively few analytical studies of the financial performance of Russian corporate farmsFootnote 1 and our work during the last few years has been aimed to partially fill this gap. In a previous study (Epshtein, 2001; Epstein, 2003), we have shown that the dreary averages – low profitability and high indebtedness – hide a whole spectrum of agricultural producers. At one end, there are well-run, financially healthy farms, which can be described as successful agricultural businesses that have fully adapted to the new market environment. At the other end, we find weak, unprofitable farms, many of which are totally unsustainable. In this article, we use the 2001 financial and production data for all corporate farms in Leningrad Oblast in Northwest Russia to classify them into five solvency groups by measures of financial health and to characterise the performance differences across the five groups. Most notably, farms in the high-solvency groups achieve higher production efficiency than less solvent farms. We show that the best performers are those with the best management, which plays a more important role than asset endowments in successful farms. We also verify to what extent the previous solvency grouping based on 1999 data has persisted over time. If the best farms survived as a group between 1999 and 2001, this would indicate that agricultural reforms have created a contingent of strong and healthy corporate farms capable of profitable production. In this sense, this would provide some evidence of at least partial success of agricultural reforms in Russia.",5

i) with the value of its marginal product in producing commodity j (VMP
j

i). If P
i>(<) VMP
j

i, the farm should decrease (increase) the use of input i in order to improve allocative efficiency (and profit). We accordingly present the results of AE analysis in terms of the AE ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of VMP
j

i to P
i: when the AE ratio is less than 1, the input's use should be reduced; when the AE ratio is greater than 1, the input's use should be increased. All marginal product estimates used in the AE tests are from econometrically estimated generalized Cobb-Douglas functions explaining the value of farm output. For each output/input combination, multiplying the estimated coefficient in the Cobb-Douglas function by the (geometrical) mean product of the input gives the input's estimated VMP (the methodology of AE analysis is briefly summarised by Grazhdaninova and Lerman, 2005). This article provides a summary overview of the AE calculations carried out by various researchers as part of the BASIS Russia project.Footnote 1 We only report the AE results for use of material inputs – fertiliser, seeds, animal feed, fuel, electricity, spare parts, and services; corresponding results for land and labour are reported in Grazhdaninova and Lerman (2005). All the AE calculations examined, with one exception, pertain to the behaviour of the large corporate farms that succeeded the former collective and state farms during transition. The exception is the work by Sazonov for Tambov Oblast, which covers the activities of private family farms (so-called peasant farms) that have arisen during transition, rather than the former state and collective farms (also see Sazonov and Sazonova, 2005). The calculations vary by researcher with respect to (1) the regions covered; (2) the data used; (3) the specific output/input combinations examined. Uzun covers all of Russia, using a Goskomstat database of the annual reports of some 24,000 corporate farms. Liefert et al. also cover all of Russia, but they use aggregate national statistics and examine only the AE of fertiliser to produce grain. Grazhdaninova and Lerman cover the three oblasts where data were collected for 144 corporate farms as a part of the 2003 BASIS survey – Rostov, Ivanovo, and Nizhnii Novgorod. Epshtein's analysis is specific to Leningrad Oblast, and it is based on the annual reports of all 195 corporate farms in that region. Sazonov's analysis relies on a survey of 56 peasant farms in Tambov Oblast. Some researchers examine the value of total farm output, including both crop and livestock production in essentially diversified Russian farms (Uzun, Epshtein, in part Lerman). In these analyses, the explanatory variables represent the total use of inputs, expressed in monetary values or in physical quantities. Other researchers analyze only crop or livestock production (Lerman, SazonovFootnote 2), or focus even more narrowly on grain, recognising that this commodity is the main consumer of fertilisers (Liefert et al., Grazhdaninova). In these cases, the use of inputs is specifically restricted to the enterprises or commodities analysed, while the output is expressed in value terms (aggregate crops or livestock) or in physical quantities (grain). The data for input and output prices used in the AE tests pertain to the specific regions covered in each analysis.

Abe Bergson would be the ideal referee of such a tournament, due to his honesty and absolute objectivity. This would have been for him the dream type of competition to referee. Bergson came to study the Soviet and the Socialist system from the theoretical viewpoint of a welfare economist, as an ideal test case of his work on the social welfare function and on optimal allocation of resources. In the same way that he was not fully satisfied with a Pareto Optimum as a normative maximum, he welcomed the opportunity to investigate not only, theoretically but also empirically, in real world situations, the merits and demerits of different social and economic systems. The emerging Soviet and Socialist case provided this opportunity. That this alternative economic system happened to be dictatorial, even cruel and inhumane of the Stalin type, that it became a formidable adversary during the Cold War, were unwarranted distractions that had to be dealt with but were never the true goals of his investigation. As much as Bergson did not like that the practical implementation of any economic system involved departures from the theoretical blueprint, he reluctantly folded up his sleeves and entered the muddy field of figures, concepts and definitions in order to peel away layer after layer of real-world distortions and biases to reach the core where, hopefully the truth may be found. As it turned out, this task of peeling took away a hefty proportion of the capabilities and energy, and indeed long years of Bergson's attention. One may ask, and indeed some did, why such a capable theorist as Abram Bergson would spend so much time on collecting, checking, manipulating and interpreting data. There are a number of responses by Bergson. First, turning to data is preconditioned upon the prior creation of a solid theoretical structure. Bergson stated the point very forcefully in his autobiographical note:
 From the beginning I have been able, I think with some success, to organize my research in the light of contemporary neo-classical analysis. Should that not have been possible, I doubt that I would have persisted in working on the Soviet Economy in any substantial way (1991, p. 62). Second, and I quote again:
 Data compilation can be a dreary task…But at any sophisticated level, where the concern is to relate the data to relevant analytical categories, such work can also be challenging intellectually (1991, p. 66). A third direct quote:
 While university scholars formerly had to devote a substantial effort to scrutinizing official data, and where necessary making independent calculations on the socialist economies, such work has largely been taken over by the US federal government, particularly the CIA, so there is little need for academics to trouble themselves with it any longer (1991, p. 65). Finally, the above discussion gives Bergson an opportunity to slash at those for which a…
 (A) corollary of the ‘leave it to the CIA approach’ is the inclination to employ, with minimal scrutiny, available socialist official statistics. Experience today shows that to be a treacherous procedure, (1991, pp. 65–66). My impression is that while it is very difficult to engage so deeply and so long in the study and manipulation of data without developing some empathy for this kind of work, Bergson concluded that the search for the true verdict on the relative merit of the socialist system could not be confined to theoretical considerations alone. This belief, and also the fact that so much was written about other aspects of the work of Bergson, has directed me to dedicate this paper to Bergson's journey in search of the truth concerning socialism. The starting point of this journey is nested in theoretical considerations, in the differentiation between the objective function of the ‘system's directors’ (SDs) and its implementation, and in the conclusion that implementation not only matters but is also dominant in the next section. The subsequent section discusses the evolution of Bergson's views and judgment on the merits of the Socialist system. The next section is devoted to the evolution of the study of comparative efficiency over time, and finally the conclusions are given.",2

By 1953, he demonstrated, or intuited that:
 Langean-type market socialism provided a viable theoretical alternative to free enterprise. Supermen-planners could computationally replicate Langean outcomes. Hence, planning was a conceptually viable, and a potentially superior surrogate for competitive markets. Soviet subaggregate data should be considered innocent until proven guilty; that is, ‘reliable’ and ‘usable’, unless there are compelling reasons for doubt.Footnote 21 The conceptual shortcomings of Marxist labor cost prices can be partly overcome with adjusted factor costing, especially with respect to ‘production potential’; that is, supply side, marginal rates of product transformation. Soviet consumption, and GDP may meaningfully reflect planners’ preferences. These axioms were revised by 1963 as follows: Whatever Soviet socialism's theoretical potential, planning in practice was micro and macroeconomically inferior to free enterprise. Neither optimal programming, nor improved incentivization could overcome the adverse effects of the criminalization of business, entrepreneurship and private ownership, price, wage, interest and foreign exchange rate fixing, as well as the ad hoc character of Kremlin economic command and control. Negative combined factor productivity would necessarily cause the Soviet GDP and per capita growth to underperform the west. Bergson's formulation implies that technological progress wasn’t great enough to offset diminishing returns to input driven growth. In order to sustain point 7, Bergson had to substantially qualify point 3 because 7 could not be confirmed with unadjusted official statistics. Moreover, nothing in the corpus of Bergson work prepared him for the Soviet Union's economic plunge 1989–1991, or the USSR's dissolution. While, this does not conclusively prove that Soviet data were corrupt, or that other causes better explain the USSR's demise like corruption, plunder, or system disorganization (Rosefielde, 2005b; Rosefielde and Hedlund, 2006), it clearly exposes the inadequacy of his axiomatics. It therefore must be concluded that Bergson's rules of thumb should be viewed as working hypotheses, which facilitated orderly analysis, but were not necessary and sufficient to validate his method. His elaboration of Langean socialism, and supermen-planned analogues was illuminating, but too removed from Command Communist reality to provide deep insight into the Kremlin's economic control mechanism, which now seems more like monkey business than optimal planning, muddling or even Hayek's ‘planned chaos’ (Markevich and Gregory, 2003; Gregory 2003a, 2003b: Cf. Nove, 1977). Nor did his analysis of incentive reforms, or his adjusted factor costing, redress this shortcoming. Soviet red directors knew nothing about Bergson's adjusted prices, and therefore could not have fixed enterprise marginal rates of transformation with respect to them. None of this means that Bergson's road map was sterile. We know in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's demise that idealistic working hypotheses cannot be relied upon to accurately assess the performance of authoritarian physically managed systems. The next time around, analysts will not delude themselves that criminalising business, entrepreneurship and privated property can be easily remedied with optimal planning and patchwork incentivization (Nove, 1977). The collapse of the Soviet Union has taught us that the Soviet experience was darker than SNIP implied. Real GDP and per capita income growth were less than they seemed. The Soviet Union was not a normal country, and data including anthropometric and hedonic adjustments thereof, that make it seem so are deceptive. Stalinist planning practice was more of a charade than an exercise in applied systems engineering and control, and the impact of structural militarisation, terror, excess deaths and Gulag greater than the national income comparisons conveyed. The USSR was closer to 1984 than a planned clone of the west, and the task of Bergson's successors is to learn from the past, and not treat semblences as if they accurately portrayed substance.",6

The merit of socialism was to be gauged by the efficiency with which it satisfied consumer welfare. Its rationality could be measured not only against consumer welfare but also in relation to ‘planners’ preferences.’ Rationality in either sense, he suggested, is best measured by ‘the degree to which conduct conforms to the material ends sought … We are thus led to ask, in respect to Soviet conduct regarding resource use, the cardinal question that arises in respect to economic conduct generally: In terms of what material ends and to what extent is such behavior economically rational?’ Few will have changed their minds about the merits of socialism as a result of the opening of the archives. The main advances that new documentation has made possible relate to the rationality of the Soviet command system. We can learn in unprecedented detail how Soviet officials behaved in the privacy of their offices and why they behaved as they did. Specifically, we find that officials at each level were continually issuing new decrees and instructions to those below them, who rarely did exactly as they were told. At the time, the same officials were receiving reports and information from below, some distorted and the rest incomplete; their core problem was to verify and control what people were really doing when they claimed to be obeying orders. The fact that officials at each level of the command system were not merely passive instruments of higher authority is what makes its operation an interesting problem. How did Soviet officials command people and allocate resources? How did Stalin and his successors get others to do their bidding? This paper is about the rational behaviour of a principal who gives an order and the agent who is expected to carry it out. In studying the behaviour that we observe historically, it tries to answer Bergson's ‘cardinal question’: ‘In terms of what material ends and to what extent is such behaviour economically rational?’ According to Avner Greif (2000), any institution that persists must be understood as an equilibrium of individual motivations and constraints: each person participates in it because it is in their interest to do, conditional upon their expectation that others have made the same calculation. How is the equilibrium of individual motivations and constraints achieved in the case of market institutions? Greif describes the fundamental problem of exchange as a game that arises from the sequential nature of a transaction. Two players contemplate a contract to engage in mutually beneficial exchange. The first player must initiate the contract and advance the means to fulfil it to the second player, or alternatively abstain. The second must decide to cooperate by completing the contract or cheat by stealing the proceeds of the exchange, including the advance, at the expense of the first player. Without means of enforcement, the best strategy of the second player is to cheat and that of the first is to abstain. Historically, therefore, the rise of market exchange required the development of a variety of private and public enforcement mechanisms that overcame this problem. Hierarchies give rise to a corresponding fundamental problem of command. The origin of the problem is the same, the sequential nature of a transaction. A principal gives an order to an agent and advances the means to implement it. Why is an order necessary? Since the principal desires an allocation of resources that differs from the one that would result from the agent's pursuit of her own self-interest; if this were not the case then the desired allocation would result from the agent's action without having to be told. It follows that for the hierarchy to find an equilibrium, the obedient agent must be induced to forego opportunities for private gain. This problem must be solved for a hierarchy to find an equilibrium. Hierarchies have existed in many forms and for many reasons. One form is the modern corporation. The transaction-cost approach of Coase (1937) and Williamson (1975) suggests that corporations exist in order to realise potential efficiency gains. In neo-Marxian economics, however, they exist to exert power and monopolise resources (Hymer, 1960/1976; Marglin, 1974). In the first case, the hierarchy grows because its superior efficiency gives it a competitive advantage, and society gains as a result. In the second case, it grows by stifling competition and extracting a monopoly rent, while society suffers a welfare loss. In this paper, we will think about a particular kind of hierarchy, the command system. The command system is a hierarchy that is driven by monopolisation, not cost reduction: it attempts to monopolise a territory by force. Monopolisation is the strategy that Evgenii Preobrazhensky (1926/1965) advocated for the Soviet economy in the 1920s. We are also looking at something similar to Mancur Olson (1993) when he analysed a proprietary dictator. The problem that I describe is present in all complex hierarchical organisations, even where their existence is predicated on superior efficiency. This is because, even if an organisation exists solely to enable its members to exploit a mutual efficiency gain that is shared with society, any individual within the organisation can gain still more by shirking or cheating the other members. Such opportunities have always been present in command systems to the extent that their monopolising drive was never completely successful and their control over resources remained partially, not fully centralised. We will use the Soviet economy as an example.",14

The Soviet Union was a great social experiment with political, social, demographic, and economic dimensions. My research focuses on the economic issues – socialised ownership, investment strategy, agricultural organisation, the growth of income and consumption. What worked? What failed? And why? What lessons does Soviet history have to teach? The present reassessment is based on three axes: recalculations of national income from 1928 to 1940 including, in particular, the growth in consumption; the use of simulation models to explore counter factual development trajectories; and the reposition of the debate on Soviet performance in a world-historical context. Major issues in Soviet economic history are analysed in this framework, including the growth prospects of the late Imperial economy, the standard of living from 1928 to 1940, the causes of rapid growth during that period, the long run history of the population, and the growth slowdown in the 1970s and 1980s. These inquiries point to a more favourable assessment of Soviet experience than is often reach. This judgement, however, should not be read as an unqualified endorsement of the Soviet system. Dictatorship was and is a political model to be avoided. Collectivisation and political repression were human catastrophes that brought at most meagre economic returns. The strength of central planning also contained the seeds of its own undoing, for it brought with it the need for someone to plan centrally. When plan objectives became misguided, as in the Brezhnev period, the system stagnated.",7

One problem naturally leads to another and the research trajectory of a scholar can easily pass fertile fields in the hot pursuit of an elusive partial truth. Abram Bergson was of course theoretically equipped to have worked either or both sides of the street of national income and product accounting, that is, using either the production potential standard or the welfare standard as the ideal behind his calculations. I have often wondered why Abram Bergson's revealed preference in his empirical work seemed to have been for the production potential standard as opposed to the welfare standard. The simplest explanation would be data availability. It is the nature of a material balances system to collect and publish a lot information about quantities and less about prices. To apply the welfare standard, consumer prices are needed and the collection of consumer price data must have seemed of relatively low priority for Western embassy staff and the intelligence professionals compared to the determination of the order of battle.Footnote 1 Another explanation can be found in the substitution of planners' preferences for consumer sovereignty to explain economic performance of centrally planned economies, which leaves ordinary households as economic objects rather than economic subjects.Footnote 2 My final speculation is that Moorsteen–Bergson quantity index number theory, Moorsteen (1961) and Bergson (1961), requires no econometrics for its implementationFootnote 3 whereas index numbers à la Konüs have been closely linked with the statistical art of demand systems estimation. Econometrics beyond the descriptive use of multiple regression was very specialised human capital for Abram Bergson's generation. While it is an interesting question in scientific biography why Abram Bergson chose the path of the production potential standard, there is the larger question of why others did not try or were not as successful in their attempts to apply the welfare standard. Since everyone suffered the same data constraints with regard to consumer prices, I believe the answer can be found in scientific fashion or, to sound more profound, the sociology of knowledge. The early 1970s was an age of disequilibrium macroeconomics. Barro and Grossman's (1971) break from the IS-LM general equilibrium framework to one of general disequilibrium caught the fantasy of many able younger economists hungry for a scientific revolution. Young hounds like Richard Portes, see Portes and Winter (1980) and Portes et al. (1987), were off chasing macro-disequilibrium foxes and applied demand analysis was not where crowds gathered in comparative economics. Nonetheless, it turns out that there were enough parts available in the first half of the 1980s to have applied the welfare standard to the Soviet consumer. In what is to follow I will describe those parts and provide a table to illustrate how one can actually quantify the microeconomic reality experienced by Soviet consumers.",4

They are swept away by popular revolutions, often followed by years of civil wars, or forcefully removed by foreign powers. The rapid and peaceful demise of the Soviet regime in 1991 is a rare and surprising exception to the rule. A popular view holds that the end of the Soviet system was predetermined by its poor economic performance in the last two decades of its existence. Although the series of studies initiated by Abram Bergson establishes a decelerating trend in the post-war Soviet economy beyond reasonable doubt, this is only a part of the answer. A low rate of economic growth is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for transition to democracy. To the contrary, non-democracies are generally associated with lower rates of economic growth (Barro, 1999) while the probability of transition to democracy is positively correlated, ceteris paribus, with higher levels of GDP per capita (Feng and Zak, 1999). Moreover, rational rulers may deliberately block technological and institutional modernisation if ensuing change threatens to eliminate their political rents (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2002). An explanation of the demise of the Soviet system is therefore to be placed in a broader political-economic context. An enticing option is to assign to Gorbachev's misguided reforms the role of the major trigger of collapse as, for example, in Ellman and Kontorovich (1998, Introduction). The importance of this factor as a proximate cause notwithstanding, it does not explain why numerous twists and turns in Soviet policy and ideology did not lead to the same final result earlier. By focusing on errors, this sort of explanation leaves little room for rational choice of involved agents. A more fundamental approach would be to look into the sources of stability of a non-democratic regime and the limits of its sustainability through the analysis of costs and benefits for the rulers and their subjects. Harrison (2002) makes an important step in this direction by modelling the Soviet system as a game played by the dictator/planner and the producer. Harrison shows that the system has two equilibria: one with a high level of coercion applied by the dictator to the producer and a high level of effort exerted by the producer in response; another with zero coercion and effort. The second equilibrium – which is the equivalent of the system collapse – is realised when, due to increasing monitoring costs, the dictator abandons coercion since it no longer brings positive net returns. This model creates a framework within which economic and political variables can be put together, and it explains the end of the Soviet regime as an optimal outcome for the agents, given the system of incentives and exogenous factors. In this paper, I take a step further in the same direction. First, I propose to look at a broader scope of options for the rulers. Theoretically, the ‘outside option’ of privatisation always existed but certain parameters apparently predicated the rulers’ choice in favour of non-inheritable collective property rights. From this perspective, a Soviet-type system may ‘shut down’ when the net benefit for the rulers is still positive but falls short of what the private-property alternative is expected to yield. Second, I will go inside the black box of coercion. In most economic models of non-democracy, the ruling agent, the dictator, is essentially the ‘only guy with a gun in town,’ while the cost of maintaining the ‘gun’ (coercion) is determined exogenously. In reality, the ruling agent is more complex. It is a bureaucratic hierarchy with a sizeable elite on top and a lower stratum of agents who provide the monitoring services on the shop floor, in the field, and in the streets. Regime stability is determined by the system of incentives for both layers of the hierarchy. In particular, the monitoring agents should have incentives to provide services at a finite cost and support the regime politically rather than to seek takeover, to become ‘roving bandits,’ or to defect to a foreign power. A large share of the coercion costs are then the cost of enforcing the contract between the ruling top and the monitors. Stability of a Soviet-type regime rests on a sort of social contract. One party to such a contract is the ‘bosses’ – the ruling state-party bureaucracy, who need loyal agents to supervise (elicit effort from) the working population. The other party is the ‘activists’ – younger members of the ruling party, people able to fulfill this task, in search of career paths toward higher incomes. Total control by the bureaucracy over the economy and a significant bureaucracy premium – the difference between bureaucratic rents and the wages of the working population – creates an incentive for an activist to enter the contract with the bosses. The terms of this contract assume that activists volunteer their services to the incumbent bureaucrats, thus allowing the latter to increase their rents. Activists are paid back with the deferred promotion into rent-paying positions. The incumbent bosses have either to retire or to create new positions to accommodate the activists whose contracts have reached maturity. The contract is beneficial for the bosses and the activists as long as it maximises expected lifetime incomes for both groups. Under certain conditions, however, the parameters of the promotion contract may become inconsistent with the bosses’ participation constraint and transition to a regime based on private property rights ensues. The discussion proceeds as follows. The first section describes the political-economic exchange between the ruling bureaucracy and the population in the Soviet institutional framework. Optimal promotion contracts and the limits to the regime's sustainability are discussed in the second section. The third section analyses the effects of time inconsistency in the implicit promotion contract and its enforceability under in two institutional settings: personal dictatorship and oligarchy. The fourth section interprets the long-run trends in the communist party membership in the USSR from the developed theoretical perspective and argues that the end of the Soviet regime in 1991 was consistent with the optimal contract reaching the bosses’ participation constraint. The last section concludes.",20

The Joint Economic Committee of Congress's noted ‘Green Books’ summarised knowledge of how Soviet industrial material supply planning worked and how it was changing from the 1950s through the 1980s (Levine, 1959, 1962; Schroeder, 1973). A rereading of these studies reveals what was known at that time. It was apparent that industrial planning was complicated, confusing, and often delayed, that it planned centrally relatively few commodities, and that it was dominated by the State Planning Commission (Gosplan), operating under its various titles during this period. The publication of a planning manual by Gosplan in 1974, with a revised version in 1980, did not prove helpful. It represented planning as a process of balancing a large number of equations but gave precious little operational detail (Gosplan SSSR, 1980). Western scholars followed three different approaches in their study of industrial material supply planning. One group tried to decipher the actual process of industrial materials planning, usually focusing on national economic plans (Bergson, 1964; Levine, 1959, 1962; Schroeder, 1973; Gregory and Stuart, various editions; Nove, 1977). The state of knowledge on planning processes was summarised by Abram Bergson in his 1964 monograph (Bergson, 1964). Others, such as Joseph Berliner and David Granick, considered planning from the vantage point of the enterprise, studying how the enterprise was planned by its immediate superiors in the ministry (Berliner, 1957; Granick, 1954). A third group, including Bergson (1989), compared ex ante plans with ex post outcomes. The most exhaustive such study was Eugene Zaleski's 1980 study of plan targets and their fulfilment by 5 years and annual plans for the period 1933–1952 (actually from 1928) (Zaleski, 1980), in which Zaleski reached his famous conclusion that the Soviet economy was not ‘planned’. Rather, resources were allocated after the plan was adopted by ad hoc ‘resource management’ by state and party officials. Raymond Powell's overlooked article in the first volume of Journal of Comparative Economics is actually a theoretical description of Zaleski's resource management (Powell, 1977). Studies of Soviet planning, most notably Zaleski's, used published sources to study 5-year and annual plans for the entire economy. The ‘operational’ plans, however, mentioned most frequently by Berliner and Granick's managers were quarterly plans issued either by the ministry planning department or by their main administrations (glavk, singular, and glavki, plural). Operational planning took place largely out of public sight in Gosplan's branch departments, ministerial planning departments, glavks, and in enterprises. This paper returns to a number of unanswered questions: What were the real procedures of industrial material planning? Was this a ‘planned’ or a ‘resource managed’ economy? The ultimate question – ‘how well’ the Soviet industrial planning system worked – defies easy answers. Bergson (1964) suggests an efficiency framework for such questions in his Economics of Soviet Planning. In this monograph, he examined labour allocation, pricing, investment allocation, and supply planning in terms of standard efficiency rules, such as equalising marginal rates of return. In the case of administrative planning, there were no readymade efficiency criteria, but he volunteered two yardsticks: Was there a reasonable degree of cost-minimisation incorporated in the fixed coefficients (or norms) used in Soviet planning? Bergson's second yardstick is whether the economy actually produced the final output mix desired by system's leaders? That is, did planning follow planners’ preferences? Bergson's second yardstick is quite similar to Zaleski's resource-management question. The preferences of the system's leaders expressed in ex ante plans could scarcely be met if resources were allocated on an ad hoc and uncoordinated basis by branch, local, regional, and national leaders.",4

Some scholars maintain that a wide gap separates the old system, that operated in the command economy, and the new pro-market arbitrazh courts (Greif and Kandel, 1995; Hendrix, 2001; Lee and Meagher, 2001). According to Berman (1963), Gosarbitrazh was a system of economic courts with judicial and administrative powers.Footnote 1 It existed separately from the regular courts, was closely linked to the government, and was immediately subordinated to the supreme administrative bodies of the regions in which they operated.Footnote 2 Similarly, departmental courts of arbitration were subordinate to the industrial ministries. While economic plans provided the guidelines for judges, regional and/or state leaders reserved the right to intervene through arbiters’ appointments, supervision of their activity, reversal or modification of arbiters’ decisions, and retrials. These characteristics are partly responsible for shaping an image of Gosarbitrazh as a highly dependent and largely insignificant institution whose practice had nothing to do with the new market-oriented economy. An alternative view is that the success of the modern-day arbitrazh courts is due to the reforms that transformed an old institution, rather than creating an entirely new one. Hendley et al. (2001) argues that the reforms were ‘much more driven by the concern of professionals within the legal system than politicians.’ According to Hendrix's (2000) estimate, roughly 30 percent of judges working in the first tier courts in contemporary Russia are former arbiters in Gosarbitrazh. Recent studies of legal contract enforcement in Russia provide an optimistic prognosis of the impact of legal institutions on economic performance. (Pistor, 1996; Johnson et al., 1999; Hendley et al., 1999, 2001). The trend toward the rule of law in post-Soviet Russia is supported by evidence that law and legal institutions are widely used when disputes are hard to resolve. The caseload of arbitrazh courts is increasing over time, from some 200,000 cases in 1994 to nearly 400,000 cases in 1998 reaching 70 percent of the mid-1980s level (Hendrix, 2001).Footnote 3 Is Gosarbitrazh so distant from the contemporary arbitrazh courts that we should view them as an entirely new institution? To what extent did Gosarbitrazh provide the contemporary arbitrazh courts with essential expertise that has allowed them to develop into a well-regarded institution? This paper attempts to answer these questions. Contract enforcement in highly regulated economies is not a well-studied theme and studying it should shed some light on the institutions that facilitated exchange in the past and under different political-economic regimes, of which we still know very little (Greif, 2000). The Soviet economic system was not immune to fundamental problems of agency and exchange (Belova and Gregory, 2002) and enforcement of government decisions was one of the top issues. However, against the backdrop of other Soviet institutions, Gosarbitrazh may give an impression of being insignificant and subordinate. Traditionally, plans and direct descending orders were viewed as governing resource allocation in a Soviet-type economy; therefore, there was no need for institutionalised inter-enterprise relations. Since the State Planning Committee (Gosplan) allegedly produced contracts between state enterprises, Gosarbitrazh should be a relatively unimportant executive agency. This line of argument has several flaws and is at odds with the literature and archival evidence. In his study of Soviet enterprises, Joseph Berliner (1957) emphasises the importance of inter-enterprise contracts. Janos Kornai (1980, p. 66) underlines the continuing role of contracts in the planned economy where ‘official rationing [plan] determines only relatively aggregate quotas. Rationing is anyway completed by the ‘business contract’ between buyer and seller in which they agree on the specific quantity, price, time of delivery.’ The Soviet archival records provide numerous indications of bilateral relations between enterprises that were regulated by contracts. Each year the government issued decrees on ‘the contracting campaign’ for the year. While Gosplan did allocate resources at the aggregate level, it had no intention of being involved in the actual implementation of transactions at the microlevel. The latter remained, to a great extent, at the discretion of enterprise managers (Belova and Gregory, 2002). Comparisons of the dynamics of the number of cases filed with Gosarbitrazh (the caseload) and economic policy changes allow us to define the role of Gosarbitrazh. Had Gosarbitrazh simply been an extension of administrative enforcement, periods of taut planning and tight governmental control over enterprises should coincide with increases in Gosarbitrazh's caseloads. Concurrently, decreasing caseloads should match the periods of liberalisation associated with lower administrative pressures. Our analysis shows the exact opposite: Gosarbitrazh's caseload activity grew during periods of liberalisation (mid-1930s, the late-1950s, mid-1960s, and mid-1980s), while it clearly shrank as the government tightened the screws (the early and late 1930s, the late 1940s – early 1950s, and the 1970s). The rest of the paper proceeds in three steps. The next section outlines the creation of Gosarbitrazh in the context of institutional change in the 1920s and the 1930s. The subsequent section examines the interplay between administrative and legal contract enforcement throughout the 1930s – the 1980s. A conclusion follows.",5

The most comprehensive attempt ‘to grasp the nature of working arrangements for resource use in the USSR’ was the 1964 monograph The Economics of Soviet Planning (Bergson, 1964). Bergson's first monograph, his 1944 The Structure of Soviet Wages, was devoted to the Soviet labour market (Bergson, 1944). Bergson's writings were anchored by his compelling interest in welfare economics, which he applied to judge the ‘merit’ of socialism: On this point, he wrote: ‘in order for resource use to be fully rational economically, theory teaches that a community must realize an ‘economic optimum.’’Footnote 1 Bergson searched for efficiency rules in Soviet working arrangements, writing: ‘After all, one needs some principles even to discover that none prevails’ (Bergson, 1964). To further his evaluation, Bergson's major concession was that this ‘rationality’ could be judged in terms of the planners' welfare function, which he expected to favour investment and defence. Bergson wrote relatively little on politics or power relations, but he did not preclude the pursuit of non-economic goals, such as the furtherance of ideology or ‘personal satisfactions … derive(d) from administering the economy through some procedures rather than others’ (Bergson, 1964), which means the ‘fact that ‘means’ are also ‘ends’’ (Bergson, 1966). Bergson did not delve deeply into the relationship between socialism and dictatorship as did Hayek (1944), but he did comment on more than one occasion that totalitarianism has been predominant under socialism although some of its ‘advocates sincerely aspire to avoid authoritarianism’ (Bergson, 1966). Bergson wanted to test for decision-making rules that would at least ‘tend towards’ or ‘approximate’ economic efficiency within the context of planners' preferences. According to my reading, he found some limited rationality in the Soviet labour market and found, in the short-term context of fixed coefficients, some reason for hope for material balances. Bergson was operating on the assumption that a dictator would loathe to waste resources.",2

Subsequent research has shown the presence of vast principal/agent problems within the vertical command system, with the principal conflict between those who issued orders and those who had to fulfil them (Gregory, 2004). When we study the camp economy, we must consider similar issues: Was there a distinction between the ministry of interior, including its embodied main administration of prison camps (GULAG) and the top leadership of the Soviet Union, or were they one and the same? Was the GULAG, like its industrial ministry counterparts, in constant conflict with the leadership over plan targets and material inputs? Were the individual NKVD construction sites and plants, staffed with forced labour, engaged in a principal/agent conflict with their superiors in the central ministry, like their counterparts in civilian industry? Although such conflicts are not the prime focus of this paper, we can report that the former Soviet archives provide ample evidence of conflicts between high NKVD/MVD and GULAG officials and local camp administrators. Judging from administrative documents and the information they provide for the period from the 1930s through the 1950s, the GULAG was generally oriented towards keeping its labour force in reasonable condition for hard work so that it could fulfil construction and production plans handed down from above. Already in the 1930s, and to an even larger extent during the post-war period, it issued numerous orders to ensure the provision of minimum levels of food, clothing and living conditions, and seeked to enforce limits imposed on the exploitation of prison labour by legislation. In contrast, camp managers (and their immediate subordinates), to our surprise, in many cases appeared less interested in maintaining bearable living and working conditions, and often proved crude, cruel, and indifferent in their dealings with prisoners. The GULAG's intense interest in inmate labour productivity is particularly reflected by the large number of requests sent to their NKVD/MVD bosses, especially during the post-war period, asking permission to introduce more efficient labour motivation systems. The most important decisions concerning labour motivation programmes in the camps system had to be made by the supreme Soviet authorities. Sometimes it took several years to get such permission ‘from above’.",6

Bergson himself dealt with defence on the basis of officially published budgetary allocations and also by drawing on the research of Oleg Hoeffding, Norman Kaplan, Richard Moorsteeen, Nancy Nimitz, Raymond Powell, and others on military prices and procurements (Bergson, 1961, pp. 362–377). Moorsteen and Powell (1966, pp. 628–637) went on to build the defence industry into their annual series for Soviet GNP by sector of origin from 1928 to 1962. Their pioneering estimate probably overstated Soviet defence production at the start of Stalin's industrialisation drive, and therefore understated its subsequent growth, but otherwise it stood the test of time (Davies and Harrison, 1997, p. 374). One of the chief obstacles to real research was Soviet secrecy. The Soviet literature on the economics of defence was aimed not at scholarship but at making ordinary Soviet citizens feel secure and making an impression on potential adversaries. Beyond occasional tantalising glimpses such as that afforded by the Soviet 1941 economic plan found after the war in German archives, Western scholars had little data on which to base objective study. Bergson's own best efforts could not overcome the veil of official secrecy. Despite his intense interest in Soviet working arrangements, the index of his treatise on the Soviet economic system contains not one reference to ‘defence’ or ‘military’; in the text, he deals with defence outlays only as a limit on the availability of resources for other uses (Bergson, 1964, pp. 308–313). But this did not mean a lack of interest in the subject. Rather, Bergson's generation lacked the opportunity to engage in more than intelligent guesswork. Moreover, their evidence base was especially fragile for the early period, as the example of Moorsteen and Powell suggests. With the fall of communism, the curtain of secrecy has become easier to penetrate, and work has begun to appear in Russia and the West, which is based on new sources and new approaches (Barber and Harrison, 2000; Bystrova, 2000; Davies, 1993; Davies and Harrison, 1997; Gregory, 2003; Harrison, 1996, 2003; Samuelson, 2000; Simonov, 1996). Russian scholarly and archival institutions are engaged in preparing a multi-volume documentary publication on the defence industry (Istoriia, 2003), which will open up new research opportunities. This paper uses the Soviet state and party archives to discuss the development of the defence industry in the 1920s and its role in preparing the ground for the ‘Great Breakthrough’ of 1929. Subsequent studies will look at the defence sector in the 1930s and later. In this paper, I will touch only on a few issues. First, I consider the influence of historical continuity on Soviet military doctrine and military-industrial production. Specifically, what were the legacies of Tsarism, the events of World War I, the establishment of the Bolshevik dictatorship, and the Civil War that led to Soviet Russia's isolation in the international arena? Second, how did the defence industry adapt to market conditions under the New Economic Policy (NEP), and how did plan and market interact? This question has obvious importance for Russia today as it devises a military-industrial policy based on market relations between government, state-owned enterprises, and the private sector. Third, what was the real state of the Soviet defence industry and its management on the eve of Stalin's emergence as dictator, and how did political and military leaders see its future at the time? Finally, to what extent did the immediate requirements of the defence industry contribute to the ‘Great Breakthrough’ that ended NEP and established the Stalinist command system? Most Western textbook accounts describe the economic context of this transition in purely civilian terms: the demands of capital construction, the grain crisis, and so on. Military-economic developments, when mentioned, are represented in terms of future needs, not present interests, although Carr and Davies (1969, pp. 454–460) provide an honorable exception. In fact, the interests of defence industry in the 1920s were a powerful influence that should not be ignored.",2
47,2,Comparative Economic Studies,20 June 2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100114,Corruption in the Gulag: Dilemmas of Officials and Prisoners,June 2005,James Heinzen,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this article, we review the phenomenon of corruption among Gulag officials, defined here as economic or official crime with the goal of enriching oneself at the state's expense. The study further examines campaigns by the leadership of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs to fight corruption, a theme that has only been mentioned briefly in published work on the Gulag. The zenith of the Gulag system, the immediate post-war years of 1945–1953, is the focus of this article. Anecdotal evidence, located primarily in a voluminous memoir literature, has long pointed to widespread solicitation of bribery and theft of property by officials in the camp system.Footnote 1 Prisoners recalled that their personal belongings, together with camp property, was frequently stolen by guards or supervisors and resold on black markets. Officials also demanded payoffs for favourable work assignments, breaks, and better food. Prisoners attest that a large proportion of their money went toward paying these bribes. In their influential 1947 book, Forced Labor in Soviet Russia, David J Dallin and Boris I Nicolaevsky also noted that corruption and bribery among camp officials were very widespread (Dallin and Nicolaevsky, 1947). Basing their conclusions primarily on interviews with former prisoners, Dallin and Nicolaevsky asserted that ‘graft reaches outrageous proportions….’ Not surprisingly, materials in the Gulag archives confirm that which innumerable memoirists have written over the years. Indeed, materials from former Soviet archives add a great deal to our understanding of corruption and anti-corruption campaigns, both in the camps and in the broader society and polity. During the Soviet era, statistics on criminality in the USSR remained a state secret. With the opening of Soviet archives, data (albeit often incomplete and contradictory) on crime and anti-crime measures became available. These data allow opportunity for more analysis of the phenomenon of criminality in general – and official crime in particular – during the late-Stalin period. Archival materials make possible an initial study of the phenomenon of corruption and economic crime among camp officials. The dimensions of frequent ‘campaigns’ against corruption inside the penal camps can also be detailed. Furthermore, archive materials allow insights into the challenges faced by camp authorities in a central element of attempts to limit corruption – the problem of motivating prisoners to provide information about corrupt officials – as leading MVD officials reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of these informant networks and the quality of the information gathered through them. On the basis of these archives, the first section of this article is devoted to an investigation of the types and quantity of official corruption in the camps. The second part of the article addresses Gulag authorities' anti-corruption efforts, which involved inspectors, auditors, and a sprawling network of informants. The article's final section addresses the camps' informant network in more detail, focusing on the authorities' problems in motivating prisoners to inform, and dilemmas prisoners faced in making decisions about cooperating with authorities. In the 1940 s and 1950 s, the Soviet Union experienced corruption at all levels of society and economic life. In a wide variety of ways, government officials in civilian society enriched themselves at public expense. They stole and resold government property, embezzled funds, extracted and offered bribes, and traded access to privileges, offices, and scarce goods. They relied on informal friendships, ‘blat’ (favours based on acquaintance), or patronage networks to cover up crimes or to obtain materials needed to successfully fulfil frequently unrealistic plan targets within an economy of shortage, bottlenecks, and hyper-centralised control. As such, officials exposed themselves to charges of embezzlement (rastrata), vziatochnichestvo (bribery), spekuliatsiia (speculation), zloupotreblenie sluzhebnym polozheniem (abuse of office), and other official crimes. It is useful to conceptualise corruption in the Gulag as part of this larger national phenomenon, which was a central feature of Soviet economic and social life throughout the Stalin period (and beyond). Of course, corruption has been a prominent feature in most nations in an era of expansive states and bureaucracies, and is by no means confined to Soviet-style economies. Nevertheless, the nature of the Stalinist economy – its nationalised property and infrastructure, strictly centralised planning system, chronic shortages, and one-party monopoly on power – provided bureaucrats with many opportunities and incentives to profit at the state's expense. In his seminal 1957 treatment of Soviet industrial management, Joseph Berliner observed that the types of activities outlined above were rife among industrial administrators (Berliner, 1957, pp. 160–230). He also pointed out that often activities that were often regarded as ‘economic crime’ could be actually efforts taken by managers desperate to fulfil unreasonable plans amidst the chaos that typified the Soviet industrial and distribution systems. (On the basis of the Gulag archive materials I have been able to review, it is, unfortunately, impossible to determine the proportion of actions labelled as crimes that were informal measures taken simply to fulfil plans, rather than to enrich the official at the state's expense.) This article will focus on crimes that allowed officials to use their positions for private profit. Admittedly, reports by inspectors and prosecutors do not always make this distinction, and the widespread practice of political attacks in many instances confused the truth of the situation even further. Since the time that Berliner reported his findings, scholars have devoted little attention to the questions of corruption during the pivotal post-war 1940s and 1950s. Nevertheless, I would suggest that some of the larger conceptualisations used in research on the better-studied 1930s and the Brezhnev era can usefully be applied to the post-war period.Footnote 2 Scholars have noted that the centralised command-administrative economy was particularly likely to breed bribery, embezzlement, and other official crimes. In a strictly hierarchical and inflexible system, administrators had major incentives to evade the rules, especially in light of harsh punishments for failure to fulfil plans. Similarly, there were prolific opportunities for self-enrichment in the chaos of the 5-year plans. Amid chronic shortages, which were particularly extreme in the Gulag, ‘black markets’ inevitably thrived in both the pre-war and post-war years. Officials were often deeply involved in these illegal markets (Grossman, 1977).Footnote 3 In his classic work on the Soviet ‘second economy’ and its relationship to the Brezhnev-era ‘kleptocracy,’ Gregory Grossman noted the strong likelihood of ‘a close organic connection between political–administrative authority, on the one hand, and a highly developed world of illegal economic activity, on the other’. (Grossman, 1977, pp. 32–33) In light of the tremendous drain on resources resulting from economic crime, central authorities were likely to crack down on the most egregious forms of criminality. Yet, studies of the 1930s by historians and of the 1970s and 1980s by economists and political scientists have shown that anti-corruption campaigns were likely to be selectively applied by the party-state, as members of the elite who were parts of strong patronage networks were usually excluded from prosecution (Belova, 2001; Lampert, 1984; Clark, 1993). Such lax or irregular prosecution might have encouraged more illegal behaviour. In light of these studies of the 1930s and the Brezhnev era, it should not be surprising to find widespread economic crime among officialdom (including officials employed in the Gulag) in the 1945–1953 period, accompanied by regular (if selective and, therefore, ultimately unsuccessful) state efforts to eradicate such activity. In light of this previous research, this study adopts the following hypotheses. First, that corruption existed in significant quantities inside the camp system, and that the forms it took were largely the same as in the wider Soviet society and economy. Second, the state's efforts to fight various types of corruption, which were widespread (albeit unevenly enforced) in the civilian world, also had a place in the camps. Just as in other areas of Soviet life, then, one would expect that corruption and anti-corruption campaigns should have been common in the Gulag. The third hypothesis of this article is that anti-corruption efforts were carried out along the same lines as in non-camp society. Similar to campaigns outside the camps, efforts to combat official corruption should have been rooted in several key principles: that officials must strictly adhere to party discipline and ‘party morality’ and observe ‘socialist legality;’ and they must be products of ‘proper’ upbringing (vospitanie), which included a ‘correct,’ ‘communist’ attitude toward their labour and discipline. Soviet authorities assumed that corruption would corrode morality among officials and society as a whole, as well as make the state's tasks more difficult (Lampert, 1984, pp. 366–385).",3
47,2,Comparative Economic Studies,20 June 2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100106,Trading Effort for Freedom: Workday Credits in the Stalinist Camp System,June 2005,Simon Ertz,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Hard physical labour was the distinguishing feature of Soviet ‘corrective labour camps’ and ‘colonies’ (Applebaum, 2003, p. 217), where, from early 1930s to mid-1950s, an accumulated total of some 17–18 million prisoners were detained (Ellman, 2002, pp. 1160–1161, 1164), the majority of them being either victims of overt ‘political’ repression, or of the utterly repressive criminal justice system.Footnote 1 Given the lack of scholarly works addressing the arrangements by which forced labour was organised inside them, on the one side, and the outstanding comparative weight of distinct economic tasks among the set of functions they were due to perform, on the other, it is self-evident that specific investigations into the economics of forced labour in Soviet camps are a central prerequisite for finally explaining their raison d'être. Abram Bergson's approach to the study of Soviet resource allocation provides a useful model for organising such research. He focused on the system's directors' objective function which he used as a yardstick for analysing observable forms of economic conduct with regard to economic rationality (Bergson, 1964, p. 11). Indeed, if Bergson's concept of the planners' preferences proved constructive in assessing the entire Soviet planning system, its application to the economy of forced labour seems even more justified: While in the ‘normal’, civilian sector one must allow for a residual impact of consumers' preferences on the choices of the political leadership (ibid., p. 8), this factor can widely be ruled out with regard to the administration of forced labour. Accordingly, the investigation of the economics of the camp system could be organised with the help of the following questions: What was forced labour's intended function within the specific framework of the Soviet economic and political system? Which means and policies were implemented to put these plans and expectations into practice? What was the real outcome achieved? To find answers, we must examine the concrete actions by which the Soviet leadership and the administration of the camp system handled forced labour. If we ask who determined the usage of forced labour during the period of Stalinism, the decisive role of the dictator is the first answer that springs to mind. Indeed, Stalin personally approved the large-scale exploitation of forced labour which initiated the camp system. He repeatedly made concrete decisions on the application of forced labour in specific economic projects (Ertz, 2003, p. 132). Nevertheless, the bulk of administrative work relating to the camp system was done by specific institutions, above all, by the People's Commissariat (since 1946: Ministry) for Internal Affairs (hereafter: NKVD/MVD), including its embodied ‘Chief Administration of Corrective Labour Camps and Colonies,’ better known under the acronym ‘GULAG.’ Even if not in all periods the sole institution charged with administering the camp system (Ertz, 2004), the GULAG was the main agency that implemented government policy on forced labour. In doing so, it had, on the one hand, a certain latitude as to its design and shape. This included the possibility to influence decisions made by higher organs, such as the NKVD/MVD, the Council of People's Commissars/Ministers, or the Presidium of the Supreme Council. On the flipside, its scope of autonomy was limited by exogenous parameters, which included the total stock, the inflow, and, partly, the outflow of prisoners (Smirnov et al., 1998, pp. 40–42, 45; Khlevniuk, 2001, p. 118; 2003, pp. 48–49). In this research, our attention is mainly directed to the GULAG's behaviour. Given the magnitude of the general research agenda, this paper seeks to shed some light on the intended use of forced labour by addressing a very specific, though fundamental issue – the motivation of working prisoners through special incentives, called workday credits, which granted prisoners a reduction in sentence for high economic performance. This topic is closely related to the issue of the productivity of forced labour. Hence, analysing the policies implemented by the camp system's administration during different periods may provide conclusions about the Soviet leadership's preferences in this realm. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In the next section we examine the main features of the workday credit system, simultaneously summarising the main stages of its application and evolution over time. Against this background, the subsequent section evaluates the GULAG's moves from an economic point of view and tests several hypotheses about economic strategies pursued by the prison camp administration. The final section concludes and points out limitations and variations of the findings' explanatory force. A formal choice model, which serves to illustrate and to substantiate the analysis and evaluation of the camp system administrators' actions, is not included here due to space limitations. However, it is available online as an appendix to an earlier version of this articleFootnote 2.",5
47,2,Comparative Economic Studies,20 June 2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100105,Testimonials,June 2005,Marshall Goldman,Jeffrey Sachs,Martin Weitzman,Male,Male,Male,Male,"At a meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on November 18, 2003, the following Minute was placed upon the records. Abram Bergson was born in Baltimore on April 21, 1914, and died this past April 23 in Cambridge at the age of 89 years. Attending Johns Hopkins on a full scholarship, he was a hometown commuter who graduated at the young age of 19 years in 1933. That same year he entered the Harvard economics PhD programme. His formative years thus coincided with the onset of the Great Depression, a cataclysmic paralysis of world capitalism with enormous political and social consequences, which drew him to economics and inclined him towards a lifelong study of human welfare and alternative economic systems. As a 23-year-old graduate student in the Harvard economics department, Bergson wrote an extraordinarily influential paper on the foundations of social welfare. To comprehend its impact on economics, one needs to understand that behind every economist's notion that, say, free trade is generally a good idea, or that rent controls are generally a bad idea – and behind every cost–benefit analysis of medical care, or of public works, or of anything else – is a philosophy about how to make an overarching summary evaluation of social policies with mixed impacts on different people. The core issue is how to render an overall judgment of whether it is better or worse on balance to support a policy that invariably helps some people but hurts some others. What is needed desperately is a conceptual apparatus that has the potential to weigh and aggregate together the pleasures of different winners and the pains of different losers to yield some kind of a reasonably balanced ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer to basic policy-choice questions. Bergson's 1938 paper clarified for all time what, exactly, are the links and how they are connected in the chain of reasoning that lies behind all of applied welfare economics. In that article, Bergson defined the notion of a social welfare function and introduced a conceptual device that is now a part of every PhD economist's tool kit – usually without their knowing where it came from. The thought experiment he introduced and made famous was to see things through the eyes of an ideal social planner whose welfare is a function of the individual utilities of all the people in the society. This construct has been used ever since to clarify the welfare attained by an actual economic system like a market mechanism, or an actual economic policy like free trade, by comparing the outcome with the hypothetical welfare attainable by the imaginary omnipotent social planner. From that point forward, Bergson's career could essentially be described as the theory and practice of welfare economics, with the largest application by far being to the field that made him famous, the study of socialist economics, particularly the economy of the Soviet Union. In 1937, Bergson started learning Russian and made a lengthy research visit to Moscow. He spent most of the war years as head of the Russian desk at the Office of Strategic Services. In 1945, Columbia University called him to an economics chair. Abe returned to Harvard as full professor in 1956 and remained here for the rest of his life. It is difficult to exaggerate the influence of Abram Bergson on the area of Soviet economic studies. Put simply, he became the world's leading authority on the Soviet economy, a scholar who was consulted and cited far more than any other about the assessment and evaluation of Soviet economic performance. The seemingly blistering pace of Soviet industrialisation in the middle third of the 20th century, and its subsequent slowdown after that, were hot topics on the world stage of public and private opinions. A lot of ideology hung in the balance. To this minefield of claims and counter-claims, Bergson brought a great scholar's careful analysis of Soviet statistics and a balanced assessment of the overall performance of its economic system. Bergson essentially invented and applied a whole new methodology for evaluating non-market allocation systems – in this case the entire Soviet economy. First he calculated the true prices reflecting relative scarcities or relative tradeoffs that are implicit in such a planned system, but which do not necessarily coincide with the artificially posted prices that appear in its own internal accounting books. Then he would infer the welfare implications as if two market economies were being compared over time or across space. Essentially, he redid the Soviet economic accounts in Western format, as if they were being measured as standard national income aggregated at true scarcity prices, for which construct a secure welfare interpretation had already been established, by him as well as several other well-known economists. It was an extremely ambitious research programme, requiring the coordination of inputs from many different sources and scholars, along with a great range of skills from the chief coordinator. Abe participated enthusiastically in the multi-disciplinary Russian Research Center (now the Davis Center), serving as its Director for many years. A small army of students learned about socialist economics and the Soviet economy from Bergson. Among his students are many with notably successful careers in universities, governments, research institutes and businesses. As a scholar, Abe was modest – really, genuinely modest. He was the straightest straight arrow in the Harvard economics department, non-Machiavellian to the point of sometimes seeming naive. Bergson was convincing in his assessments of the Soviet economy mainly because of his intellectual authority, but also because he was ‘honest Abe’, who refused to have preconceptions, and who told it as he saw it, empirically, from the best reconstructed data he could honestly come up with. A first impression of Abe was that he was a very proper man. Coming to know him better, one saw that behind the somewhat formal front was a warm, kindly person – and this caring person was hard to forget. He formed deep, lasting friendships, perhaps the most famous being with his Harvard classmate Paul Samuelson. It would be remiss to end this brief Minute without noting the close relationship Abe had with his wife of 63 years, Rita, that sustained him over such a long and productive life. Respectfully submitted, Marshall I. GoldmanPaul A. Samuelson (MIT) Martin L. Weitzman, ChairAbram Bergson Memorial ServiceThe Memorial Church, Harvard UniversityNovember 24, 2003 After love of family, there may be no bond stronger than the love of one's teacher. That is how I, and I’m sure many here, feel about Abe Bergson. Abe was a pivotal figure in my life, in our lives: teacher, mentor, role model, counselor, friend. I am here to express my gratitude. Abe Bergson, we all know, personified scholarship, and even more, wisdom – that ineffable quality which combines learning, integrity, commitment, and ethical engagement. This much is clear to all. What I want to share with you is the dazzling magic for me, as a 20-year-old junior at Harvard College, of gaining entry to Abe's celestial orbit. I had come to Harvard College filled with questions about the nature of society, fueled in part by the Vietnam War, a high-school trip to Russia, a summer visit to an East German pen-pal, and a freshman-week reading assignment of Schumpeter's Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy. As you can imagine, my head was spinning. I had come, indeed, with a question, inchoate, poorly formed, and yet insistent. How should a society best order its affairs? It is the question I’ve been grappling with, in my own imperfect ways, for more than three decades. Abe Bergson was the intellectual giant and gentle teacher who gave me the great gifts of guidance and confidence to pursue this search. He was, of course, already a legend when I first met him. EC 10 had taught me of the Bergson Social Welfare Function. My budding concerns about socialism and capitalism pointed always to Bergson's books and articles. So it was with a dizzying excitement and anticipation that I knocked on his door in my junior year to see if he would lead me through a directed reading class on comparative economic systems. Thus began my weekly meetings with Abe, a thrilling association that would continue for the next quarter century. My reading sessions with Abe were transformative, electric. He introduced me in a breath-taking, almost personal way, to von Mises, and Lange, and Hayek, and Lerner, and Dobb, and Scitovsky, and of course, to Samuelson. I read extensively; we discussed; and I learned about a way of seeing the world: with rigour, and knowledge, and breadth, and integrity, and yes, with Bergsonian wit and a droll, almost playful regard for the groping, imperfect missteps of all scholars, even the greatest, and even himself. We discussed Cambridge's G. E. Moore, an over-rated pedant in Abe's view. We read A. J. Ayer and the logical positivists. We discussed the then newly published Theory of Justice of John Rawls. Abe was a scintillating thinker, and, crucially, an independent thinker. He was methodical and purposeful. He was not to be swept by fads. As just one example, he regarded John Rawls’ mini-max principle as rather arbitrary, just one of the many plausible versions of his more general social welfare function. But equally importantly for me, he was kind, supportive, encouraging, and utterly generous of his precious time and wisdom. He helped instill values as well as knowledge; encouragement as well as discipline in thought. And subtly, but surely, he helped to convince me, perhaps more than anyone else at that critical juncture in my life, that I might usefully and productively devote my own career to the quest that Abe was on: to develop and use the tools of economics to improve the human condition. At the end of the reading course, I received a junior-year honour from Harvard College, the Detur Book Prize, which entitled me to receive any book of my choice. Naturally I selected Abe's Essays in Normative Economics, and that volume inscribed by Abe remains among my most treasured possessions. Abe was my teacher for years to come. He arranged an invitation for me to join him for a day in Wroclaw, Poland in 1976, the summer after my Harvard College graduation. This was indeed, the first professional conference that I attended. As we walked through Wroclaw, and as Abe pointed out to me the shoddy socialist maintenance of the conference site, I saw Abe as a true explorer: eyes open, taking in the evidence of socialist Poland, linking theory and practice. This experience illustrated in a small, but powerful, and absolutely captivating way that good economics exists not only in the theorems, in the journals, in the conference halls, but also, indeed as importantly, in the assimilation of evidence and experience from life itself. For Abe, as for all great economists, there was no divide between economics and the ‘real world,’ just the real world. From being mentor, Abe also became colleague and friend and invaluable counsellor. One of the pivotal symbolic moments of our relationship came as I was honoured to join the Harvard Economics Department faculty in 1980. Suddenly, and with no small trepidation in my voice, ‘Professor Bergson’ one day became ‘Abe’. We were now colleagues, though he always remained my teacher. For 20 years more, Abe and I discussed politics, economics, history, and of course the collapse of communism and the transition to markets in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He analysed, wrote, and read voluminously, questioned intensively, and advised sagely. Abe cut through cant, ideology, and shortcuts. His wisdom was forever a guide, illumination, and inspiration. When it came time for me to add my voice to the nominations for the Nobel Prize in Economics, naturally I nominated Abe. This was a prize he richly deserved but did not receive. Paul Samuelson, who of course could have won half a dozen times, once noted that Abe Bergson deserved not just one, but at least two Nobel Prizes: for his great work in welfare economics and for his other full career as dean of scholars of the Soviet economy. What was additionally remarkable about Abe was that these two life projects were seamlessly intertwined: theoretical and practical; normative and positive; conceptual and empirical. Abe was after holistic truths and deep understanding. Usual boundaries could not apply. The other boundary that Abe crossed, in my great good fortune, was the boundary of teacher and friend. From my junior year in college onward, I was a guest of the incomparable Bergson family – taken under the wing not only by Abe but also by the ever-incomparable Rita, and befriended by their three lovely daughters. That personal affection extended to my wife Sonia, my parents, and Sonia's parents. Abe and Rita were always on hand to celebrate our life milestones as well: our wedding and the naming and bar mitzvahs of our children. Abe wrote extensively about the role of the economist as advisor to the larger community. He was, of course, most concerned about the role of the welfare economist, the wielder of a Bergson Social Welfare Function. Abe's ideal type advisor was to be wise, judicious, and a small ‘d’ democrat, helping a community to see how best to forward its economic interests according to what Abe called its ‘prevailing values’. In one essay, Abe wrote that the welfare economist might ‘hope that the world would be a better place to live in with his counsel than without it.’ Abe fulfilled his hope. He made our world a better place, and markedly so. He enriched our lives. We say a profound thank you to Abe Bergson for showing us the wisdom and civility and kindness that is possible, and that he magnificently achieved. We also extend our love, gratitude, and deep affection to Rita, Judith, Mimi, and Lucy.",2

I feel humbled, and more importantly, pressured to not end this tradition by boring everyone out of their minds. The rare opportunity to offer you my view on how comparative economics should develop and be pursued must be tempered by the fear leaving this new tradition stillborn. I recognise that such an address from any of my distinguished predecessors would have been a perfect way to launch this tradition; unfortunately, however, I am the test case. Rather than present a set of methodological dicta, I want to explore a fundamental problem of transition economics, peering into the black box of institutions. To a large extent, what we do as transition economists, is study how institutional arrangements deflect economic performance from the trajectories that economic fundamentals would otherwise direct. If development economists and economic historians are tasked with explaining why economies grow rich, in comparative economics, we are most focused on why economies fail to do so. The problem is not to explain economic collapse;Footnote 1 I suspect that most of us would argue that even the demise of central planning was not the result of economic collapse but of political pressures that accompanied deteriorating economic performance.Footnote 2 The task is thus to explain why opportunities for better performance are not exploited. The important skill developed by comparative economists is understanding economic behaviour in distorted economies. There are two distinct, yet compatible, approaches that have been pursued. Economic Pathology focuses on the distortions that prevent economies from performing at optimal levels.Footnote 3 The command economy, for example, suffered from distortions in pricing, lack of property rights, soft-budget constraints, etc. We studied the consequences of this, and how it impacts on economic behaviour and performance.Footnote 4 Comparative morphology on the other hand, studies the logic of the system and how it evolves. Thus, to continue with the command economy, comparative morphology asks why this system was so difficult to reform, by focusing on the factors that held the system together. In this way, it is possible to understand the forces that drive the evolution of the system. I hope to show why this is important by the end of this talk. What I want to suggest is that by studying failed paths we can peek closer into the institutional black box. Studying growth failures is at least as valuable as growth miracles. With miracles, the problem is to assess the relative importance of many fortuitous events. Failures may teach more.Footnote 5 The Tolstoy axiom about marriage is apropos – ‘Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way’. At least for economists, there appears to be one path to successful economic development. Failure, however, is characterised by great diversity. Despite the diversity in which failure (or postponed success) appears to be displayed, there may be some lessons that can be learned. In this essay, I will focus on the role of dysfunctional institutions, and in particular, how they function in times of great upheaval. I will argue that policies that appear to be perverse, when examined in isolation, display a certain logic when studied in terms of the institutional environment. When properly understood, the persistence of bad policies becomes more comprehensible.Footnote 6",4

What is the reason for the phenomenal rate of growth: the fast increase in input or the improvement of the productivity? It is important to answer this question, because growth due to increased input use is bounded and temporal, while growth due to by the technical progress is unbounded and sustainable. This paper aims to clarify quantitatively the source of the economic growth and the regional pattern of growth in China during the post-reform periods by using accounting analysis, to probe into the role of the total factor productivity (TFP) in both national and regional economic growth, and to identify the determinants of TFP in Chinese economy. There are many debates on the TFP of China in recent years. However, those studies have mainly used either national-level data (Collins and Bosworth, 1996; Hu and Khan, 1997; Young, 2000; Chow and Lin, 2002, etc) or sectoral-level data (Chen et al., 1988; Jefferson and Rawski, 1994; Huang and Ron, 1997; Kong et al., 1999; Albert, 2001 etc.). Employing a frontier production function approach, Wu (1995) compared productivity and efficiency performance among the regions as well as across sectors. Ezaki and Sun (1999) made an attempt to explain the relation between the growth of TFP and income inequality. But regression results based on cross-section data need to be re-verified. Our research has the following features: firstly, we calculate the growth rate of TFP by employing growth accounting methods not only on the national level but also on every province, not only on the whole sample period (1981–2000) but also for sub-periods (the 6th Five-Year Plan (1981–1985), the 7th Five-Year Plan (1986–1990), the 8th Five-Year Plan (1991–1995), and the 9th Five-Year Plan (1996–2000)). Secondly, we calculate and analyse the growth pattern for three regions and empirically find that there exist different growth patterns of TFP for every group. We also obtain some other interesting results. For example, three municipalities, namely Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin, have a relatively lower growth rate of TFP. Finally, we explore some common determinants of TFP growth, using panel data. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. The following section briefly gives an introduction of the methodologies and models. The data construction used in growth accounting model is explained in the subsequent section. The penultimate section gives ante analysis of the empirical results. The last section draws some conclusions.",13

Evidence from Quality of their Exports,September 2005,Yener Kandogan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The literature before the collapse of socialism provides numerous accounts for the technological backwardness in Eastern Europe: van Brabant (1988) and Bogomolov (1987) point out that Eastern European manufactured goods lacked sufficient quality and technical sophistication to be marketable in Western markets. Treml (1981) identifies a similar situation in the Soviet manufactured goods and machinery. The US-imposed embargo on exports of strategic and high technology goods to communist economies in 1947 can be counted as one of the important causes for this situation (van Brabant, 1980). However, the trade block formed in response among socialist countries in 1949, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), where there were no incentives for competition or innovation, is considered by many as the primary reason for the low-quality of Eastern European products. After the fall of socialism, these countries have undergone a series of reforms to restructure their production technologies. Most noteworthy reform towards this goal is the extensive efforts to liberalise their international trade. Beside the unilateral removal of quantitative trade barriers, almost immediately after the collapse of CMEA in 1991, 10 Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC) signed the Europe Agreements with the European Union (EU). Five out of 12 Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) formed a customs union in 1994.Footnote 1 Initially, the opinion in Europe was that this rapid trade liberalisation would not succeed. They would not be able to export their products to market economies because their products were of such poor quality to be marketable internationally. Furthermore, their production technology was largely resource-intensive due to subsidised resource imports from Russia, which made their capital obsolete after the breakup of CMEA. They needed to restructure their production technology. However, contrary to expectations, there has been a considerable reorientation of exports towards the EU, especially in CEEC, away from the former partners in CMEA. The increase in trade with market economies is a good sign, but it is not conclusive about the extent of restructuring experienced in transition countries. The important question is the source of the increase in trade with these non-traditional partners. The increase could be a result of intensive margin, where there is quality and thus price increase in the products, or extensive margin, where a larger quantity of a larger set of goods is exported (Hummels and Klenow, 2002). The answer to this question will help determine the extent of restructuring achieved, and thus the success of transitional reforms. At this point, a distinction should be made between restructuring and specialisation. Within the context of transition countries, restructuring implies improving product quality by upgrading the production technologies. Production specialisation changes the quantity of exports in response to liberalisation. As trade barriers are removed, the composition of exports changes to reflect comparative advantages. Depending on the relative factor endowments, this leads to specialisation in certain industries. Even if a country specialises in low-skilled labour or resource-intensive industries, it could still experience restructuring. This can be done by gradually improving the production technology and thus the quality of the products in that industry. Previous work on this area concentrated primarily on the most advanced countries in CEEC, and covered the time period of 1989–1994. In the earliest analysis, Drabek and Smith (1995) found that the unit values of EU imports from CEEC have fallen. Analysing 1989–1992, Brenton and Gros (1997) found little evidence for product upgrading. Although Landesmann and Burgstaller (1998) argued that CEEC exports are concentrated on lower quality products, they indicated that the quality gap between the EU, and Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic narrowed during 1989–1994, and the gap with Bulgaria and Romania widened. This paper analyses the changes in the quality of exports from all 22 transition countries, interprets the findings to determine the extent of restructuring, and discusses the potential factors behind it. The focus is only on the manufacturing exports (SITC 5–8) at product level during 1992–1999, which excludes early years of transition with turbulent macroeconomic problems.Footnote 2 The analysis is restricted to exports to market economies only. The reasons are numerous: Most importantly, restructuring of production technologies is needed to be able to export especially to market economies. Exports to formerly socialist partners could still be under the influence of CMEA arrangements in practice, despite its formal abolishment.Footnote 3 Lastly, developed or developing, market economies are becoming increasingly important partners for transition countries.Footnote 4 Although this analysis should not be considered as a formal empirical test of Grossman and Helpman (1991), the approach of this paper is influenced by their quality ladders concept in economic growth. Accordingly, the middle income South competes with the industrialised North by imitating their innovations. In the South, progress is achieved by importing product designs and production methods of the North. If the factor endowment conditions permit, the South can earn rents due to lower manufacturing costs. In the wake of loss of profit potential, the North designs the next generation higher quality product and methods. Eventually, this product is imitated in the South, too. Overall, a gradual increase in quality is observed for the products manufactured in the South. Transition countries very nicely represent the South in this theory: High levels of FDI provide a channel for importing product designs and methods; Abundance of human capital, and its low cost make imitation feasible and profitable, respectively. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the next section, changes in factor intensity of exports are analysed to get an idea about changes in the quality of their products. CEEC and CIS countries are analysed separately for comparison. The section following the next briefly discusses the limitations of analysing factor intensity of exports in this context, and some issues related to the use of unit values to represent quality. In this section, changes in quality and their implications on economic restructuring are discussed in detail. Then, changes in aggregate unit values, number of products under quality improvement are analysed. Lastly, based on changes observed in unit values and trade balance, products are categorised into those with structural problems, with deficit in price competition, as well as those under successful price or quality competition. The penultimate section interprets of the results by relating them to the scope of trade liberalisation agreements, the FDI inflows, and the abundance and the cost of factor endowments such as human capital.",4
47,3,Comparative Economic Studies,22 August 2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100059,The Transition between the Old and New Traditional Economies in India,September 2005,J Barkley Rosser Jr,Marina V Rosser,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Rosser and Rosser (1996, 1998, 1999) introduce the concept of the New Traditional Economy to the discussion and analysis of economic systems. This idea derives from the trichotomisation between tradition, market, and command made by Karl Polanyi (1944). For Polanyi and his followers the traditional economy is embedded within a broader socio-cultural framework.Footnote 1 They see the traditional economy associated with backward technology and pre-modern societies, with the rise of the market economy leading to a ‘disembedding’ of the economy from its socio-cultural framework to come to dominate that framework rather than the other way around. This was the Old Traditional Economy. In the New Traditional Economy there is an effort to re-embed a modern or modernising economy within a traditional socio-cultural framework, usually associated with a religion, but to do so while maintaining or adopting modern technology. The most well-known example is that of the Islamic economies such as Iran where a reconstructed view of Islamic economics has been pursued that was developed initially in Pakistan (Maududi, 1975 [1947]) as part of the anti-colonialist struggle. Eventually this became part of the search for an independent identity separate from the competing ideologies of capitalism and socialism during the Cold War.Footnote 2 But it is also seen as emerging in other socio-cultural frameworks as well. India presents a special case with respect to this discussion. With the possible exception of much of rural, sub-Saharan Africa, it remains arguably the site of the most entrenched and extensive example of an actually existing Old Traditional Economy in the jajmani system associated with the Hindu caste system in rural India. This system persists despite markets being established in rural India for a long time and a period of emphasis on socialist ownership of industry and indicative central planning since India's independence in 1947 that is still largely in place and with the caste system being formally outlawed. Although rejecting elements of the system, Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi (‘Father of Indian independence’) defended the ideal of the rural Indian village economy with a pre-industrial technology, arguably an Old Traditionalist ideology. However, the reality is that increasingly the forces of modernisation are gradually breaking down the isolation of India's rural villages and integrating them into the broader market economy of India with its continuing elements of socialist central planning. Thus, a consciously constructed ideology of Hindu economics has appeared that accepts modern technology more than Gandhi did and that seeks integration in the modern world economy even while attempting to re-embed the economy within the Hindu socio-cultural system, perhaps expressed earliest and most clearly in the work of Deendayal Upadhyaya (1965). Currently associated with the recently ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), this ideological movement can be described as New Traditionalist. Thus India, more sharply than other nations with New Traditionalist movements, has seen a transition from Old to New Traditionalism take place within a fairly short time period. The nature of this transition, both in economic thought and in its relation to the actual state of the Indian economy, is the subject of this paper. Following this introduction, the second section reviews the comparison between the Old and New Traditionalist perspectives. The third examines this comparison in relation to the views of Gandhi and Upadhyaya in particular. The fourth considers the historical development of the Indian economic system and its prospects in light of this discussion. A concluding section follows.",4

47,4,Comparative Economic Studies,12 December 2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100128,Transition: Intended and Unintended Processes,December 2005,Michael Ellman,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A remarkable feature of actually existing transition was the combination of intended and unintended processes. Transition was intended (by the international financial institutionsFootnote 1) to comprise the Holy TrinityFootnote 2 of stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation. Stabilisation referred to the need to reduce inflation, both open and suppressed, create a stable currency, and establish balance of payments equilibrium. To achieve these goals, a standard package of fiscal and monetary (sometimes supported by exchange rate and incomes policy) measures was recommended, together with price liberalisation so as to eliminate suppressed inflation. Experience has shown that, despite the skepticism of numerous critics, such packages if persisted in are successful in reducing disequilibrium. Furthermore, experience has also shown that successful early stabilisation was positive for economic growth (Beyer, 2001), with the longest recessions in countries that did not give precedence to stabilisation . However, it should be noted that:
 The short-term political costs may be such as to make it impossible to persist in the implementation of such a package (as in Yugoslavia in 1990 where the adoption of such a package was one of the factors leading to the breakup of the country). The time taken for the package to work may be far longer than anticipated (in Poland a stabilisation package was implemented at the beginning of 1990, but it was only 9 years later, in 1999, that inflation finally fell below 10% p.a.). It may contribute to a sharp decline in output and welfare (as in Russia after the unsuccessful attempt at shock therapy by Finance Minister, and subsequently acting Prime Minister, Gaidar at the beginning of 1992). As a result, 5 years after transition began, Kornai (1994) – writing about relatively stable Hungary where inflation was then only about 20% p.a. – argued that growth must be the main economic objective and stability should be considered not as an equally important objective but as a constraint to be borne in mind when trying to achieve growth. One of the main aims, reducing inflation to a single figure annual rate, is not actually a necessary condition for economic growth in post-socialist countries (as the experience first of Poland and then of Russia showed). Liberalisation meant the liberalising of prices, by removing subsidies and price controls (so that prices could reflect supply and demand and not cause shortages and queues), of internal trade (so that traders could meet market demand) and of external trade (to enable the country concerned to take full advantage of the international division of labour). Liberalising prices was essential to the emergence of a market economy. However, sudden liberalisation under disequilibrium conditions gave rise to ‘corrective inflation’ (ie the immediate price rises necessary to bring supply and demand into equilibrium) and, where fiscal policy remained destabilising, it gave rise to continued inflation (as in the CIS countries). Liberalising internal trade made more goods available and generated extra income, but was also a bonanza for protection racketeers, sellers of fake goods, and tax evaders. Liberalising international trade was a major factor in overcoming the former shortages and queues, but frequently caused serious production declines by introducing international competition in previously protected markets and also facilitated capital flight (eg by frauds such as double invoicing). Privatisation was thought to be crucial for both political and economic reasons. Politically it created powerful interest groups with a stake in transition and strongly opposed to a restoration of the old system (which would have led to the loss of their newly acquired property). In addition, it secured support and money from the West. Economically, it was thought that only privately owned enterprises could operate successfully in a market economy. Experience has shown that:
 At any rate in central Europe, especially in Poland, economic growth has come mainly not from newly privatised formerly state-owned enterprises, but from de novo enterprises, that is newly created enterprises (which often use assets acquired from (formerly) state-owned enterprises).Footnote 3 As Dabrowski et al. (2001, p. 318) observe, ‘the early conventional view probably over-estimated the positive impact on performance of fast privatisation of SOEs’. The importance of de novo enterprises is now generally recognised (Kolodko and Nuti, 1997; Dabrowski et al., 2001).Footnote 4 The quick privatisation of the entire national economy often degenerates into large-scale looting (Goldman, 2003). Although this is quick, and hopefully Coase-efficient, it undermines political support for the resulting social system by redistributing wealth to a small elite. This may reduce domestic investment and increase capital flight. Considering the Russian experience through the prism of new institutional economics, Williamson (2000, pp. 608–610) concluded that ‘privatising needs to go beyond the ex ante award stage to include an examination of possible ex post implementation problems and, in consideration of the differential hazards, to proceed selectively’. Complete privatisation is not a necessary condition for economic growth. For example, in Poland a large part of the economy remained state-owned years after economic growth resumed. The design of privatisation programmes has been more important for enterprise performance than initially expected. It is now widely accepted that (Dabrowski et al., 2001, p. 307) the ‘method of privatisation matters’. Some ownership reforms, such as voucher privatisation in the Czech Republic, introduced principal–agent problems by diluting ownership or by failing to result in control over management and incentives to raise efficiency and profitability. They often contributed to the decapitalisation of industry (Ellerman, 1998). Similarly, Bonin et al. (2004) found that voucher privatisation of banks did not lead to any increase in efficiency, whereas attracting a strategic foreign investor did lead to higher profit efficiency. Furthermore (Stiglitz, 1999, 2001, p. 132), when priority is given to speed, privatisation may actually undermine the creation of a healthy market economy by stimulating corruption, regulatory capture and capital flight. Giving priority to speed may also deprive the state budget of substantial potential revenues. The environment (political, institutional, cultural and geographic) in which privatisation takes place has an important impact on its effectiveness. Summing up numerous empirical studies, Estrin (2002, p. 101) has argued that, ‘while privatisation seems to have improved company performance in almost all developed and middle income countries, the record is less convincing in transition countries and, notably, in the former Soviet Union’. It was initially assumed that firms with strong outside owners (other firms, investment banks, individuals) would be the most efficient. However, Uvalic (2003, pp. 182–183) has argued that, ‘empirical evidence to date has been mixed, and in many cases has not supported such predictions. On the one hand, the experience from a number of CEE countries where privatisation led to substantial insider ownership has shown that firms controlled by employed workers and managers have actually been quite efficient… Some of the most recent survey evidence on corporate governance of countries of the FSU – including Belarus, Russia and Ukraine – indicates that whereas outsider ownership never leads to greater restructuring, dominant ownership by insiders sometimes does… Managerial and employee ownership does not appear to have had a significant adverse effect on restructuring'. Similarly, in the Russian oil industry, the initial experience was that (Moser and Oppenheimer, 2001, p. 322), ‘Contrary to the argument of many analysts and economists that outsider management would be a crucial advance for the industry, the existing insider managers or established oil men of LUKoil and Surgut Holding proved better and more responsible than the new banker entrants’. In countries with large extractive sectors (especially oil and natural gas), where favourable world market prices can generate large rent streams, privatisation of these extractive sectors can significantly reduce state revenue and make a major contribution to corruption, bad governance and capital flight. In the light of experience, already in 1996 a well known early advocate of rapid privatisation recommended that in Russia the previous year's privatisation of raw materials companies should be reversed and the natural gas monopoly renationalised (Sachs, 1996).",6
47,4,Comparative Economic Studies,12 December 2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100062,Unemployment Benefit Systems in Central and Eastern Europe: A Review of the 1990s,December 2005,Milan Vodopivec,Andreas Wörgötter,Dhushyanth Raju,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the most conspicuous consequences of the transition of former socialist economies has been the emergence of large-scale, open unemployment – a phenomenon unheard of before the transition. These economies have thus been confronted with the difficult task of providing income protection to the unemployed while avoiding undue fiscal costs and minimising the work disincentives created by such protection. Faced with the prospect of high unemployment, many transition economies introduced traditional, OECD-style unemployment insurance systems. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate these systems by examining their income protection as well as efficiency effects. To address income protection, we analyse the coverage, size, and targeting of unemployment benefit systems. We also investigate the distributional aspects of unemployment benefit systems by identifying which groups of workers benefited most, and how these systems changed the pre-transfer distribution of income. With respect to efficiency effects, we study how unemployment benefits influenced work disincentives, in particular, whether more generous replacement rates and longer benefit durations affected the length of unemployment spells. We also examine whether the introduction of unemployment benefit systems helped to speed up enterprise restructuring. (We found no study that examined the possible positive effects of unemployment benefit systems – for example, better job matching as reflected by increased reemployment earnings.) To provide a comprehensive review of unemployment benefit systems, the paper employs two methodological approaches. First, the analysis of income protection effects is based on our own empirical analysis using household survey data for seven transition countries. Second, the analysis of efficiency effects is based on the review of a large body of literature about the performance of unemployment benefit systems in transition economies during the 1990s. The paper thus presents our original work on income protection effects, as well as extends the review of unemployment benefit systems in transition countries of Scarpetta and Reutersward (1994) which looked at these systems in the early period of the transition. Other reviews of labour markets in transition countries address unemployment benefit systems only selectively, to the extent it touches on other subjects (such as Riboud et al, 2001; Boeri and Terrell, 2002; Feldmann, 2004), or are much narrower in scope (for example, Bardasi et al. (2001) focus on the targeting of benefits and the existence of job search among the recipients). In this study, we would like to shed light, among other things, on the question of the suitability of traditional unemployment insurance systems for transition economies, particularly for those countries with poor administrative capacities and low incomes per capita. This concern is tied to distributional issues: unemployment insurance benefits may be regressive, that is, mostly paid to better-off workers. Moreover, because of poor administrative capacity in these countries, there may be significant ‘leakage’ of these benefits. Moreover, unemployment benefits may adversely affect efficiency – they may create work disincentives and, by increasing the bargaining power of workers, contribute to higher equilibrium unemployment and increased employment in the informal sector. The paper is organised as follows. We first describe the formal unemployment benefit systems introduced by transition countries, as well as discuss key issues arising in their implementation. We focus on Central and East European as well as Baltic countries, which constitute a relatively homogeneous group. Subsequently, in the core section, we then evaluate these systems by examining their income protection effects (including effects on the redistribution of income), as well as efficiency effects. We conclude with a summary of main findings and a discussion of emerging policy issues.",25

This phenomenon of higher intensity of labour use in individual farms is also observed for transition countries. Previous survey data, as presented in Table 1, have shown that individual (family) farms are characterised by a substantially higher ‘labour intensity’ than corporate farms, that is, large farm enterprises created from reorganising collective and state farms in the process of economic reforms (Lerman, 1998). This is surprising in the transition context, because large corporate farms – certainly those in the former Soviet Union – are generally believed to have inherited a substantial contingent of surplus labour, which needs to be channeled out of agriculture in the course of transition with the objective of increasing sectoral productivity and efficiency. Yet, the creation of individual farms – one of the modes for reorganisation of former collectives in transition countries – would seem to increase rather than decrease the agricultural labour force. Earlier work has indeed shown that agricultural employment increased significantly during transition in countries such as Albania, Armenia, Georgia, and Romania, where agricultural land was distributed to the rural population for individual farming (Lerman, 1998, 2000). On the other hand, Dries and Swinnen (2002) find greater exits of labour from Polish agriculture in regions with fewer individual farms (ie, North-Western Poland), although to start with these regions employed less labour per unit of land than regions with higher incidence of individual farms. Thus, instead of channeling labour out of agriculture, the breakup of collective farms into individual units acts as a labour sink that effectively stores labour in agriculture. This effect may be of concern to policy makers because additional labour leads to further deterioration of agricultural labour productivity, at least in the short run. We, on the other hand, argue that this effect has an important social impact in transition countries, where inadequate employment opportunities outside the farm sector may lead to serious social and political difficulties in case of massive exit of labour from agriculture. This paper examines how individualisation of agriculture affects labour intensity and efficiency of agricultural production. We test two hypotheses: that individual farms are characterised by higher labour intensity than corporate farms, and that despite higher labour intensity individual farms achieve productivity levels that are not lower compared with corporate farms. The analysis is based on a cross-sectional comparison of Polish and Russian provinces in 1997–99. It is perhaps appropriate to stress that, in our conceptual approach, the difference between individual and corporate farms is not one of size. Although individual farms on average are smaller than corporate farms, it is the difference in incentives to owners and labour between the two forms of farm organisation that counts in the present context (see Allen and Lueck (2002) for a discussion of the differences in incentives for individual and corporate farms). We use Poland and Russia as examples of two transition countries whose agricultural sectors have widely different institutional characteristics (see the section on Sectoral background). It is therefore particularly intriguing that the analysis for both these countries produces strikingly similar results. The study intentionally uses data from the second half of the 1990s, before issues of accession to the European Union became acutely relevant for Poland. Moreover, it is not our intention to give specific policy advice regarding the Polish farm structure in the wake of accession: for a full discussion of these topics the reader is referred to World Bank (2001) (see also Csaki and Lerman, 2002). Our purpose is to contribute to the ongoing intense debate in transition countries concerning the relative merits and demerits of individual versus corporate farms. The paper starts with a short overview of theoretical considerations concerning labour in agriculture. After describing the data used for the analyses, it proceeds to give relevant background information about Poland and Russia. This is followed by an examination of empirical evidence regarding higher labour intensity of individual agriculture. We then present results of a productivity analysis, which has been carried out in both the production function paradigm and the technical efficiency paradigm. In the concluding section, the results are related to social implications, which ultimately brings us to formulate some policy conclusions for transition agriculture.",15

Given the high unemployment rates among the Roma, perhaps the title should be ‘Opportunities for Roma to Avoid Unemployment’. The distinction between ‘increasing employment opportunities’ and ‘avoiding an increase in unemployment’ is not just a semantic one. The positive connotation of the first phrase unfortunately does not correspond to the reality Roma are facing. The development challenges for Roma communities are not so much about ‘improving their welfare’ but rather ‘avoiding a decline in their employment status’. According to official statistics, Roma unemployment often reaches 95–100 per cent. These figures do not, however, record involvement in the informal sector, which is not often considered to be employment. Surveys were conducted in part to gain an accurate quantitative picture of the levels of real unemployment among the Roma.Footnote 1 The survey from 2002 was the first attempt to carry out an integrated household survey to clearly distinguish between ‘wage employment’ and ‘income generation activities’, which include work in the informal sector. The ‘Vulnerable Groups Survey’ from 2004 was a follow-up of the former elaborating in-depth methodological aspects of vulnerability research (sampling, appropriate sets of indicators, fieldwork) targeting marginalised populations like the Roma. The survey in 2004 employed a format similar to that of an integrated household survey and included members of the majority community living close to the Roma so that comparisons could be made between Roma populations and non-Roma populations living in close proximity.Footnote 2 This article deals with various issues of Roma unemployment, such as unemployment rates, employability, ethnic discrimination and its relationship to the low competitiveness of the Roma labour force. The paper also looks at traditional skills as a source of employment opportunities for the Roma. The last section deals with the role of different actors (individuals, businesses, the state) in increasing employment opportunities and thus reducing poverty.",27

Significant increases in employment came from the bottom-up growth of micro and small companies. Since microbusinesses are mostly dependent on microlending, access to microloans is therefore important in reducing structural unemployment (Forster et al., 2003). Not all unemployed, however, benefitted from the higher growth that came later. High rates of poverty and insufficient employability left vulnerable layers of the population including Roma heavily dependent on often-inadequate social welfare programmes and transfer payments. In this situation vulnerable groups often survive by engaging in informal small-scale production, farming, and trade. These forms of self-employment help to stabilise household consumption and maintain supplies of food in periods of crisis, but the lack of access to affordable financial services – such as microcredits, savings, microinsurance, and financial leasing – hinders the ability of the poor to pursue these endeavours and overcome poverty. Typically, the poor have no access to formal lending institutions due to the high costs in terms of time, money, bureaucratic procedures, and collateral requirements. If the poor want to obtain capital they are forced to rely on informal moneylenders who charge extremely high interest rates and are often linked to organised crime. Because of the lack of access to credit from formal credit institutions and the prohibitive interest rates of informal moneylenders, the relatively new microlending industry – which is taking root in Bangladesh, Brazil and other countries – would seem to be an appealing option for the Roma.Footnote 1 The reality for vulnerable groups, however, has been less promising. Many countries in the region have microfinance programmes but, with few exceptions, they have failed to reach the most vulnerable layers of the population. Seen from a commercial bank's perspective, microfinance and microlending in particular are not appealing for several reasons. First, small loans are more expensive to administer and thus offer lower returns. Administering a loan of a few thousand dollars is not much cheaper than a loan of few millions, but the return is not comparable. Second, vulnerable groups, especially the poor, have difficulties in providing collateral for the loan and thus fall into the ‘high-risk’ category. Third, small entrepreneurs usually do not follow strict accounting procedures, making it difficult for bankers to assess their creditworthiness. Fourth, most micro and small entrepreneurs and particularly the poor, lack experience and knowledge of business planning, writing business plans etc. As a result both sides, banks and microentrepreneurs, have rational reasons to avoid each other. These are the reasons why microlending – regardless of the characteristics and the vulnerability criteria of the respective group – remains largely out of the scope of banks, which prefer upstream clients and are sometimes accused of ‘skimming’ (Christen and Rhyne, 1999). In fact, there is a gap between the needs of microbusinesses (including businesses that are or could be run by people from vulnerable groups) and those of ‘traditional’ bank clients. There are numerous banks serving more established entrepreneurs, while there is a sizable microcredit demand (from vulnerable groups) that stays largely unsatisfied (World Bank, 2004). In fact, formal banking and microfinancing are two completely different segments of the banking sector as they do not compete for the same cluster of clients. Vulnerable groups do use credit, however. To shed light on what opportunities exist for the microfinance industry, and what difficulties the Roma have in obtaining credit, UNDP included a section on access to capital in a major survey of vulnerable groups in Southeastern Europe.",4

Greg's approach was and is ‘fundamentalist’; he looks to the essential nature, the internal logic of the economic system, to its defining characteristics and fundamental core, in order to understand how and why it functions as it does. In doing so, he has developed fundamental insights into the strengths and weaknesses, the problems and prospects of the Soviet, indeed ‘Soviet-type’, economic system. From the beginning, his work has highlighted factors that, while not at the focus of Sovietological interest at the time, proved critical to the growing problems and eventual crisis that brought about the demise of the system. These derived from an intuitive feel for, and a truly profound understanding of, the essence of the Soviet economic system, which has informed and inspired the work of many in the succeeding generations of ‘Sovietological’ economists, myself included. In focussing on ‘fundamentals’, Greg Grossman began his career studying the heart, the engine, of the Soviet system – the industrial core of the economy. Here, at the centre of the priorities of the system's ‘directors’, the nature and the essence of the economic system was most clearly revealed, and its strengths and weaknesses most clearly displayed. These were distilled into his analysis of the ideal type, the ‘command economy’ (Grossman, 1963), and its approximate implementation in the Soviet Union. Driven by the urgency of encirclement, backwardness and ‘historical necessity’, and broadly informed by a socialistic, messianic, antimarket ideology, the Soviet leadership struggled to build a powerful, modern industrial economy on a profoundly backward base through the extraordinary efforts and sacrifices of the unenlightened masses led by a dedicated, committed and fully ‘enlightened’ elite.Footnote 1 This could be accomplished only through all-encompassing social control, brooking no questioning or opposition. It, however, placed an overwhelming burden on the elite and their agents, and cracks had to appear in the system of command and control. Even at the highest priority industrial core of the system, not all could be commanded and controlled properly, and so alternative, illegitimate activities and mechanisms appeared – a ‘second economy’ filling in and supplementing the command economy in ways both supportive of its essential functioning and stability and subversive of its ultimate viability. And running through this analysis, krasnoi nit’yu, lies Grossman's analysis of the anomalous role of money in the command economy, both unavoidable and subversive, facilitating and undermining, and feeding that cancer of central planning and command implementation – the ‘second/shadow economy’. Thus at its very core, the Soviet economic system was built on a fundamental contradiction. Its spirit derived from the command principle, the need for those who ‘truly know’ to have absolute discretion and control to make sure that what is needed, what is ‘right’, is done as it should be. But this spirit inevitably struggled with a recalcitrant body of intractable interconnectedness and imperfect human material whose ‘imperfections’ surfaced in a secondary ‘shadow economy’ symbiotically imbedded into the first, official, ‘command economy.’ As Greg Grossman noted at the beginning of his analysis in ‘The structure and organization of the Soviet economy’ (1962), ‘Economic systems are best known by the institutions they keep’. The formal structure of those institutions is of course well known to this audience.Footnote 2 What I want to focus on here is the particular light cast on those institutions by Greg Grossman's approach. In particular, I want to highlight the systemic logic of two key faces of the Soviet economic system – the state owned, centrally planned and administered command economy, and the privately driven, often complementary second economy – with an emphasis on a key link between them, the social contrivance of money.",13

This type of standard definition focuses attention on economic institutions, which, according to Douglass C North (1998, p.79)are:
 ‘… the humanly devised constraints that structure human interaction. They are made up of formal constraints (e.g., rules, laws, constitutions), informal constraints (e.g., norms of behavior, conventions, self-imposed codes of conduct) and their enforcement characteristics. Together they define the incentive structure of societies and specifically economies.’ They also facilitate the organisation and conduct of transactions between members of the society and, crucial to their effectiveness, employ various enforcement mechanisms, which can be based on habits, rules of morality, customs, rights, or coercion. Institutions influence beliefs and behaviours of individuals and groups, and thus the preferences and priorities expressed through both public decisions (Engerman and Sokoloff, 2003). Most analysts select arbitrarily one or two key institutions with which to specify the economic system, for instance, market versus planned economy, the share of government ownership in the means of production, the relative importance of government expenditures or regulation, the dominant ideology, the most important economic values (individualistic, social, communitarian), the most common structure of enterprises, and so forth.Footnote 1 Some social scientists have developed certain models and then classified countries according to how closely they approximate these ‘ideal types.’ But, as Richard Grassby sourly notes (1999, p. 2), ideal types are ‘fictive generalizations about the predominant characteristics of a particular society, projected from selected historical facts and intended to serve as a basis for universal analysis.’ Moreover, we cannot be sure that the most important institutions and organisations in the economy are taken into account since only two or three features are singled out as crucial. Another problem in using these ad hoc procedures is that little attempt is made to link the selected criteria with the full range of other economic institutions and organisations that structure the society in question. Such approaches can be justified, however, when the analyst cannot get adequate data on the society's full range of economic institutions, although the results must be accepted with caution. My approach is different. I start with variables representing a series of institutions and organisations and define each as a dimension of the economic system, an approach that allows multidimensional statistical techniques to be employed. I focus on institutions and organisations that might have an important impact on the economy (at least as suggested by case studies of particular nations) and that are related to the system of property or distribution. Given these various dimensions, I then look for cluster of nations with similar configurations of economic institutions and organisations. More technically, I calculate the distances in this multidimensional space defined by the selected institutions and organisations between each society and every other society and employ a pattern recognition technique called cluster analysis to determine which societies are nearest to each other. This allows us, in turn, to determine which institutions and organisations cluster together. The clusters of economies which appear most similar define, in turn, the different types of economic systems. Chart 1 presents a simplified example in a two-dimensional space. To be very concrete, let us assume that all economic systems have different degrees of only two institutions, protection of the job rights of workers (A) and government expenditures as a ratio of GDP (B). For each society we can designate this configuration by an x on the graph. At first glance, the economies fall into three clusters, whose boundaries I have sketched. These clusters are bunched somewhat differently, with cluster Q the most tightly packed; and cluster S, the most loosely. One economy, in the upper middle portion of the graph, does not fall clearly into any of the three clusters; different estimations of the clusters might put it in either Q or R. This kind of problem arises more often when examining the economies of agricultural societies than for either foraging (hunting, gathering, and fishing) societies or industrial/service economies.Footnote 2 Designation of clusters.Note: The axes A and B, respectively, represent the two possible institutions in this simplified example, relative protection of job rights of workers and the ratio of government expenditures to GDP. The position of each society (×) is determined by the degree to which these two institutions play a part in its economy. Q, R, and S represent the derived clusters. The chart illustrates another problem, however, that is quite common in this procedure. Might it be better to consider cluster S as really two clusters, with the dashed line marking the boundaries of each? We face a tradeoff. On the one hand, according to the principle of Occam's razor, entities (types of economic systems in this case) should not be multiplied unnecessarily, and we should have as few clusters as possible.Footnote 3 On the other hand, increasing the number of clusters reduces the error in defining each cluster. Obviously, if we have 29 societies (each with an × on the graph) we will have no error in our description if we define 29 clusters. If, however, eight x's cluster near each other and another nine x's are also close to each other, but not near to the first group, and a third group of 11 x's also form a distinct cluster, we lose relatively little information about the grouping of economic systems by reducing the 29 clusters to three. At this juncture it is useful to draw upon the principle of the minimum description length (MDL), defined by Jorma Rissanen (1989, p.79ff.; 2001), who worked from a ‘stochastic information-theoretic’ approach. This technique combines the positive value of additional information gained by increasing the number of clusters with the negative value of the resulting greater theoretical complexity (both determined using information theory) and thereby arrives at a description length used for determining the optimal number of clusters. More specifically, the first step is to calculate the description length associated with each of various numbers of clusters for the data under examination. The optimal number of clusters (minimum description length) is simply where the gain in information is exactly counterbalanced by the increase in complexity. A computer program (written by Bruce Maxwell and described in Maxwell et al., 2002) allows an easy calculation of the MDL over a range of numbers of clusters. Once the optimal number of clusters (the number of economic systems) is selected, the program prints out the list of economies in each, as well as certain properties of each cluster, so that we can gain a quantitative idea of how often particular institutions occur together. The optimal number of clusters, I must emphasise, may not be very helpful if the isolated clusters are very broad (in terms of Chart 1, if the lines defining the clusters encompass a very large area). A useful statistic to investigate this matter compares the variance of the distance of every point (a nation) with every other point in the sample and then compares it with the variance of the distance of every point within a given cluster with every other point in the same cluster for each cluster. Such a calculation tells us how much of the differences among the various economies is explained by the calculated clusters. Thus, if the MDL calculations determines that three clusters are optimal and if, within each of these clusters, all countries have the same institutional configuration, the reduction-in-variance is 100 percent. By way of contrast, if the points to be clustered are randomly scattered over the multidimensional space, the calculated reduction-in-variance may be only 10 percent and distinctive economic systems cannot be meaningfully determined, a situation that, fortunately, I did not encounter. It is worth noting, however, that the percentage of variance explained by the clusters (economic systems) is less for the developing economies than industrial/service economies. I suspect that two reasons can explain why the economic systems of developing nations have received so little attention. Among the developing nations more societies appear close to the border separating economic systems. Moreover, the systems boundaries are relatively broad and explain less of the variance than we might wish. Although I do not believe that any economist has carried out a cluster analysis to arrive at these conclusions, analysts have intuitively perceived that the delineations of economic systems in developing nations would be difficult. Finally, I must emphasise that although such an approach appears ‘objective, it cannot be used heedlessly. The analyst must base the calculations on unbiased information and select judiciously the dimensions by which the clusters are to be defined (in the example of Chart 1, relative protection of the job rights of labour and the ratio of government expenditures to the GDP). The number of relevant institutions and organisations is, of course, related to the complexity of the economy. I define ‘developing countries’ as those nations which, in 1990, had a per capita GDP of $10,000 or less in a set of common prices (Maddison, 2003). For this group I collected data on economic institutions and organisations that were not highly specialised in one sector and that had some relevance either to distribution of goods and services or to property relations in many sectors. For such data I could draw upon three different types of indicators: Some of the 31 indicators I selected were derived from the laws defining the institutions (for instance, various types of government regulations or patent protection); from statistics about their activities (for instance, centralisation of banks or the percentage of workers covered by collective bargaining contracts); while still others, from expert opinion (for instance, the level of the economy – enterprise, industry, or national – at which wages are most often bargained or the competitiveness of the economic environment). When I present the summary data below, I also specify which of the three types of indicators are involved.Footnote 4 These indicators (discussed in detail in Appendix A) are grouped into five categories: (a) those reporting the ways in which the product market functioned in the different countries (nine indicators); (b) those describing aspects of the labour market and various types of labour institutions (five indicators); (c) those referring to various characteristics of enterprises and the system of production (four indicators); (d) those detailing the relative importance of different types of governmental activities (six indicators); (e) and, finally, those reporting particular aspects of the financial system (seven indicators). Some of these indicators overlap in certain respects, but all reflect what I believe to be crucial aspects of the property and distribution institutions of the societies. Relevant data could be found for 41 nations (listed in Table 1). The minimum description length analysis pointed toward four clusters (economic systems) as optimal number. After specifying this number, the cluster analysis program then randomly selects the same number of nations, and calculates in an iterative fashion the nations in those clusters. Given the randomness of the initial selection of nations, it was necessary to run the program a number of times and average the results. For this reason I also specified that each run of the program include the average of 100 such calculations and each calculation be carried out with 200 iterations. Then I carried out such a procedure 10 times, so that a total of 1000 different sets of calculations of the clusters were used in the reported results. If a given nation did not fall at least 70 percent of the time in one cluster, I considered it to lie away from the core of the cluster and towards the boundary. In Table 1, I add a question mark after the name of these 10 countries and, for the estimation of the properties of each economic system in Table 2, exclude them from the calculation.Footnote 5 The percentage of countries close to the boundaries of the clusters among the developing nations is much larger than in a similar analysis of industrialised nations. Nevertheless, the results seem serviceable for further exploration.Footnote 6",15

Several countries in the region are already in the process of considering or implementing far-reaching ‘second-generation’ reforms in this area.Footnote 1 However, persistent macroeconomic instability in some, and the entrenched legacy of socialism and central planning in others, have generated additional challenges which are complicating the design of an effective decentralised system. The virtually global trend towards devolving service implementation to lower levels of government is based on the wide acceptance of the subsidiarity principle and on the view that it results in improved efficiency in the delivery of public services and, hence, a more efficient allocation of resources in the economy.Footnote 2 The current movement towards democratic forms of governance is also closely associated with the demand for decentralised government.Footnote 3 At the same time, increased fiscal decentralisation, in itself, is seen as an important means of increasing democratic participation in the decision-making process, thereby, enhancing accountability and transparency of government actions. In yet other countries, the trend towards greater autonomy for subnational levels of government is driven by the need for national coherence in the face of ethnic or regional centrifugal forces or conflicts. In many transition economies, the political and economic failure of autocratic, highly centralised socialist regimes may have provided an impetus to the subsequent decentralisation initiatives. Whatever the precise background and the motivation in different countries, it is generally acknowledged that the manner in which decentralisation is carried out can have a significant impact on macroeconomic management and performance. A common view in the literature is that decentralisation may aggravate fiscal imbalances, thereby, endangering overall macroeconomic stability, unless sub-national governments are committed to fiscal discipline and the decentralisation package includes incentives for prudence in debt and expenditure management.Footnote 4 Empirical evidence on the relationship between decentralisation and macroeconomic instability is mixed. Shah (1998) and King and Ma (2001) find that a decentralised fiscal systems have a better record in controlling inflation and deficits. However, Fornasari et al. (2000) and DeMelo (2000) find that increases in subnational spending and deficits lead to an increase in spending and deficits at the central level. Recent studies suggest that the design and implementation of a multi-tier system of government can significantly affect overall resource allocation in the economy and, hence, economic efficiency, growth, and welfare (Davoodi and Zou, 1998; Martinez-Vazquez and McNab, 2003; Akai and Sakata, 2002). A central argument for fiscal decentralisation leading to improved resource allocation rests on the assumption that fiscal decentralisation increases local influence over the public sector. However, in theory, there is an equal possibility that fiscal decentralisation simply transfers power from national to local elites and that improved access of local elites to public resources increases opportunities for corruption (Bardhan and Mookherjee, 2000).Footnote 5 In general, the impact of fiscal decentralisation on corruption depends to a large extent on the quality of the supporting institutional framework and in particular, the degree that subnational governments and/or officials can be held accountable. In light of the possible effects – that depend on the institutional design – of fiscal decentralisation on economic growth, macroeconomic management and corruption, a key challenge for many transition economies has been to reap the economic benefits of decentralisation while maintaining control over public expenditures and borrowing, restoring growth and improving accountability of local governments and officials to limit corruption. In retrospect, for many former socialist countries, the combination of efforts aimed at consolidating macroeconomic stabilisation during the early years of the transition, together with the fundamental structural changes in the economy, in some cases strong centrifugal forces, and political and ethnic conflicts, created an extremely complex setting for fiscal decentralisation. This goes a long way in explaining why the fiscal decentralisation process in many transition countries has been rapid, haphazard and largely non-transparent, with the emerging system of intergovernmental relations having important implications for budgetary developments. In recent years, there has been progress in efforts to reform intergovernmental relations in many of the transition economies. However, this progress has been uneven across countries and across various components of intergovernmental fiscal relations. It is widely agreed that the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the Baltics have been the more active reformers in many of the key aspects of intergovernmental fiscal relations. They have made considerable progress in carrying out fiscal decentralisation and have promoted institutional settings and processes that allow for the articulation of interests and policymaking based on consensus building. However even in these countries, there remain challenges and areas for needed progress. Many other countries, including Russia, Ukraine and the Central Asian States still need substantial reforms of the incentive structures that govern intergovernmental fiscal relations in order to obtain an efficient and well-functioning multi-tier system of government. Bird et al. (1995) provided a comprehensive comparative assessment of the decentralisation in early years of transition. A recent study by Wetzel and Dunn (2001) examined the uneven progress on fiscal decentralisation and key challenges to effective decentralisation in the transition economies of Europe and Central Asia. They adopt a traditional approach that focuses on different structural elements that together make up a system of intergovernmental fiscal relations (the legal and institutional framework, expenditure and revenue assignments, transfers and subnational borrowing). Our paper differs from theirs in that we provide a more systematic framework to identify and assess key adverse incentive mechanisms inherent in the design of the system of intergovernmental fiscal relations in these countries. In this respect, our paper is similar to Dabla-Norris et al. (2000), which analysed key disincentives in intergovernmental fiscal systems in a smaller subset of transition countries, namely, Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Our paper provides a simple analytical framework to examine areas where key principles of sound fiscal decentralisation have been breached with their potentially negative impact on the effectiveness of service delivery as well as macroeconomic performance. This includes an assessment of the strength of institutions pertinent to the intergovernmental financial relations, relevant laws, regulatory frameworks and other incentive structures that may facilitate or undermine effective fiscal decentralisation in transition economies. In the section following the next, we identify three critical principles of sound decentralisation which are then contrasted with actual policies and practices in select transition countries. Finally, the last section concludes.",35

Following the agricultural reforms, such as privatisation of farm land and assets, in the early 1990s, traditional socialist farm structures (collective and state farms) have generally been transformed into corporate farms: capitalist enterprises with the legal labels of partnerships, joint-stock companies or limited liability companies. Simultaneously, in all of the transition economies millions of private individual farms – family farms – have emerged, often operating on a very small scale and satisfying much of rural household food consumption (Swinnen and Macours, 2000; Lerman, 2001). Corporate farms, in contrast, have declined in number and, it appears, also in economic viability. Evidence from various countries suggests that corporate farms are suffering from low profitability, high debts, and high liquidation or bankruptcy rates, even in those countries where policies towards the different farm structures are officially non-discriminatory (EBRD, 2003; Lerman et al., 2002). In this paper, we will examine the possible reasons for these problems besetting corporate farming in many transition economies, and explore their relevance for corporate farms in Lithuania. This question is an interesting one for several reasons. Theoretically, the market reforms in agriculture were driven by a distinct view on the inadequacy of corporate enterprise structures in agriculture within a market economy, and the desirability of replacing them with family farms, which were deemed to be inherently more efficient (Schmitt, 1993). To enable this transformation to occur was a major aim of the land privatisation programmes in the early 1990s. The common perception of socialist-style farm structures in the early transformation years was that ‘the evident weakness of this organizational form provides the argument for full scale privatisation’ (IMF et al., 1991, pp. 157–158) and that ‘privatisation in … agriculture mainly concerns the breaking up of large units…’ (World Bank, 1995, p. 2). It would now, a decade and a half later, be important to examine how the performance of corporate farms, as they presently operate in the new market economies, is connected to such innate inadequacies. Other studies (eg Mathijs and Vranken, 2001; Gorton et al., 2003) have found large variability within the group of corporate farms, indicating that factors other than goverance structures play a role. Consequently, corporate farms are not doomed – though they may be handicapped – by their governance structures, and it would then be possible to explore policies to enhance their performance. In this study, we explore and analyse how various factors both within corporate farms and in the farm environment affect their performance.Footnote 1 From a policy point of view, the fate of the corporate farming sector is important for agriculture as a whole. Because alternative farm structures (family farms) are typically small and often market only part of their production, commercial agriculture is still to a large extent dominated by corporate farms. Corporate farms also work considerable shares of agricultural land in many transition economies. Improving the performance of these enterprises would be relevant to the contribution of the agricultural sector to the national economy (eg in terms of incomes, employment, and export potential). In this paper several hypotheses on the factors affecting corporate farm profitability in a transition economy are developed. These will be examined based on both secondary information and survey data from Lithuania collected by the authors. The data provide an opportunity both for an explorative investigation of the structure, environment and performance of corporate farms in Lithuania and for an econometric analysis of the validity of the hypotheses. The paper is concluded with an overview and discussion of the findings.",3

During Japanese colonial occupation, considerable industrialisation occurred in the northern part of the peninsula, building on developments that had occurred under the Choson dynasty during the last quarter of the 19th century. The south was the breadbasket. At the close of the Second World War, the peninsula was divided into zones of US and Soviet military occupation, in the southern and northern parts of the peninsula, respectively. Unable to agree on a formula for unification, rival states – the Republic of Korea in the south and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north – were declared in 1948. In 1950, in a bid to unify the peninsula forcibly, North Korea attacked South Korea. The US and China were drawn into the conflict, and in 1953 an armistice ended the fighting and more or less re-established the original borders. The two Korean states subsequently not only pursued divergent development strategies but also pushed those strategies to extremes. South Korea not only adopted a capitalist system but also went on to pioneer an outward-oriented development strategy, emphasising international trade as a catalyst. North Korea, in contrast, not only adopted central planning but also intentionally time-phased its plans to frustrate linkages with those of other fraternally allied socialist states and in doing so created the world's most autarkic economy, notable in the degree to which markets were repressed under the deified leadership of founding leader Kim Il-sung. Juche, normally translated as ‘self-reliance,’ was adopted as the national ideology, though in fact, North Korea always remained reliant on external support. The contrast in outcomes was astonishing: Between 1963, when major reforms were initiated, and 1997, when it experienced a financial crisis in the context of a broader regional upheaval, South Korea averaged 8 per cent real growth and experienced only a single year of negative growth – 1980, following the second oil shock and the assassination of the president. According to the Penn World Tables, at the start of that period the country's income level was lower than that of Bolivia and Mozambique; by the end it was higher than that of Greece and Portugal.Footnote 2 North Korea, in contrast, is the only significantly industrialised country to experience a peacetime famine. These divergent outcomes are very much related to the two countries' political systems. As remarkable as South Korea's economic performance has been, its political development has been as impressive, if not more so: In a single decade between 1987 and 1997, leadership of the South Korean government went from an authoritarian strongman (General Chun Doo-hwan) to his elected but hand-picked successor (General Roh Tae-woo) to an elected centrist civilian politician (Kim Young-sam) to a former dissident (Kim Dae-jung). In contrast, North Korea remains mired in a Stalinist hereditary dynasty. A single nation but wildly different trajectories.",3

Peter Nicholl was appointed Governor of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) by the Managing Director of the IMF with the approval of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1997. The Law of the CBBH stipulated that after six years the Governor of the CBBH would be a Bosnian citizen. After six years Nicholl was given citizenship so he could continue as Governor for another year. He remained Governor until 31 December 2004 and then served another year as a board member. In 2003, the British financial magazine ‘Finance Central Europe’, named the CBBH as the best central bank and Nicholl Governor of the Year in the Southeast Europe region. In this essay, Nichol compares his experience as Governor of the CBBH to his experience in New Zealand where he worked for twenty-two years and was deputy governor for last five years. He argues that while there are differences between the two environments, there are also many similarities and that clear laws and good operating procedures are needed for successful administration of public institutions in either place.",

One reason is that in most of the corporate scandals of recent years, poor corporate governance has been found to be part of the problem – either by commission or omission. Good governance is also an important issue for public sector organisations and it is the organisational structures and governance of public sector organisations that I will focus on in this article. The two institutions, I use as case studies to illustrate my points are both central banks: the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, where I worked for 22 years from 1972 to 1995 and was Deputy Governor for the last 5 years of that period, and the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where I have worked since 1997 and was Governor from 1997 to the end of 2004. Good governance within the public sector does not, of itself, guarantee good economic performance in a country. Good economic performance comes essentially from the private sector. But the converse situation is also very important and, I think, does hold true. Bad government will almost certainly lead to poor economic performance. The private sector can build on good government and magnify its benefits for a country's citizens. But it is almost impossible for the private sector in a country to overcome and compensate for bad government. This is even more so in today's highly globalised world. Private sector participants can often relocate their operations to more business friendly environments relatively easily. It is a point I try to make as clearly and frequently as I can to policy-makers in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Eastern Europe as a region is now attracting increasing amounts of foreign direct investment and that is likely to continue. But that does not automatically mean that foreign investment will come to BiH. If the business environment is more attractive in neighboring countries, the investment will go there. There are at least four ways in which the government sector can undermine the ability of the private sector to generate growth, employment and wealth. Firstly, they can impose a set of economic and regulatory policies that add substantially to the cost of doing business in that country. The recent survey on competitiveness (World Bank and IFC, 2006) showed both the excessive burdens many countries still impose on establishing and operating a business and the huge differences in these burdens that exist among countries, even in the same region. Secondly, the government can have a major impact on the way business is done in the private sector, including the way companies can be managed, the way contracts can be entered into and the way contract problems can be resolved, and by ensuring there is a sound, equitable and efficient system of law and justice in the country. In New Zealand, most people never have to use the court system to resolve commercial disputes but all would have confidence that if they ever did need to do so, the justice system would be fair and relatively quick. Coming from such a background, I did not realise until I worked in BiH how fundamentally business behaviour changes when this basic trust in the judicial system does not exist. The third problem bad government can create for the private sector is to generate major uncertainty either through macroeconomic instability or by constantly changing the regulatory rules that a private enterprise faces. All investment takes time to plan, implement and generate a return for the investor. If there is a high likelihood that government could change the rules of the game during the investment cycle, investment becomes very risky. The private sector can actually cope better with bad policies than with constantly changing ones. While they do not like bad policies, they can plan the best way to operate in that environment so as to minimise the negative impacts. But constant changes in policies, especially changes in the overall direction of policy, make investment planning almost impossible. A fourth way in which government can create problems for the private sector is through unfair competition. In many countries, government is not only a regulator of industries, it also owns many enterprises and thus can be a competitor too. To use a sporting analogy, government can be the referee and a player at the same time. This always has the potential to be a problem. It need not be a major problem provided the government-owned enterprise competes on an even playing field basis with the private enterprises in the same industry. Unfortunately, this seldom happens. Another way in which good governance within government can make an important contribution to a country's economic performance is the efficiency with which government uses economic resources in its own operations. In most countries, government is a major user of economic resources. The proportion of GDP spent by government is more than 50% in some countries and is below 30% in very few. It is therefore very significant. Government can use these resources efficiently or wastefully. What can be done in structuring and governing public institutions to tip the balance between these two outcomes towards the efficient end of the spectrum? This is the issue I want to focus on using the two central bank case studies. Both the New Zealand and Bosnian Central banks have gone through a major reform process. In the New Zealand case, we were trying to reform and modernise an institution that had existed for over 40 years. We were thus trying to change established procedures and habits. In the Bosnian case, I was appointed Governor in 1997 of a new institution. We were therefore establishing a new organisational structures and systems. But there were still a lot of habits and behaviours that came out of peoples' past experiences that had to be changed. Some of these related back to the socialist system which they had operated under and which tended to frown on and stifle initiative. Some related to the terrible war they had recently been through which led to deep mistrust. The two environments were very different. About the only thing that New Zealand and Bosnia have in common is that they have much the same population, around four million people. But in most other respects: history, economic structure, ethnicity, etc., they are very different. The differences can be summed up in one way: the New Zealand's society and economy were stable in most fundamental respects and had been for a long time. In BiH, everything was unstable. I took part in the analytical and drafting work that preceded the passing of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) law in 1987 that put in place the basic legal and institutional framework under which the RBNZ has operated since that time. In BiH, the CBBH law which sets out the legal framework under which the CBBH operates was already passed when I arrived to take up the position of Governor. It is a very clear and good law and in many of its broad characteristics it is similar to the New Zealand law. Having such a good law has been a very important factor, indeed even a crucial factor, for enabling the CBBH to be established successfully and to operate effectively.",4
48,2,Comparative Economic Studies,22 June 2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100127,Job Reallocation and Productivity Growth in the Ukrainian Transition,June 2006,J David Brown,John S Earle,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Although much has been written about the important role played by labour reallocation in the transition of the post-socialist economies, there are relatively few analytical studies of the degree to which labour markets have been successful in facilitating the movement of workers from less productive to more productive activities. This lack of analysis may partly be due to the fact that the attention of economists studying labour markets in transition has tended to be dominated by a two-sector model in which labour gradually shifts from state- to privately owned firms and in which within-sector homogeneity is assumed.Footnote 1 Essentially, a representative state-owned (industrial) enterprise destroys jobs and a representative privately owned (service sector) firm creates them. While a reasonable simplification for some purposes, the representative firm model omits much of the interesting heterogeneity within sectors. Moreover, on closer examination, actual labour flows appear to be largely inconsistent with the model, as turnover of jobs and workers is much larger than required merely for flows from state to private ownership or from manufacturing to service industries – although these flows are nontrivial. More disaggregated studies, using microdata, have documented substantial labour mobility within these sectors.Footnote 2 Furthermore, it has become evident that broad sectors mask substantial variation in firm performance, restructuring, and productivity. If the labour market is supposed to be functioning to reallocate labour from less to more productive uses, then the focus on aggregate sectors may be somewhat misplaced. In this paper, we argue that an evaluation of the extent to which labour markets in transition economies have begun to successfully perform this function requires detailed microdata at the firm level and a methodology for connecting labour flows with productivity performance. Drawing upon measurement methods introduced by Davis and Haltiwanger (1992, 1999), we describe the magnitudes and patterns of job reallocation in Ukraine, and the relationship of the observed job flows with a measure of firm productivity. Our focus on job rather than worker flows is dictated by limitations of our data, but it is also more straightforward to relate firm-level productivity with firm-level employment, rather than with worker mobility. Our purpose in examining Ukraine is to extend our recent analysis of Russia (Brown and Earle, 2002) to a large transition country, albeit one that has been somewhat neglected by transition research. While the starting point of the transition process was quite similar in both cases, given the common Soviet heritage, the choice of policies thereafter was quite different, with Ukraine by most accounts following a more ‘gradualist’ path of slower liberalisation, privatisation, and stabilisation than its larger neighbour. Is the gradualist policy reflected in a slower or faster pace of job reallocation and a better or worse functioning of the labour market, in the sense of the correlation of job flows with productivity? Are the patterns of job flows becoming more similar to those observed in the West (for instance, reported by Davis and Haltiwanger, 1992, 1999), and how do those patterns compare with those in Russia? These are the main questions around which we organise our analysis. The paper's focus is restricted to continuing firms in the manufacturing sector. Again, this focus is dictated by constraints of available data, but the size of this sector, its importance to the Ukrainian economy in the Soviet period, and the particular difficulties of restructuring suggest that it is also a worthwhile subject for study. The data we employ do have the advantages of a fairly long time series – annual from 1992 to 2000 – and they are quite comparable in scope and variable definitions to those in our Russia study.Footnote 3 We should emphasise, however, that the data permit no inferences to be drawn concerning entry, exit, and the new private firm sector, which is likely to be an important source of growing labour demand and job creation.Footnote 4 In Ukraine as in Russia, it is clear even from aggregate statistics that job destruction has dominated job creation in the industrial sector. Figure 1 shows the evolution of annual average employment over the 1992–2000 period, including a remarkable fall of nearly 40 per cent by 1999, followed by a small increase in 2000. Although large by any standard, the employment drop was nonetheless substantially exceeded by the fall in output to less than 50 per cent of its initial level. Production, employment, and productivity in Ukrainian industry, 1992–2000. These patterns may be unsurprising to anyone familiar with recent developments in the East European region, but little is known about the character of this massive job destruction in the industrial sector. Does it represent a process of creative destruction, whereby the least efficient firms downsize and eventually disappear, while the more efficient grow? Or does it represent severe recession, in which all firms have been hit by a common negative shock? A final possibility is that the job destruction is concentrated among the better, more efficient firms in industry, suggesting ‘sclerosis’ in the sense of Caballero and Hammour (2000), whereby unproductive firms survive due to market imperfections and government policies. In Ukraine, as in Russia, there are particularly compelling reasons to suspect some sclerotic forces at work, as the government may have directly subsidised or otherwise supported weak and failing firms, while taxes, bureaucratic interference, and poor contract enforcement and property rights protection may have retarded the growth of firms that are more successful. The view that the economic transition has destroyed the better, more productive parts of the industrial sector is far from uncommon in Ukraine and other transition economies, although it is usually associated with nostalgia for the Soviet period. In this paper, we provide evidence on the character of resource reallocation by relating job flows to firm-level productivity measures. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Next section describes our data, and the subsequent section provides a basic description of the magnitudes, heterogeneity, and covariates of job flows, including their relationships with ownership, market concentration, exports, capital intensity, labour productivity, and employment size. Following Davis and Haltiwanger (1999), we estimate the impact of these factors on employment growth and job reallocation in a regression framework and then use simulation methods to compute the partial coefficients measuring their effects on excess job reallocation. To assess whether the job flow patterns have changed over our observation period of 1992–2000 – that is, whether they are moving in the direction of patterns characteristic of market economies – we interact the covariates with a time trend in these regressions and simulations. Next section relates the job flows to productivity differentials across firms and industries. We employ decomposition techniques drawn from Davis and Haltiwanger (1999) and Foster et al. (2001) to measure the contribution of job flows to sectoral and aggregate productivity growth, and we also apply regression techniques to assess the statistical significance of the relationship between employment share growth and productivity differentials and to estimate the effects of firm characteristics on this relationship. We are particularly interested in assessing whether we can find evidence for any effects of privatisation and liberalisation policies on this aspect of restructuring. The final section provides a brief conclusion. The variable definitions are described in Appendix A.",11

This is a new situation for the NMS given that prior to accession their fiscal situation was not the subject of regular and binding surveillance. Furthermore, the NMS are obliged to enter Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) at some point and meeting the fiscal convergence criteria is perhaps the most serious obstacle along this road, for some at least. Each NMS has its own specific fiscal situation, with the Baltic countries and Slovenia showing a healthier fiscal stance and the ‘Visegrad group’ (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia), Cyprus and Malta suffering serious fiscal problems. In addition, NMS have to deal in the short- to medium-term with the negative fiscal consequences of EU accession (contributions to the EU budget, co-financing and pre-financing EU transfers and the costs of adopting the acquis). However, in the long-term, the nature of their fiscal problems is unlikely to differ from what can be observed today and is expected in the OMS. This concerns, for example, the high level of fiscal redistribution that is an effect of the excessive level of social-related expenditures and is further challenged by the expected consequences of population ageing. Thus, most OMS and NMS will continue to face serious fiscal strains in the next decades. On the microeconomic level, both OMS and NMS have to increase the competitiveness of their economies and their excessive fiscal burden is one of the most serious obstacles blocking this path. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the fiscal challenges faced by the NMS with special attention given to the eight transition economies of Central Europe and the Baltic region (NMS-8).Footnote 1 The paper is organised as follows: The next section analyses the fiscal situation of NMS and differences between them. We follow-up this section with one that extends this analysis with an attempt to estimate the fiscal costs of EU accession for the NMS. In subsequent section, we discuss the prospects and seek to gauge the preconditions for the NMS to meet fiscal convergence criteria as defined by the Treaty of EU and the SGP. Next section focuses on long-term fiscal challenges that stem mainly from unfavorable demographic trends faced by both OMS and NMS in the near future. Penultimate section addresses the hot issue of EU fiscal surveillance rules. Finally, last section offers conclusions.",4

The aim of this study is to clarify, whether and where this statement is true and how income distribution does affect the overall growth performance of transition countries. There is a vast amount of literature on real and nominal convergence of the new European Union (EU) member countries to ‘old’ EU member countries’ standards,Footnote 1 but little is known about the behaviour of income distribution. Is the dramatic increase in income inequality overshooting EU levels or will there be a convergence in the sense of assimilation to EU levels? The countries under review are: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland as the most important new EU member economies and Russia in order to have a comparison with a non-EU accession country. The findings are analysed against the background of convergence or divergence respectively vis-à-vis the EU level of income and income distribution. Here Germany, being the neighbouring country and biggest EU economy, is taken as benchmark.Footnote 2 The current state of the art in income inequality research can be summarised as the ‘Transatlantic Consensus’, which explains inequality through a partial analysis approach with changes on the labour market at its core. This approach and its explanatory value for transition economies will be critically discussed from a macroeconomic point of view. The potential inter-relationship between inequality and growth is particularly important for transition countries, because, according to conventional wisdom, these countries have experienced rising inequality and declining GDP. For the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland it can be shown that income distribution remained relatively stable before and throughout the transition period on the basis of so far unpublished data from the Luxemburg Income Study database. Russia, however, displays a sharp increase in inequality. These results are illustrated by Lorenz curves and underpinned by developments in functional income distribution. The paper is structured as follows: The next section summarises the standard explanation of rising inequality, which is a microeconomic approach in a partial analytical framework. Its application to transition economies is briefly presented. The third section reflects upon macroeconomic issues related to the distribution of income. Various approaches are discussed in this context. The fourth section presents an empirical analysis of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Russia. It is organised in the sequence of general income development, personal income distribution and functional income distribution plus transfers. The fifth section reconsiders the performance of each country and gives hypothetical explanations. The conclusion puts the countries under review into the context of convergence and divergence.",13

Kosovo's autonomy is a direct result of NATOs 12-week bombardment of Serbian military and civilian targets in Kosovo and Serbia. This action resulted in the signing of the Military Technical Agreement on the 9th of June 1999 and the subsequent withdrawal of the Serbian civil and military presence in Kosovo. On the 10th of June 1999 the United Nations issued resolution 1244 (United Nations Security Council, 1999a, 1999b). This resolution authorised the establishment of the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) and enabled the political and economic control of Kosovo to pass from Belgrade to the UN administration based in Pristina. Although economically and politically independent of Serbia, post-conflict Kosovo still lacks several key features normally associated with independent states. In the economic sphere, Kosovo uses the Euro as its official currency and therefore has no control over exchange rates and monetary policy.Footnote 1 Furthermore, Kosovo is required to balance its domestic budget, since it is unable to finance a budget deficit through internal or external borrowing.Footnote 2 International borrowing for the purposes of investment is also prohibited. This restriction was imposed by UNMIK in order to prevent a situation from arising where international creditors could attempt to recover their loans directly from the UN. Finally, Kosovo suffers from a range of difficulties, which arise from the fact that it is not a sovereign state and is therefore unable to obtain membership of international organisations. For example, Kosovo does not have representation in the WTO and has a very limited ability to negotiate international trade agreements.Footnote 3 Politically, Kosovo is able to operate independent of Serbia, with Belgrade having almost no involvement in the domestic decision-making process. This is not to suggest that Belgrade has no interest in the decision-making process, but simply to suggest that Belgrade's opinion is rarely taken into account in Kosovo's internal political process. Political power in Kosovo is effectively shared between two political bodies, UNMIK and the Provisional Institutions of Self Government (PISG).Footnote 4 UNMIK is still the ultimate authority in Kosovo and retains ‘reserve powers’ in the following areas: security, law and order, foreign relations, minority rights, banking supervision, customs, management of publicly owned enterprises, energy and mining. Responsibility in all other areas has been transferred to the PISG. UNMIK also retains the power to overturn decisions made by the PISG. The economy of Kosovo is still recovering from the long-term effects of the war in 1999 and its forced separation from the economy of Serbia in the same year. During the first three years of economic independence from Serbia, economic activity in Kosovo has been dominated by post-conflict reconstruction, which in turn has been largely funded by the inflow of international aid donations and remittances from the Albanian diaspora (Korovilas, 2002). The figures in Table 1 demonstrate the extent of the economic slowdown in Kosovo as the post-war reconstruction boom comes to an end. This is the consequence of the significant decline in international aid and reduction in the inflow of migrant remittances from the diaspora. In 2003, export earnings were equal to only 3.7% of total imports, with 90% of exported goods produced by the socially owned sector (Monthly Macroeconomic Monitor, various editions). Therefore, SOE's are responsible for a small proportion of total economic activity in Kosovo and a very large proportion of total exports. Kosovo is highly dependent upon the importation of food and other vital goods, leading to a sustained balance of trade deficit. Increasing the level of exports is the obvious solution to Kosovo's current economic difficulties. However, the main sectors of Kosovo's economy with significant export potential, such as manufacturing, processing and mineral extraction, are still a part of the socially owned sector and are therefore unable to attract the level of investment needed to develop their export potential. In other parts of the former Yugoslavia privatisation was accomplished by initially nationalising SOEs, then selling them to private investors, with the proceeds of the sale being received by the state. This type of ‘formal privatisation’ is not possible in Kosovo since UNMIK does not have the authority to impose this type of fundamental change upon ownership rights. Despite the fact that formal privatisation is not possible, UNMIK has been actively pursuing alternative methods of ‘privatisation’, such as leasing and liquidation, in order to transfer Kosovo's socially owned enterprises into the private sector.Footnote 5 Kosovo contains some 350 socially owned enterprises. The vast majority of these enterprises are engaged in the extractive and manufacturing sectors, with the main focus on mining, finished and semi-finished goods (World Bank, February 2001). Kosovo's agricultural sector contains a mixed picture, where the vast majority of agricultural land is in private hands. However, there are a number of agricultural processing plants that remain in social ownership. UNMIK has taken a very clear stance on the issue of privatisation, stating that the transfer of socially owned enterprises to the private sector is one of the key economic reforms that needs to take place in order for Kosovo to become a dynamic and sustainable independent economy. The privatisation process in Kosovo is administered by the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA). This UNMIK department is charged with the task of administering socially owned enterprises, resolving ownership disputes and ultimately privatising these enterprises (UNMIK, April 2002). However, by December 2003, over 4 years since the establishment of Kosovo as an independent political and economic unit, only 55 of the 350 SOEs had been successfully privatised.Footnote 6 This paper will examine a number of key issues relating to the privatisation process in Kosovo. Firstly, this paper will examine the current condition of the Socially owned sector in Kosovo. It will then give some indication of the extent to which privatisation has been limited by the availability of economically viable SOEs. Secondly, this paper will also address the question of whether an appropriate privatisation model can be developed, which can operate within the constraints of Kosovo's current legal system. Specifically, whether UNMIK can legitimately transfer SOEs into the private sector and avoid a successful legal challenge to this process. Finally, this paper will consider whether the privatisation model devised by UNMIK allows former SOEs to operate with a sufficient level of market freedom in order to qualify as genuine private sector enterprises.",4

An extensive literature has examined the differences across East European countries and the changes over time in these official statistics, using them to derive conclusions on such issues as the flexibility of adjustments, the effectiveness of passive and active labor market policies, and the social costs of transition.Footnote 1 However, little consideration has been given to the possibility that statistical agencies in different countries may have adopted somewhat different definitions, even if they all conform to the international conventions, because the latter permit some flexibility in the classification of several ambiguous categories that are considered – in developed market economies – to be relatively unimportant. If the transition process tends to foster the growth of such nonstandard forms of employment and unemployment, this raises questions about the comparability of the official statistics and about the tendency of the transition literature to rely exclusively on conventional labor force measures. Even if the definitions are comparable, the statistics may be misleading if these nonstandard forms of employment and unemployment are important, as their proportions can differ from country to country. For example, the standard definition of employment includes a number of categories that differ substantially from the conventional picture of the long-term employee working regular full-time hours for a regular wage and expecting continued, perhaps indefinite, employment.Footnote 2 Not only are self-employed entrepreneurs excluded from this picture, but also such groups as part-time workers, temporary contractors, unpaid family helpers, those on temporary leaves, those who work solely for their own (and their families’) consumption, and laid-off people who retain a formal attachment to the job. These categories are potentially quite large, and some of them may be treated differently in different countries. Yet little attention has been paid to them in most research by economists studying labor markets in the transition economies.Footnote 3 The definition and measurement of unemployment also involve substantial ambiguities. The statistical treatment of laid-off workers on recall, involuntary part-timers, discouraged workers, and others who are marginally attached to the labor force has in fact been extensively discussed by labor statisticians in the West, particularly in the United States, where the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) regularly publishes ‘measures of labor underutilisation’ together with the monthly employment report based on the Current Population Survey (Bregger and Haugen, 1995). How important are these categories, and how are they treated by statistical agencies in different transition economies? Again, these issues have attracted little analysis. The magnitudes of nonstandard types of labor force status have important implications for judging labor market performance and developing policy measures to improve it. If, for example, a country has many discouraged workers, temporary contract workers, involuntary part-time workers, and underemployed workers for economic reasons, while few self-employed entrepreneurs have emerged, the employment situation would be much worse than that captured by the standard employment and unemployment measures. The size of the subsistence agriculture sector affects the accuracy of standard poverty indicators and potentially also the effectiveness of wage subsidies for improving welfare. A possible explanation why nonstandard types of labor force status in transition have received little attention, despite their potential importance, is lack of information. The data requirements for a careful analysis involve individual-level data from labor force surveys (LFSs), which since the early 1990s have been collected in most East European countries. These data have tended to be jealously guarded by the statistical agencies, however, and access to them has usually been quite limited. In this paper, we report the results of our analyses of nonstandard types of employment and unemployment using LFS microdata we have collected for three economies: Estonia, Romania, and Russia. Although our choice of countries is partially constrained by data availability, these three economies provide the possibility for an interesting set of comparisons, as they are structurally different and have adopted rather different policies in the transition. The differences can be seen, for instance, in rankings of ‘progress in reform’ or ‘extent of liberalisation’ by international agencies such as the World Bank (1996), which placed Estonia in the top group of rapidly reforming post-socialist countries in Eastern Europe, Romania with a group of slower reformers, and Russia among the laggards. Interestingly, however, such rankings bear little resemblance to the relative magnitudes of the reported rates of unemployment and employment in these countries. Figure 1 displays unemployment rates (ILO definition) for eight transition economies, in order of increasing unemployment. The Romanian rate is the second lowest in the group, close behind Hungary's, while the Russian rate is also among the lowest. The Estonian rate is relatively high, however – almost as high as the rates in Bulgaria, Poland, and Slovakia. Employment–population ratios for the same countries are shown in Figure 2. The employment rates in Romania and Russia are the highest in the group, and Estonia's is also relatively high. These published rates clearly convey only limited information about labor market reforms and developments. Unemployment rate (ILO definition, %), 2001. Source: ILO (2001). Employment–population ratio (ILO definition, %), 2001. Source: ILO (2001). One might expect to see much different rates of nonstandard employment and unemployment across these countries, potentially reshuffling the labor market performance rankings. Agriculture was a much larger share of the socialist economy in Romania, so the possibilities for agricultural self-employment are likely to have been much greater in Romania. Firms were weaned off state subsidies much more quickly and exposed to more international competition in Estonia than in Romania or Russia, possibly providing clearer signals that they had to sever ties with a significant fraction of their workforce in order to survive. We first provide a brief discussion of the characteristics of each country's LFS. Then we use these data to re-compute and examine the definitions of the official employment and unemployment indicators. For the most part, the results here correspond closely to the published official statistics, although in order to ensure age-comparable estimates we restrict the age range to 15–72 (as used in Russia). Next, we consider several types of nonstandard or boundary categories of employment and unemployment: temporary contracts, voluntary and involuntary part-time workers, nonsearching job-losers, unpaid family helpers, discouraged workers, and household producers – particularly those in agriculture who consume all or most of their output. Finally, we re-estimate the employment–population ratios and measures of labor utilization under alternative definitional assumptions. The next section describes the surveys, and penultimate sections report the nonstandard employment and unemployment results, respectively. The last section provides some concluding remarks.",9

Dollarisation is a lasting, if not a permanent, change in the economic environment of a country, with economic costs and benefits that extend far into the future and are difficult to quantify. Therefore, the decision to dollarise, while influenced by economic analysis, rests primarily in the political domain. According to Frieden (2003), political economy considerations explain much more successfully the choice of exchange rate regimes compared to standard economic cost–benefit analysis. For example, as Willett (2000) points out, the European Monetary Union (EMU) is here although, according to traditional economic analysis, it should not be. This paper contributes to the literature on the choice of an exchange rate regime by using unique survey data from Bulgaria to reveal the factors driving the public support for and opposition to official euroisation. Bulgaria has operated a currency board regime since 1997 when the exchange rate was pegged to the German mark to stabilise the economy after one of the worst financial crises in a transition economy. The currency board lowered inflation very rapidly and has sustained low inflation since 1997 contributing to rapid rates of economic growth. Bulgaria is expected to join the European Union (EU) in 2007. A recent agreement between the Bulgarian National Bank and the Bulgarian Ministry of Finance establishes the goal of joining the EMU as soon as 2009 with a transition from the currency board to EMU membership at the current exchange rate. Thus, there is a predictable and orderly exit from the currency board on the near horizon. The question studied here is whether the population supports unilateral euroisation even before EMU membership. Although the policy relevance of this question is diminishing with the approaching EMU entry, this paper makes contributions to the literature in two important directions.Footnote 1 First, it offers the first systematic evidence on a move from a peg to euroisation or dollarisation. The literature, for example, Collins (1996), Edwards (1996), Frieden (2003), and Klyuev (2002), has studied the political economy choice between fixed and flexible exchange rates, but no paper has investigated the political economy of euroisation starting from a peg.Footnote 2 In that case, the support for euroisation is linked primarily to the level of confidence in the stability of the peg. We show that the growing credibility of the currency board in Bulgaria reduces the support for early euroisation. Second, this paper reveals the various influences shaping public attitudes toward a major economic policy option. Although the political economy literature recognises that policies cannot be implemented without public support (see Roland, 2002), it offers only limited evidence on the formation of beliefs about policies. Furthermore, the evidence presented here is on the micro-level, whereas the literature usually studies policy choices, including the choice of an exchange rate regime, on the macro-level.Footnote 3 For example, the surveys lend support to Kinder and Kiewiet's (1979, 1981) sociotropic hypothesis that citizens are motivated primarily by national economic conditions and not by personal costs and gains in evaluating policies. The data also allow us to examine whether the costs and benefits of euroisation studied by economists are the same as the costs and benefits expected by the population at large. For example, we learn that the opposition to early euroisation in Bulgaria is based primarily on a nationalistic attachment to the domestic currency, something that does not enter economic calculations. These and other influences on attitudes are studied in the remaining sections of this paper. The next section discusses the pros and cons of euroisation in Bulgaria. The following two sections present the survey data and summary statistics from the surveys. The penultimate section reports econometric estimates using the data and the final section concludes.",

In the pre- and early-transition periods, state policies generally distorted resource allocation, as credit – subject to a variety of controls – was directed toward sustaining existing industries and maintaining living standards through explicit and implicit subsidies to enterprises and households. Since the primary role of the banking system was to channel funds to the real sector, efficiency and profitability were not among the top priorities. The banks were not engaged in evaluating the credit conditions of their borrowers, and therefore no risk management techniques were in use. Outdated statistical standards were designed to serve the objective of easy planning as opposed to disclosure of the true financial state of banks. While some countries in the region have been successful in eliminating underlying distortions and restructuring their financial sectors, in other cases financial sectors remain underdeveloped and the rates of financial intermediation continue to be quite low. This is especially alarming in light of mounting evidence of the effect of financial sector development on economic growth (see, for instance, Levine and Renelt, 1992 and King and Levine, 1993). Although part of the success across countries could be attributed to better initial conditionsFootnote 1 and achievements of early macroeconomic stabilisation programmes, the importance of structural reforms were the dominant force behind the success in performance (eg, Berg et al., 1999). Progress in legal and regulatory reforms, enterprise privatisation, price and external trade liberalisation were partially responsible for the changes taking place in some transition economies. These changes manifested themselves not only in the financial soundness of banking institutions, but also in a wider range and sophistication of financial services provided by the latter. Reduced availability of centralised financing encouraged banks in the region to look for alternative sources of financing and undertake measures aimed at deposit mobilisation. As economies grew, triggering an increase in savings, so did the number of financial intermediaries (securities market institutions, pension funds, insurance companies, and brokerage firms) claiming a share of the pie and exerting additional pressure on banks to improve provision of services. In light of these changes, it has become important to assess the relative role of different institutional and policy settings in explaining the difference between outcomes across countries and financial institutions. Yet, the effect and relative importance of various macro and regulatory elements of financial reforms in transition countries have so far not been properly evaluated.Footnote 2 Nor is there a consensus on the scale and the scope of effective regulatory regime. Studies on transition economies have yet to look into these issues.Footnote 3 One should note that different policy measures may have different, and often opposite, effects on operational efficiency and technological improvements of banking operations. For instance, although tightening prudential requirements may limit banks' profitability and reduce the operating efficiency in the short run, doing so may encourage banks to look for new and innovative ways to invest, thereby expanding the production possibilities frontier.Footnote 4 It is, therefore, essential for a policymaker to be able to identify policy instruments that are effective in bringing about changes in productivity and efficiency and come up with the best (often least-cost) policy response. This is of particular importance for economies in transition, where the choice of instruments for policymakers can be rather limited as well as costly. This paper aims to fill in the gap. Its purpose is to: (1) calculate an appropriate measure of commercial bank efficiency in a multiple-input/multiple-output framework and (2) evaluate the effects of macroeconomic, legal, as well as regulatory environments on performance of commercial banks as measured by these efficiency indicators. We do so in a wide range of transition countries and across a number of years. We argue that to fully assess the efficiency of commercial bank operations, it is necessary to model various types of functions performed by banks. In the beginning, we skip the discussion on the potential links between various policy variables and bank efficiency, only to discuss them later, along with the final results of estimation. The range of questions that we concern ourselves with is as follows. We look at the impact of prudential standards on efficiency and wonder if tighter prudential environments necessarily lead to inferior performance. We also investigate the impact of foreign ownership on banks' performance and test whether the banks with dominant foreign ownership outperform their largely domestically owned counterparts. Finally, we look at the impact of competition, enterprise restructuring, capital market development, and legal environment on bank efficiency indicators. The paper is structured in the following way: The next section provides an overview of the literature on bank efficiency analysis and describes the methodology used in the paper. The forthcoming section describes the data set and discusses the results of non-parametric estimates of efficiency indicators in cross-country and cross-regional settings. The subsequent section explains differences in cross-bank efficiency indicators by regressing them on the set of policy instruments and control variables. The final section offers conclusions and policy recommendations.",126

Evidence on this issue can guide policy-makers who must decide how closely to track external developments as well as theorists who want to know whether to feed domestic or external shocks into their models. A related goal is to assess which external shocks matter the most. Thus far there is little evidence on these issues for the former centrally planned transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe. This paper takes a step toward filling the gap. The paper proceeds in two steps. In the first step, we provide estimates of the fraction of the variation in real aggregate output and aggregate price level in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland (CHP) that can be attributed to external shocks. In the second step, we estimate to what extent interest rate shocks originating in the euroarea (in Germany) can account for the spillovers to CHP from the rest of the world. Our goal in the first step is to collect stylised facts in the form: x% of the variance in real aggregate output (aggregate price level) in the Czech Republic (Hungary, Poland) originates abroad. Our model for each of the three transition economies is a vector autoregression (VAR). To measure external shocks, we use prices of commodities traded in the world market and key macroeconomic variables in Germany. Germany is by far the largest neighbour and the main trading partner of each of the three transition economies we look at. Within a VAR model for a given transition economy, we test the hypothesis that external variables in the VAR are Granger causally prior (GCP) with respect to domestic variables. It turns out that we find support for the GCP restriction in each of the three transition economies. We then impose the GCP restriction and decompose the sources of the aggregate fluctuations in each transition economy into domestic and external. Our analysis in the first step is reduced-form in the sense that we do not provide a structural interpretation for shocks driving the VAR dynamics, other than that these shocks are of domestic or external origin. No further structural identification – necessarily arbitrary to some degree – is required to compute the variance decomposition of interest to us. Nevertheless, our results do help choose between two competing theories of aggregate fluctuations in CHP. According to one, external shocks are an important source of these fluctuations. Theoretical models of CHP and policy rules for CHP will be seriously incomplete if they abstract from external developments. According to the other view, external shocks are of minor importance for understanding the macroeconomic dynamics in transition economies.Footnote 1 We find support for the former view. We estimate that external shocks account for about 20–50% of the short-run variance in aggregate price level in CHP between 1992 and 2004. The long-run estimate is about 60–85%. The short-run estimate for real aggregate output is about 15–20%, whereas the long-run estimate is about 25–50%. Thus, we find that a sizable fraction of the variation in real aggregate output and aggregate price level in CHP can be attributed to external shocks, especially so for aggregate price level. The recent literature on business cycles in emerging markets emphasises the importance of external interest rate shocks (Neumeyer and Perri, 2004; Uribe and Yue, 2003).Footnote 2 In the second step, we orthogonalise our external shocks in order to investigate to what extent interest rate shocks originating in the euroarea (in Germany) can account for the spillovers to CHP from the rest of the world. We find that euroarea interest rate shocks can account for a sizable fraction of the spillovers. Euroarea interest rate shocks account for more than one-third of the joint effects of external shocks on real aggregate output in CHP. Euroarea interest rate shocks account for about 50% of the joint effects of external shocks on aggregate price level in the Czech Republic and for more than two-thirds in Hungary and Poland. The estimated effects of euroarea interest rate shocks on real aggregate output and aggregate price level in Germany are consistent with interpreting them as euroarea monetary policy shocks. Remarkably, we find that euroarea interest rate shocks have the same qualitative effects in CHP as in Germany. Real aggregate output and aggregate price level in CHP show the same pattern of gradual decline after a positive euroarea interest rate shock as real aggregate output and aggregate price level in Germany. Our conclusions are in line with what other authors have found for small open economies in the developed world and for emerging markets outside of Europe. Cushman and Zha (1997) study Canada using world commodity prices and key macro-economic variables in the US to measure external shocks. Cushman and Zha find that a sizable fraction of about 50–75% of the variance in real aggregate output in Canada is attributable to external shocks. Del Negro and Obiols-Hums (2001) study Mexico likewise using world commodity prices and key macroeconomic variables in the United States as measures of external shocks. The estimates of Del Negro and Obiols-Hums attribute about 75–85% of the variance in real aggregate output and in aggregate price level in Mexico between 1976 and 1994 to external shocks. Both papers, like us, use VAR models with multiple external variables and the GCP restriction. Uribe and Yue (2003) estimate that US interest rate shocks explain as much as 20% of movements in aggregate activity in emerging markets in Latin America and Asia. We also make contact with the recent macroeconometric literature on transition economies. In the most closely related paper, Korhonen (2003) estimates bivariate VARs for real aggregate output in a number of transition economies and an index of real output in the euroarea. His variance decomposition suggests that about 10–15% of the variance in real aggregate output in CHP is attributable to external shocks. Our estimate is larger, possibly because we use more than a single variable to measure external shocks. Another difference between Korhonen (2003) and this paper is that we test the GCP restriction and use it to justify the variance decomposition.Footnote 3 A number of recent papers focus on the related question whether macroeconomic fluctuations in Central and Eastern Europe are correlated with the fluctuations in Western Europe. Fidrmuc (2004) reports correlations between detrended aggregate real output in Germany and in a number of transition economies. Fidrmuc and Korhonen (2003) formulate structural VAR models for real aggregate output growth and inflation in several transition economies, identifying aggregate supply and demand shocks (in the spirit of Blanchard and Quah, 1989). Fidrmuc and Korhonen then study the correlation of East European shocks with the euroarea shocks, obtained analogously. Dibooglu and Kutan (2001) similarly use the Blanchard–Quah identification to study the sources of real exchange rate movements in transition economies. The difference between our study and the work of Fidrmuc and Korhonen (2003) and Dibooglu and Kutan (2001) is that these authors rely on the Blanchard–Quah identification that is stronger than the GCP restriction and the orthogonalisation that we use. The Blanchard–Quah identification has been criticised in the literature (see Faust and Leeper (1997) and Cooley and Dwyer (1998)). Furthermore, the GCP restriction is easily testable and our results turn out to not depend on the orthogonalisation that we use. One can view both approaches as complementary. Dibooglu and Kutan (2005) and Golinelli and Rovelli (2005) present estimated theoretical models of the same transition economies that we study. Laxton and Pesenti (2003) calibrate an open economy equilibrium model using data from the Czech Republic. None of these papers, however, decomposes the sources of aggregate fluctuations in CHP by origin. Furthermore, the theoretical models that these papers employ naturally make much stronger assumptions than our VAR models. Again, one can view both approaches as complementary.Footnote 4 The paper proceeds as follows. The following section presents the econometric model. The succeeding section discusses the results. The final section concludes and discusses implications of the results for theoretical modelling and policy. In Appendix A, we list several stylized facts about CHP relevant for the analysis. Appendix B provides details of the data. In Appendix C, we discuss inference on parameters of the model.

To tackle this management challenge, many oil-producing countries are setting up oil funds. In light of experience, there is a need to ask a fundamental question: under what circumstances can such funds become part of a policy solution – rather than ending up as a part of the problem? The literature on resource-rich economies supports the view that oil and gas revenues can pose problems for economic management. In a range of cases, economic performance appears to suffer rather than benefit from the impact of natural resources endowment (Gylfason and Zoega, 2003; Paldam, 1997). The international community, including international financial organisations, have become growingly concerned about the effectiveness with which natural resource revenues are used, and notably how they can help foster long run economic and social development. The latter fits into the wider topic of the political economy of resource-driven growth. At the present time there is a growing literature on the concept that natural resource endowment is an economic curse rather than a blessing (Auty and Mikesell, 1998; Auty and de Soysa, 2006; Gylfason, 2001; Kalyuzhnova and Kaser, 2006; Sachs and Warner, 2001, etc). In this paper we are making an initial assumption that for Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan their resource endowment is a potential blessing to overcome transition disruptions. However, the lesson of experience in other countries is that realizing this promise – and avoiding the risk that natural resources become a ‘curse’ – is crucially dependent on policies, and in particular on transparency. Oil funds, we will argue, can contribute by smoothing some of the instability that may arise from energy price fluctuations; and transparent rules of operation can also avoid many of the adverse incentives that have plagued some resource-rich countries. Of course, the optimal design and practical implementation of these instruments of hydrocarbon revenue management in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan remain to be seen in the years ahead. This paper analyses one of the possible instruments of hydrocarbon revenue management – oil funds. Such funds have become fashionable in the wake of recent high and volatile oil prices, and with new discoveries of hydrocarbon deposits. In recent years, many countries either established oil funds or are considering doing so. These funds have different titles, goals and rules, but they share the underlying objective of helping governments deal with the problems created by large revenues from the energy sector. The core question to be addressed is whether oil funds, generically, are panacea for the so called ‘paradox of plenty’ – or whether they are effective only in circumstances that are in any case particularly benign. The oil funds may serve as a form of ‘commitment mechanism’, thus substituting for the IMF commitment mechanism. The paper suggests that the key requirements for success with such funds lie in governance issues. The paper is divided into three main sections. The first reviews the conceptual framework relevant to natural resource funds – taking into account the broad context of macroeconomic and energy policies, in a setting oil price uncertainty. The second section turns to institutional issues – including management costs and problems of organisational design. This section highlights the critical role of governance in three respects: defining transparently the goals of each fund; communicating these goals to build a constituency of public support; and ensuring the efficient and transparent management of the fund on an ongoing basis. The third section of the paper analyses the evolution of two oil funds, the State Oil Fund of the Azerbaijani Republic (SOFAZ) and the National Fund for the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK). It highlights the main principles that govern the operation of these funds, and reviews managerial steps that have been taken so far as a consequence of the policy process in these countries. It explores core governance issues, and so doing probes the question whether, in the Azeri case, the typical goals of an oil fund are appropriate at this stage of developments. A final section of the paper offers brief conclusions – drawing these threads together, and identifying future priorities for research.",28

We examine the environmental behaviour of industrial firms approximately 8 years after this collapse. The main aim of the paper is to understand the economic and social transition factors that spurred environmental management systems (EMSs) that are believed to have contributed to the generally positive environmental changes that have been observed in the region. Because the transitions in CEE countries have been so large and dramatic, understanding what factors spur adoption of EMSs could yield important lessons for other countries, many of which are undergoing some degree of transition away from reliance on governments to allocate economic resources. Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia are examined in this paper. In all these countries, the transitions began during 1989–1991 and in 1998, which is when our data were collected, all were associate members of the European Union (EU). Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia were admitted to the EU in 2004 and the remaining two countries are associate members. We particularly look at the effects of privatisation, export orientation, public pressure and environmental regulation on environmental behaviour in industrial firms that are likely to have serious pollution problems. EAP Task Force (1998) notes that nonferrous metallurgy, iron and steel, pulp and paper and chemicals may have particularly dramatic effects on human health. We focus on enterprises in these sectors, as well as energy and mining firms. The following section reviews the relevant literature on the relationship between the transitions to market economies and environmental outcomes. The section also reviews the literature on adoption of EMSs. The further section discusses the data and empirical approach. The penultimate section presents the results and the last section concludes.",9

Our study analyses firm-level environmental performance, as measured by the level of air pollutants emitted by large stationary sources, in the transition economy of the Czech Republic during the years 1993–1998. In particular, our study assesses whether firms face economies and/or diseconomies of scale with respect to pollution control by evaluating the effects of production on emission levels. As important, this paper assesses whether certain sectors face different scales of production – economy or diseconomy – than other sectors. Specifically, this paper assesses whether the effects of production on emissions differ across various sectors. This close examination of production scale effects, including their variation across sectors, stands in stark contrast to previous studies. Certainly, no study of a transition economy scrutinises the effects of production and sector. This omission extends to studies of any economy. While previous studies include production and sector as control variables in their empirical analysis (Khanna and Damon, 1999; Magat and Viscusi, 1990; Foulon et al., 2002; Earnhart and Lizal, 2006), these studies fail to scrutinise the important relationship between pollution, production, and sector. This paper explores the relationship between pollution and production within the following format. The following section develops a simple framework for understanding production scale effects. Next section describes the database on firm-level air pollutant emissions and production. Next one estimates and interprets the effects of production scale and sectoral differences on air pollutant emissions. The final section concludes.",7

Voluntary regulation, by contrast, provides incentives – but not mandates – for pollution control. In industrialised countries, such regulation has become quite popular over the past two decades (OECD, 1999, 2003). Environmental authorities in developing countries, particularly those in Latin America, have also embraced voluntary regulation and are rapidly putting new programmes in place. For example, in Colombia, over 50 voluntary agreements (VAs) between environmental authorities and industrial associations were signed between 1995 and 2003 (Lara, 2003). And in Mexico, ten such agreements involving over 600 firms were signed during the 1990s (Hanks, 2002). Although voluntary environmental programmes in industrialised countries and those in developing countries share many features, their objectives are generally different. In industrialised countries, regulators typically use voluntary programmes to encourage firms to overcomply with mandatory regulations, or to cut emissions of pollutants for which mandatory regulations do not exist. In developing countries, by contrast, regulators generally use them to help remedy rampant non-compliance with mandatory regulation (Blackman and Sisto, in press). The broad reason for widespread non-compliance with mandatory regulation in developing countries is well known: infrastructure needed to enforce regulations is weak or altogether absent at both the federal and local levels. For example, federal authorities are usually responsible for developing and promulgating written environmental regulation. However, in many cases, such regulation is incomplete, confused, or inappropriate. Local authorities are typically responsible for monitoring and enforcing written regulations. However, in most developing countries, regulatory power is concentrated at the national level and local institutions are relatively weak. In addition, local regulators are often strongly influenced by private-sector interest groups and lack the political will for strict enforcement (World Bank, 1999; Willis et al., 1999; Blackman and Sisto, in press). The voluntary initiatives that regulators in developing countries are using to try to overcome these constraints include VAs negotiated between environmental regulators and industry associations in specific polluting sectors and/or geographic areas (also known as ‘negotiated environmental agreements’ and ‘voluntary environmental agreements’) as well as public programmes with pre-established rules to which individual firms or facilities are invited to participate. In this paper, we focus on the former type of voluntary regulation. VAs in developing countries often entail four types of commitments. First, a group of industrial firms agrees to make the investments needed to comply with existing mandatory regulations within a certain time period. Second, as quid pro quo, environmental authorities agree not to sanction the firms for non-compliance during this grace period. Third, regulatory authorities agree to make investments needed to eliminate barriers to the enforcement of mandatory regulations, for example, by promulgating missing regulations. Finally, environmental authorities promise to subsidise the firm's investment in pollution control. Such VAs are usually widely publicised at the local level. 
Blackman and Sisto (in press) present a detailed description and analysis of four consecutive high-profile VAs between regulators and trade associations representing the leather tanning industry in León, Guanajuato, Mexico's leather goods capital, and a notorious environmental hotspot. In each of these VAs, tanners agreed that within 2–4 years, they would cut emissions of organic and inorganic water pollutants by building in-house industrial wastewater treatment facilities, implementing pollution prevention measures, and, in some cases, relocating to industrial parks where common effluent treatment plants could be built. In addition, the tanners promised to improve their handling and disposal of solid and hazardous tanning wastes. As quid pro quo, local environmental authorities agreed not to fine tanners for violating mandatory emissions standards during a 2- to 4-year grace period. Federal and local regulators also agreed to fix longstanding problems with mandatory environmental regulations including a complete lack of rules governing wastewater discharges into local sewers – a responsibility of local regulators – and confused and inconsistent rules governing the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous tanning wastes – a federal responsibility. Finally, under pressure from federal regulators, local environmental authorities agreed to build a municipal wastewater treatment plant, to establish zoning laws for tanneries, and to finance a tannery pollution control education and research centre. All four tannery VAs were signed by top federal environmental authorities and were well publicised. (For a descriptions of other VAs in developing and transition countries, see Lara, 2003; Dvorák et al., 2002; Freitas and Gereluk, 2002; Hanks, 2002; Koehler, 2002.) Unfortunately, the track record of VAs in developing countries is decidedly mixed. Some appear to have performed as advertised. For example, according to Freitas and Gereluk (2002), a Brazilian nation-wide VA spurred significant reductions in benzene emissions in the metal and petrochemical industries. However, other VAs clearly have not performed well. For example, the aforementioned tannery VAs ultimately were mostly ignored by the signatories (Blackman and Sisto, in press). Similarly, Lara (2003) finds that compliance with a sample of 13 Colombian VAs was negligible. Such negative evaluations beg the question of whether VAs are likely to be an appropriate regulatory instrument for developing countries. The theoretical economics literature on VAs – which, to our knowledge, focuses exclusively on VAs industrialised country settings – does not provide much reason for optimism (for reviews of this literature, see Lyon and Maxwell, 2002; Khanna, 2001). This literature argues that industry associations participate in and comply with VAs in order to preclude more stringent mandatory regulation (eg, Alberini and Segerson, 2002; Maxwell et al., 2000; Segerson and Miceli, 1998). For example, in Segerson and Miceli (1998), a ‘background legislative threat’ motivates industry to negotiate a VA. Moreover, the stronger this threat, the more pollution abatement the VA generates. In developing countries with weak regulatory capacity, however, threats of strict mandatory regulation are not credible. Hence, the existing theoretical literature seems to imply that VAs are not likely to be effective in developing countries with limited regulatory capacity. In this paper, we argue that existing theoretical models of VAs lack the dynamic structure needed to understand the role VAs play in developing countries. We develop a game-theoretic model in which investment in abatement may occur in stages, and we use it to examine the effect of VAs on investment in abatement and in regulatory infrastructure when local and federal regulatory capacity is weak. We find that VAs hold promise for increasing both types of investment and enhancing welfare in precisely those situations where the regulatory capacity is weak. The intuition for this result is as follows. A VA in our model provides a ‘grace period’ during which no penalties are applied to the industry for failure to comply, but after which more stringent penalties may be applied. A VA thus changes the industry's dynamic investment pattern, reducing short-term investment, but increasing long-term investment. We find that when the probability of effective mandatory regulation is low and the VA allows for a significant increase in penalties for non-compliance, the latter effect outweighs the former, and the VA can enhance welfare. The analytics used to derive our results are technical and lengthy. In this article, we focus mainly on presenting the results along with the intuition that underpins them. Readers interested in the technical details are referred to Blackman et al. (2006a). The remainder of the article is structured as follows. The next section outlines our analytical model, including the basic assumptions, the timing of the regulators’ and polluter's decisions, the notation, and the agents’ payoff functions. The third section presents equilibrium results for the status quo (absent a VA). The fourth section presents equilibrium results in the case of a VA. The fifth section compares welfare from the status quo and VA equilibria. The last section presents a summary and conclusions.",16

It is argued that the former (the collapse of output during transition) can be best explained as adverse supply shock caused mostly by a change in relative prices after their deregulation due to distortions in industrial structure and trade patterns accumulated during the period of central planning, and by the collapse of state institutions during transition period, while the speed of liberalisation had an adverse effect on performance, if any. In contrast, the latter process (recovery) should be treated as a normal growth process and could be modelled with the tools of conventional growth theory: it could be expected that in the sufficiently long run it would be possible to capitalise on liberalisation due to the increase in factors efficiency that would lead to better performance. Based on previous literature (see Popov, 2000 for a review), the following framework for explaining the collapse of output during transformational recession is accepted. First, transformational recession was caused by the adverse supply shock that resulted from deregulation of prices and change in relative price ratios that created the need for reallocation of resources due to distortions in the industrial structure and external trade patterns that existed before transition. Second, by another adverse supply shock associated with the collapse of state institutions (understood as the ability of the state to enforce its rules and regulations), which occurred in the late 1980s to early 1990s and which resulted in chaotic transformation through crisis management instead of organised and manageable transition. And third, by poor economic policies, which basically consisted of macroeconomic mismanagement, no matter whether the pursued reforms were gradual or radical. Fast speed of reform per se (shock versus gradual transition) at the initial stage of transition probably aggravated the reduction of output because immediate deregulation of prices caused the need for restructuring (reallocation of labour and capital) that exceeded the investment potential of the economy. In the first approximation, economic recession that occurred during transition was associated with the need to reallocate resources in order to correct the industrial structure inherited from centrally planned economy (CPE). These distortions include overmilitarisation and overindustrialisation (resulting in the underdevelopment of the service sector), perverted trade flows among former Soviet republics and Comecon countries, excessively large size and poor specialisation of industrial enterprises and agricultural farms (lack of small enterprises and farms). In most cases, these distortions were more pronounced in former Soviet Union countries (FSU) than in Eastern Europe (EE), not to speak about China and Vietnam – the larger the distortions, the greater was the reduction of output. Transformational recession, to put in economic terms, was caused by adverse supply shock similar to the one experienced by Western countries after the oil price hikes in 1973 and 1979, and similar to post-war recessions caused by conversion of the defence industries. The additional reason for the extreme depth and length of the transformational recession was associated with the institutional collapse – here differences between EE countries and FSU are striking. The efficiency of state institutions, understood as the ability of the state to enforce its own rules and regulations, resulted in the inability of the state to perform its traditional functions – to collect taxes and to constrain the shadow economy, to ensure property and contract rights and law and order in general (crime rates and corruption increased dramatically during transition as compared to the communist past). Naturally, poor ability to enforce rules and regulations did not create business climate conducive to growth and resulted in the increased costs for companies. It is precisely this strong institutional framework that should be held responsible for both – for the success of gradual reforms in China and shock therapy in Vietnam, where strong authoritarian regimes were preserved and CPE institutions were not dismantled before new market institutions were created; and for the relative success of radical reforms in EE countries, especially in Central European countries, where strong democratic regimes and new market institutions emerged quickly. And it is precisely the collapse of strong state institutions that started in the USSR in the late 1980s and continued in the successor states in the 1990s that explains the extreme length, if not the extreme depth of the FSU transformational recession. What lead to the institutional collapse and could it have been prevented? Using the terminology of political science, it is appropriate to distinguish between strong authoritarian regimes (China and Vietnam and to an extent – Belarus and Uzbekistan), strong democratic regimes (Central European countries) and weak democratic regimes (most FSU and Balkan states). The former two are politically liberal or liberalising, that is, protect individual rights, including those of property and contracts, and create a framework of law and administration, while the latter regimes, although democratic, are politically not so liberal since they lack strong institutions and the ability to enforce law and order (Zakaria, 1997). This gives rise to the phenomenon of ‘illiberal democracies’ – countries, where competitive elections are introduced before the rule of law is established. While European countries in the 19th century and East Asian countries recently moved from first establishing the rule of law to gradually introducing democratic elections (Hong Kong is the most obvious example of the rule of law without democracy), in Latin America, Africa and now in CIS countries democratic political systems were introduced in societies without the firm rule of law. Authoritarian regimes (including communist), while gradually building property rights and institutions, were filling the vacuum in the rule of law via authoritarian means. After democratisation occurred and illiberal democracies emerged, they found themselves deprived of old authoritarian instruments to ensure law and order, but without the newly developed democratic mechanisms needed to guarantee property rights, contracts and law and order in general. No surprise, this had a devastating impact on investment climate and output. There is a clear relationship between the ratio of rule of law index on the eve of transition to democratisation index, on the one hand, and economic performance during transition, on the other. To put it differently, democratisation without strong rule of law, whether one likes it or not, usually leads to the collapse of output. There is a price to pay for early democratisation, that is, introduction of competitive elections of government under the conditions when the major liberal rights (personal freedom and safety, property, contracts, fair trial in court, etc.) are not well established. Finally, performance was of course affected by economic policy. Given the weak institutional capacity of the state, that is, its poor ability to enforce its own regulations, economic policies could hardly be ‘good’. Weak state institutions usually imply populist macroeconomic policies (budget deficits resulting in high indebtedness and/or inflation, overvalued exchange rates), which have devastating impact on output. On the other hand, strong institutional capacity does not lead automatically to responsible economic policies. Examples range from the USSR before it collapsed (periodic outburst of open or hidden inflation) to such post Soviet states as Uzbekistan and Belarus, which seem to have stronger institutional potential than other FSU states, but do not demonstrate higher macroeconomic stability. Regressions tracing the impact of all mentioned factors are reported in Table 1. If the rule of law and democracy indices (see data section for definitions) are included into the basic regression equation, they have predicted signs (positive impact of the rule of law and negative impact of democracy) and are statistically significant (equation 1), which is consistent with the results obtained for larger sample of countries. The best explanatory power, however, is exhibited by the index that is computed as the ratio of the rule of law index to democracy index: 83% of all variations in output can be explained by only three factors – pre-transition distortions, inflation and rule-of-law-to-democracy index (Table 1, equation 2). If liberalisation variable is added, it turns out to be statistically insignificant and does not improve the goodness of fit (equation 3). At the same time, the ratio of the rule of law to democracy index and the decline in government revenues are not substitutes, but rather complement each other in characterising the process of the institutional decay. These two variables are not correlated and improve the goodness of fit, when included together in the same regression: R2 increases to 91% (equation 5) – better result than in regressions with either one of these variables. The liberalisation index, when added to the same equation, only deteriorates the goodness of fit, is not statistically significant, and has the ‘wrong’ sign. To test the robustness of the results, another year for the end of the transformational recession was chosen – 1998, so the period considered was 1989–1998 (by the end of 1998, the absolute trough was reached in 24 countries out of 26 that experienced the recession). The adjusted R2 is slightly lower, but the statistical significance of coefficients remains high (with the exception of the initial GDP per capita). The best equation is shown below:   (N=28, adjusted R2=82%, t-statistics in brackets, all variables are shown in the same order as in equation 7 from Table 1 (liberalisation variable is omitted)). Once again, if liberalisation variable is introduced in this equation, it turns out to be insignificant. This latter conclusion still remains most controversial – the emerging consensus today, if any, seems to be that performance is largely determined by the institutional capacity (the factor that was overlooked in the earlier debates), but economic liberalisation still matters a great deal (De Melo et al., 1997; Havrylyshyn and van Rooden, 2003). The theoretical argument in favour of the positive impact of liberalisation on performance is quite strong: market economy should be more efficient than the CPE, so there is a ‘marketisation dividend’ to be reaped, and the faster economic liberalisation occurs, the better should be the performance. However, there are a number of obvious facts that do not fit into the scheme. First, China – the only country that carried out classical gradual transition (with slow deregulation of prices – dual-track price system) outperformed impressively all other transition economies, and of course Chinese example is too important to ignore. Second, the comparison of Vietnam and China – two countries that shared a lot of similarities in initial conditions and achieved basically the same results (immediate growth of output without transformational recession), despite different reform strategies. While Chinese reforms are a classical example of gradualism, Vietnamese reformers introduced Polish-style shock therapy treatment (instant deregulation of most prices and introduction of convertibility of dong) even before Poland did, in 1989, and still managed to avoid the reduction of output.Footnote 1 Third, differing performance of the FSU states. The champions of liberalisation and stabilisation in the region were definitely Baltic states (cumulative liberalisation index by 1995 – 2.4–2.9), whereas Uzbekistan (with the same index of 1.1) is commonly perceived to be one of the worst procrastinators. But in Uzbekistan, the reduction of output in 1990–1995 totalled only 18% and the economy started to grow again in 1996, while in the Baltics output fell in the early 1990s by 36%–60% and even in 1996, 2 years after the bottom of the recession was reached, was still 31%–58% below the pre-recession maximum. In 2004–2005, the list of countries that exceeded the pre-recession level of output in 1989 looked very much like a list of procrastinators in terms of economic liberalisation and non-democratic regimes in terms of political liberalisation: in addition to five central European countries and Estonia, there were also Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Belarus and Kazakhstan (see Figures 1 and 2),Footnote 2 not to speak about China and Vietnam. Thus, the case for gradual, Chinese-type reforms remains very strong and is very much favoured by many academics and policy makers – see Kolodko (2000) for an extensive summary of the debate.

The Washington Consensus departs from and rejects what used to be ‘orthodoxy’ in economic development: import substitution, nationalization, planning, and use of the inflation tax to raise savings. Structural adjustment in Latin America had the goal to substitute a traditional statist economic system to a market-based economic system (Williamson, 1990a, p. 402). In spite of this, it has been alleged that the Washington Consensus has been accepted as common wisdom on policies for economic development. The Washington Consensus was applied to structural crisis in other countries, including the transition economies (Cross and Strachan, 2001, p. 182; Kolodko, 1999, p. 4–5). The term, Washington Consensus, has been used as a synonym for what is often referred to as ‘neoliberalism’ by those who have criticized the program. At the same time that ‘Latin America was engaged in its hesitant, controversial, patchy, incomplete, but nonetheless rather widespread attempt to move from the statism to a market economy’ (Williamson, 1990c, p. 3), another debate was taking place – which is relevant for our discussion – with regard to Russia, the former republics of the Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe. The debate was about of a more radical process of transition from centrally administered socialism towards market capitalist relations. The transition from a centrally administered to a market based economy in these countries was characterized by a substantial reduction in output, increased unemployment, hyperinflation, corruption and illegal activities. It is alleged and being established as common knowledge that these results were due to the implementation of the orthodox policies inspired by the Washington Consensus. These policies were implemented in the form of Shock Therapy under the principle of ‘one-size-fits-all’ (Cross and Strachan, 2001, p. 187; Kolodko, 1999, p. 4, 22; Stiglitz, 2002, p. 141). The purpose of the paper is to factually determine whether there is any association between the Shock Therapy and the Washington Consensus and hence demystify the relationship between the two strategies for economic development. It is important to distinguish between the two policy prescriptions the Washington Consensus and Shock Therapy, as the debate on development and transition continues to take place, which would influence the future potential application of both policy prescriptions. The two policy prescriptions have not lost their significance as supporters of either or both strategies continue to argue for their relevance for economic development and transition. Williamson (2003a) continues to insist for the relevance of the Washington Consensus and the ‘completion of first generation of reforms’. While at the same time an assessment is taking place on whether Shock Therapy was successful in transition economies and in actual fact whether it was implemented as prescribed: ‘Most of the bad things that happened [in Russia]–such as the massive theft of state assets under the rubric of privatization–were directly contrary to the advice that I gave and to the principles of honesty and equity that I hold dear’ (Sachs, 2005, p. 147). There has been a lot of confusion with regard to what Washington Consensus actually means. This is because the term has evolved, via the natural process of debate, discussion, criticism and misinterpretation, to denote a different set of policies than originally subscribed. As such, I distinguish between two different versions of the Washington Consensus, the Washington Consensus proper to denote the original set of policies initiated by the father of the term and the Washington Consensus as a neoliberal manifesto to represent the policies subscribed with the term ‘neoliberalism’ by its critics. The alternative versions are presented in a schematic form in Table 1. It is demonstrated that, in actual fact, the Shock Therapy process implemented in transition economies had some common elements with the Washington Consensus proper and some common elements with the Washington Consensus as a neoliberal manifesto. With respect to the remaining elements of the reform process, we can identify important discrepancies in both versions. Hence, the Shock Therapy process in transition economies was not identical to any particular version of the Washington Consensus. The underlying reason for these discrepancies between both versions of the Washington Consensus and Shock Therapy – even though it is asserted and/or assumed that there was direct correspondence between them – can be explained in terms of the differing circumstances between transition and Latin American economies. As the situation was different in transition economies comparing to Latin America, therefore, the associated problems were not a component of the Washington Consensus. As a result there were new elements in the reform process that the shock therapy had to confront and provide an immediate solution for which the Washington Consensus could not provide an answer; nevertheless, there was never the intention of the Washington Consensus to provide such an answer. Policy-makers and students of economic development and transition would benefit from this taxonomic testing of the alternative versions of the Washington Consensus in conjunction with the Shock Therapy process, revealing effortlessly the association between them. To my knowledge no such testing has taken place and consequently the misconnection of Shock Therapy with the Washington Consensus has prevailed. The paper is structured in the following way: the second section develops the alternative versions of the Washington Consensus, while the third section develops the Shock Therapy approach implemented in transition economies. The fourth section contrasts the alternative versions of the Washington Consensus with Shock Therapy and the fifth section concludes that Shock Therapy cannot be identified with any version of the Washington Consensus.",8

49,1,Comparative Economic Studies,28 February 2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100161,"Determinants of Employment Growth at MNEs: Evidence from Egypt, India, South Africa and Vietnam",March 2007,Sumon Kumar Bhaumik,Saul Estrin,Klaus E Meyer,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Spillovers, in the form of technology transfer from a multinational enterprise (MNE) to local firms in the host country, are often proposed as an important rationale for establishing policy regimes conducive to foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing countries (Findlay, 1978; Borensztein et al., 1995). Technology transfer remains the cornerstone of the substantial literature on spillovers, though much of the evidence linking presence of MNEs to technological improvement of the local firms is indirect (Meyer, 2004).Footnote 1 Empirical studies have typically examined the link between the extent of foreign ownership in a domestic firm or foreign presence in a sector on the level or change in the multifactor productivity in that sector (eg, Aitken and Harrison, 1999). Evidence favouring a positive relationship have been explained in three ways: (a) demonstration effect of the MNEs' production processes on their local competitors, (b) improvement in the productivity of the firms that are in the supply chains of both the MNEs and the local firms, and (c) migration of labourers from MNEs to local firms either through employment or start-up entrepreneurial ventures. Direct evidence is the strongest in favour of the impact coming from the migration of labourers from MNEs to their local competitors. For example, Hou and Gee (1993) and Tsiang and Wu (1985) have found evidence of technological spillovers from MNEs to local firms in Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. Similarly, Pack (2001) and Katz (1987) report evidence suggesting that local managers of MNEs often leave to start their own businesses, thereby facilitating technology transfer from the MNEs to local companies. This is also consistent with the recent experience of the Indian software industry (Commander, 2003).Footnote 2 The process of spillovers by way of recruitment of MNE personnel by local firms in emerging markets has been modelled theoretically (eg, Kaufman, 1997), and, not surprisingly, these models suggest that the extent of spillovers would depend on the (marginal) costs and benefits associated with the hiring of labourers by both MNEs and local firms. The obvious questions, therefore, are why a MNE should transfer high-quality technology from the parent firm to the developing country subsidiary, and why it should train its labour force efficiently to use this technology. These issues have been addressed in the theoretical literature on spillovers. Fosfuri et al. (2001) show that a MNE would transfer technology to a developing country subsidiary and train the local labourers only if the local firms do not directly compete with the MNE in the product market. Campbell and Vousden (2003) extend this line of argument and use a two-period model to argue that a MNE would limit the number of labourers that are trained in the use of the cutting edge technology, thereby increasing the skilled wage to the point where it is unprofitable for a local firm to employ these skilled labourers. Wang and Blomstrom (1992), however, posit that a MNE would seek to maintain its technological dominance over the local firms not by limiting technology transfers, but by progressively transferring better technology from the parent to the developing country subsidiary, thereby creating a virtuous circle of competition, spillovers and continual technological upgrade of both the MNE subsidiary and the local firms. Systematic studies of the factors that impact on the growth of MNE subsidiaries and their decision to hire labourers, who are the conduit through which technology is transferred from the MNEs to their competitors, are very rare (Bloningen and Tomlin, 2001; Tan and Mahoney, 2005). To our knowledge no such studies exist as yet for emerging markets, so crucial issues for such economies, such as the impact of the policy environment and the institutional arrangements on employment creation, remain unexplored. Further, while there are a large number of studies that explore the determinants of firms' employment growth in general (see, eg, Hart, 2000; Fotopoulos and Louri, 2004), they do not take into consideration the strategic objectives of the firms that can be of paramount importance in the context of foreign direct investment by MNEs into emerging markets. Our contribution is to examine the determinants of employment growth at MNEs, taking into consideration the strategic objectives of these firms, the impact of local conditions, and the companies' experience in those environments. Our analysis is based on a unique data set of 293 MNEs operating in four developing countries: Egypt, India, South Africa and Vietnam. These countries were chosen because they have relatively high levels of foreign direct investment among the cohort of non-Chinese emerging market economies, thereby facilitating the collection of a reasonable number of foreign subsidiaries through random sampling. Moreover, they differ significantly with respect to key independent variable in this study, namely, their policy and institutional environment, as well as their pool of skilled labourers,. We use this cross-country data set to estimate an employment function that links growth of employment at the MNEs to their characteristics, the nature of the parent MNEs control over the local subsidiary, the characteristics of product and factor markets in the local country, and local institutions. Our results suggest that the extent of control that a MNE has over its affiliate, characteristics of the relevant industry in the host country, and institutional and regulatory environments of the host country are important determinants of its employment growth in emerging markets. This is an important finding for policy makers in emerging markets, who may be encouraging FDI to take forms, such as joint ventures, which fail to maximise employment growth and therefore potential spillover benefits. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In the next section we briefly summarise the relevant aspects of the literature on the growth of firms, including employment growth. The data and variables are described in the forthcoming section and the regression specification and results are reported in the penultimate section. Finally concluding remarks are given.",3

But for preschool-aged children, preschool can also contribute importantly to human capital development, especially among poor children (Danzinger and Waldfogel, 2000). By international standards, preschool enrolments were high under socialism, although rates in Central Asia lagged those in other areas (Riazantsev et al., 1992, p. 27). Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, preschool enrolment rates have plummeted in Central Asia (UNICEF, 2003, p. 81). This may leave large numbers of children without preparation necessary to succeed in school and to be included in the region's post-socialist development. To better understand the factors underlying declining preschool enrolments in Central Asia, we examine preschool enrolments in Kyrgyzstan over the period 1993–1998. Kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest countries in Central Asia, and has seen the preschool enrolments fall to the lowest level among Central Asian countries, with the exception of Tajikistan (UNICEF Transmonee, 2005). We evaluate demand- and supply-side explanations for low enrolments, and use data from the Kyrgyzstan Poverty Monitoring Survey to develop a logistic model of preschool enrolment. On the demand side, we examine the impact of households’ need for custodial care, household ability to pay for care, and cultural/social factors (mother's education and ethnic background). This last variable builds on a previous finding in Bulgaria of significant differences in preschool enrolment dynamics across ethnic groups. On the supply side, we consider the impact of preschool availability and quality. Through this model, we hope to broaden understanding of household decisions to invest in preschool, and to assist policy makers in improving preschool attendance as a form of school preparation and early human capital accumulation, especially among poorer households. Current policy recommendations often target access as a key to raising preschool enrolments (eg Henscher and Passingham, 1996). While national-level data currently show excess supply of preschool places, we find that access to a preschool is the most important determinant of enrolment. However, we also find that demand-side factors including the availability of non-working adults to provide home care, household cash income per capita, and social background have a significant impact on enrolment.",14

At the beginning of the transition, several key reforms were implemented to restructure the banking sectors in these countries. A two-tier banking system was introduced, separating the functions of central bank and commercial banks, while privately owned banks were allowed. In spite of these initial reforms, major problems, such as the extent of bad loans, continued to hamper the progress of banking systems in these countries in the 1990s. These problems were resolved in many transition countries with the recapitalisation and the privatisation of banks. Furthermore, the privatisation has allowed the massive entry of foreign banks in these countries. This process of privatisation associated with the foreign involvement is generally considered as having a positive influence on governance and performance of banks (Weill, 2003). Nevertheless, the commonly accepted view is that the current situation of banking sectors in transition countries of CEE lags behind the banking sectors of developed countries of Western Europe (Scholtens, 2000; Riess et al., 2002). Indeed, in spite of the changes, it might be difficult to modify the habits and behaviours inherited from the old regime within such a short period. The reduction of bank underperformance is, however, particularly important for transition countries, for two reasons. First, bank credit is by far the largest source of external finance for companies in these countries (Caviglia et al., 2002). Indeed, the financial markets are underdeveloped in transition countries (Scholtens, 2000), resulting in a high dependence to bank credit for financing. Consequently, investment is particularly sensitive to the changes in banking performance in these countries. Indeed, an improvement of banking performance means a reduction of loan rates, but also a better allocation of financial resources, and therefore an increase in investment that favours growth.Footnote 1 Second, the recent EU membership of several transition countries renders the question of companies' microeconomic performances more pertinent, and therefore also the performance convergence of banks. Indeed, the major point is to know whether these countries may have the normal functioning of a market economy in the next years. It is therefore of utmost interest to assess the performance of banks of transition countries of CEE in comparison to the banks of developed countries of Western Europe.Footnote 2 Indeed, the existence of a gap in bank performance between both categories of banks in favour of Western banks would contribute to slow down the catching-up process of CEE countries. However, in spite of the extensive application of efficiency frontiers in the banking empirical literature, no work to our knowledge has yet estimated an efficiency frontier on a set of banks from Western and CEE countries to allow a comparison of cost efficiency among countries. Indeed, all the former studies investigating bank efficiency in transition countries aim at estimating bank performance for transition countries, without any comparison to Western European countries (Opiela, 2001, and Nikiel and Opiela, 2002, for Poland, Weill, 2001, and Weill, 2003, for the Czech Republic and Poland, Hasan and Merton, 2003, for Hungary, Bonin et al., 2005, for 11 transition countries, and Fries and Taci, 2005, for 15 transition countries). This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature about the comparative performance of CEE and Western banks by estimating cost efficiency on a large sample of banks. We provide new elements on the gap in cost efficiency between both groups of banks to assess the differences in bank performance. To do so, we measure cost efficiency on a sample of 955 banks in 17 European countries (11 EU countries, six EU accession countries) by using the stochastic frontier approach (SFA). This work raises four fundamental questions. Q1: Do CEE banks have lower efficiency levels than Western banks in Europe? Evidence is needed to assess the level of backwardness in performance of CEE banks: does it exist? And if the answer is affirmative, how far are CEE banks from Western banks? To provide answers, we first measure cost performance with standard accounting ratios, before comparing cost efficiency scores. It then allows us to provide concrete elements on the relative cost performance of CEE and Western banks. Our conclusion is then that CEE banks have a significantly lower efficiency than Western banks. Q2: How does cost efficiency of CEE banks evolve in the late 1990s? Even if there exists an efficiency gap, it is important to know if the performance of CEE banks is getting closer to the Western banks' level. Indeed, a positive trend on this issue is particularly relevant to evaluate the microeconomic implications of EU membership for transition countries. We answer this question by measuring cost efficiency of banks for each year of the period 1996–2000. Q3: Is the efficiency gap between both groups of banks the result of economic environment? Indeed, the lower bank efficiency in CEE countries in comparison to Western countries may come from a less favourable economic environment for CEE banks. For instance, CEE countries have lower levels of per capita income and intermediation ratioFootnote 3 than Western countries that make harder the work of banks. Furthermore, Dietsch and Lozano-Vivas (2000) have among others shown that the environment may explain the differences in bank efficiency between countries. It is therefore of utmost interest to assess the role of environment in the efficiency gap. We proceed to this analysis by estimating a cost frontier that includes environmental variables. Q4: Is the efficiency gap between the two groups a result of differences in risk aversion? The efficiency gap might also come from differences in risk preferences (Hughes and Mester, 1993; Mester, 1996). The degree of risk aversion has an impact on cost efficiency: a risk-averse bank may fund its loans with a higher ratio of equity to deposits than a risk-neutral bank. Thus, by not choosing the cost-minimising level of equity, the risk-averse bank may appear less efficient than the risk neutral one. This issue is particularly relevant here, as there might exist a higher degree of risk aversion in CEE countries, because of the recent history with high volumes of bad loans, but also of the lack of expertise in risk assessment (Riess et al., 2002; Caviglia et al., 2002). Indeed, if CEE banks' managers are more risk-averse than Western banks' managers, their performance would be underestimated if equity is not controlled in the cost efficiency model. To take this aspect into account, we include the level of equity in the estimation of the cost function model to control for risk preferences, following Mester (1996). Consequently, we provide an analysis of the comparison in efficiency between CEE and Western banks. The structure of the paper is as follows. First section provides a first glance on the comparative performance of CEE and Western banks with standard cost ratios. Next section outlines the methodology used for the cost efficiency measures. Next one describes the data and variables. Last section develops the empirical results, answering each question in the order they have been presented. Finally, we provide some concluding remarks.",20

For example, a major area of research focuses on measuring gender wage differentials, what is driving them and which policies may help to reduce them.Footnote 1 In that spirit, this paper focuses on gender differences in unemployment and what is driving them in order to be able to pinpoint where policy intervention might be needed. More specifically, we examine the relative changes in men's versus women's unemployment rates and labour market flows in transition economies during the early period of the transition, when most of the changes in the labour market were occurring.Footnote 2 We first provide an original analysis of labour market flows for the Czech Republic, where the unemployment rates for women were consistently higher than the rates for men during the first decade of the transition. We then use our findings and those from other studies to provide the first systematic flow analysis of the gender unemployment gap in the post-communist economies. Differences in any two groups’ unemployment rates are obviously a result of differences in the frequency of job loss. However, unemployment rates can also differ because one group faces greater difficulties in finding jobs or because these individuals move into and out of the labour force more frequently. Hence, a useful way to further our understanding of gender differences in unemployment rates is to analyse the differences between male and female transition probabilities (or flows) between any two of the principal labour market states: employment (E), unemployment (U), and out-of-the labour force (O).Footnote 3 This enables us to pinpoint the driving forces behind the higher of the two unemployment rates: is it due to a lower probability of finding a job, a higher probability of leaving a job, or because women are more likely than men to enter unemployment from out-of-the labour force and less likely to leave unemployment for out-of-the labour force? In this paper, we use quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS) data during the 1993–1996 period to provide the first calculations of these six flows for men and women by marital status, for the Czech Republic. In addition to calculating these flows, we carry out a microeconomic analysis of the determinants of women's and men's flows across labour market states in the Czech Republic. We estimate multinomial logit models to test whether or not single men and women continue to have significantly different transition probabilities than married men and women, once we control for other factors, such as age, education, location of residence and seasonal and cyclical factors. In the process we also identify which of these other factors affect the probability of leaving (or staying in) unemployment, employment or out-of-the labour force. In addition to its intrinsic value, knowledge of the magnitude of these flows is important for designing policies to reduce the incidence or duration of unemployment of different demographic groups. The literature estimating and analysing transition probabilities across these labour market states in post-communist economies is substantial.Footnote 4 However, there is very little research analysing differences in men and women's unemployment rates in these economies.Footnote 5 This paper also contributes to the literature by using the estimated flows by gender from this and three other studies of transition economies to establish if there is a systematic pattern in the determinants of gender differences in the early part of transition.",9

Debt financing has the potential to achieve intergenerational fairness by spreading the costs of building local infrastructure over the entire period during which benefits from this investment occur. At the same time, subnational borrowing can be abused to shift the costs of local public services to future generations or other jurisdictions in excess of what would be justified by possible spillover of benefits. The common solution to this dilemma is to allow subnational borrowing subject to certain safeguards such as borrowing limits and explicit hierarchical authorisation for issuing debt. In countries where subnational governments are free from legislative or regulatory borrowing constraints by higher-level governments, they arguably face borrowing constraints imposed by lenders (Lane, 1993). Capital markets can discipline governments by charging a higher risk premium as the volume of outstanding debt (explicit borrowing and payables) becomes too large relative to the expected revenue stream (Capeci, 1994). At some level of indebtedness the borrower will not be offered further credit at any interest rate. The economic literature identifies a number of general conditions for market-based fiscal discipline to work, the most critical of which is no expectations of a bailout. The latter is in part determined by intergovernmental arrangements that delineate competences and taxing powers between the levels of government. Market-based discipline argument takes on new twists in transitional countries. On the one hand, at the early stages of transition a naïve faith in the laissez-faire approach favoured market-based fiscal discipline in those countries. This trend was reinforced with the political drive for subnational autonomy, which among other things included borrowing powers. Therefore, many transitional countries have allowed subnational borrowing under very liberal regulations. On the other hand, the very conditions that are crucial for market-based fiscal discipline to work are often lacking in those countries. Thus, financial markets are often underdeveloped and lack liquidity. In addition, the institutions of local governance are immature and thus might not be conducive to fiscal policies responsive to rising borrowing costs. For developed economies, empirical studies have documented market-based discipline in the form of positive relationship between the level of governments' indebtedness and their cost of borrowing (Bayoumi et al., 1995; Poterba and Rueben, 2001, for US state bonds; Capeci, 1994, for New Jersey municipal bonds). Although, the effectiveness of market-based fiscal discipline is particularly relevant for transitional economies as explained above, so far it has not been studied in the context of transition. Our study is the first to examine the performance of this market mechanism under the evolving institutions of decentralised governance in a transitional country. There are conjectures that market-based fiscal discipline might fail in the context of transition similar to the remarkable failure of coupon privatisation under the poor institutions of corporate governance in transitional economies. The major challenge to an empirical test of market-based discipline is obtaining a consistent measure of market yields on the credit obligations of different jurisdictions. We have been able to identify one debt instrument that was utilised by a majority of Russian regions under standard conditions. These securities, called agrobonds, were issued by 69 out of a total of 89 regional governments in 1997–1998 to convert their outstanding liabilities to the federal government, who eventually auctioned off these bonds to private investors. We argue that the agrobonds' yield spread over the federal bond yield reflects the creditors' assessment of the risk that the issuer would not be able (or willing) to honor the obligation of servicing its agrobonds. Over the last decade Russia has shifted from a permissive stance on subnational borrowing, which solely relied on market-based discipline, to administrative and rule-based controls on subnational borrowing (Martinez-Vazquez et al., 2006). This study attempts to shed some light on whether tightening of borrowing constraints had been warranted by incomplete decentralisation or whether it only reflects a change of political fashion. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In the next section, we examine the variation in intergovernmental arrangements faced by different regions in Russia. In particular we attempt to identify characteristics of a region that determine availability of a central government bailout. Section 3 reports the empirical evidence on the impact of these characteristics on the formation of risk premia by private lenders. Our conclusions follow.",2

Differences in liberalisation processes, manufacturing bases, administrative reforms and political frameworks manifested themselves as differences in trade structure and comparative advantage. The body of studies assessing the evolution of trade patterns in transition economies includes a number of papers dealing with the newest EU members (Aturupane et al., 1997; Fidrmuc et al., 1999; Kaitila, 1999; Kaitila and Widgren, 2001; Traistaru et al., 2002). They also highlight the glaring absence of similar empirical research on the Russian economy. In the following discussion, we therefore give an examination of the evolution of Russian specialisation over time and identify signature characteristics of Russia's export structure. To this purpose, we use the Aquino and the Grubel–Lloyd (GL) indices to distinguish between inter-industry specialisation and intra-industry trade (IIT) and identify the vertical (VIIT) and horizontal (HIIT) intra-industry trade components adopting a methodology based on the works of Abd-el-Rahman (1991) and Greenaway et al. (1994). A simple econometric estimation of the factor content of trade enables us to establish which components are important in explaining Russian trade flows. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: the following section illustrates the main stylised facts concerning trade specialisation. The next two sections review the main ways of measuring inter- and intra-industry trade and explicates the indices used in the empirical analysis. The penultimate section presents the empirical evidence on the patterns of trade specialisation in Russia and displays the econometric findings for the factor content of the Russian exports.

The difference between actual and potential GDP yields the aggregate output gap, but the concept of potential level and gap or cyclical position can be extended to any macroeconomic variable. For instance, the unemployment rate fluctuates around an equilibrium level, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). The cyclical adjustment of the budget balance also represents an application of this idea by attempting to remove the cyclical effects from budget revenues and expenditures in order to estimate the cyclically adjusted budget balance (CAB). Formally, CAB equals the budget balance minus the cyclical component. Although economists generally agree on the intuitive concept of the cyclical component, there is less consensus on how to measure it, given that it is unobservable. Of the various econometric techniques proposed to solve this problem, two have emerged as the most widely used: the aggregated approach, advocated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Commission (EC), and the unconstrained disaggregated approach, used by the European Central Bank (ECB). While several studies discuss the problems of the CAB from the point of view of fiscal issues in great detail, for instance see Van den Noord (2000) or Chalk (2002), they do not identify the potential problems arising from the estimation of output gaps. Neither the aggregate nor the ECB-type disaggregated approach has been tested to establish whether they meet the economic requirements, such as the usage of appropriate macroeconomic variable and theory, that are indispensable in order to obtain relevant and accurate gap estimations. The unobservable nature of cyclical component requires a special approach to evaluate and compare the different methods. Since the true value of the output gap is unknown, the simple concepts of econometric error or bias are not applicable. Therefore, the estimations of different methods should be ranked by the validity of their theoretical foundation and information they require. Consequently, if there is discrepancy between two estimations, then this discrepancy is considered as bias if one method is superior to the other on the theoretical and/or professional ground. This paper seeks to provide a more thorough assessment of cyclical position estimates. It examines the cyclical position of the US, Japan and 25 EU Member States, and finds that both the aggregated and disaggregated approaches have significant shortcomings. The aggregated approach cannot cope with different shocks, that is, provides the same fiscal indication regardless to the source of economic disturbancy, whereas the unconstrained disaggregated method suffers from systematic bias and fails to exploit theoretical consideration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a methodology that is free of these distortions. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The following section examines the approaches advocated by the above-mentioned international institutions in detail. The next section proposes a new methodology for measuring the cyclical position. Then the succeeding section estimates the compositional effects. The penultimate section shows the importance of the composition effect by means of three case studies of the Finnish, Hungarian and Italian budget balances. Finally, the last section provides some overall conclusions.",2

Agricultural production and farm household income has grown rapidly, due largely to agrarian reforms undertaken by the government. Beginning in 1978, a series of institutional reforms significantly transformed a collectivised planned agricultural sector into something resembling a capitalist structure. The crucial milestones have been the abolition of the communal property base, the introduction of the household contract responsibility system, price and market liberalisation, the revision to the Land Administration Law in 1998, and, most recently, China's admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) (Kedliker, 1992; Zweig, 1997; Oi, 1999; Whiting, 2001; Unger, 2002). The farm household has become an active agent in the marketplace in contrast to a passive production unit in the planned economy. After meeting some minimum production requirements from local government, farm households at the village level have certain rights to decide what they will produce and how to market their products. However, Chinese farmers face a number of challenges – low agricultural prices due to large stocks of products, lagging incomes and excess labour in the agricultural sector, among others. Externally, Chinese agriculture faces increasing competition from foreign products due to China's recent entry into the WTO and the continuing globalisation of agriculture. Domestically, Chinese agriculture has moved into a new development stage characterised by significant increases in the level of production, along with shifts in food demand as a consequence of urbanisation and rising incomes. Under these circumstances, millions of small-scale farm households in China are unable to compete effectively and respond to changes in domestic demand and withstand pressure from international markets. For many small holders, market access has become increasingly difficult and their incomes continue to lag behind the rest of the economy. Agricultural officials in China are faced with the problem of how to overcome the limits imposed by a fragmented production system, improve the quality and competitiveness of agricultural products and raise the income of rural households. In 2004 a system of subsidies, along with infrastructure investments and reform in rural credit institutions, was introduced to improve the welfare of farm households (Gale et al., 2005; Gale and Collender, 2006). However, institutional innovations to create new ways of doing business also play an important role in China's attempts to modernise its agricultural system and improve rural incomes. One of these innovations is contract farming. Contract farming is a fairly new venture for the Chinese agricultural sector – one that emerged as a result of the government's agricultural industrialisation programmes. Contract farming has a checkered history throughout the world. At its best, contract farming provides a means to manage complex production processes with greater precision than is possible through arm's length market transactions. This can result in higher quality, safer food with lower production and marketing costs. In some cases, particularly in developing or transition economies, contracting can overcome imperfections in input and output markets or institutional deficiencies by providing credit, seeds, machinery services, human capital and market access to farmers. However, without adequate competition among contracting firms, informed farmers and rule of law, contract farming may lead to economic serfdom for peasant farmers or a food system that meets the economic objectives of power elites (see, for example, Little and Watts, 1994; Runsten and Key, 1996; Eaton and Shephard, 2001; Allen and Lueck, 2003; MacDonald et al., 2004). The agricultural industrialisation programme, of which contact farming is a part, has been supported and motivated by the Chinese government with the purpose of making agricultural production more profitable and competitive. Contract farming offers a means to effectively connect small-scale farmers and large-scale food processing firms. Local governments also recognised the potential of contract farming for transforming the structure of agriculture and raising farm income. Many have implemented a number of programmes and incentives, such as credit support and tax reduction for agribusinesses involved in contract farming. Contract farming in China has made considerable progress since its emergence 20 years ago. Four characteristics can be safely generalised from its growth so far. First of all, the number of agricultural commodities produced under contract has increased steadily. Agricultural products produced or marketed under contract have grown from small-quantity locally specialised products, such as food oil and vegetables, to bulk commodities such as corn, beans, rice and wheat. For example, in Jiling Province, the number of contracted commodities has grown from 30 in 1999 to 70 in 2000. Second, the geographic distribution of contract farming has also expanded greatly. Initially, contract farming was developed in the economically advanced coastal provinces. Now contract farming is spreading rapidly into the underdeveloped areas of Central and Western China. Many firms sign contracts not only with local farmers, but also with farmers in other provinces. Third, the scale of products produced under contract (planted areas, volume of cash receipts and number of farmers) has also increased. According to the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, the planted area involved in all types of contracts reached 18.6 million hectares in 2001, approximately 40% higher than in 2000 (Niu, 2002). Finally, the number and complexity of contracts have also increased. Beyond rather standard production and marketing contracts, some new contracts cover food transactions between main production regions and high demand regions and seed provision between farmers and research institutions. According to the most recent survey from the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, there were 4.6 times the number of organisations involved in agricultural industrialisation across 31 provinces in 2000 than in 1996. The number of farmers who signed contracts with firms increased twofold over the same period. The proportion of farmers involved in contract farming went up correspondingly, from 10% to 25% (Niu, 2002). Table 1 shows the level and composition of firms or organisations involved in agricultural industrialisation between 1996 and 2000, the most recent data available. The dominant type of firm is the so-called ‘dragon-head-driven’ company. Dragon-head companies are agribusiness firms designated by national, provincial, municipal or county authorities with regard to their economic strength, operation scale, level of technology, management and their potential to improve farm incomes. For example, a national dragon-head firm must meet the scale and management criteria drafted by the National Agricultural Industrialization Development Joint Committee. Other rankings are specified by committees at corresponding levels. County-level dragon-head firms are the lowest level with the smallest size and impact within this ranking system. These firms agree to develop production or marketing systems that include market access, technology, technical assistance, credit and other inputs for local farmers. Most of the dragon-head firm systems involve the use of contracts. In exchange for their role in rural development, the dragon-head firms receive support from all levels of government and, since 2002, receive financing from the Agricultural Development Bank of China. In some cases, the dragon-head firms that are engaged in contracting are also encouraged to develop ‘bargaining associations’ for farmers in an attempt to create some degree of countervailing power. The types of organisational relationships between farmers and agribusinesses over the 1996 to 2000 period are reported in Table 2. Contracts are the dominant form of farmer-to-firm relationships. Note, however, that the proportion of contract relationships dropped steadily from 70.8% in 1996 to 49% in 2000. This would suggest that although the volume of production under contract appears to be increasing in China, the proportion of firms involved in contracting is declining, presumably because other forms of business organisation, such as cooperatives or farmer-owned businesses, are becoming more prominent or are proving to be more effective. Consolidation of firms may also offer explanations; however, these trends may be offset by the Government of China's efforts to encourage new firm development. Note, too that cooperatives and farmer-owned businesses may also rely on contracts. This paper presents information on contract farming from two independent surveys of peasant households and designated dragon-head firms. The survey data sketches out some of the characteristics of the participants in contract farming, the types of contractual relationships being developed as well as the perceived benefits and limitations of contracting. A brief profile of a contracting firm and a participating farm household is given in Box 1.",48

This, it is being claimed, could be necessary in order to avoid potentially harmful consequences to financial stability and to the future path of inflation. In practice, the current situation gives rise to two inter-related questions:
 Should indeed central banks consider, as a general rule, asset price developments, particularly asset price volatility and possible bubbles, when formulating monetary policy? Is the current asset price boom rooted in causes that are different from those that caused previous similar events, and does it therefore require a different approach? There is a very rich and detailed literature dealing with the first question, but there is no clear-cut, universally accepted, answer. However, one issue that is generally recognised by all sides in the debate is that the discussion is about ‘bubbles’, that is, about the price misalignments of assets or their or departures from fundamentals. There is practically no argument about the futility of reacting to ‘equilibrium’ asset price changes, unless they undoubtedly impact, in an evident and measurable manner, on the inflation forecast and the outlook for real activity. Summarising the dispute, it is possible to divide the arguments for and against direct monetary intervention into three categories:
 Identification difficulties. Those opposed to central bank intervention claim that bubbles are not observable and that, therefore, misalignments of asset prices are almost impossible to identify. Leaning against an equilibrium trend that is misidentified as a potential bubble will do more harm than good, since it would have immediate costs in terms of output losses and of a sub-optimally low inflation rate (Bernanke and Gertler, 2001). The counter-argument is that misalignments should not be any more difficult to identify than are other unobservable concepts, such as the output gap, the natural rate of unemployment, or the equilibrium real interest rate and that all these concepts are used routinely by central banks in setting their policies (Cechetti et al., 2000, 2003). Credibility issues. The claim, for those opposing extra action, is that, as a rule, asset prices are too volatile and expectation-dependent to be a credible target. Moreover, the central bank should consistently focus on its primary objective and avoid the public confusion that could be triggered by targeting individual asset prices. The opposing school claims, however, that central bank reputation is at stake if it neglects financial stability, even if the inflation objective is achieved. Moreover, outcomes related to asset bubbles could have direct implications for financial stability, and, therefore, preventing bubbles must be part of the core functions of a central bank (Bordo and Jeanne, 2002). Policy effectiveness. Another argument for avoiding intervention is that, in practical terms, there is an instrument problem. The interest rate is too blunt a tool and using it too often risks creating a serious recession if a bubble popped violently (Bernanke and Gertler, 2001; Greenspan, 2002). The opposite view claims that the natural bursting of a bubble can actually have very serious consequences, creating a longer recession and higher overall costs Mussa (2003). What seems evident from the above summary is that there is not much common ground between the two sides in this debate. However, one aspect that appears to be neglected in this view is the one embodied in the second question mentioned above, namely, what are the characteristics of each individual episode. In practice, the best strategy to follow at each point in time could be event dependent, meaning that it could depend on the specific nature of a particular asset price development. Asset price inflation could be rooted in many factors, combining elements of misalignments and bubbles with fundamental price adjustments. Moreover, even unambiguous fundamental price variations may result in overshootings that could correct themselves without the need for intervention, but that could also ignite an expectation-based overadjustment that has all the characteristics of a bubble. It is for this reason that understanding of the main underpinnings of specific episodes could be more important than attempting to establish general and universal policy rules. Therefore, it is crucial in this regard to understand in some detail the proximate origin of observed asset price developments.",1

This has also been accompanied by strengthening of banking supervision, and improvements in the legal environment. A much more competitive environment has resulted, and the quality of the banking system seems vastly improved.Footnote 2 Many of the countries have subsequently seen a sharp acceleration of bank lending. This has been associated with high levels of capital inflows in general, and, in many cases, with substantial current account deficits. (For an overview of the lending situation, see Backé and Zumer, 2005.) A striking feature of the acceleration in bank lending has been very rapid growth in lending to households, albeit from a low base. In this paper, I will examine the determinants of this strong increase in household credit in the transition countries. Supply-side effects are clearly a major cause of the growth in household lending, as banking reform and privatisation have produced well-capitalised banking systems that are ready and able to provide a growing range of banking products. Additionally, interest-rate differentials have been large enough to allow for profit margins that are more than sufficient to compensate for any additional risk. At the same time, demand-side conditions have also stimulated household lending. Pent-up demand for consumer durables and especially for housing has been a major factor. Robust economic growth has certainly played a role, and the expectation of higher future income, in part aided by the prospect of EU membership, has also boosted loan demand. The macroeconomic implications of increased household lending have been readily visible. Theory tells us that household lending affects consumption if households are liquidity constrained. Cross-country research by Baccheta and Gerlach (1997) shows that liquidity constraints are common, and that credit aggregates have substantial impacts on aggregate consumption in advanced countries. Estimates by Corricelli et al. (2006) suggest that substantial numbers of transition country borrowers are also liquidity constrained, so that the provision of credit to households has significant effects on aggregate consumption and also on imports in transition countries as well. Additionally, Herrmann and Jochem (2005) find that part of the current account deficit of Central and Eastern (CEE) and Southeastern (SEE) European countries can be accounted for by the level of GDP per capita. That is, when income grows, the estimated ‘normal’ current account deficit falls. Although the cross-country regressions cannot directly explain this, it would seem that demand for capital inflows fall as income increases, while previous investment raises productivity and exports, decreasing the merchandise trade deficit. This suggests that to some extent, the current account deficits and also the rapid growth of credit seen in CEE and SEE countries can be attributed to a normal catching-up process. However, even if such a conclusion is correct in general, it does not imply that catching-up is without its dangers and pitfalls, nor that catching-up countries cannot experience harmful lending booms and subsequent crisis. And, of course, very rapid household credit growth may be problematic in this context. At the same time, rapid credit growth has been identified as a key factor in banking and currency crises around the world. This raises the question of whether transition countries can have ‘too much of a good thing’ (Duenwald et al. (2005); see also Caprio and Klingebiel, 1996; Eichengreen and Rose, 1998; Eichengreen and Arteta, 2000; Borio and Lowe, 2002; Cottarelli et al., 2003). Much dispute rages about whether credit growth thresholds really exist, and whether they are relevant everywhere. For example, Gourinchas et al. (2001) suggest that problematic lending booms are mainly a Latin American phenomenon. Using a case study of Croatia, I find that the expected negative effects of rapid lending growth on loan quality have not (yet?) materialised in the household sector. Furthermore, the rapid growth of housing credit, probably the best-collateralised and least default-prone subcategory of household loans, suggests that the relatively benign prudential status of household lending may continue in the future. After the Croatian case study, I turn to a cross-country analysis. Using a sample of 90 countries, I study the main determinants of the ratio of household lending to GDP. I include a ‘transition effect’, which encapsulates the legacy of non-market banking systems offering little household credit. The transition effect, however, seems to be fading away over time as CEE and SEE banking systems converge towards EU standards. Importantly, the rate and level of convergence varies from country to country. To analyse the diverse experiences of transition countries, I use the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) transition indicators, which provide quantitative indicators of reform progress in several particular areas of transition. The results of a second-step regression analysis of the residuals from the cross-country growth equations for transition countries suggest that stronger banking sector reform increases the level of household credit to GDP, evidently by increasing the supply of credit and in particular household credit. At the same time, stronger real sector reform decreases the supply of household credit by increasing enterprise sector credit demand and creditworthiness. This suggests that there may be a danger of unbalanced reforms, in which banking sector reform proceeds more rapidly than real sector reform, leading to strong household lending growth and weak enterprise sector lending growth, contributing to rapid consumption growth, high current account deficits and foreign debt problems. The paper is structured as follows: the next section is a case study of Croatia, discussing the evolution of credit quality, and examining possible explanations for continued high repayment rates. It is followed by a brief overview of the household lending phenomenon in the transition countries as a group. The next part of the paper provides a cross-country regression analysis of lending to households, which is followed by an analysis of residuals for transition countries aimed at identifying the specific determinants of household lending in transition countries, and a concluding section.",

The run-up in house prices coincides with unprecedented expansion of private sector credit in the region, with loans for house purchase playing a key role in the expansion. This has raised concern about the implications for financial stability if house price diverge from the underlying fundamentals of housing demand and supply. To our knowledge the determinants of house prices in CEE have not yet been systematically examined. Our main goal is to assess quantitatively whether the fundamental determinants of house prices, such as disposable income, interest rates, housing credit and demographic factors, have played a role in the observed house price dynamics. Our model of house prices draws on the standard variables used in the empirical literature, and also takes account of some specific transition factors, such as the transformation of housing market and financial institutions, improvements in the quality of newly constructed housing, and growing demand for housing in this region by residents from other parts of Europe. In our empirical work we take a comparative approach and study the determinants of house price changes for panels composed of transition economies and of developed OECD countries. We use the mean group panel dynamic OLS (DOLS) estimator, which allows for cross-country heterogeneity in both short-run and long-run elasticities of house prices with respect to their determinants. The use of these panels sheds light on the common determinants of house prices for the two groups of countries, and, at the same time, allows us to identify some important differences. Our main result is that, overall, house prices in CEE can be explained fairly well by per capita GDP, real interest rates, credit growth, demographic factors and some transition specific factors, in particular institutional development of housing markets and housing finance. The available data did not allow us to investigate the issue of possible misalignment of house prices in CEE vis-à-vis comparable OECD countries. What we are able to show, however, is that estimated elasticities of house prices with respect to fundamentals were the highest in those countries that experienced the fastest growth of house prices. The outline of the paper is as follows. The next section provides a brief overview of the literature on the determinants of house prices, and stylised facts on the movement of house prices in CEE. The subsequent section discusses the data, presents our empirical model, and describes the estimation techniques. The following section presents the estimation results. Finally, the last section draws some concluding remarks.",114

In fact, banking in most transition countries has largely shaken off the traumas of the transition era. At the start of the 21st century banks in these countries look very much like banks elsewhere. That is, they are by no means problem free but they are struggling with the same issues as banks in other emerging market countries. There have been a surprisingly large number of studies that have told us about the performance of these banks but we know very little about their risk taking behaviour and how the banking environment influences it. In this paper, we examine risk taking by banks in transition with information from the EBRD's 2005 survey of bank managersFootnote 1 and balance sheet and income data prepared by BankScope. The institutional environment differs considerably among the countries in our sample. The western European countries that joined the European Union (EU) in 2004 were obliged to establish creditor rights and ensure proper law enforcement while many of the other countries were not exposed to these external pressures for reform. Thus, institutions in these countries offer, on average, less protection for lenders as compared to the new member states (see EBRD, 2004 and Pistor, 2000). In this paper, we examine the relationship between the institutional environment and risk taking by banks. The role of financial intermediaries such as banks is to channel savings to investors. In a modern economy, banks do this by maintaining a delicate balance between risk taking and managing risk. Our aim here is to examine the link between banks' risk-taking and risk management activities and the quality of the institutional environment. An examination of the relationship is interesting because theory is ambiguous about its direction. We can demonstrate this by considering the role of collateral, a widely used mechanism for ameliorating risk. Bankers face information asymmetries when they engage in lending since only the borrowers know about the ‘true’ risk of their investment projects. However, there are several covenants that bankers can include in their credit contracts to overcome information asymmetries. Bester (1985) showed that collateral can serve as a signalling device, so that borrowers reveal their true riskiness by the amount of collateral they are willing to offer. To ensure that devices like collateral can be effective, laws that define collateral relationships and adequate institutions for enforcement are essential. More reliable collateral laws and arrangements could result in greater use of collateral to overcome asymmetric information and an overall reduction of risk. In a poor legal environment, a borrower might use the same asset as collateral in several lending agreements or might refuse to surrender the collateral in case of default. In this view, a better institutional environment will be associated with a greater willingness to use collateralised loans and more lending. This is consistent with results in the law and finance literature that show a positive relationship between good creditor rights and credit market development (La Porta, et al., 1997, 1998, commonly called LLSV). However, Berger and Udell (2002), Berger et al. (2001) and Haselmann and Wachtel (2006) have shown that banks behave differently under different institutional settings. For example, Berger and Udell (2002) find that banks are more willing to provide financing to information opaque borrowers in a better legal system. That is, with reliable collateral arrangements, banks will lend to more risky borrowers even if ‘hard’ information such as audited financial statements are unavailable. In this view, improvements in the institutional environment are associated with greater risk taking by banks. We find no indication of excessive risk taking by any specific group of transition banks. Overall banking markets in transition economies are relatively homogenous with only small differences among the average bank operating in different regions, belonging to different ownership groups or having a different size. Interestingly, we find no connection between the level of risk banks take and the institutional environment they operate in. Nevertheless, banks that operate in an unsound environment generally maintain a higher level of capital. Furthermore, banks with higher risk measures compared to their competitors also do more risk management activities. This suggests that banks in transition economies have learned how to manage their risks by now. The first section discusses the relationship between the banking environment and risk taking, as well as the relevant literature. The next section presents the bank data and the relationship of bank performance to ownership and size. Our measures of bank risk are presented in the following section. The relationship between risk and bank characteristics is discussed in the succeeding section. Bank risk measures are related to risk management activities and specific types of risk taking in the penultimate section. The conclusions are given in the last section.",31

They privatised many state-owned enterprises, signed foreign trade agreements with other countries in the region, and have generally achieved a significant level of macroeconomic stability with improved growth rates. Some of these countries became full European Union (EU) members in May 2004. They also experienced a significant increase in foreign direct investment (FDI). As a consequence, the ratio of inward FDI stock to the 12 CEE countries studied here in total world inward FDI stock increased more than three-fold, from 0.81% in 1994 to 2.89% in 2004.Footnote 1 Over the same period, these countries also achieved a substantial increase in their exports, especially towards Western Europe. The question we address in this paper is whether FDI inflows have been a significant determinant of export growth in 12 CEE countries. To do so, we use a pooled data for the period between 1996 and 2004 and attempt to account for the effects of FDI on host economy exports. We separate the potential effects into supply-increasing effects (capacity effects) and FDI-specific effects. The supply-increasing effects arise when FDI inflows induce increases in the host country's production capacity, which, in turn, increases export supply capacity. The FDI-specific effects arise because foreign capital inflows may incorporate different competitive advantages, such as superior knowledge and technology and thus, higher productivity, or better information about export markets as compared to local firms. We believe that differentiating between these two effects of FDI on exports is especially important in terms of policy implications. It is often argued that successful FDI-promoting policies should lead to, among other things, a significant increase in the host country's exports. However, if evidence indicates that FDI increases exports only through increasing export supply capacity, then FDI inflows are not special in that policymakers could increase exports through alternative means as well, such as promoting domestic investment, rather than FDI. If, on the other hand, one finds that there are direct FDI-specific positive effects of foreign capital inflows on exports, this would mean that specific efforts aimed at attracting further FDI would be justified. In the following section, we provide a discussion of potential channels through which FDI may affect exports.

This includes, of course, most of the former Soviet bloc nations, especially in Eastern Europe. This sea change has raised a large number of crucial questions. On the normative side, there are obviously questions of how democratisation, that is, the transition to a democratic form of government, can be encouraged, as well as how democratic consolidation in new and fragile democracies can be strengthened. On the positive side, there is a range of questions associated with the economic performance of new democracies. (See Rodrik and Wacziarg (2005) for a short summary of results on economic growth.) In this paper, we consider one such positive question: elections in new democracies. Specifically, we consider what they imply for fiscal policy (ie, political budget cycles), how electoral results depend on economic performance and fiscal policy, and how the results that are found in new democracies may be related to democratic fragility and consolidation. As Riker (1982) and others have argued, elections are the defining feature of a democracy. They are not sufficient to define a country as a democracy, as most, if not all, non-democratic governments hold elections, even though such elections are generally a sham. But they are certainly a necessary condition for a country to be called democratic. No system can be called democratic if it does not hold regular, free elections. Hence, understanding the two-way causation between elections and economic policy or outcomes seems central to understanding the effects of democratisation. The plan of this paper is as follows. In the next section, we summarise empirical views of political cycles in economic activity (the political business cycle) and in economic policy, particularly fiscal policy (the political budget cycle). In the third section, we summarise our own findings that the increase in deficits in election years which other researchers have found is a phenomenon of new democracies. In the next section, we put these results in the context of research on democratic consolidation and discuss possible explanations of the ‘new democracy effect.’ Then, results on voter response to deficits and economic growth in both new and old democracies are presented. These results suggest that the political budget cycles found in new democracies may reflect something other than the incumbent's attempt to gain votes. In the next section, we consider an alternative explanation, namely that the ‘new democracy effect’ reflects high expenditures (and deficits) meant to protect newly democratised regimes from reversion to non-democracy, that is, to consolidate democracy. The last section presents some concluding observations.",21

What explains the disjuncture? And what does it imply about the competitive viability of authoritarian societies in the future? This essay argues that Russian and Chinese behaviour is best explained by common features of their core systems that were momentarily aligned during the postwar Soviet era, and latent cultural propensities that emerged later. It also contends that while authoritarian systems can survive, modernise, mimic aspects of advanced societies, and sometimes briefly rival western democratic free enterprise, the ‘idea of the west,’ remains best (Huntington, 1996).Footnote 1 The communist paradigm which forced the core Russian and Chinese systems 1949–1991 to perform in tandem was based on the principle of physical systems management, or natural economy where the state criminalised private ownership of the means of production, business and entrepreneurship (Soviet War Communism 1917–1921), and as a consequence was drawn to fill the vacuum by requisitioning and rationing. Ownership, business and entrepreneurship in these regimes were state monopolies, precluding private profit-seeking, which allegedly exploits the masses. Likewise democracy was proscribed because it was equated with exploitation by the ballot, making Chinese and Russian communism ‘beneficently’ authoritarian. Communist leaders were taught early by the Soviet economic collapse 1917–1921 that requisitioning and rationing were not efficient enough to assure national survival. Planning was needed to allocate resources to better use, and where this did not suffice individual self-seeking had to be enlisted into state service. Rulers found that plan constrained individual utility seeking by state enterprise managers, supervisors, and collective farmers could be tolerated, and informal second economy activities overlooked, but open markets threatened their regimes' power. (Rosefielde, 2007). Both Russia and China adhered to this paradigm throughout the Maoist (1949–1976) and early Deng Xiaoping (1978–1992) eras. They tolerated intra-state negotiated haggling and supply contracting, peasant communal agriculture and some informal activities without permitting consumer demand to govern the provision of public and household goods. The state was in command. It claimed to embody the people's will, promoting and protecting social welfare, and eclipsing western challengers. But the face behind the congenial socialist mask was grim. Russia and China were authoritarian martial police states. This term is descriptive, not polemic. It means that sovereignty (the power to determine supply) over public goods was the right of the Communist Party, not the people's democratic will, expressed through fair, multi-party electoral representation. The leadership in this authoritarian capacity chose to maintain immense military establishments supported by martial attitudes, and preserved its stranglehold on intra-party political, administrative, military, economic and civic power through omnipresent secret police. The KGB (Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti) and NSCC (National Security Council of China) were the swords and shields of communist autocracy. These characteristics distinguished the Communist east from American democratic free enterprise or European social democracy (Linz and Stepan, 1996). In the west, individuals not autocrats are the sovereigns of their welfare achieved through private ownership, legitimate business, entrepreneurship, markets, democratic participation, civic freedom and responsible electoral representation. The idea of the west is self-regulating in both private and public spheres, not imposed from above by ‘progressive autocracies’. Although experts understand that neither the east nor the west is inherently superior judged in terms of social welfare (Bergson, 1965), the self-destruction of the Soviet Union has persuaded many that democracy and competitive markets are better than authoritarian martial police states on technical and ethical grounds. Russian and Chinese leaders in the 1980s grudgingly conceded that communist physical systems management, intra-state enterprise haggling, collectivist agriculture, and the shadow economy were inferior as the west claimed, but were not convinced about the necessity of democracy, popular limitations on secret police, and military power. They were prepared to experiment with private ownership, business and entrepreneurship; mixed with state markets partially responsive to consumer demand, and residual aspects of planning, physical systems management and state ownership. But the Chinese Communist party and post-communist Russian leaders refused to relinquish their autocratic rule (Rosefielde and Hlouskova, 2007),Footnote 2 both believing like Hitler before them that democracy and self-regulating free enterprise under the rule of contract law were not essential for prosperity. OECD statistics reported in Table 1, Table 2 support Chinese communist leaders on this important point, but not the Russians. Chinese gross domestic product and living standard growth 1973–2000 surpassed democratic norms by a wide margin, while Russian performance was manifestly inferior. It improved during the recovery phase of the Putin years (although inflation and unemployment remain high), but the jury still is out on whether Moscow can achieve robust sustained growth after the petro-boom has run its course (Table 3). Why did the Chinese succeed, where the Russians failed?",5

While CEEFSU economies went through deep transformational recession, growth in Asia has accelerated.Footnote 1 Particularly remarkable has been the contrast between China and Russia. Several types of explanations have been offered in the literature on this phenomenon. Differences in initial conditions have played an important role. China and other Asian transition economies did not go through simultaneous political and economic transitions; they had large agricultural sectors, lower level of development, less initial macroeconomic distortions and were less integrated into the CMEA (de Melo et al., 2001). These differences affected the growth path during transition. A second set of explanations focus on differences in policies. China (and also transitioning Asia) chose a gradual, dual-track reform style in contrast to the big bang approach to liberalisation and privatisation followed by Russia and a number of other CEEFSU economies. Gradual and dual-track approaches, it has been argued, allowed pro-reform coalitions to be formed (Roland, 2000), permitted learning through experimentation (Lau et al., 2000), introduced competitive pressures in the economy without privatisation (McMillan, 1997), and reduced the extent of the liberalisation shock on the economy. Campos and Coricelli (2002) maintain that the adoption of a gradualist reform strategy is intrinsically (italics added by the authors) linked to the far superior performance of China and Vietnam vis-à-vis other transition economies. While these explanations have advanced our understanding, they have also neglected important aspects of the transition process. The typical approach has been to treat policies as exogenous and to assume certain automaticity in their implementation. Underplayed is the fact that since policies are normally designed and carried out by the government, their content, implementation and impact would inevitably reflect the incentives, capacity and credibility of the government as the manager of the transition process.Footnote 2 Similar policies can be implemented very differently and as a result produce vastly different outcomes. A case in point is the reform experience of the Soviet Union under Gorbachev. Perestroika was, in essence, a gradual and dual-track type of reform. While preserving planning and state ownership largely intact, Moscow passed a resolution in 1986 allowing individual enterprises. A law on cooperatives was passed in 1988 permitting private ownership in the services, manufacturing and foreign trade sectors. The Soviet Joint Venture Law that went into effect in 1987 initially limited foreign investment, but was subsequently revised to allow majority foreign ownership and control. Steps towards decentralisation were taken with the Law on the State Enterprises, which enhanced enterprises' and local governments' autonomy.Footnote 3 Reforms were gradual and of the dual-track type – quite similar to China's approach. Yet, these reforms failed in the Soviet Union – shortages became widespread, GDP collapsed declining by 2% in 1990 and by 8% in the first quarter of 1991 – while they succeeded in China. Murphy et al. (1992, p. 900) explain the difference by the decline of the power of the central government and of the communist party in the Soviet Union. This example points to the important role that the government can play in the transition. The transition is above all a process of institutional change – a change in the rules of the game. What is the role of the government in ensuring that these changes are potentially welfare improving and are well implemented? The answer depends very much on the ideological beliefs about the nature of the transition process. If one believes that there is one best, universal and well-understood set of largely self-enforcing institutions which is the end goal of the transition process, then there is no good reason for giving the government a lot of discretionary power. The government's task is relatively simple. The focus should be on speed, accountability and transparency. If, one the other hand, transition is viewed as a process of discovery, of search through a large space of possible institutional arrangements, then logic dictates giving the government a significant amount of ‘managerial’ discretion while making sure its incentives are compatible with welfare improving interventions. This paper explores the role of the government in influencing economic outcomes in transition. It looks at the importance of ideological beliefs in shaping reform strategies and approaches particularly regarding the incentives and capabilities within government. It then examines the implications of these approaches for the design and outcomes of the privatisation process. The focus is on China and Russia both because these countries epitomise contrasting approaches to reforms and to allow for greater empirical content. Examples from other transition experiences are brought in when necessary.",8

In its absolute form, the theory claims that in the long run the exchange rate between two currencies will be equal to the ratio of two corresponding national price levels. One implication of the theory is that a country can fight inflation by managing the value of its currency in terms of the currency of its major trading partners. For a successful policy, the relative prices and the nominal exchange rate should converge over time and form a stationary process. Thus, one way of testing the PPP is to test for the mean-reverting property of the nominal exchange rate that incorporates changes in relative prices into its mean-reverting process, that is, testing for stationarity of the real exchange rate. Early studies that tested for stationarity of the real exchange rates or other formulation of the PPP mostly rejected it. Examples include Taylor (1988), Carbae and Ouliaris (1988, 1991), McNown and Wallace (1989), Layton and Stark (1990), Kim (1990), Bahmani-Oskooee and Rhee (1992), and Bahmani-Oskooee (1995). Examples of those who have supported the PPP include Bahmani-Oskooee and Barry (1997), Lothian and Taylor (1996), and Bahmani-Oskooee (1998).Footnote 2 Most of these studies relied upon the standard Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test in which the null hypothesis of non-stationarity or unit root is tested against a linear stationarity. Recently Kapetanios et al. (2003, KSS hereafter) have developed a new test that is based on a non-linear exponential smooth transition autoregressive (ESTAR) procedure in which the null is still unit root but the alternative is non-linear stationarity in a time-series variable. Application of this new test by most recent studies reveals that the new test supports the PPP more often than the standard ADF test implying that the mean-reverting process of real exchange rates follows a non-linear path. Examples in this later group of studies include Sarno (2000), Taylor et al. (2001), Liew et al. (2004), Chortareas and Kapetanios (2004), Sarno et al. (2004), and Bahmani-Oskooee and Gelan (2006). One common feature of all of the studies mentioned above is that they have all relied upon the official exchange rates in testing the PPP. There is another part of the literature that includes studies that have used black market exchange rates in testing the PPP in less-developed countries (LDCs). The main argument for using the black market or parallel exchange rates in testing the PPP is that they serve as a proxy for floating exchange rates in LDCs. The literature reviewed by Bahmani-Oskooee and Goswami (2005) reveals that PPP is supported more often when the black market exchange rate is used in the testing procedure. Studies in this group are Culbert (1975), Edwards (1989), Phillips (1988), Bahmani-Oskooee (1993), El-Sakka and McNaab (1994), Baghestani (1997), Sanchez-Fung (1999), Luintel (2000), Kouretas and Zarangas (2001), Nagayasu (2000), and Bahmani-Oskooee and Goswami (2005). Although the above-mentioned studies validate the PPP by using the black market more often than the official exchange rate, support for the PPP is not unanimous across the countries. In this paper, we try to test the PPP by using both the official as well as the black market exchange rates. In doing so we employ both the standard ADF test and the KSS test to determine whether the mean-reverting properties of the real black market exchange rates are on a non-linear but stationary path. To this end, we introduce the KSS test in the next section. The penultimate section reports the results with concluding remarks in the final section.",3

The negative effect of external crises on GDP growth is motivated by the existence of financial frictions such as liability dollarisation (see Aghion et al., 2005; Christiano et al., 2005), working capital constraints (as in Christiano et al., 2005), government guarantees to bank's foreign creditors (as in Burnside et al., 2005), search frictions in the foreign investment decision (see Gopinath, 2004), underdeveloped financial markets that give rise to collective underinsurance (see Caballero and Krishnamurthy, 2005), or jumps of the shadow exchange rates (as eg in Guimaraes, 2006). The crises effects are then propagated through the economy, for instance, due to the financial accelerator effect, or currency and maturity mismatches on balance sheets. The approaches adopted for estimation of impacts of external crises on GDP growth can be roughly summarised into three groups. First, the so-called event studies look at stylised facts derived from the difference in the development of the most important macroeconomic variables before and after the crisis' occurrence and draw some conclusions based on this (see eg Gupta et al., 2003; Aziz et al., 2000; Milesi-Ferretti and Razin, 1998, 2000). The second approach is to inspect significance of crises identification dummies in long-run growth regressions (5-year averages) as applied, for example, by Barro (2001). Third, the seemingly most popular approach investigates short-run growth regressions (using annual data) as, for example, Edwards (2001), Hutchison and Noy (2002, 2005, 2006), and Moreno (1999). Papers by, for example, Barro (2001) and Edwards (2001) further estimate the effect of external crises on investment but do not attempt to compound these indirect effects with the direct effects of the crises on GDP growth. In this paper, I estimate the direct (on GDP growth) and indirect (through growth determinants) impacts of currency crises (CC), current account reversals (REV) and their concurrent occurrence on growth cycles of emerging market economies (EMEs). However, the main contribution of the paper to the literature is in an attempt to compound the direct and indirect effects of the external crises on GDP growth using applicable weights for the indirect effects. Since crises distort the transmissions between GDP growth and its determinants, I argue that the pertinent weights for compounding the direct and indirect effects should be obtained from growth regressions for non-crises countries. The proposed methodology hinges on the assumption that apart from the crises occurrence, the crises and non-crises countries are similar. The adjustment dynamics after an external crisis is analysed by means of convergence characteristics of the employed data series. I find that a current account reversal has a negative effect, both direct and indirect, on economic growth causing a slowdown in excess of 2 percentage points in the current year. The direct effect of currency crises is insignificant and unlike in the case of the reversals, the indirect effect dominates and delivers a negative overall effect. The time necessary for the adjustment of actual growth back to its equilibrium rate is roughly 4 years after a current account reversal and 2 years after a currency crisis. The paper is organised as follows. The next section provides estimates of the overall (compounded) effects of CCs, REVs, and their concurrent occurrence on economic growth. It also examines the adjustment dynamics after external crises and the last section concludes.",1

In 2005 the European Council issued conclusions on ‘Re-launching the Lisbon strategy: A partnership for growth and employment’. Slovenia is a transition country that joined the EU in 2004. In 2005 it launched the ‘Framework of economic and social reforms in order to increase the welfare in Slovenia’. These are just two instances of recent attempts to formulate a growth policy. The formulation of growth policy which would accelerate and sustain a high growth rate is of great concern to policy-makers. A subject of growth policy and the question of finding a framework for formulating a growth policy for specific nation-state conditions has recently come onto the research agenda. Rodrik (2005), Hausmann et al. (2005), Aghion and Howit (2005), and Sapir et al. (2004) have made recent contributions here. What should an analytical framework discuss or advise about the growth policy of a particular country? Does economic theory give straightforward instructions for how to form a growth policy? Rodrik (2005, pp. 993, 1009) reports that no country has experienced rapid growth without minimal adherence to higher-order principles of sound economic governance – property rights, market-oriented incentives, sound money, and fiscal solvency. He points out that the key is to realise that general theoretical principles do not translate directly into specific economic growth policy recommendations. A similar statement could be made with regard to theories and models of economic growth. Pritchett (1997, p. 15) expressed the opinion that it is conceivable there is an all-purpose theory of economic growth, but it is more plausible that the appropriate growth policy will differ according to the particular situation. I conclude from these two statements that general growth theory does not suffice to formulate growth policy. Growth theory deals with big ideas, general factors and principles of economic growth. At this level, it is of general validity and it is institution-free. Growth policy, on the other hand, cannot be formulated a priori; it is contingent on the local economic and political context. Unlike economic principles, growth policies do not hold general validity. Rodrik (2005) suggests that the successful acceleration of growth is frequently related to non-standard growth policies (eg China, East Asian countries, Ireland). Many growth policies are possible. The problem is to know which particular growth policy to chose for a particular country. I pose the following question: can a grouping of countries into a club or groupings according to some common characteristics reduce the range of possible growth policies? I shall elaborate on the question by extending the growth strategy concept to a group of countries. Is it possible to apply one growth strategy to a group of countries? For example, is it possible to apply a single growth strategy to the 25 (or more) countries of the European Union? I maintain it is possible to extend the concept of a growth strategy to a group of countries with certain similar features. The thesis of the article is that it is useful, in terms of growth policy, to arrange European countries into several groupings and that there is a mainstream growth pattern in the grouping. The article is structured as follows. In the first part I will present convergence theories and theories of the stages of growth and competitive development in order to identify bigger ideas concerning the theories of growth. By combining the ideas of three theoretical sources I define the concept of development clubs. Based on data for the 1955–2000 period I identify the development groupings of countries in Europe. Further on I discuss the question of whether certain groups of countries form development clubs in Europe. I then examine the dynamics of development clubs and groups. The concept of development groups and clubs is finally applied to discuss some implications for the growth policies of the EU, groups of European countries and some individual European countries.",3

Despite the importance of transaction costs, approaches to measuring them (Wang (2003); for an overview see also Shelanski and Klein, 1995) are still poorly developed (see Benham and Benham, 2000). In particular, few studies aim at measuring the transaction costs of whole economies. Wallis and North (1986) created the concept of the transaction sector for estimating the transaction costs in an economy. They show that the transaction sector expanded in the US economy within a period of one hundred years. The method of Wallis and North has also been used for calculating the transaction sector of Australia, New Zealand and some European countries. These follow-up studies on industrialised countries consider different time spans. Despite definitional differences and despite the application in a variety of countries, there are similar outcomes: the transaction sector rises in time ranging between 45% and over 60% of GDP in industrialised countries for the last decades of the 20th century. These figures imply that roughly half of the GDP in industrialised countries is required to make markets and hierarchies work. Our leading hypothesis is that the transaction sector of a former socialist economy rises in the transitional period. This development is plausible for two reasons. First, the importance of markets increases in this period, hence, a growing number of people are engaged in making transactions. Second, post-communist societies experience a decline of trust (Bjørnskov, 2006), this bringing about the necessity of more resources for carrying out economic transactions. In order to measure the transaction sector in Bulgaria between 1997 and 2003, we use the measuring method which Wallis and North (1986) had developed. In broad terms, our results show that this sector increases in transition countries but is lagging behind as compared to its size in industrialised Western economies. The paper is structured as follows. The next section outlines the concept of the transaction sector and in the further section we provide a survey of the literature. Later we draw attention to the Bulgarian economy between 1997 and 2003 and in the penultimate section we present our results. Finally, a conclusion follows.",3

In the 1958 New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party proclaimed the GLF goal of surpassing the United Kingdom in industrial production in 15 years and the United States in 20–30 years. The nation was soon elevated to a state of euphoria, as news of exaggerated production miracles spread throughout the country like wildfire. However, dreadful reality quickly set in. In 1959, China's grain output suddenly declined by 15%, and in the following 2 years, food supply plunged further, to 70% of the 1958 level. During the same period, a widespread famine raged across China. Years later, based on population census and fertility survey data, demographers were able to estimate that the total excess mortality during the GLF crisis ranged from 16.5 (Coale, 1981) to 30 million people (Banister, 1987). This monumental scale of the famine makes it arguably the largest in recorded history. However, during the two decades after the famine ended, there was no public recognition of its existence outside of China. Even within China, despite awareness of severe hardship during the crisis years, the magnitude of the famine was largely unknown because the Chinese government prohibited scholarly inquiries into the subject. The public in China and the West began to realise the full severity of the Chinese famine only in 1980, when demographers and Sinologists released systematic research findings.Footnote 1 Since the publication of a complete time series of crude mortality rates in the 1983 Statistical Yearbook of China, and the subsequent release of population census and fertility surveys, this catastrophe has received increasing attention among social scientists. Initially, academic research was focused on reliable estimation of excess deaths and delayed births associated with the famine. Then, following the seminal work of Lin (1990) on agricultural collectivisation and performance in China, economists intensified research effort on the causation of the collapse in production as well as the concurrent famine. Research findings include a 1993 special issue of the Journal of Comparative Economics and a 1998 symposium issue of China Economic Review. Thanks to recent progress made possible by retrospective surveys and the collection of archived data, researchers are able to conduct rigorous econometric studies assessing the joint significance of various factors contributing to the GLF crisis. Much has been learned about what caused the precipitous decline in grain output, why mortality climbed to the colossal scale, and why the catastrophe lingered so long. This article offers an overview of the growing literature on the economic analysis of China's GLF.Footnote 2 To establish a reliable factual basis for subsequent discussion, the next section documents the estimates of existing studies on the scale of excess mortality and the magnitude of decline in grain production during the crisis. Relying on Sen's entitlement approach to famine (Sen, 1981), we clarify several conceptual issues that are important for the analysis of China's GLF, particularly with regard to the role of central planning and the relationship between aggregate food supply and the causation of famine. The subsequent section examines the determinants of the decline in output, while the penultimate section analyses the determinants of extra mortality. In each section, brief expositions of economic hypotheses are followed by discussions about data issues and econometric strategies for estimation. We also report up-to-date empirical findings. Subject to qualifications, the existing research supports the hypothesis that a sequence of failures in central planning was mainly responsible for the sharp declines in China's grain output between 1959 and 1961. At the inception of the GLF, wishfully hoping for a jump in agricultural productivity from collectivisation, the Chinese government implemented an infeasible industrialisation timetable. The diversion of massive amounts of agricultural resources to industry and excessive grain procurements from the peasants, which led to malnutrition and decimation of labour productivity, were both responsible for the collapse of grain supply. The time lag between heavy grain procurement in 1 year and the nutritional deficiency in rural workers in the subsequent year contributed in part to the prolonged decline in production. Bad weather also exacerbated the mistakes of economic planning. The associated famine has multiple determinants. In addition to grain availability decline, during normal years as well as periods of national food emergency, China's food distribution system under planning gave only urban residents legally protected rights for acquiring a certain amount of food. The lack of food entitlement to the rural population due to the urban-biased allocation rule, together with political radicalism and grain exports during the crisis, contributed to the enormous death toll. Agricultural crisis and famines have long occupied the attention of scholars. The traditional approach to famine analysis, which dates back to the writings of Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus, proposes that famines are primarily caused by a sudden decline in food availability (FAD). From the late 1970s onward, a new literature on famines emerged. The intellectual foundation of this new literature is Sen's entitlement approach, which goes beyond FAD explanations and emphasises a broader set of causal factors that influence hunger and welfare, including food distribution, ownership patterns, relative prices, and famine policies (Sen, 1981; Dreze and Sen, 1989). However, despite substantial progress in developing a richer conceptual framework and improving empirical knowledge for the new literature, the understanding about famines in socialist economies had long remained rudimentary (see Ravallion, 1997; O'Grada, 2007). This void in research was due in part to the fact that socialist institutional arrangements differed from standard market settings of the entitlement approach, in which private wealth and relative prices could explain a large part of hunger and starvation. In contrast, governments under central planning set commodity prices and controlled food production and distribution. Hence, research findings from the Chinese GLF crisis contribute to our understanding about famine causes under alternative economic systems. A key insight is that central planning embodied a systemic risk. If erroneous policies were made at the top and implemented with dogmatic confidence, policy failures would have nationwide repercussions, resulting in a monumental disaster and an enormous death toll (Li and Yang, 2005). Perhaps this finding provides a partial answer to a perplexing contrast between two large developing countries that was raised by Sen (1983) more than two decades ago: the inability of China to avoid large-scale famines, while achieving a much better record of eradicating regular malnutrition and hunger than that of India. The research findings on China also have implications for analysing the Soviet famines under planning in which overambitious production plans, excessive grain collections, and biases in food distribution were important causal factors. While the major focus of this article is on Chinese government policies as they relate to the GLF, in the last section of the paper, significant parallels will be drawn to the Soviet famines of 1931–1933 and 1947. These correlations corroborate and bring into relief the research findings on China.",30

Independent states for the first time in history, they continue to be governed by authoritarian, super-presidential regimes with considerable state direction of resources and poor records for economic freedom and human rights. On the most recent European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) scale for nine dimensions of reform ranging from 4.3 for market economy to 1 for no reform, Kazakhstan was rated at 3.0, Kyrgyzstan 2.9, Tajikistan 2.4, Uzbekistan 2.3, and Turkmenistan at 1.3. And yet these five economies have recovered from their transitional recessions and have begun to grow at respectable rates. How this has been achieved is the main focus of this survey, which will also explore the effects on their economic structures and distribution of income of their economic reform efforts. To begin, my brief descriptions of the five ex-Soviet Central Asian states rely on the only two comprehensive accounts of the region to be published recently (Ofer and Pomfret, 2004; Pomfret, 2006) and on annual surveys published by the EBRD. After country surveys, which deal with the initial situation of the 1990s and the countries’ internal and external strategies, I turn to specific issues of the region: distribution of costs and benefits, the role of resource rents, external strategy, and growth prospects. Throughout I consider materials published since 2000 only.",13
50,1,Comparative Economic Studies,25 March 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2008.5,Growth Recovery in CIS Countries: The Sufficient Minimum Threshold of Reforms,March 2008,Oleh Havrylyshyn,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Transition countries in the European and Eurasian region all experienced a significant decline in output throughout the 1990s.Footnote 1 While the extent of the decline is sometimes disputed on the basis of incomparability between Soviet period and market regime measures of gross domestic product (GDP), there is no doubt all countries went through what Kornai labelled a ‘transitional recession’. It is also agreed that the recovery came relatively early for Central Europe and the Baltics, which hit bottom in the period 1992–1994. Others, and in particular many in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), witnessed a continued decline through much of the 1990s, but starting about 2000, the latter not only finally began to recover, they experienced a surge of growth with annual GDP growth rates between 6% and 10% and sometimes more. In the second half of the 1990s, many econometric studies of growth in transition were undertaken to explain both the sharp decline and the recovery where it had begun. Traditional factor inputs were generally found to be unimportant, and a broad consensus emerged that for better performance stabilisation was a sine qua non, liberalising reforms generally promote growth as does institutional development and that unfavourable initial conditions retard it at least in early years of transition.Footnote 2 These explanations fit well the broad facts of Central Europe and to a lesser extent the Baltics, experiencing less decline and earlier recovery of GDP. One implication of this literature was that CIS did not face good prospects for growth because CIS countries by the end of the decade still lagged far behind Central Europe and the Baltics on all reforms, except perhaps stabilisation. It was therefore somewhat of a puzzle why they experienced a strong surge in GDP growth from 2000, with rates far higher than Central Europe had then or at the time of their recovery. The most popular alternative explanation was the oil price boom. The first objective of this paper is to show that this alternative explanation was far from the whole story: the oil boom contributed to high growth, but the underlying reason for recovery at this time remains the same as for Central Europe and the Baltics: they reached a minimum sufficient threshold of stabilisation, liberalisation and institutions. As the last have become increasingly important in the literature, a second and more modest objective of the paper is to trace out the sequencing of reforms in transition countries, and note two important facts: in all transition countries institutions lagged far behind liberalisation, and reached very low levels prior to the rowth recovery. The paper does not propose new econometric evidence on long-term determinants of growth rates, or the much-debated issue of the relative role of institutions and liberalisation. Instead, it poses a new question: was there a minimum threshold of reforms sufficient to re-start growth? The paper is structured as follows: The next section reviews the empirical literature on determinants of recovery in transition, including in particular macrostabilisation, liberalisation, initial conditions and institutional development. The further section considers various explanations of the post-2000 surge of growth in the CIS and notes its apparent inconsistency with the earlier literature. The subsequent section proposes a reconciliation of this inconsistency by showing that for both Central Europe and the Baltics and CIS, growth restarted once a minimum threshold of transition reforms was reached. The penultimate section then turns to the less explored dimension of institutional development, and inquires in particular about its sequencing vis-à-vis stabilisation and liberalisation. Finally, the last section summarises what is known and what remains unclear on the determinants of growth in transition economies.",13
50,1,Comparative Economic Studies,25 March 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100237,Old Capital vs. New Investment in Post-Soviet Economies: Conceptual Issues and Estimates,March 2008,Alexei Izyumov,John Vahaly,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Transition to the market has led to a massive shift of capital and labour resources accumulated in the communist economies since the period of central planning. But while changes in labour reallocation are fairly well covered by data and are extensively studied in the transition literature, the fate of communist-era capital and its role in the new post-reform development is much less understood. Everybody agrees that a significant part of Soviet-era capital has been effectively destroyed by the switch from the plan to the market; however, no official data exist to account for that transformation. In addition, unlike data for the labour force, capital stock information for different transition economies is not readily available in a format that allows cross-country comparisons. In a major review article, Campos and Coricelli (2002) noted: ‘... we do not know much about what happened to communist capital. Did it depreciate very fast? How much of it was reallocated to the emerging private and informal sectors?’ (p. 806). Recent data on the levels of capital and capital–labour (K/L) ratios for transition economies are not available in the World Penn Table database or in OECD and EBRD databases.Footnote 1 Our paper attempts to answer some of these questions by generating a series of estimates of fixed capital for Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries based on certain assumptions about a survival rate of the old Soviet capital. To compare capital accumulation outcomes across countries, we measure capital on per worker basis in the form of K/L and use the same currency units, purchasing-power-parity (PPP) dollars. Having derived the estimates of ‘market-quality’ capital stock, we then apply them to a basic growth model with the goal of measuring the role of capital in the GDP recovery. In view of data limitations, we consider our estimates as only tentative indicators of the underlying trends and levels of capital accumulation in the studied countries. From the standpoint of longer-term economic growth, the Schumpeterian ‘creative destruction’ of old communist-era capital was a positive development. In some way, it can be compared to the destruction of capital in Europe and Japan during the Second World War, which was followed there by record economic growth in the 1950s and the 1960s. In the CIS, however, old capital was not renewed rapidly as economic and political instability that followed market reforms was not conducive to new investment. By the mid-1990s, investment rates in most of CIS declined to around 20% of GDP or less (World Bank, 1996, 2005, 2007; Blanchard, 1997, Popov, 2000, 2006; Campos and Coricelli, 2002; Svejnar, 2002; EBRD Transition Report, 2006). Importantly, in contrast to post-war Europe and Japan, the destruction of older capital in the CIS, as well as in other transition economies, was economic rather than physical. Large quantities of older assets inherited from communist times became a major obstacle in the way of new investment – a ‘curse of old capital’ (Popov, 1999; Aukutsionek, 2004). The situation was further complicated by massive privatisation, which often distributed existing assets to new owners for a nominal price, creating strong incentives for divestment and capital flight (Boycko et al., 1996; Blasi et al., 1997; Goldman, 2003).Footnote 2 In the late 1990s, in particular after the 1998 Russian rouble default and beginning of the oil export boom, investment in the CIS revived. With the establishment of relative macroeconomic stability, foreign capital, which was insignificant in the first years of reforms, started to flow in on a much larger scale, particularly to countries rich in natural resources (Svejnar, 2002; Heinrich et al., 2002, Pavlinek, 2002, Sohinger, 2005; EBRD Transition Report, 2006; World Development Report, 2005; World Bank, 2006). Were the new additions to capital stock large enough to increase it above the pre-reform levels? What is the role played by the new capital accumulation in the economic recovery in the CIS? In this paper, we try to answer these questions based on our capital stock estimates and other available data. The paper consists of six sections. Following this introduction, the next section discusses conceptual and statistical issues of accounting for ‘old’ and ‘new’ capital in transition economies and reviews the literature. Then the subsequent sections describe the estimation methodology and discusse levels and trends of capital stock accumulation in CIS countries, respectively. The penultimate section contains the analysis of economic growth patterns in the CIS using the newly developed ‘market-quality capital’ series. The final section concludes.",17

50,2,Comparative Economic Studies,22 May 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2008.14,How Has China's Economic Emergence Contributed to the Field of Economics?,June 2008,Gary H Jefferson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Noteworthy innovations in the field of economics over the past three decades, particularly in the field of institutional economics, have coincided with China’s transformation from a relatively minor, centrally planned economy to a burgeoning economy with the highest sustained rate of economic growth on record. China is now poised to become the world’s third largest economy and is widely expected to regain by mid-century its position last enjoyed circa 1820 as the world’s largest economy (Maddison, 2003). Measured in terms of GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP), the overtaking of the US economy may materialise within a single decade.Footnote 1 Of course, it is difficult to isolate the impact that China’s economic transformation has had on the field of economics. Other important changes have occurred in recent times, including economic transitions in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and Vietnam and the rapid globalisation of the world economy, involving the establishment and expansion of the World Trade Organization and the deepening and expanded reach of a growing array of financial markets. Nonetheless, my thesis in this paper is that China’s dramatic economic transformation has itself inspired a broad body of research that substantially enriches the field of economics. While I will argue that the China-related economic literature is noteworthy in numerous respects, one feature stands out. Many country economic analyses address the issue of why a particular country has not lived up to its performance expectations. Usually, the answer is deemed to be obvious. That is, the country did not follow the appropriate policy; it deviated in fatal ways from orthodox policy prescriptions associated with the so-called Washington Consensus. Alternatively, if the country indeed did appear to have conformed to the tenets of this neo-liberal doctrine, the literature probes the question as to why a country that dutifully carried out the policy consensus did not reap the expected benefits. China is different. Much of the China literature addresses a contrary puzzle: with institutions and policies that have deviated greatly from established orthodoxy, how could China be performing so well? China’s economic emergence has contributed to the field of economics simply by posing this very different puzzle and forcing members of our discipline to come to terms with the fundamental contradiction between expectations shaped by theory and the observed outcomes. Certainly no body of literature has focused on this puzzle to the extent that the China literature has. Since the nature of the puzzle is so fundamentally different from the usual formulations that spur research, it should not be surprising that the literature addressing this puzzle represents a unique contribution. This paper argues that research on China’s experience deserves attention for its focus on two areas. First, as both a transitioning economy and a developing economy, China provides a large, heterogeneous, fast evolving laboratory for testing and illustrating many important and enduring insights of the economics discipline. The paper focuses on the work of economics Nobel laureates whose insights and conclusions have been made far more vivid and accessible when viewed through the lens of China’s economic experience. These insights include, but are not limited to, the work of Solow in growth, Lewis, Kuznets, and Sen in development and Buchanan, Coase, and North in institutional economics. Second, research on the Chinese experience expands the scope of economic analysis. The story of China’s economic experience is about the evolution of a system involving complex interactions and feedback mechanisms that cut across institutions and time. Much of the answer to the puzzle of China's distinctiveness has to do with viewing economic transition as a series of interrelated process rather than a collection of events, that is, the process of reassigning property rights, the process of becoming a market economy, the process of technology transfer and innovation, and the process of learning and adapting mental models to new economic realities. As such, China-related research emphasises and expands the scope of the endogenous nature of economic reform and development. For example, the restructuring of only a small proportion of China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) was the immediate and direct outcome of state action. Edicts, such as those liberalising new entry and sanctioning enterprise restructuring, had little direct impact on SOE performance. However, the competition that resulted from liberalisation did create pressures and opportunities that altered the relative marginal benefits and costs of institutional change. Such changes in the incentive structure motivated local government officials, managers, workers, and outside investors to search for new governance arrangements and new technologies that led to China's incremental enterprise restructuring. This cursory account of China's corporate governance reform is but one example of China's reform experience that illustrates the dynamic, endogenous character of China's transition and development process. China’s government has played a central and on-going role in the economy’s transition. The transitions of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (EEFSU) and that of China reflect a key difference. Whereas the functioning and authority of the EEFSU political systems collapsed, China’s ruling party and central government have remained intact with the legitimacy and administrative capacity to steer China’s economic transformation. China’s government has played a central role in reassigning property rights from the state to individuals, thereby incentivising workers, managers, and investors to serve as agents of economic growth. If there is an unfinished chapter relating to China’s experience, it is likely to be how property rights, now extensively in the hands of individuals and non-state organisations, are operating through feedback mechanisms to reshape the structure and functioning of China’s government and political system. China’s experience offers a now irrefutable lesson. Economic transition and development is a far more complicated phenomenon than simply putting in place the principal elements of the neoclassical model, whose policy implications have been dubbed the Washington Consensus, or even adhering to an enlarged doctrine that incorporates the basic tenets of the New Institutional Economics (NIE). With respect to the latter, stressing that there are many paths to the fulfillment of different visions of a market economy, Murrell (1991) argues: ‘The institutions of capitalism come in many varieties and cannot be put in place instantaneously. There are many alternative reform paths, depending upon the importance attributed to each of these institutions’ (p. 59). More than any other country, China’s experience gives life to this insight. The following sections examine these themes as well as the specific literature on China that develops these themes. In writing this essay, I faced a tension between giving an account of China’s economic reform and then identifying the literature that maps into this paradigm of transition and development or undertaking a full review of the literature from which a synthesis of various themes would naturally emerge. In principle, the latter approach seemed preferable, but given my somewhat inflexible priors regarding the essential lessons of China's reform experience as well as the difficulty of confronting the now vast literature on China's transition and development, I judged the full immersion approach to be infeasible.Footnote 2 Hopefully, there would be substantial agreement in the conclusions arising from the two approaches. How differently these two approaches to carrying out this assignment might have turned out I leave to you, the reader, to assess. While this paper no doubt misses important contributions, it attempts to capture the essential character of the forest if not all the trees that populate it. The paper is organised as follows. The next section highlights some of the quantitative impacts of the growth of China-related economic research on the field, including the coming on line of extensive data sets and proliferation of journals, books and compilations relating to China’s economy. The third section describes the distinctive nature of the puzzle that shapes the China research agenda – why China’s economy is performing as well as it is given China's deviation from economic orthodoxy. One theme of this paper is that the research that chronicles and analyses China’s economic transformation vividly illustrates and in some cases deepens the insights of important areas of the established economics literature. The fourth section 4 illustrates this theme. The fifth section develops a second theme regarding the distinctive contribution of China-related research; that is the focus on understanding the evolution of economic systems as a process that cuts across institutions and time. This section sets out an analytical framework into which we situate much of the salient research on China’s economic experience. The sixth section reviews and synthesises that research and the seventh section investigates the distinctive features of China’s economy and assesses the extent to which these may or may not limit the transferability of analyses and lessons drawn from the Chinese experience to other countries and regions. Finally the last section reviews the key conclusions of the paper and speculates on new directions for China-related economic research.",8

Our aims are twofold: to quantify whether announcements of cross-border M&A transactions create value (abnormal returns) for bank shareholders, and to determine whether M&A characteristics and/or environmental and institutional conditions in EME explain abnormal returns. Generally, the empirical record shows that target firm shareholders receive a premium return from M&A transactions whereas returns to acquiring firm shareholders are mixed (see Bruner, 2002). For cross-border transactions from industrial countries to EME and involving non-financial firms, the evidence shows that positive returns accrue to shareholders in both regions (see Chari et al., 2004). We extend the literature on cross-border M&A between industrial and emerging markets to the banking sector, which has undergone a deregulation-induced internationalisation over the 1990s to the present. The internationalisation of banking is facilitated inter alia by liberalising policies such as bank privatisation and fewer restrictions on foreign ownership in EME and this has boosted cross-border M&A activity. In banking, cross-border M&A offers several potential benefits to target banks including access to technology and lower costs of capital. Therefore, it is meaningful and instructive to calculate the value gains and losses accruing to bank shareholders from announcements of impending cross-border investments. Economically, small returns over a few days should be annualised to illustrate their importance (Bruner, 2002). By way of preview, the average return to target bank shareholders in our sample of EME banks for a period of five working days is more than 3%; on an annualised basis, this constitutes a return of over 400%. While this is a theoretical return, nevertheless the example illustrates the importance of short-term abnormal returns to investors and institutions in comparison to alternative investments. The distribution of value or possible wealth transfer between shareholders has implications for public policy. Non-financial sector evidence finds that wealth is redistributed from EME to industrialised countries (Chari et al., 2004). Quantifying stockmarket reaction to M&A announcements provides evidence as to whether EME markets operate efficiently and on the speed at which information is processed. Given the difficulties in valuing banks plus the greater opacity of emerging markets due to considerably larger information asymmetries (see Focarelli and Pozzolo, 2001), stockmarket reaction to M&A announcements may yield insights that could lower information asymmetries and facilitate further cross-border investments. We recognise the importance of examining variability across returns rather than the magnitude of returns alone. Whether cross-border bank M&A announcements generate value – and for whom – is an empirical matter. For this purpose, we have identified 73 M&A transactions involving the acquisition of stakes in 46 listed banks in EME between 1998 and 2005. M&A transactions are sourced from Acquisitions Monthly with additional information on deals and participants, and share price indexes being sourced from Thomson Analytics Banker One, BankScope, and Datastream. The transactions occur in three regions: Latin America (LatAm), Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and Asia. In total, approximately $797.5 billion of EME bank assets were sold for $37.5 billion (at 2,000 prices). Over 65% of bank assets were sold in Asia but at a lower cost to acquiring banks compared to LatAm and CEE. The purchase of stakes in LatAm banks accounted for over 73% of the total value expended, with LatAm bank assets the most expensive to buy.Footnote 1
 The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The next section briefly reviews the international consolidation of the banking industry while the subsequent section outlines the event study approach. Then sample construction and data are discussed in a further section. The penultimate section has two sets of results: first, cumulative average abnormal returns and second, a regression analysis of the relationship between returns and deal characteristics in EME stockmarkets. The final section concludes.",19

There are three distinct methods of investigating the link between trade balance and real exchange rate or terms of trade, which includes testing the Marshall–Lerner condition, the J-curve, and the S-curve. The Marshall–Lerner condition is an indirect method of assessing the effectiveness of devaluation in improving trade balance. It asserts that as long as the import and export demand elasticities add up to more than unity, a decline in terms of trade or a real devaluation will have a favourable impact on trade balance. While a seminal work by Houthakker and Magee (1969) used standard econometric methods in estimating the import and export demand elasticities, more recent studies byRose (1990), Bahmani-Oskooee and Niroomand (1998), and Bahmani-Oskooee and Kara (2005) have relied upon cointegration analysis and estimated the elasticities for different countries (developed as well as less developed). The above studies have shown that the Marshall–Lerner condition is satisfied in most countries. However, there have been circumstances under which trade balance has continued to deteriorate despite the fact that the Marshall–Lerner condition is satisfied. See Magee (1973), Junz and Rhomberg (1973), Meade (1988), Bahmani-Oskooee (1985), and Rose and Yellen (1989) for examples. Given that the Marshall–Lerner condition is a long-run condition, this occurrence shifted the emphasis to the short-run dynamics that traced the post-devaluation time path of trade balance to the widely known concept of the J-curve. The argument put forward by researchers is that there are adjustment lags between the time that a currency is devalued and the response of trade balance. Thus, a short-run deterioration is consistent with a long-run improvement in trade balance and seems like a necessary feature of devaluation. For an extensive review of the literature, see Bahmani-Oskooee and Ratha (2004). More recently, another body in the literature has emerged that concentrates on analysing the cross-correlation function between trade balance and terms of trade. Using the cross-correlation function, Backus et al. (1994) were the first to show that trade balance is negatively correlated with current and future movements in terms of trade but positively correlated with past movements. They labelled this finding for OECD countries as the S-curve because of the asymmetric shape of the underlying cross-correlation function. Following the same logic and analysis, Senhadji (1998) investigated the pattern for 30 less developed countries and recovered the same empirical regularity in most cases. An important question that we address in this paper is, given the evidence for developed and less developed countries, whether a similar S-pattern could be observed for emerging economies as well. Evidence supporting such a pattern would suggest that similar dynamic, general equilibrium models could also be applied to these economies. Besides the general interest on the topic among policy circles, studying the link between terms of trade and balance of trade for emerging economies is quite important for several other reasons as well. First, these new emerging markets of Europe have had a huge surge in their trade flows since the beginning of market reforms starting in the early 1990s. At the beginning, real exchange rates initially appreciated in all these economies. During the initial years of the transition, the key economic goal was to achieve a stable inflation environment, instead of competitiveness, because the elimination of government restrictions in general, and trade liberalisation measures in particular, increased aggregate demand, putting pressure on prices. Bahmani-Oskooee and Kutan (2007) find that over time, competitiveness, measured by terms of trade fluctuations, has played a much more important role as inflation was controlled and price convergence with the European Union (EU) is achieved. Some countries undertook a series of official devaluations, while others have switched to more flexible exchange rate policies.Footnote 1 Over the years, there has been a significant increase in trade flows, particularly to the EU. An important question then is whether there has been a significant link between movements in the terms of trade and trade balance during this time period. Second, these economies are relatively small open economies, relying heavily on export revenues in their catching-up efforts with the EU. On May 2004, among our sample countries, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the Slovak Republic joined the EU. Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Turkey are the candidate countries. Russia has also been transforming her economy significantly and may apply for an EU membership in the future. Thus, real economic convergence towards the EU standards is the ultimate objective of their economic integration decision with the EU. Fluctuations in export revenues due to adverse terms of trade changes may delay the real convergence process, putting stronger pressure on the real sector of the economy, hurting competitiveness and ongoing restructuring efforts. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: A review of the S-curve literature is provided in the next section. The data, definitions, and cross-correlation functions between terms of trade and trade balance are presented in the subsequent section, followed by concluding remarks and suggestions for future research in the final section.",8

The same period has seen China's industrial output grow at least 12-fold, with dramatic changes in industrial structure. Valued at the more market-based prices of 2004, agriculture's share of GDP fell from 42% in 1978 to 13% in 2004, industry's share rose from 29% of GDP to 46% of GDP, and the service sector increased its share from 30% to 40% of GDP (Naughton, 2007, pp. 154–155).Footnote 1 The total number of secondary industry (including mining, manufacturing, construction, and utilities) workers increased from 69 million to 169 million, and their share of the labour force rose from 17% in 1978 to 22% in 2004, while the urban share of the country's population rose from under 20% to well over 40%.Footnote 2 As late as 1985, petroleum was China's largest single export, accounting for 20% of export earnings. Between 1985 and 1995, China's exports saw a dramatic shift to labour-intensive commodities and a correspondingly large decline in natural resource-based products. According to the International Economic Databank (IEDB), the share of labour intensive products in China's exports increased from 37% in 1984 to 54% in 1994, while the share of agricultural and minerals-intensive products together declined from 49% to 15%. During the more than quarter century of system change in China, the role and nature of state-owned industrial enterprises has been continuously evolving. In 1980, SOEs were at the heart of China's industrial sector, accounting for 76% of gross industrial output (Jefferson and Singh, 1998, p. 27) and 57% of industrial employment (China Statistical Yearbook 1999, Chapter 5). The SOE share of total industrial output declined steadily, from 77% in 1978 to only 49.6% in 1998. Industrial SOE profits were 15% of GDP in 1978, but fell below 2% of GDP in 1996 and 1997. By 2004, few SOEs remained in their original form, yet some 38% of industrial output was being produced by firms classified as state-owned and by corporations the majority of whose shares were owned by government entities.Footnote 3 More privatisation is in the offing, yet a large role for state ownership seems assured at least into the next decade. SOEs also changed qualitatively, from being units in a command economy tasked with meeting quantitative targets and providing comprehensive services to their employees, to being (in the 1980s and early 1990s) enterprises responding to the price signals of a market economy but retaining the basic SOE organisational form and enjoying easy access to bank credit, to their most recent incarnation as corporations, often with some private shareholders, facing at least a somewhat more disciplined banking system and, for many of the largest among them, an active stock market. This paper surveys the literature on the impacts of the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s on state-owned industrial enterprises in China, asking whether and to what degree the introduction of market forces and incentives in the 1980s, and of corporatisation in the 1990s, improved productive efficiency. There is much that the paper does not do, for instance it does not deal extensively with industrial firms of other ownership types, nor does it adequately discuss enterprise finance, the employment effects of SOE reform, or papers focusing on the selection of enterprises for privatisation. Beginning our research with broad ambitions, we were humbled by the size and complexity of the literature on state industry in the world's largest transition economy, and have accomplished only what we could do in limited time. The paper is organised as follows: The first section gives a brief overview of the process of reform in China's industrial sector and especially its SOEs, with three sub-sections that explain our reform periodisation, then describe the first and second reforms periods in somewhat more detail. The middle two sections survey studies of reform's impacts on SOE performance, with the second section focusing on studies of the reforms up to 1992 and the third section dealing with studies of the reforms from the mid-1990s to the present. In those sections, we devote particular attention to econometric studies of enterprise-level data. The fourth section provides concluding remarks.",32
50,3,Comparative Economic Studies,22 August 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2008.10,Information Sharing in Credit Markets: Incentives for Incorrect Information Reporting,September 2008,Maria Semenova,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Information about borrowers represents an asset of a certain value in the market for bank loans. A bank's client who enjoys the advantages of bank loan over time and who repays fully and regularly, getting new loans on more favourable conditions, would certainly agree that the information is also valuable for borrowers. Those who borrow in order to repay old debts also agree. And the creditor would concur: the efficiency of its credit policy is tightly connected with availability of this information. Each bank would like to distinguish between reliable and risky borrowers, minimising time and funds on data search, collection and analysis and on monitoring borrowers' actions. Each borrower prefers to obtain loans on favourable conditions, namely to pay interest that does not exceed the degree of his own and his project riskiness. The existence of an informational intermediary facilitates the bank loans market (Jappelli and Pagano, 1999, 2000b). This intermediary accumulates data on borrowers, which is received from banks and some other sources, and then provides it to potential creditors. This method is faster, cheaper and more accurate for a bank than doing the search and analytical work itself. It is particularly true for the consumer credit market. Why is it so important to pay attention to informational intermediation institutions while studying the market for bank loans? One of the most serious problems of this market is asymmetry of information between a lender and a borrower. The procedures of financial statement analysis, estimation of investment quality, monitoring of borrower's actions are discussed quite comprehensively. However, this is costly and probably inefficient. Informational intermediaries' activities may be considered as an alternative, and targeted directly to improving markets with information asymmetry:
 Necessary information is provided and therefore banks become more aware of their potential clients. This helps to estimate creditworthiness more precisely, to offer an interest rate at a level more consistent with the particular client's riskiness and to reduce the share of bad loans in bank's credit portfolio. Bank's expenses for information collection and analysis usually decrease. Monitoring becomes cheaper. The fact that the borrower's credit history exists and will be used by potential creditors disciplines the borrower, because all future loans will be granted on conditions determined by his previous behaviour. Informational rent, resulting from a bank's exclusive knowledge of a borrower's creditworthiness, tends to be diluted. This spurs competition and leads to overall interest rate reduction, adding an incentive to borrow for and invest in less-risky projects. Formal informational intermediaries in the market for bank loans are private credit bureaus and public credit registries. Private credit bureaus functioning is based on principles of voluntary membership and mutuality of data flows. Often they are commercial organisations. Public credit registries are usually founded by the Central Bank of a country. Information on loans over a certain threshold must be reported without fail. In contrast to private credit bureaus the services of public credit registries may be free of charge. In practice some sort of informal ‘segregation of duties’ takes place: private credit bureaus tend to concentrate on personal loans, credits to small and medium enterprises, public credit registries accumulate data on large loans. However, if informational intermediation is represented by one type of institution only, it usually copes with all segments of the market. An informational intermediary usually collects data of two types. Black (negative) information includes data on failures to pay on time, bad loans and other breaches of credit contract. White (positive) information usually is data on the loans taken (amount, interest rates, maturity period, guaranties) and on borrowers' own characteristics. Quite often information provided by banks is compared to that from other sources to which the intermediary has access and statistical analysis is performed with the use of specially designed software. A particular channel of data control is represented by borrowers themselves: often they have the opportunity to check the information in their credit files for accuracy. Nevertheless, credit reports tend to contain errors, and it may be that such an error influences the prospective creditor's decision about loan granting. The errors are probably caused by technical defects: banks and information intermediaries deal with huge volumes of data. But could there be other reasons? The value of information about borrowers as a competitive advantage may be a reason for a creditor, who is a member of information exchange network, to behave opportunistically. A bank may prefer to provide its competitors with false information to preserve the competitive advantage. That seems to be an appropriate solution if the reporting is obligatory, for example, due to Central Bank requirements.Footnote 1 The purpose of this paper is to study banks' incentives for this kind of opportunistic behaviour. The paper is organised as follows. The second section provides a review of literature on information asymmetry problems in the market for bank loans and on peculiarities of informational intermediation as a way to solve them. The third section presents a model, which is used to analyse a bank's benefit provided by misreporting. The fourth section describes some examples of systems for data accuracy and reliability control, which are adopted in different countries, and demonstrates that misreporting takes place even where these systems are highly developed. The last section summarises the findings.",9

Initially all had fiscal and monetary institutions ill-suited for a market economy. In particular, as transition progressed a new system of money and banking was created to implement market economy monetary policies and improve financial intermediation. Monetary policy options were severely limited in the early transition period however. Transition economies found a fixed nominal exchange rate anchor as the monetary policy of choice. Targeting a monetary aggregate, base or reserves, proved untenable as these were difficult to measure, money demand was unstable and foreign assistance flows, inter alia, distorted measures of base money. In addition, there were large, often unpredictable, transition shocks that compounded measurement of monetary aggregates. During the early transition period the long and varying lags between changes in money and changes in inflation introduced too much uncertainty at a time when building central bank credibility was essential. A fixed nominal exchange rate anchor served two important purposes. First, it was a highly visible policy target, which the central bank could manage and therefore effectively gain credibility. Second, there was a real need to limit exchange rate volatility in order to promote international trade and investment during a period when these economies were opening to world markets. Within a few years, however, the disadvantages of a fixed exchange rate policy became apparent: loss of monetary autonomy, the potential for currency mismatches within the banking system and speculative attacks leading to financial and banking crises, and equilibrating the real exchange rate only via domestic price changes and real output decreases. Relatively quickly many transition economies moved to a heavily managed exchange rate policy as other options were explored. Only with the maturing of institutions and domestic financial markets did alternative monetary policies, inflation forecast targeting in particular, become a viable option.Footnote 1 There are several critical prerequisites for inflation targeting. The first is the institutional capacity of the central bank to forecast inflation, the intermediate target, and utilise an array of instruments to meet the target. The second is reasonably well-functioning, sound financial markets that link central bank instruments, a particular interest rate, to the ultimate policy variable, a measure of inflation. Third, the central bank must be operationally independent of the government and free of fiscal obligations, that is, fiscal dominance must be absent. Fourth, a market-oriented economic structure with predominantly deregulated prices, low level of dollarisation and low exchange rate pass-through must be in place (or nearly so). Finally, there must be a political willingness, both within the central bank and the government, to support a commitment to low inflation. The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary were the first three transition economies to adopt inflation targeting and it took from 8 to nearly 12 years into the transition and pressures to move into the Euro area to convince policy makers to adopt inflation targeting in some form.Footnote 2 But even for these early adopters it is unclear whether or not their policy actions are comparable to similar inflation targeting central banks in well-developed market economies. Siklos (2006) notes that central bank behaviour with respect to interest rate setting is often summarised for analytical purposes by its estimated reaction function.Footnote 3 If this is the case he suggests that the instrument rule of the Hungarian National Bank should then be similar to that of Euro area central banks. Gerdesmeier and Roffia (2004) also note estimating reaction functions provides a basis for forecasting changes in central bank policy instruments and evaluation of central bank policies. It may be reasonable also to suggest that in general the reaction function of an inflation targeting transition economy central bank should be similar to that of an inflation targeting market economy central bank. Thus, for recent transition economy adopters of inflation targeting a comparison of the central bank reaction function with other central banks may reveal both whether or not the prerequisites for inflation targeting have been met and whether or not the central bank is committed to and effective in carrying out the announced policies. In this paper we focus on one transition economy recently adopting inflation targeting, Armenia. For both analysts and policy makers the existence and understanding of monetary channels that link interest rates and inflation is critical. To this end we specify and estimate a Taylor rule-type reaction function for the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA). In the next two sections we first briefly describe the evolution of Armenian monetary policy and we ask whether the prerequisites for inflation targeting are met. In the subsequent section we outline a Taylor rule-type reaction function and estimate it for Armenia. To determine whether the CBA is inflation targeting or exchange rate targeting we estimate the reaction function without the exchange rate and then with three alternative measures: the nominal exchange rate, the real exchange rate and the de-trended real exchange rate. Then we provide interest rate simulations for the empirical rule and compare the actual interest rate path with that of three alternatives: the estimated reaction function, a strict inflation targeting rule and exchange rate pass-through and a strict inflation targeting rule with interest rate smoothing. The final section presents conclusions and suggestions for future research.",4
50,3,Comparative Economic Studies,22 August 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2008.29,"Advancing Inflation Targeting in Central Europe: Strategies, Policy Rules and Empirical Evidence",September 2008,Lucjan T Orlowski,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There are three distinct stages in the institutional evolution of monetary policies in Central and East European Countries (CEECs) as the major objectives of monetary policy itself evolved. At the early stage, reflecting transition from central planning to a deregulated market economy, the key objective was to provide the foundations for initial price stability. This was accomplished by enacting currency pegs that helped counter large, corrective inflation stemming from the massive price deregulation in the early 1990s (Bruno, 1992). Monetary policy at that time relied almost exclusively on the exchange rate channel of policy transmission, that is, a quick translation of stable import prices into lower domestic wholesale and retail prices. However, the fixed exchange rate regime alone could not eradicate the remnants of price and wage indexation, which precipitated real currency appreciation and large current account deficits in the mid-1990s (Halpern and Wyplosz, 1997). Coincidentally, these fundamental problems mirrored those of the East Asian countries that led to the Asian Financial Crises of 1997/1998. As a result, the CEECs experienced spillover effects from that crisis, although to a different degree. Consequently, the CEECs monetary authorities abandoned currency pegs in search of alternative policy regimes that would provide a viable anchor for attaining price stability.Footnote 1 During the second stage, the main objective was to lay out foundations for sustainable price stability. Along with a move toward more flexible exchange rates, CEECs monetary authorities faced the task of finding an appropriate monetary policy framework conducive to achieving price stability. The alternatives were rather limited at that time. Monetary targeting was out of the question due to unstable relationships between monetary growth and inflation. In addition, the relationship between inflation and interest rates as well as exchange rates was also unstable (Orlowski, 2004). Income targeting would certainly exacerbate inflationary pressures, and exchange rate targeting in the presence of ubiquitous wage and price indexation would precipitate real currency appreciation further.Footnote 2 These systemic pitfalls led to the emergence of direct inflation targeting (DIT) as a viable monetary policy strategy that could effectively counter persistent inflation.Footnote 3 DIT can be broadly defined as monetary policy based on a prescribed quantitative inflation target as its primary objective, supported by a high degree of transparency and accountability (Roger and Stone, 2005). The main objective of the third stage of monetary policy was to facilitate monetary convergence to a common currency (the euro). This task cannot be accomplished by a simple targeting of domestic inflation or by an exclusive exchange rate targeting. Monetary convergence to the euro is a complex process that combines multiple tasks, such as inflation convergence, exchange rate stability and convergence of long-term bond yields. These tasks, in their simplified form, are encapsulated by the Maastricht convergence criteria.Footnote 4 Accordingly, a strict form of inflation targeting may not be appropriate for facilitating convergence to the euro since it does not take into account exchange rate stability. If during the convergence process inflation targets are to be maintained, they need to be supplemented with an auxiliary objective of exchange rate stability. Therefore, a more flexible variant of DIT is viewed as more conducive to accomplishing the key objectives of convergence to the euro (Jonas, 2006; Orlowski, 2001, 2005b). The major tasks of monetary policy at each of the above three stages necessitate a proper sequencing of changes in policy strategies. This study aims at outlining the optimal sequencing of DIT strategies on the convergence path to the euro. The policy evolution begins with strict inflation targeting that encompasses achieving explicit inflation targets and lays the foundations for sustainable price stability. Flexible inflation targeting that combines the inflation and the exchange rate stability targets is perceived as an ultimate solution suitable for the period preceding the euro adoption. Within this framework, the inflation target is prescribed by the objective of minimising the differential between the domestic and the eurozone inflation forecasts. At the ultimate stage upon the actual adoption of the euro, a local central bank relinquishes its monetary autonomy to the European Central Bank, which implies the end of an independent monetary policy. Feasibility of the proposed DIT sequence depends on the ability of a central bank to use a set of appropriate indicator variables in forecasting inflation, and thus also in the determination of plausible inflation targets.Footnote 5 Consistent with the major theories explaining the financial and monetary variables underlying the inflation process, this paper attempts to test the impact on inflation of changes in the exchange rate, in sovereign bond yields and in the money supply. A stable functional relationship between inflation and the indicator variables allows for expanding the time horizon and improving inflation forecasts, thus enabling the introduction of a more flexible, forward-looking DIT. The empirical tests for stability between inflation and the above-noted indicator variables are conducted for the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary in order to ascertain their readiness for adopting flexible DIT strategies. These three countries are chosen because they have formally embraced DIT, albeit in very different functional forms. Specifically, the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) has enacted a flexible DIT combining the inflation target with a specific exchange rate stability target, the Czech National Bank (CNB) has officially embraced a flexible DIT with a managed float, and the National Bank of Poland (NBP) has followed a seemingly strict DIT allowing its currency to float freely (Roger and Stone, 2005; Orlowski, 2005a). Viability of DIT for CEECs is discussed in the next section, which also presents a model describing the evolution of the policy framework. Then the specific features of the initial and the present DIT regimes adopted by the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are overviewed. The empirical tests examining the stability of the relationships between inflation and the selected indicator variables are next presented. Recommendations for policy modifications and applicability of this analysis to other countries converging to a common currency system are briefly discussed in the concluding section.",3
50,3,Comparative Economic Studies,22 August 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2008.23,"Inflation Targeting, Policy Rates and Exchange Rate Volatility: Evidence from Turkey",September 2008,Cem Akyurek,Ali M Kutan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Facing a sudden reversal of capital inflows, Turkey had to exit from its 13-month-old exchange rate peg and adopt a floating exchange rate regime in February 2001. The after effects were devastating, as the nominal exchange rate nearly doubled in 2 months, inflation more than doubled in 6 months and the economy contracted significantly with the collapse of the banking system. The crisis led to a new economic programme funded by the IMF and a new approach to monetary policy (Akyurek, 2006). Accordingly, in January 2002 the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) began implementing an implicit inflation targeting framework (IIT), which encompassed core attributes of an inflation targeting (IT) regime including, among other requirements, the announcement of a formal target for inflation. Coupled with fiscal discipline and economic reforms, under the IIT framework, inflation declined from over 70% to below 8% by year-end 2005 while the CBT consistently outperformed its year-end point targets measured by the consumer price index (CPI). In due course, the CBT cut its overnight policy rate from 59% to 13.5%. It seemed more or less that during this period of disinflation, structural transformation and transitional dynamics, the CBT was searching for an equilibrium real interest rate commensurate with lower inflation. Given successful disinflation, improvements in fiscal conditions and the banking system in particular, the CBT introduced full-fledged IT at the beginning of 2006, which brought further transparency to the new framework. During the first year of full-fledged IT, year-end inflation (9.86%) exceeded the target (5%) by a wide margin. The year saw a sudden reversal of capital inflows in May–June mainly driven by the deterioration in investor sentiment towards emerging markets in general. The exchange rate depreciated by close to 30% and the CBT raised its policy rate from 13.25% to 17.50%. While inflation returned to pre-shock levels after about a year, it remained above the path leading to the 4% year-end target set for 2007. In this paper, we focus on Turkey's inflation targeting regime. Turkey's experience is important for several reasons. First, literature on inflation targeting mainly focuses on developed countries.Footnote 1 More recently, some developing and emerging markets have adopted a regime of inflation targeting and their experience is examined by some recent studies.Footnote 2 Many new member states of the European Union (EU) have also adopted inflation targeting regimes.Footnote 3 However, there is scant work on inflation targeting regime for Turkey. We believe that Turkey's experience may provide valuable lessons for emerging European and other developing economies. In addition, Turkey is a candidate for the EU membership, and inflation targeting is consistent with the Maastricht criteria for joining the European Monetary Union. The paper has three simple objectives. Firstly, in the second section, we provide a short description of the IIT period in Turkey including a discussion of the evolution of the new monetary framework and the conditions prevailing during the period of its implementation. Here we emphasise the challenges facing the conduct of monetary policy in this new environment and also discuss the changes to the framework with the transition from IIT to IT. The third section provides a discussion of theoretical issues concerning interest rate policy in small open economies under the IT regime. The section provides a brief discussion of monetary transmission with an emphasis on issues concerning the dynamics of monetary channels in emerging markets and implications for monetary rules. The fourth section provides a discussion and empirical analysis of the path of policy rates in Turkey where the main drivers of policy changes seen under the new framework are formally investigated. As such, a Taylor rule is estimated for 2002–2007. In the section Exchange rate pass-through, capital inflows and monetary policy: 2002–2007, the results of an empirical analysis of exchange rate pass-through to inflation is presented, including an investigation of changes, if any, in the process since the introduction of IIT. The next subsection includes a brief discussion of monetary policy reaction to sudden stops during 2002–2007. Concluding remarks are presented in the last section.",8

The stronger the impact of policy announcements on expectations, the easier it is for policymakers to control inflation and to accommodate shocks without jeopardising the objective of price stability. The concept of credibility, which seems particularly relevant in this context, is the marginal credibility, defined as policymakers' ability to influence public expectations by means of policy announcements (Cukierman and Meltzer, 1986).Footnote 1 This paper empirically investigates the marginal credibility of inflation targets in Poland. It proposes a new methodology to estimate credibility by collecting three pieces of information: survey data on inflationary expectations, forecasts generated from past macroeconomic data, and central bank's inflation targets. The aim is to statistically assess the relative distance between the targets and survey-based expectations on the one hand, and between these expectations and data-based forecasts on the other. The closer the expectations are to the targets relative to the data-based forecasts, the higher is the marginal credibility of the target (the public attaches greater weight to policy announcements than to past developments). It is optimal for private agents to use both past data and policy announcements in forecasting inflation, as parameters of a central bank's loss function change over time in an unobservable way and policy announcements partly reveal these changes (Cukierman and Meltzer, 1986).Footnote 2 The paper starts by discussing existing empirical literature on the marginal credibility of policy announcements. The next section presents a short description of inflation targeting in Poland. The subsequent section gives a more detailed description of the proposed methodology. Estimation results follow, and some technical details of the estimation strategy are relegated into the Appendix.",3

However, the Romanian transition to a market economy system has been marked by high and volatile inflation rates. Monetary policy choices have been rooted in an understanding of inflation as an excess aggregate demand phenomenon. The policy framework has changed throughout transition, from broad money targeting (1990–1996) to high-powered money targeting (1997–2005), and then to inflation targeting (August 2005). The NBR explained the latter policy move as a response to the increasing inadequacy of monetary targeting approaches (NBR, 2005). The paper will use the 1997–2005 period, when the NBR formally committed itself to targeting the monetary base of the system, as the basis for exploring Romanian policy-making in practice and the challenges to the newly adopted inflation-targeting framework. It will situate the transition to the new policy regime in the context of the April 2005 further liberalisation in the capital account and the attending policy dilemmas. It will argue that the new policy regime carries on the tension between theorising and practice of monetary policy, with monetary authorities on the one hand failing to overcome the policy trade-offs of the monetary targeting years, and on the other hand unable to alter the money markets' structural features in order to consolidate the relevance of the policy rate for spending decisions as required by the new regime. It will show how the inflation targeting framework faces the central bank of a small open economy with a paradoxical situation: interest rate decisions that in theory ought to be geared toward internal considerations, but in practice are greatly limited by, and depending upon external factors. Hoping to stimulate debate, it will finally outline some alternative policy options. Although other macroeconomic developments will be presented to explain the circumstances surrounding policy-making, the main aim is to critically assess the assumptions behind NBR's monetary policy strategy, without systematic questioning of its effects on inflation rates or the appropriateness of its chosen instruments for creating a well-functioning financial system.",9

A decade after the East Asian crisis and the ever-growing importance of developing-country-banking systems, the extent to which progress has been made in regulatory reform commands our attention for several reasons. Those concerned with the fragility of financial systems, whether from a social welfare or a narrower investor's perspective, want to know whether developing countries’ financial systems are safer now than in the 1990s, or whether they merely appear safer as a result of the recent generous inflows of foreign capital. Furthermore, those formulating financial-sector policy recommendations, including the World Bank (Bank) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), want to know what to do next in improving the efficacy of financial systems, which presumably necessitates an understanding of what has been accomplished thus far. Indeed, in 1999 the Bank and the IMF started the Financial Sector Assessment Program to assess systematically the status of financial systems in countries and to make recommendations for reform, including in the area of bank regulation. As a result, Bank and Fund officials, among others, want to know the extent to which recommendations were adopted and whether the reforms were beneficial. Many seem to know what has happened to bank-regulatory reforms in countries and have drawn optimistic conclusions about recent changes – perhaps though with some rethinking taking place after the turbulence in credit markets that began in the summer 2007. After all, investors in recent years have been putting their money into emerging market economies at very narrow interest rate spreads. Also, Martin Wolf commented that ‘… there have been substantial structural improvements in Asian economies, notably in the capitalization and regulation of financial systems’ (Financial Times, 23 May, 2007). Still others believe that bank regulation and supervision are now sufficiently effective to warrant more aggressive capital account liberalisation. For example, Ken Rogoff (2007) recently suggested that while IMF recommendations in the 1990s to liberalise more fully capital account transactions might have been premature, now is the time for the IMF, still searching for a new direction for itself, to resume this effort. Yet, do we actually know what has happened to banking policies in recent years and is there any evidence regarding the consequences of the actions that have been taken? Have changes in the bank-regulatory environment enhanced the creditworthiness of developing countries? Is bank regulation so much better now that one should not expect crises to follow from greater capital account liberalisation? In addition to these important questions about the stability of financial systems, policy makers are also concerned about other features of their financial systems. Will the bank-regulatory framework prescribed by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision increase access to financial services? Have changes in regulation contributed to financial-sector development and the allocation of capital by banks to those firms most likely to promote growth and reduce poverty? And what about the efficiency of banks, or their corporate governance, and corruption in the lending process itself? These questions regarding the recent changes in the regulatory environment and their effects represent a natural area of inquiry. More than 10 years ago, a similar set of questions motivated us to start assembling the first cross-country database on bank regulation and supervision. Based on guidance from bank supervisors, financial economists, and our own experiences, we began putting together an extensive survey of bank regulation and supervision.Footnote 1 The original survey, Survey I, had 117 country respondents between 1998 and 2000. The first update in 2003, Survey II, characterised the regulatory situation at the end of 2002, and had 152 respondents. Survey III was posted at the Bank website in the summer of 2007 with responses from 142 countries. Survey III is special because barring a postponement in Europe on par with that in the United States; it represents the last look at the world before many countries formally begin implementing Basel II, the revised Capital Accord. This paper is organised as follows. The next section very briefly reviews the structure of the survey and discusses some issues that arise in the responses to the three surveys. The subsequent section looks at the state of bank regulation around the world in 2006, and importantly how it has changed in the last 10 years. Then the further section turns to a first analysis of the data, asking whether the changes in bank regulation are contributing positively to financial-sector development (and thus we hope to the wider availability of financial services) and to the stability of banking systems around the world. Finally, the last section concludes with lessons for Basel II, and for countries that are grappling with a response to it. Based on our empirical analysis of what works best in the bank regulation (BCL, 2006) and subsequent changes that have taken place since the late 1990s in the regulatory environment, we see no basis for the view that countries around the world have primarily reformed for the better. While many have followed the Basel guidelines and strengthened capital regulations and empowered supervisory agencies to a greater degree, existing evidence does not suggest that this will improve banking-system stability, enhance the efficiency of intermediation, or reduce corruption in lending. While some countries have reformed their regulations to empower private monitoring, consistent with the third pillar of Basel II, there are many exceptions and even reversals along this dimension. Moreover, many countries intensified restrictions on non-lending activities, which existing evidence suggests hurts banking-system stability, lowers bank development, and reduces the efficiency of financial intermediation. Our tempered advice continues to be that countries will benefit from an approach to bank regulation that is grounded in what has worked in practice. In our earlier work, we found that an approach that favours private monitoring, limits moral hazard, removes activity restrictions on banks, encourages competition, including competition by foreign banks, and requires or encourages greater diversification appears to work best to foster more stable, more efficient, and less corrupt financial-sector development. Our earlier findings did not support a hurried adoption of the first two pillars of Basel II by developing countries, but rather stressed the value of first developing the legal, information, and incentive systems in which financial systems flourish to the benefit of everyone. Based on the existing evidence, we continue to believe that this approach is the most sensible one for country authorities to pursue. Critically, the data in this new survey provide the raw material for research that should help confirm, refute, or refine this private monitoring view.",195

The case of Denmark serves as a reference for comparison, illustrating that financial integration across borders can be achieved without a subsequent deep financial crisis. The Nordic crisis of the 1990s was a devastating one. The loss in output, employment and industrial production in the early 1990s was large compared to the outcome of previous major crises among the Nordics. There is no event in the entire post-World War II period of a similar magnitude. In terms of loss to society, it matches the depression of the 1930s, commonly regarded as the most severe crisis of the 20th century. Indeed, the financial crisis of the early 1990s is a unique one – it represents a sharp break with the business-cycle pattern after World War II, in particular in Finland and Sweden. When the growth rate in real income (GDP) is examined (Figure 1), the following pattern surfaces for the period 1980–2000. Finland and Sweden went through a major depression in 1990–1993, with negative growth rates. Both Denmark and Norway had a recession in 1988 and a weak recovery in 1989–1992, with a decline in the growth rate in 1993 before a major recovery set in. In Finland and Sweden, the turnaround occurred in 1993 as well. Unemployment in the four countries shows a sharp rise in the early 1990s, most pronounced in Finland and in Sweden, peaking in 1993 and then gradually tapering off. Real income growth in the Nordic countries, 1980–2000, per cent  Source: AMECO The evolution of the economies of Finland, Norway and Sweden during the last decades of the 20th century is similar in many respects. The causes and consequences of the boom–bust cycle in these three countries are the same. The similarities are most striking between Finland and Sweden. They may be described as economic twins during the 1980s and 1990s.Footnote 2 The Scandinavian experience is worth examining for several reasons. First, the Nordic cases of financial deregulation, boom–bust and financial crisis should be viewed as four simultaneous laboratory experiments carried out in a similar environment as the four countries have so much in common. When the aim is to distil policy lessons, as in this study, a comparative perspective is more informative than a focus on the experience of only one country. Second, the Nordics were pioneers in the sense that they engineered financial crises in the early 1990s, well ahead of the emerging-market crises in the late 1990s. By now, these later episodes, in particular the events in East Asia, dominate current research as well as policy views on financial liberalisation and financial crises. The crises in the Nordic countries tend to be ignored, although they deserve a more prominent position.Footnote 3 Third, the tradition of openness, transparency and frank public debate in the solidly democratic Nordic countries offers a wealth of data and evidence concerning financial liberalisation and crisis. Policy-makers, politicians and bankers have published their memoirs from this period, providing us with insights commonly not available for other countries. Finally, the four Nordic countries are modern welfare states with large public sectors, some of the most generous public support schemes, a tradition of good governance and some of the highest GDP per capita figures in the world. The lessons from boom–bust episodes in such societies may be different from those in emerging-market economies with smaller public sectors, lower GDP per capita, less developed democratic traditions and institutions, weaker social safety nets and from those that lack good corporate governance and strong legal infrastructures. For this reason, the Nordic record warrants a separate examination. This study is organised as follows. First, the process of financial liberalisation and the ensuing boom–bust cycle is summarised. Next, this account forms the base for extracting 15 lessons from the Nordic experience, covering the immediate crisis episode as well as the financial integration process started by the financial deregulation in the 1980s, a process that has been going on since then.",23

New central banks needed to be organised in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's dissolution, and the desire was to establish institutions that would be the most effective in achieving central banking goals. At the same time, attention turned to some alleged corporate governance problems involving central banks (Frisell et al., 2007), as well as the widely publicised governance problems in large corporations such as Enron. Many long-established central banks have been examining the methods used to achieve their objectives, and as a result, several central banks have undergone changes to their institutional frameworks, methods of implementing monetary policy, or provision of payment services, in an attempt to make them more effective. For example, in 1989, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand was given the ability to implement monetary policy without political influence. In 1997, the Bank of England gained more independence from the government and was given responsibility for setting monetary policy to achieve the government's inflation target. Responsibility for bank supervision, which the Bank of England was given in 1987, was removed from the Bank of England's duties in 1998 (Lybek and Morris, 2004). In the US, the Federal Reserve has been increasing the degree of monetary policy transparency and communication to help promote policy effectiveness. For example, in November 2007, the Fed began providing economic projections more often and with a longer forecast horizon. There is a growing body of literature that examines what procedures central banks should follow to set monetary policy most effectively (Blinder, 2004). Moreover, in light of the transition to electronic forms of payments, US Federal Reserve Banks are rethinking the role their branches perform within the Federal Reserve System. This environment of change has created a new interest in better understanding the roles played by organisational structures, accountability, and transparency in increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of central banks in achieving their objectives and ultimately yielding better economic outcomes. Lybek and Morris (2004) surveyed the central bank laws in 101 countries and found that while central bank autonomy (ie, independence from the government) and accountability are generally accepted as a good practice, there is less consensus regarding the structure, size, and composition of the governing bodies. Frisell et al. (2007) expanded on this topic by examining the organisational structures in a group of mostly European central banks. The authors raise an important question whether there is a trade-off between the accountability of central banks and their independence from the government in setting monetary policy. While much has been written about the potential role that organisational structure can play in central banks, there has been little in the way of empirical study of the hypothesis that institutional form is related to performance. We provide some preliminary evidence. Our paper asks two simple questions: first, can we find a significant statistical relationship between central bank structural characteristics, including board structure and goals, and economic outcomes that reflect the performance of central banks? Second, do these relationships differ across central banks operating in countries at different stages of economic development? Thus, our study adds to the growing literature on organisational form and central bank performance in two ways. First, while much of the literature has focused on developing measures of the governance structure of central banks, we attempt to provide statistical evidence on whether measures of structural and organisational forms are significantly related to better economic outcomes. Second, while much of the literature has focused on the relatively developed countries, in this paper, we provide cross-country evidence.Footnote 1 We emphasise that our results must be viewed as suggestive rather than definitive. The relatively short time frame in our sample makes it difficult to disentangle the direction of causality: does organisational form cause good performance, or does good performance lead to particular central bank organisational characteristics? Also, our central bank structure variables may be proxying for omitted variables. Thus, our results are best interpreted as correlations. Nonetheless, we believe that some of the significant relationships we find are sufficiently interesting to warrant further investigation on the important question of whether there is a discernable relationship between central bank institutional structure and economic performance. The rest of our paper is organised as follows. The next section discusses the responsibilities of central banks, potential methods for achieving the goals, and our hypotheses. The subsequent section discusses our data. The next section presents our empirical results. The final section concludes.",18
50,4,Comparative Economic Studies,19 December 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2008.37,The Impact of the USD/EUR Exchange Rate on Inflation in the Central and East European Countries,December 2008,Ljubinko Jankov,Ivo Krznar,Maroje Lang,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"During the last few years, there has been growing empirical support for the idea that external factors might have a leading role in explaining business cycles in small open economies.Footnote 1 In particular, import prices and exchange rates have been the focus of empirical studies trying to determine the main sources of inflation in small open economies. This paper suggests that the USD/EUR exchange rate might be considered as an additional important determinant of inflation in the Central and East European countries (CEEC), an idea that has not been explicitly analysed in previous studies. Our motivation comes from the empirical evidence shown in Figure 1. We see a strong correlation between the first principal component of the CEEC's annual consumer price inflation rates and the annual change in the USD/EUR exchange rate. Despite the existence of quite different monetary and exchange rate regimes in the CEEC, it seems that there are some similarities in their inflation paths that might be accounted for by USD/EUR exchange rate fluctuations. The EUR/USD exchange rate and the principal component of nine CEEC (Romania and Slovenia not included) annual inflation rates. Both series are standardised Most previous studies of pass-through in the CEEC focus on effective exchange rates and assume that the individual country can influence effective exchange rates through monetary policy (for a survey, see Égert and MacDonald, 2006). Contrary to that, we distinguish between the exchange rate of the domestic currency against the euro and the USD/EUR exchange rate and analyse which portion of the variation in inflation in the CEEC can be attributed to the USD/EUR exchange rate, as an external shock. In addition, we study to what extent USD/EUR exchange rate shocks influence inflation. Finally, we attribute the different levels of impact of the USD/EUR exchange rate on inflation among the CEEC to the different exchange rate regimes. To measure the impact of the USD/EUR exchange rate on domestic producers and consumer inflation across countries, we employ the empirical model of pricing along a distribution chain, as in McCarthy (2007). The advantage of this model is that it has a vector autoregression (VAR) representation that allows us to trace the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on inflation at each stage along the distribution chain (importers, producers, and consumers). While McCarthy (2007) studies a large open economy that can influence external factors, we adopt a small country assumption where domestic variables cannot influence external variables. In other words, we represent the model of pricing along the distribution chain in the CEEC with a VAR model with block exogeneity restrictions (external variables) in the spirit of Cushman and Zha (1997).Footnote 2 The imposition of block exogeneity seems a reasonable way to identify foreign shocks from the perspective of the small open economy. Our empirical exercise shows that the USD/EUR exchange rate accounts for the largest share of inflation volatility in the CEEC with stable exchange rates of the domestic currency against the euro. Furthermore, the extent of the USD/EUR exchange rate's influence on inflation in the CEEC is the largest in the economies with stable exchange rate regimes. These results might be important in the context of the price stability requirement of the Maastricht Criteria: in addition to the internal challenge of keeping low inflation and dealing with the difficulties of the price convergence process, the applicant countries could face problems beyond their influence. Given that most of the CEEC peg their currencies to the euro,Footnote 3 either because of the conditions of the ERM-II or because of their domestic issues (euroisation in particular), and taking into account the high volatility of the USD/EUR exchange rate, our findings suggest that the CEEC under a fixed or heavily managed exchange rate might face substantial problems in achieving a high degree of price stability. The decision to include the USD/EUR exchange rate as a separate external factor is motivated by the monetary and exchange rate regimes in the CEEC. These countries are primarily concerned with fluctuations of their exchange rate against the euro: while all countries (will) have to participate in the ERM-II, some countries use the exchange rate against the euro (previously the Deutsche Mark) to reduce imported inflation and anchor inflation expectations. Since the USD/EUR exchange rate is determined on the global financial market, neither an individual country is able to influence it nor can it influence the world prices. Hence, it cannot simultaneously manage both its bilateral exchange rate against the euro and against the dollar. For this reason, we refrain from using the effective exchange rate, which combines the managed exchange rate against the euro and the exchange rate against the dollar.Footnote 4 Therefore, for countries with heavily managed exchange rates to the euro, the USD/EUR exchange rate in fact represents an external shock. By focussing on the stability of their domestic currencies against the euro, the CEEC effectively reduce the exchange rate pass-through of goods priced in euros to domestic inflation. However, since a number of commodities are priced in dollars, there is still a pass-through from the dollar, which is amplified by the USD/EUR exchange rate fluctuations. This paper is organised as follows. The second section illustrates the model of pricing along the distribution chain applied to the CEEC. The third section describes the VAR methodology with block exogenous restrictions. The fourth section describes the data used and provides a basic description of monetary and exchange rate regimes in the CEEC. Results are presented in the fifth section, along with a discussion of the impact of the USD/EUR on disaggregated data to confirm our understanding of the transmission channel. The special case of the regime change in Lithuania, where the currency peg was changed from the dollar to the euro, is also presented. The final section concludes.",4

New issues can give rise to new branches of economics. The Great Depression gave rise to macroeconomics. The collapse of Soviet socialism gave rise to transition economics. The backwardness of at first south-east Europe and then of the ex-colonial world gave rise to development economics. The existence of the USSR with its distinctive non-market economic system, the worldwide spread of Soviet-style socialism, and its attractiveness throughout the world also gave rise to a new branch of economics, often known as economic Sovietology. This comprised a prolonged and intensive study of the Soviet economy, particularly in the USA, between the end of the Second World War and the collapse of the USSR. These new branches of economics naturally applied many mainstream economic ideas to their new study-objects. However, they encountered many phenomena not previously studied by mainstream economics. These new phenomena, and their analysis, in turn contributed much to mainstream economics. This has been explained, with reference to development economics, by Bardhan (1993). The purpose of this paper is to make a comparable argument for economic Sovietology.Footnote 1",10

According to population pessimists, because of the large outflow of the working age population from transition economies, declining fertility requires an immediate policy response from both an economic and a social point of view. In contrast to the West European countries that face a similar fertility trend, the transition economies are less able to attract a large flow of immigrants, and ultimately will face the repercussions of an ageing society. However, other observers argue that there is a tight connection between rising per capita incomes and declining fertility rates and that, given the success of the transition in raising income levels, policy measures to raise fertility are likely to be ineffective. I build on this current debate between pro-natalists, who support government policies to influence families’ child-bearing decisions and encourage them to have more children, and those who doubt, on practical, political or moral grounds, whether these policy changes are necessary or effective in addressing the declining fertility trend in the region. By synthesising recent theoretical findings and newly developed econometric techniques, I examine the short- and the long-run relationship between fertility and economic growth in a transition economy, Ukraine, and identify the channels through which they interact. My primary purpose is to quantify the magnitude of the impact of macroeconomic factors on fertility and to examine the policy options for reversing the declining fertility trend. Although most economists agree that the macroeconomy has an important effect on family decisions, the magnitude of these interactions is not very clear. In order to fill this gap, I use a newly assembled data set, consisting of monthly information on unemployment, births, money holdings, and growth in one of the low-fertility East European economies, Ukraine, for the period 1996–2005. Using these data, I provide the evidence on the time frame over which socio-economic events have an impact on fertility in Ukraine. In attempting to measure the extent to which macroeconomic conditions affect fertility we must bear in mind that the population and the economy evolve jointly. It is not only fertility that affects economic performance but also economic variables that shape demographic developments. In this paper we demonstrate that families’ fertility decisions, labour market conditions, money holdings, and economic growth are, indeed, interrelated. Moreover, by employing a multivariable vector autoregression (VAR) model that captures the interactions between all variables under consideration, I show that, in Ukraine, labour market conditions and households’ money holdings are important determinants of family decisions to bear and rear children. I find that the birth rate sharply increases immediately following a money holdings disturbance. While in the very short run an unemployment shock adversely affects fertility, over a longer horizon it stimulates households to increase child bearing. The impact of unemployment shocks and money holdings shocks can be seen for up to 2 years, with a slowly diminishing effect on fertility. I find that the relationships between fertility, the labour market, and money holdings are significant both in a statistical and an economic sense. Unemployment disturbances and monetary incentives explain more than a third (13.6% and 20.6%, respectively) of fertility variations in Ukraine. I show that, in the short run, money holdings cannot be considered neutral with respect to households’ child-bearing decisions, and correspondingly, a policy maker may employ childcare transfers as an effective mean to address declining fertility. The paper is organised as follows. The next section explores recent studies on the dynamic modelling of the relationship between fertility choice and economic growth and analyses the gaps in this literature. The subsequent section presents a vector autoregressive model to estimate short-run responses of labour market, fertility, money holdings, and output growth to disturbances in a transition economy. The empirical study includes impulse response, variance decomposition, and sensitivity analyses. The last two sections conclude by interpreting the results, offering policy implications, and suggesting possible avenues for future research.",4
51,1,Comparative Economic Studies,16 February 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2008.21,Is Inflation Perceived by Polish Consumers Driven by Prices of Frequently Bought Goods and Services?,March 2009,Tomasz Łyziak,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The existence of divergences between economic agents’ subjective opinions concerning current price developments and statistical inflation indicators creates a challenge for monetary policy makers. In particular, a gap between the two variables may lower the credibility of monetary policy, influencing expectations about future price changes and distorting decisions on prices and wages. The empirical literature suggests that a rapid increase in prices of frequently purchased products was one of the principal factors explaining increased consumers’ inflation perception in the euro area member states after the launch of the new currency. A similar phenomenon where the price increases of frequently bought goods were significantly higher than the overall inflation rate characterised the period of Polish accession to the European Union (EU). The phenomenon was mainly due to the rapid growth of food prices, which exceeded consumer price index (CPI) inflation by 2.8 percentage points on average in the year of accession, 2004. Fluctuations of relative prices of this kind offer a good basis for analysing the impact of price changes of frequently bought goods and services on Polish consumers’ inflation perception, which is the aim of this study. In order to do this I calculate different proxies of price changes of frequently purchased products and examine their correlation with survey-based measures of consumers’ inflation perception. The paper is structured as follows: the next section reviews the empirical literature on the impact of price changes of frequently bought items on consumer inflation perception in the Economic and Monetary Union member states after the launch of the euro; the subsequent section describes the data on Polish consumers’ inflation perceptions and price changes of frequently purchased goods and services used in the study and then the later section presents the results of the analyses; and the last section concludes.",10

Rapid growth since the late 1990s raised the question of how to ensure that the oil boom will bring enduring prosperity, and among the policy responses have been establishment of an oil fund, direction of resources into human capital formation, and promotion of economic diversification. This paper focuses on one aspect of the diversification strategy, the promotion of agriculture. Specifically, it reports estimates of producer support in order to assess whether announced polices resulted in improved incentives for farmers during the period 2000–2004. The agricultural sector is a major part of Kazakhstan's economy, with between a quarter and a half of the population depending upon it.Footnote 2 Following the Virgin Lands programme of the late 1950s and 1960s, Kazakhstan became a major grain producer, on top of the traditional pastoral economy and a cotton sector concentrated in the south. After independence the agricultural sector experienced a severe decline; the annual growth rate of agricultural value-added in 1990–2001 was −3.22%. The decline was reversed around the turn of the century, and from 1999 to 2004 agricultural output grew at over 5% a year, mostly due to increased crop production while livestock growth was more modest.Footnote 3 One reason for the decline was a policy vacuum, which saw the rapid switch in the early 1990s from support for farmers to a market situation where prices of inputs rose much faster than output prices. The policy situation was reversed in the early 2000s as the government responded to the oil boom by promoting economic diversification, which included generous support for agriculture. The first two sections of this paper examine the historical background and the evolution of policies since independence. The third section presents estimates of the budgetary support to and price distortions facing farmers, with emphasis on three principal and different sectors of the farm economy: the grains which dominate agricultural exports, the livestock sector, and the regionally concentrated cotton sector. The ultimate goal of the quantitative exercise is to determine whether policy statements about promoting agriculture are captured in measures of producer support or whether they were empty announcements. The fourth section draws conclusions.",2
51,2,Comparative Economic Studies,18 May 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2009.2,"Russia from Bust to Boom and Back: Oil Price, Dutch Disease and Stabilisation Fund",June 2009,Bruno Merlevede,Koen Schoors,Bas Van Aarle,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Russia is the largest neighbour of the enlarged European Union (EU). The economies of the EU and Russia are increasingly integrated through rising flows of goods, services, capital and people between the two blocks. Russia also plays an important strategic role as a supplier of energy and raw materials to the EU, decreasing the EU's dependence on Middle East energy sources. Gaining insight in the economy of this strategic partner to the EU is therefore not without importance. In this paper we model Russia's macroeconomic evolution during the last decade (1995–2007) and use this model to simulate Russia's economic future under several scenarios. The period of transitional recession before the Russian crisis of 1998 was marked by high inflation, failing stabilisation and disappointing macroeconomic performance. Although the Russian government embarked on an exchange rate-based stabilisation in 1995, it did not succeed to balance its budget and had to draw increasingly on foreign lending to fund its recurrent deficits. This unsustainable policy mix and the prolonged political and economic instability culminated in a severe economic and political crisis in August 1998. The Russian government was forced to abandon its exchange rate policy, devalue the ruble, suspend payments on government paper and announce a moratorium on the Russian foreign debt. By 20 September the ruble had fallen from 6 to 22 rubles per dollar.Footnote 1
 Rather than the expected final blow, the crisis turned out to be Russia's economic catharsis.Footnote 2 Indeed, real GDP growth after 1999 averaged 7% annually and the volatility of nominal variables such as prices, wages, interest rates and exchange rates has declined markedly. Several explanations for the recent good macroeconomic performance of Russia have been suggested. Ahrend (1999) claims that the deadly stabilisation of 1995–1997 was the consequence of an inappropriate exchange rate policy. The overvaluation of the ruble during the period of the ‘corridor’ policy yielded stabilisation at the cost of a prolonged economic recession. In the line of this argument the devaluation of the ruble in August 1998 kickstarted economic growth through a broad process of import substitution across all sectors. Others put forward that Russia's economic boom is largely explained by the oil price. Owing to a string of external events oil prices increased rapidly after 1998 from a relatively low level below $15 to more than $90 per barrel in 2007. As largest crude oil producer and second-largest crude oil exporter of the world, Russia strongly benefited from higher world oil prices. Finally, some political economists argue that the political and economic stabilisation brought by president Putin reduced economic and political risk, which supposedly created the confidence and trust so badly needed for economic recovery (see, eg, Berglöf et al., 2003). This also allowed the Putin administration to initiate a number of interesting fiscal policy reforms. We develop and estimate a dynamic open economy macro-model of Russia. The model contains the basic macroeconomic relations that govern macroeconomic adjustment,Footnote 3 but it is also specifically tailored to capture the effects of the oil price, private sector confidence and fiscal policy reform on the Russian economy. Our main variable of interest is the oil price. In our view, it is not sufficient to estimate the oil price elasticity of exports, the current account or government revenues. Fiscal policy, the exchange rate and exports are only three direct channels through which the oil price affects the Russian economy. Indirectly, all other variables in the model will be affected through second-order effects. We then employ the model to simulate Russia's economic future under different scenarios regarding the oil price, private sector confidence and fiscal policy. The simulations suggest that the Russian economy is vulnerable to downward oil price shocks. We find two mechanisms that mitigate the economic effects of oil price shocks, namely the stabilisation brought by the Oil Stabilisation Fund (OSF) and the Dutch disease effect. The effect of a negative shock in private sector confidence on real GDP turns out to be comparable in magnitude to the effect of an oil price shock, although the transmission of both shocks runs along different channels. The fiscal policies of the Putin administration are found to temper the economic fluctuations caused by oil price shocks. In the next section we present the model. The subsequent section describes the data and the estimation methodology and comments on the estimation results. In the penultimate section we evaluate how oil price shocks, changes in private sector confidence and in fiscal policy influence Russia's economic future by means of a set of simulations. The final section summarises and presents conclusions.",15
51,2,Comparative Economic Studies,18 May 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2009.1,Rationality as a Barrier to Peace: Micro-evidence from Kosovo,June 2009,Sumon Kumar Bhaumik,Ira N Gang,Myeong-Su Yun,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Economists have often viewed social conflict as an outcome of competition to control natural resources (Hirshleifer, 1995) in contexts where collective action is costly or infeasible. Others have argued that such competition does not necessarily explain the existence of armed conflicts, given that armed conflicts inflict significant damage on all parties involved. If, however, there is a breakdown of the social contract involving redistribution of resources among different groups of individuals using fiscal mechanisms, and if this breakdown results in increasing uncertainty about the share of these competing groups in society's resources, armed conflict may be an outcome (Skarperdas, 1992; Azam and Mesnard, 2003). The intensity of the conflict is exacerbated in an environment where past grievances are well entrenched within one or more of the competing groups (Collier and Hoeffler, 1999). On the other hand, if the gains from the absence of conflict are clearly observable, for example, in a period of economic growth, there is a significant reduction in the likelihood of social or civil conflict (Miguel et al., 2004). 
Addison and Murshed (2001) argue that, even though elimination of conflict is socially optimal, it is often not a feasible option because it is in the interest of one or more of the parties involved in the conflict to renege on a peace agreement. The final outcome depends on factors such as the payoff to these parties on account of the conflict and the extent to which they discount the future. Esteban and Ray (1999, 2008) demonstrate that a conflict can be aggravated by, among other factors, an increase in within-group inequality. Relatively affluent sections of the groups are then in a position to induce members of the relatively poor sections to join the conflict somewhat inexpensively, given that the poorer people in these groups have low opportunity costs of time. In their framework, an increase in the average income of one group relative to the other, however, has an ambiguous impact on the extent of the conflict. On the one hand, the group whose income increases is in a better position to bear the monetary cost of intensifying the conflict. On the other hand, to the extent that this increase in income is across the board within the group, there is an increase in the opportunity cost of the group members such that fewer among them might want to get involved in the conflict. However, others have argued that between-group inequality may also be an important source of conflict, especially if the groups are formed along ethnic lines (Stewart, 2002). While social scientists have examined the rationale for and economic cost of social conflicts (eg, Azar et al., 1978; Colletta and Cullen, 2000; Abadie and Gardiezabal, 2001), there have been few systematic attempts to link the above theoretical literature on social conflicts to the available micro-level information about the people who are involved in these conflicts, if any. Much of the empirical analysis has involved the use of cross-country data to identify covariates of civil war and the impact of such wars on macroeconomic variables like capital stock and gross domestic product (Collier and Hoeffler, 1998; Collier, 1999). This lacuna in the literature possibly owes its origin to the paucity of detailed individual or household-level data in most contexts of active civil conflict. Yet, to the extent that at least some of the conflicts are a consequence of optimal decisions of individuals and/or socio-economic groups, often resulting in failure of rival groups to arrive at a mutually acceptable bargaining outcome, it is necessary to understand the factors that influence the reservation payoffs of these individuals or groups during conflicts. In this paper, we address this lacuna using micro-level data from a context where pre-conditions for conflict like grievance and failure of social contract exist, such that an externally enforced peace contract is fragile, and yet for which the relevant data are available. We use household-level data from Kosovo to attempt to reconcile some of the theories associated with social conflict with the empirical evidence. Kosovo is an interesting case where it is not difficult to explain the reason for the conflict (see, eg, Waller et al., 2001), and it is also relatively easy to explain the intransigence of Serbia, which has been presented with a fait accompli in the form of the acceptance of the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovar Albanians (henceforth Albanians) by a number of major European Union (EU) countries and the United States of America (USA). But it is more difficult to explain the persistence of resistance to a final solution by the Kosovar Serbs (henceforth Serbs), as well as the absence of any magnanimous gesture on the part of the Albanians given that both the Serbs and the Albanians are likely to reap peace dividends.Footnote 1 On the basis of our empirical findings, and drawing on other literature on Kosovo, we comment on the likelihood of a mutually acceptable political resolution of the conflict in Kosovo in the foreseeable future.Footnote 2
 It should be noted that this paper does not aim to provide a comprehensive political analysis of the Kosovo conflict. The conflict provides a backdrop in which the two parties that are at odds share mutual mistrust born out of actual and perceived grievances that makes bargaining difficult. There are political dimensions to these grievances and the resultant mistrust that are not analysed in this paper. Instead, it focuses on economic aspects of the crisis. Recent economic literature, cited above, has identified various economic factors such as income distribution that can help prolong conflicts. We first estimate measures of poverty and income inequality to see whether they can explain the persistence of the conflict. Next, we examine the proposition that both the Serbs and Albanians are able to prolong the stalemate, which indicates that their reservation utilities are high such that neither is able to make concessions that would make bargaining attractive to the other party, thereby bringing the latter to the table and enabling the two to proceed to a mutually acceptable endgame. Specifically, we use regression analysis to identify possible reasons that would either make the status quo acceptable to the Serbs and Albanians, relative to an uncertain post-settlement future, and/or factors that would help sustain their consumption levels even during the current conflict, thereby making their positions entrenched and increasing their reluctance to make concessions that can lead to meaningful discussions and negotiations. The empirical analysis in this paper provides an economic rationale for high reservation utilities that are possibly playing a role in forestalling such negotiations. As in the case of any economic study, it takes as given the political complexities in Kosovo, and this ceteris paribus nature of the analysis has to be kept in perspective while drawing policy conclusions from it. Our results indicate that comparable levels of intra-group inequality and poverty are found among Serb and Albanian households. As Serbs constitute a very small proportion of the overall population, the comparability of inequality and poverty outcomes should be firm groundwork for conflict resolution. However, analysis of intra- and inter-group variations in consumption indicate that much of the variation within and between groups is not easily accountable for by observable factors, making it difficult to target policies aimed at reducing poverty and inter-group differences in living standards. This makes it plausible for both ethnic groups to stake a claim to victimisation and unfair treatment, such that the neutrality of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), which started administering the province after NATO intervention in 1999, is brought into question. Finally, while Serb households have a good reason to prefer the status quo under UNMIK governance over an Albanian-dominated independent Kosovo, the Albanians have an equally good reason to not make the magnanimous gestures involving resource transfers that might elicit a peace-oriented response from the Serbs. In view of the analysis, a political resolution of the Kosovo conflict in the immediate future might remain elusive unless an external agency like the EU makes a credible commitment, such as fast-track EU membership, that can significantly increase the benefits of bringing an end to the conflict while simultaneously ensuring that EU institutions would guarantee that agreements about sharing of resources made by the Serbs are honoured ex post. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: In the next section, we briefly outline the nature of the conflict in Kosovo. The data and the issues concerning within-group and between-group heterogeneity in consumption are discussed in the subsequent section. The empirical analysis used to estimate the impact of household-level characteristics on the per capita consumption of Albanian and Serb households are reported in the penultimate section. In the final section, we comment on the likelihood of a negotiated political solution to the conflict and conclude.",5

They refer to productivity gains generated by the geographical concentration of economic activities. Agglomeration economies may stem from the grouping of firms of the same industry, which are called localisation economies, or are related to the scale of the whole city, which are referred to as urbanisation economies. Traditionally, urban economists have resorted to agglomeration economies to explain the existence and growth of cities. There are also negative externalities related to the expansion of cities. Consequently, in city system models, urban size is determined by the interaction among these opposed forces (Henderson, 1974, 1988). Numerous studies have attempted to test the existence of agglomeration economies. Kawashima (1975), Sveikauskas (1975), Segal (1976), Forgarty and Garofalo (1978) and Moomaw (1981, 1985) estimate the effect of city population size on labour productivity in the USA. Generally, they find positive effects of city size on productivity, showing the existence of urbanisation economies. Evidence of localisation economies is also provided by Nakamura (1985) and Henderson (1986), with localisation proxied by employment in a given industry. Recently, Au and Henderson (2006) measured net agglomeration benefits using Chinese city data. They found an inverted U shape of real income per worker against city employment. The role of the density of economic activities is emphasised by some researchers (Ciccone and Hall, 1996; Harris and Ioannides, 2000; Ciccone, 2002). They argue that density is fundamental to the theory of agglomeration economies, and that a greater density of economic activities generates more advantages to productivity. This article attempts to test the existence of agglomeration economies in Chinese cities by estimating the impact of both factors, scale and the density of city population, on urban productivity. China has resumed its economic and urban growth since the launch of economic reforms. There is a consensus that the country has delayed urbanisation, but the form that future urbanisation should take remains controversial. As in many developing countries, planners are highly concerned about the negative effects of city size growth and excessive urban concentration, although urbanisation is increasingly perceived as a potentially beneficial process (Jones and Visaria, 1997; Henderson, 2003). In fact, urban policy in China has long favoured the growth of small and medium-sized cities relative to large cities. This policy of restricting the growth of large cities may lead to large productivity losses, if large cities are likely to generate greater agglomeration economies. It is thus interesting to examine whether cities in China are too large or too small in order to identify the most appropriate urban growth pattern, especially when we recognise the significant role of city growth in absorbing surplus rural labour and in the structural transformation of the economy. Using a panel of about 150 Chinese cities, this article explains labour productivity differences among cities by urban size and density. Specifically, we attempt to answer two questions: Do larger cities have productivity advantages over smaller cities? Does the density of urban economic activities have any effect on productivity? The remainder of the article is organised as follows: In the next section we briefly review urban policies and urban growth in China. In the subsequent section, we summarise the literature related to agglomeration economies. The penultimate section presents the data, the methodology and the results of econometric analysis. The last section provides some concluding remarks.",19
51,3,Comparative Economic Studies,21 May 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2008.49,Market Segmentation and the Location of Production Activities,September 2009,Haoming Liu,Sarah Yueting Tong,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"It has been well documented that plants are far from randomly allocated across geographic locations. For example, Ellison and Glaeser (1997) observed that the concentration levels of 446 out of a total of 459 four-digit industries in the United States are higher than what would be expected if all plants are allocated randomly across states. While there is no lack of explanations for this phenomenon, few researchers have tried to link the degree of industry concentration with market segmentation, especially at the national level, except for Bai et al. (2004). Bai et al.'s (2004) study is based on a very intuitive idea that, due to local governments’ strong incentives to protect highly profitable local industries, their markets are far from integrated at the national level. This in turn prevents these industries to reach their optimal geographic concentration levels. Using Chinese provincial-level data, they indeed find that an industry's concentration level is negatively correlated with its profitability, which is in contrast to a large body of US empirical studies (eg Bain, 1951; Dalton and Penn, 1976) who find that profit rates are higher in highly concentrated industries. Indeed, the issue of local protection and market segmentation within China has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Debates have been focused on whether economic reforms, including decentralisation and market liberalisation, have raised the degree of local protection and thus worsened efficiency. Extensive empirical literature has been written to investigate the extent and the overall trend in China's market segmentation. Using provincial and industry data, studies identify the existence of substantial local protectionism against trade across provincial borders. However, these studies failed to reach a general consensus on the overall movement in the degree of market segmentation in recent years. An early study carried out by Kumar (1994) concludes that China has a poorly integrated national market. The main characteristics include dispersed production capacities, decreasing inter-regional trade flows, declining inter-provincial investment, and poor labour market integration. Young (2000) shows that production structures across provinces are converging, using either three-sector or five-sector data, and concludes that local protectionism in China has risen during the 1980s and early 1990s. Using provincial trade flows, which are derived through combining China's trade data and provincial input–output tables, Poncet (2003, 2005) argues that Chinese provinces’ greater involvement in international trade was associated with a decrease in domestic trade flow intensity between 1987 and 1997, concluding that Chinese reforms did not reduce impediments to inter-provincial trade flows. In contrast, Naughton (2003), using inter-provincial trade data, finds that the degree of market segmentation was lower in 1992 than in 1987. By analysing tri-monthly Chinese provincial grain prices from 1988 to 1995, Park et al. (2002) find evidence of highly integrated agricultural markets. Zhang and Tan (2007) also show that product market has become more integrated in recent years. Employing two-digit manufacturing industry data between 1985 and 1997, Bai et al. (2004) conclude that China's specialisation of industrial production has reversed an early drop in the mid-1980s and registered a significant increase in the later years. Using a rich, newly available firm-level data set, this paper revisits the issue of local protection within China that leads to market segmentation and potential efficiency loss. The firm-level information provides us a number of advantages. First, with firm data, we are able to obtain a much better measure of production concentration, proposed first in Ellison and Glaeser (1997). Second, spanning from 1998 to 2002, the data reflect the more recent changes in Chinese industry structure. More significantly, firm-level data enable us not only to analyse the relationship between concentration and profitability of industries, but also to further distinguish the effects of market segmentation from those of various industry-specific characteristics. For example, it is possible that, in the absence of market segmentation, the level of concentration and profitability could be negatively correlated if industries that are mostly dominated by a few extremely large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) also have low profit margins. Presumably, the impact of industry-specific characteristics can be properly addressed by using a fixed-effect model in countries where the industry structure is relatively stable over time. For China, however, this is unlikely to be true in recent decades. Economic reforms since late 1970s have led to not only a rapid expansion but also a substantial restructuring of Chinese industries. Indeed, according to our calculation, the concentration ratio of some industries fell considerably from 1995 to 2002 while that of others increased. For example, the Herfindahl index (H) of ‘electric lighting and wiring equipment manufacturing’ (Standard Industrial Classification [SIC] 407) decreased from 0.0399 in 1995 to 0.0045 in 2002 while that of ‘special industry machinery manufacturing’ (SIC 368) increased from 0.0067 to 0.0504 over the same period. Since aggregate data do not contain any information on an industry's market structure, such as whether the industry is dominated by a few large establishments, studies using this type of data cannot identify the real causes of the negative correlation between geographic concentration and profitability. Following Bai et al. (2004), we first examine the relationship between an industry's profitability and its concentration level. The rationale behind this is that, to maximise its tax revenue, local governments have stronger incentives to attract the most profitable industries. As a result, highly profitable industries will have a lower concentration level. We call this type of protection ‘offensive protection’. Our results indeed show that a lower degree of geographic concentration, measured by the Ellison and Glaeser (1997) index, γ, is negatively associated with lagged profitability. This suggests that local protection may continue to hinder China's market integration process in recent years. Nevertheless, we also find that geographic concentration of industries, measured by γ, has increased consistently and considerably between 1998 and 2002. The same trend is observed with a raw measure of geographic concentration. These results indicate that, while local protection may have slowed down the process of concentration, the overall trend of increasing concentration in the early to mid-1990s continues. Interestingly, we find neither a significant relationship between an industry's profitability and its Herfindahl index, H, nor a clear time trend in H. The empirical evidence documented so far suggests that the negative relationship between γ and profitability is not driven by industry-specific factors. It also suggests that the rise in γ is likely to be driven by the clustering of plants rather than by the increasing market shares of larger plants. In addition to protect highly profitable industries, local governments also have a higher probability to protect industries where local firms cannot compete with non-local firms of the same industry. This is because, comparing with competitive firms that can outperform their competitors in a free market, less competitive firms have stronger incentives to lobby local governments to fence out competition by raising entry barrier for the products of non-local firms. We will refer this type of protection as ‘defensive protection’. Because local protection prevents firms from dying, similar to the impact of offensive protection, defensive protection also prevents these industries from reaching their optimal level. In addition, it will help local weak firms gain market shares or prevent them from losing market shares. In the absence of government interventions, as these firms are less productive than non-protected firms of the same industry located in other provinces, these protected firms should lose rather than gain market shares. Our empirical results show that market shares of firms in protected industries grow faster than firms of the same industries but located in other provinces. This evidence lends further support to the argument that local protection slows down the market integration process in China. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The next section describes an illustrative model on firm location choice and its empirical implications. The subsequent section discusses the data source and empirical findings.

51,3,Comparative Economic Studies,21 May 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2009.5,Happiness and Economic Systems,September 2009,Frederic Pryor,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many studies on the determinants of happiness or subjective well-being (SWB) have explored the impact of particular demographic variables (sex, age, marital status, etc) and also of economic and political performance variables, such as unemployment status, inflation rates, efficiency of government services, civil liberties, and so on. Political and economic systems and the institutions composing them may be another source of SWB but, until recently, their impact has received relatively little attention. In recent years, however, Frey and his colleagues (eg, Frey and Stutzer, 2000, 2002; and Frey, 2008) have shown that SWB varies between Swiss cantons according to the degree of direct democracy; and Helliwell (2002) and Helliwell and Huang (2006) provide cross-country evidence that citizens are happier in nations with constitution establishing presidential systems and some form of proportional voting. The relation between economic systems and happiness has received virtually no serious theoretical or empirical analysis in the scholarly literature in any discipline. In the popular media one sometimes finds two types of vague arguments about this relationship: (a) Some leftwing commentators assert that happiness is greatest in ‘gentle’ welfare states, such as the Nordic nations, while it is lowest in English-speaking nations with their alleged ‘dog-eat-dog’ capitalism. Some rightwing commentators assert the opposite, that Nordic economic systems stifle initiative and frustrate would-be entrepreneurs, while lassez faire capitalism allows people to reach their greatest potential and, thus, become happier. (b) Others seem to say that most people are unmoved by abstract economic arguments and view the economic system instrumentally, that is, they are more concerned with the performance of the economy, rather than the system per se. As the economic performance of the four capitalist economic systems studied in this note are roughly similar by most criteria (Pryor, 2008), this argument can be taken to imply that there is no significant difference in happiness in countries with these different systems. This study is motivated by three concerns: (a) to explore empirically whether the relation found between the political system and happiness also holds for the economic system so that a stylised fact can be established, which can provide a focus on future theoretical economic analysis; (b) to determine which economic institutions are responsible for this relationship, assuming that such a correlation between system and happiness can be found; (c) and to test empirically the two ideological conjectures outlined in the previous paragraph. The next section focuses on three methodological issues: the measurement of happiness, the selection of the sample, and the definition of the economic systems. The subsequent section surveys 53 possible determinants of happiness on a national level and explains why and how I have used principal component analysis to reduce these possible explanatory variables to a manageable number. The next following section presents the results of the regression analysis attempting to relate economic system to the level of happiness. The penultimate section explodes several objections to this type of analysis. The final section summarises the results and explores in greater detail why economic systems do not influence SWB, whereas political systems do. This topic raises a number of intriguing side issues, but because this is a note with very few positive results, rather than a treatise, I leave these matters to others. And for similar reasons I also do not review the happiness literature in-depth.",5

51,4,Comparative Economic Studies,04 June 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2009.8,"Total Factor Productivity Growth, Structural Change and Convergence in the New Members of the European Union",December 2009,El-hadj M Bah,Josef C Brada,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"A key task for the transition economies that have recently joined the European Union (EU) is real convergence, the catching up with the per capita income levels of the older and more developed members. Although some observers have stressed that this process would require extensive investment in physical and human capital (Blanchard, 1997, Buiter, 2000), the growth accounting literature suggests that these are not likely to be the decisive forces leading to convergence. This literature, from Solow (1957) to Prescott (1998) and Hall and Jones (1999), stresses that economic growth as well as inter-county differences in per capita income are largely because of changes, or differences, in total factor productivity, with the accumulation of physical and human capital playing only a subsidiary role.Footnote 1 The EU's own experts (European Union, 2006, p. 35) project that the new member countries’ per capita incomes will grow at about 4% per annum while those of the older and richer members will grow at 2%, leading to a convergence of per capita incomes in 2040. Moreover, the same estimates assume that over 50% of the growth in per capita incomes in both old and new members will be the result of total factor productivity growth rather than of factor accumulation, although, of course, total factor productivity (TFP) growth in the new member countries would thus be about twice as fast as in the old member countries. The ability of the new EU members to generate and sustain significant gains in TFP should not be taken for granted. The USSR and the countries of East Europe saw gains in TFP came to a virtual halt in the early 1980s, if not before then, a situation unprecedented among countries at such a level of development. The first to note the slowdown in TFP growth in the USSR was Kaplan (1968) who showed that, for any plausible parameter values of a Cobb-Douglas production function, Soviet TFP growth was falling towards zero.Footnote 2 The results of similar research for East Europe by researchers in both the West and in the communist countries themselves came to more or less that same conclusion, namely that, by the start of the 1980s, the only sources of growth in East Europe were increases in capital and hours worked, with TFP growth non-existent or negative.Footnote 3 It is possible that the forces that retarded TFP growth so severely during the late communist era have not been entirely eliminated by the process of transition. If the sources of TFP growth cannot be greatly influenced by short-term changes in policies, institutions or economic systems, then the transition economies would be consigned to being second-class members of the EU for a long time.Footnote 4 Alternatively, if TFP does respond quickly to changes in policies, institutions and economic system, then the recent upsurge in TFP growth in the new EU members’ countries could be because of temporary factors, whose effects will soon wear off, a scenario developed in some detail by Van Ark (1999). Hall and Jones (1999) attribute high TFP levels to better institutions, but the new EU members have already undertaken many of the reforms needed to create functioning market economies and to meet the institutional and legal standards of EU membership. Thus, while some institutional improvements may still be possible, their pace, and thus that of TFP growth, may be much slower than it was in the past decade. In contrast to Hall and Jones, Frankel and Romer (1999) stress the role of openness to trade as the driver of TFP, but the new EU member countries have already undertaken as much opening up to international trade and investment as is likely to be feasible and further rapid growth of trade to GDP ratios does not seem likely. Finally, the transition economies, including the new EU members, may have been the beneficiaries of what we may call temporary Prescott--Granick effects that led to rapid, but short-lived, gains in TFP. Prescott (1998) and Parente and Prescott (2000) argue that TFP growth and levels are inversely related to the ability of incumbent workers to prevent the adoption new technologies, work rules and ways of organising production in order to protect the rents that they can earn using older technologies or ways of organising their work. In the case of the transition economies, the pattern of TFP growth can thus be understood in terms of David Granick's (1989) description of the Soviet economy as a ‘job-rights economy’ in which workers had an explicit right to a particular job at a particular location. At the start of the Soviet experiment, unskilled workers were brought into factories from agriculture; they had no rents to preserve and no understanding of their job rights. As workers gained tenure at their places of work, they were also increasingly able to earn rents from operating the existing technology, and they thus had both the ability and the incentives to block the efficient introduction of new technologies and ways of working. As a result, new technology and ways of fully exploiting its productivity-enhancing characteristics could only be introduced into newly built and staffed factories but not into existing ones, thereby sharply reducing TFP growth. In the course of the transition, these job rights disappeared because open unemployment reduced workers’ bargaining power and because socialist-era laws providing these job rights were swept away, and the rents earned by the old industrial elite of the work force disappeared. Thus, in the Prescott--Grancik view, the current accelerated pace of TFP growth in the new EU member countries will continue only so long as workers continue to be unorganised and unable to exert pressure to slow changes in work rules and the fully effective introduction of new technologies. Because the work-place inflexibilities that the Prescott--Granick view considers important barriers to TFP growth are alleged to be the cause of slow productivity growth in the older EU member countries, fears that they will also spread to the new members are not unfounded. Consequently, the future pace of TFP growth in the new EU member countries is both uncertain and of great importance to their future well being. A second and related aspect of real convergence is structural convergence. The communist regimes in East Europe had followed a development strategy that favoured industry and agriculture at the expense of services. Thus, these countries entered the transition, and EU membership, with employment shares in industry and agriculture that were much larger than those found in market economies at similar levels of development and with service sectors that had much lower shares of employment than were to be found in comparable market economies (Gregory, 1970; Ofer, 1976). These disparities in employment carried over to the shares of these sectors in aggregate output as well. As these economies turned to the market to allocate resources, the service sector expanded dramatically while agriculture and industry lost employment share (European Union, 2006), although all of these economies continue to exhibit higher labour shares in agriculture and industry and lower shares in services than are to be found in the older EU member counties. Whether this structural difference is a legacy of communist policies or whether it simply reflects the fact that structural change in favour of services at the expense of agriculture and industry occurs with rising per capita incomes in nearly all market economies is unclear. In either case, structural change is more rapid in the new EU member countries so it remains to be seen whether this faster and ongoing shift of resources between sectors is an important contributor to, or retardant of, aggregate TFP growth.Footnote 5 In principle, it should be possible to undertake growth accounting exercises for the transition economies at the sectoral level, thus measuring TFP levels and their evolution over time, but in reality we face a fundamental problem in estimating the stock of capital. The transition from socialism to capitalism effectively destroyed a large, but unknown, part of the capital stock. Part of the destruction was physical; factories were abandoned and equipment was scrapped or thrown away. Another part of the destruction was what might be called ‘moral’, meaning that the huge changes in the structure of demand and the wholesale acquisition of new and more productive technologies from the West that occurred in the course of transition devalued, or accelerated the depreciation of, much of the communist-era capital stock (Campos and Coricelli, 2002). Studies of this phenomenon have produced estimates of surprisingly large declines in Russian and East European capital stock over the course of the transition. For example, Deliktas and Balcilar (2005) estimate that up to 50% of the communist-era capital stock was destroyed in the early transition.Footnote 6 The various estimates of the excess destruction of capital stock differ in their magnitude as well as in the methodologies utilised to estimate the losses and in the assumptions driving the estimates. Moreover, given the logic of the argument for the destruction of capital, the amount destroyed in each country should depend, inter alia, on the communist-era openness of the country, on its industrial structure, and on the degree of its integration into the CMEA or Soviet economy.Footnote 7 Needless to say, wide divergences in these unofficial estimates of the capital stock lead to wide divergences in estimates of TFP growth and levels in the course of transition (Burda and Severgnini, 2008a). Absent plausible official estimates of sectoral and even aggregate capital stocks and the wide divergence in the unofficial estimates, as well as the lack of sectoral capital stock data, we propose to measure sectoral TFPs without recourse to capital stock data.Footnote 8 Effectively, our approach substitutes readily available data on sectoral employment and aggregate GDP, the constraints on the interrelations between macroeconomic variables derived from a widely used model of economic growth and structural change, and model parameters obtained through calibration for generally unreliable or unavailable data on sectoral capital stocks in the transition economies. This substitution of easily obtainable data and a model and parameters that have proven their value in other applications seems to us to be a useful way to approach the questions that lie at the heart of this paper. A similar data limitation for developing countries has led researchers to develop indirect methods for estimating sectoral TFPs by making use of cross-section prices in a multi-sector growth model similar to the one we use to infer sectoral relative TFPs.Footnote 9 In this paper we use a three-sector model developed by Bah (2008) to infer sectoral TFP time series for the new EU members. This kind of model also has been used by Rogerson (2008) to analyse labour market outcomes in Europe.Footnote 10 The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section ‘A three-sector model of structural transformation’ describes the model, characterises the competitive equilibrium and calibrates the model to the US economy. Section ‘Estimates of sectoral TFP in Austria and transition economics’ applies the model to Austria and to a sample of transition countries to demonstrate differences in sectoral TFP levels and their change relative to Austria, an EU member with a per capita output close to the (old member) EU average and with some similarities in size and location to a number of the transition economies. With a few exceptions, in all sectors Austrian TFP exceeds that of the new member countries, but there are important sectoral differences in TFP between the new EU member countries and Austria. Moreover, not all members’ TFPs are progressing in all sectors in a way that promotes catch-up with Austrian per capita income. Although structural change does not appear to be a serious barrier to growth in the new EU member countries, some of them are found to rely heavily on input growth rather than TFP improvements for their GDP growth. The last section draws out some policy implications of our findings.",31

Since 1990, growth in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) has averaged 5.1% compared with 1.8% in the EU-15.Footnote 1 Yet, this convergence of GDP per capita has often not been rapid enough for some critics and has stoked the political nostalgia for the days of socialism and central planning. Certainly, a proper assessment of the Great European Integration episode will be a long-term project involving many different dimensions, and a single indicator such as GDP per capita may not do proper justice to it suffice, even if economists are convinced that it is the correct measure. In this paper, we assess the progress that has been made in the short period since 1994 in the new market economies of Europe along the dimension of total factor productivity (TFP), which is a measure of both technological progress as well as technical efficiency. As TFP growth is the source of all sustainable improvements in standards of living, it seems imperative to get good measurements of it as well as to understand its determinants. This paper constructs three different measures of productivity growth in a set of European economies: the standard Solow residual plus two alternatives which we have proposed elsewhere as an answer to measurement problems arising in transition economies countries (Burda and Severgnini, 2009). In doing so, we will also assess the determinants of TFP growth in the established Western European countries. This task appears all the more important, as EU membership increasingly represents a Janus-faced economic challenge for the newcomers. On the one hand, EU trade integration has proceeded briskly since the completion of the internal market in the late 1980s and has accelerated since the accession of the ‘new EU-12’ (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia). As evidence of this trade integration, consider that in 1995 German exports represented 22% of GDP, but by 2007 had risen to over 45%. The lion's share of this increase has been to the new accession nations and the rest of the EU. The other face of Janus is the heavy hand of the EU's common external tariff and product and labor market regulations. In particular, the acquis communautaires have added to the regulatory burden of enterprises and may make convergence of the poorer members more difficult. Although the return to Europe contains much promise of economic order and stability, it also contains the prospect of adopting regulations which, in the medium term, may slow or even prevent convergence to the high standards of living already enjoyed in developed Western Europe. After assessing evidence from 30 European economies in the period 1994–2004, we conclude that TFP growth was consistently higher in Central and Eastern relative to Western Europe and has even risen for some latecomers to market reforms (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Russia, and Ukraine). These gains probably have more to do with the elimination of inefficiencies in production, distribution, and administration infrastructure than with technological progress. We also find that TFP growth in the ‘New Europe’ – not in the sense of NATO and defence policy but rather of supply side reforms – has consistently outpaced that of ‘Old Europe’. In the last section, we present suggestive evidence that product, but not labor market regulation may have had a role in determining the evolution of TFP growth in Western Europe in a period when cross-country differences appear to have increased.",24

Concerning the employment target, one can see progress in Europe in recent years. The employment rate has increased from about 60% in the mid 1990s to 68% in 2008 and is approaching the Lisbon target. There is, however, no similar development for productivity. Europe has stopped to catch up with the US since the mid 1990s, leaving a productivity gap of about 10%. This can be seen as an evidence for conditional convergence. It looks as if European institutional arrangements and knowledge expenditure levels prevent further convergence. This paper therefore concentrates on reform areas that could increase the rate of innovation and knowledge investment in the EU. It is widely recognised by now that knowledge investment is a key to economic growth and there is a link between the growth rate of technical progress and knowledge investment, both in the form of higher R&D spending or increased education expenditure. For example, the OECD (2003) estimates that increasing R&D by 0.1% points could increase GDP by about 1.2%, while de la Fuente (2003) estimates that 1 year of additional education could raise GDP in the EU by 4% to 6%. However, it is also evident that it is not in the power of governments to increase R&D spending (of the private sector) directly. Instead one has to think about appropriate policies that induce firms to increase intangible investment. These can take a variety of forms, for example, tax incentives, changes in market structure, supporting public R&D efforts, increasing the pool of qualified R&D personnel etc. This paper provides such a quantitative evaluation of alternative policy measures. For this analysis we make use of an endogenous growth extension of the Commission's QUEST III model (see Ratto et al. (2009)), which is a standard Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model (DSGE). The framework that we adopt is the Jones (1995, 2005) extension of the Romer (1990) endogenous growth model, which uses a variety approach for modelling knowledge investment. We will start by looking at a direct policy measure, namely a tax credits for R&D investment. Tax credits for R&D investment have become more popular as several EU Member States, notably Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands have switched from direct R&D funding towards tax incentives (see European Commission (2007)). Secondly, an indirect policy measure we consider is increasing competition in the service sector. Although the service sector does by itself not directly invest in R&D, raising competition can stimulate knowledge investment in downstream sectors. Thirdly, we also explore other structural impediment for higher innovation spending, such as entry barriers for new firms both in the form of high financing costs for start-ups and administrative barriers. There is substantial empirical evidence on high entry barriers for start-ups in the EU compared to other countries in the OECD, notably the US. Finally we will also look at the effects of increasing the share of high-skilled workers. Here we explore the economic consequences of the European Commission's ‘blue card’ proposal that aims at boosting high-skilled immigration into the EU. These four dimensions cover a wide spectrum of possible measures to increase knowledge investment in the EU. Because there could be short-run costs of reforms we do not only show long-run effects but also provide the full dynamic solution for the relevant variables. The paper is organised as follows. The following section documents the deficiencies of the EU in the area of innovation. The ‘Model’ section contains a detailed description of the model. The subsequent section discusses calibration and estimation of structural parameters and provides a comparison with the US, which we use as a benchmark. The penultimate section presents and discusses the various reform scenarios. The final section concludes.",5
51,4,Comparative Economic Studies,23 July 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2009.14,Regulatory Reform and Competition: How to Push the Agenda Forward. A European Perspective,December 2009,Alberto Heimler,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In most European countries, the 1980s have been a turning point for economic policy, with competition and liberalizations becoming the point of reference of government action. European institutions played a very important role, both directly and indirectly. In the late 1980s, the European Commission started to liberalize public utilities by adopting directives and regulations legally binding on member States. The process was not always smooth since, especially in the early days, many member States legally challenged the Commission initiatives. The first EC Directive, which in 1988 liberalized the market for telephone terminal equipment,Footnote 1 was challenged in front of the European Court of Justice by five countries (France, Italy, Belgium, Germany and Greece),Footnote 2 on the ground that the Commission lacked the legal power to issue such legislation. The Court upheld the Commission's initiative, but even so the choice to liberalize was not fully accepted at the national level. Many member States delayed as much as they could the adoption of further liberalization measures. For example, Directive 90/388/EEC,Footnote 3 which liberalized value-added telecommunications services (short of voice services), was implemented in Italy with a 3-year delay in 1994, when it became clear that failure to comply would have led to the opening of infringement proceedings (with the risk of high sanctions). EC influence was not always resisted. Indeed, in the course of the 1990s, all European member States adopted a domestic competition law fully convergent with the antitrust provisions of the Treaty. Interestingly, these laws have assigned to domestic antitrust authorities the power to advocate in favor of competition-oriented reforms. As a result of the involvement of national competition authorities in the process of regulatory reform, the arguments in favor of competition have entered the political debate, a radical change for many jurisdictions in continental Europe. In Italy, the antitrust Authority was given full powers to independently advocate for competition, even ex officio, unlike the French Conseil de la Concurrence, which could only intervene upon a governmental request,Footnote 4 or like the German Monopol Kommission, a different body altogether from the German competition Authority and lacking any enforcement powers. From 1990 to 2007, the Italian Authority issued almost 450 advocacy reports aimed at promoting competition, a number unmatched by any other competition authority in the European Union (EU). An interesting feature of the Italian experience is that these advocacy reports were taken up immediately when they showed that a draft law was contrary to Community obligations. In these cases, the Authority's reports served a subsidiary function, avoiding infringement proceedings being opened against Italy. The arguments in favor of competition were not very important. The second category of successful interventions consists of reports intended to prevent a weakening of the Authority's powers or a narrowing of the scope of competition law. In such cases, the opinion of the Authority was considered valuable and worth following. In most other instances, the Authority's advocacy reports were covered in the press, sometimes with large headlines, but failed to influence reform, at least in the short run.Footnote 5 The major benefit of the Authority's advocacy reports was to propose competition as an effective political tool for achieving a higher rate of growth, eliminating rigidities in many markets, especially in private services, a sector traditionally characterized by widespread protections and intrusive controls. The extensive press coverage that accompanied these reports eventually increased the reputation of competition among policy-makers. The culture of competition in the country substantially improved as a result. It has certainly been an advantage that, when reforms were politically mature, the competition-oriented solution was already there and available to be picked up. The advocacy reports of the Authority represented the archive where interested ministers could look for practical ideas of reform. In 1998, the minister of industry,Footnote 6 aiming at the modernization of the Italian legislation on retail trade, eliminated unnecessary restraints to competition, relying on the suggestions contained in a report of the antitrust Authority published 5 years earlier. More recently, in June 2006 and January 2007, the same minister, this time the minister for economic development, intervened again with far-reaching measures to liberalize many sectors of the Italian economy, from the professions, to banks, insurance companies, cafeterias, restaurants and pharmacies, drawing directly on about thirty of the Authority's advocacy reports, which were cited in the press releases issued by the ministry as having provided a baseline for the Government's action. Some institutional/procedural change may be required to enhance the probability that governments choose the market solution. In particular, the adoption of regulatory impact analysis (RIA) (providing that reform be accompanied by a cost benefit analysis that justifies them)Footnote 7 and of competition impact assessment (according to which any disproportionate restriction of competition needs to be justified)Footnote 8 would force a technical discussion of the different options available and ease the adoption of competition-oriented reforms, thus avoiding the introduction of unjustified restrictions. Competition impact assessment shares the methodology followed by antitrust authorities in their competition advocacy reports, but it overcomes some of their weaknesses, providing the market solution at an early stage in the government decision-making process, at a time when a political consensus on a given solution has not yet been found. Furthermore, while the opinion of the antitrust Authority is not required by any procedure and is often met by some irritation on the part of policy-makers, competition impact assessment is part of the procedure for effective law making. The experience of many OECD countries shows that requiring a justification for every regulatory restriction ensures that the market solution is explicitly considered, enhancing the possibility that it is chosen. The paper addresses first the role the EU has played in the process of market liberalization. Then it gives some examples based on the Italian experience of the positive impact of antitrust authorities on the process of regulatory reform. Finally, it discusses the procedures, like RIA and competition impact assessment, that would more systematically promote markets free of unjustified regulatory restrictions.",3

Since 1993 it has been officially termed a ‘socialist market economy’. The CCP has recognized private property in law and engineered a shrinking share of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Even so, the 24 Chinese companies on the Fortune 500 list for 2007 were either owned or controlled by the state. Oligopolistically competitive SOEs dominate strategic sectors, such as oil and telecommunications. The Party still appoints many, perhaps a majority, of all enterprise managers, particularly in the SOEs (Naughton, p. 317, Pei, p. 31). The state also sets prices for grain, energy, transportation, steel, and other inputs, as well as interest rates on deposits. Banks are almost all state-owned and allocate loans according to Party directives. CCP leadership legitimizes retaining (and perhaps enhancingFootnote 2) its hierarchical rule and activism in capital markets and investments by unmatched growth of material product and China's rising standing in the world. China's development pattern since 1978 is a result of experimentation and political deals, rather than a strategy worked out and enunciated at any point of time (Huang, p. 104; cf. Rodrik, p. 23). The most active period of reform was the 1980s. After Tiananmen Square, the regime seemed to hesitate and substitute foreign investment for encouragement of native capitalists. Indigenous Chinese firms experienced great difficulty entering sensitive sectors, including finance, telecommunications, petrochemicals, and even automobiles (Pei, p. 32). To rule this huge country, the Party delegates considerable decision-making power to local officials appointed by central authorities. They are then promoted (and rewarded) based on their success increasing material product (Brandt and Rawski, p. 16). This decentralization involves township and village enterprises (TVEs) with community or privatized (in practice, local officials’) ownership, special economic zones with duty-free imports for foreign investors and exporters, and a unique position for Hong Kong (returned to the PRC in 1997). Agricultural households, who now work land on long-term leases, can sell over-quota products at free market prices; so can state-run factories. The two-track prices thus provide peasants crucial incentives for increased production without affecting state requirements. Liberalization and privatization, as recommended by the Washington Consensus, were hardly adopted across-the-board in China (Rodrik, p. 86). Nor was gradualism, imposed by policy differences among the CCP elite, necessarily essential to their success.Footnote 3 What was essential? Market-oriented incentives. What is still needed? Development of high-quality institutions, including democratic participation and a reliable rule of law (Rodrik, pp. 91, 94). China's growing ‘private’ sector and its increasing number of wealthy capitalists indicate for some writers that the Chinese economy might now be classed as ‘capitalist,’ although with qualifications.Footnote 4 Considering that Mao Zedong's revolution was anticapitalist, calling today's China ‘capitalist’ or ‘postsocialist,’ particularly by a scholar living abroad, has obvious critical intent. Instead, most of China's own analysts prefer the term middle stratum, defined by income, for the middle class (Lampton, p. 78). Though permitting or even encouraging private enrichment,Footnote 5 the Party has had success in co-opting this class. Most of these individuals seem to have conservative views similar to those of the Party hierarchy and appear more often than before at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and other congresses. The Party keeps wages low, particularly for rural migrant laborers without permits (hukou), and prevents the formation of independent trade unions. It does not strictly enforce existing safety laws nor remove domestic industry's remaining protections from foreign competition (Dickson, pp. 11, 240). Nonetheless, as Minxin Pei conjectures, ‘In all likelihood, China's new capitalists’ support for the CCP is contingent upon the party's ability to provide favors and protect their privileges and property’ (p. 94). They resist allowing Party cells within their private enterprises, nor do they eagerly join the Party (Pei, pp. 95, 185). Those who do (‘red capitalists’) are often managers of SOEs that have been privatized (Dickson, p. 29). Of the capitalists not associated with the CCP, only a relatively few with lower status and wealth are politically active at all (Dickson p. 242). They do not tend to join government-sponsored and even privately organized business associations, which are not seen as effective in raising broad issues (Dickson, Chapter 4). In other words, most Chinese capitalists are still a dependent class, though a growing one with its own interests, if little political consciousness as yet.",1

The observed investment patterns in the post-communist transition, however, challenge traditional investment theories. Some authors claim that ‘larger firms had virtually unlimited access to capital’.Footnote 1 Other authors show that ‘firms which made losses were not liquidity constrained and were still able to draw upon external funds’.Footnote 2 In a similar vein, a study on Russia reveals a negative relationship between internally generated cash flows and investment in members of financial-industrial groups (Perroti and Gelfer, 2001). In this paper we argue that in the post-communist transition, there are other factors to consider regarding the link between internally generated cash flows and investment due to the peculiar institutional environment, namely: (1) the underdeveloped financial sector; (2) the motivation of the state to bail out both the state-owned banks and firms; and (3) the hardening of the budget constraint over transition years (Kornai, 2001).Footnote 3 We study the institutional determinants of investment performance of both listed and non-listed firms in 13 transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) over the period 1993–2003. In particular, we estimate investment-cash flow models using the accelerator model of investment and augmenting it with cash flow terms. The literature on investment-cash flow regressions was criticised on the grounds that cash flow merely proxies for future investment opportunities, and thus a positive investment-cash flow coefficient does not say anything about cash constraints (Kaplan and Zingales, 1997, 2000). This paper addresses this critique by deriving institutional hypotheses and testing them in the post-communist transitional environment. For example, the hardening of the budget constraint in transition countries implies a decreasing investment-cash flow sensitivity over time, which we find in the data. One cannot sensibly explain this finding by cash flow becoming a poorer and poorer proxy for future investment opportunities over transition. The paper addresses three major questions. Is there evidence of a hardening of the budget constraint over the transition years? What are the effects of privatisation and more generally of ownership change on the investment-cash flow sensitivity? How do different ownership categories (state, foreign investors, domestic firms, financial institutions and privatisation funds) affect investment behaviour? The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section discusses our hypotheses and the econometric modelling. The subsequent section describes the data and sample characteristics. The fourth section presents the econometric results. The penultimate section scrutinises the soft budget constraint phenomenon by discussing state-controlled firms in more detail.

The literature finds that access to capital is not unlimited and is determined by the degree of informational asymmetries and agency costs. The large extant empirical work has focused on identifying indicators at the firm level, such as dividend payout ratios, bond rating, degree of bank affiliation, membership in financial conglomerates, firm size, firm age and/or governance structure, that approximate for the severity of capital market imperfections and explain the observed differences in investment behaviour across firms.Footnote 1 In this paper, by using a rich panel data for a large and representative sample of Estonian firms, we investigate firms’ investment behaviour during the period 1993 through 2002 and make several contributions. Fundamentally, we provide new evidence on a topic that has attracted the attention of theorists but for which there is little empirical evidence – the impact on investment of alternative governance structures. The study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it accounts for the effect of governance structures in investment decisions through their role in mitigating or exacerbating informational asymmetries and agency costs. Second, it assesses the long-run viability of certain ownership forms. This is an important issue in light of the continuing debate in the literature about the efficiency of various ownership forms resulting from the extensive privatization process in almost all former centralized economies. Third, in a more general context, it contributes to the debate in the corporate governance literature on the effect of governance through ownership. Fourth, the results of the analysis allow us to answer questions such as how pervasive across firms and over time are liquidity constraints in Estonia and to what extent are different governance structures likely to be financially constrained? The answers to these questions, in turn, provide directions where public policy should focus to promote successful restructuring on the part of firms. Further, as the movement from state ownership led to the emergence of similar ownership structures in almost all transition economies, our conclusions would be applicable to other Central and East European and former Soviet Union countries. Finally, by focusing on the small, open and dynamic economy of Estonia we provide evidence of a country that has been understudied in the governance literature. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we outline the testable hypotheses and present the specifications to be estimated in the empirical work. The next two following sections focus on sample construction and data description, and the estimating strategy and presentation of results. In the last section, we conclude with further discussion and some policy recommendations.",1
52,1,Comparative Economic Studies,21 January 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2009.22,Currency Allocation of Public External Debt and Synchronization Indicators of Exchange Rate Volatility,March 2010,Martin Melecky,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Governments are often forced to issue debt in a foreign currency if their funding needs cannot be met by issuing debt denominated in the domestic currency due to the underdevelopment of domestic bond markets or an attempt to avoid crowding out domestic firms from domestic currency borrowing (Turner, 2002), the ‘original sin’ (Eichengreen et al., 2003), low monetary credibility (Jeanne, 2005), or an emphasis of the cost element in the cost/risk trade-off (Broner et al., 2007). A suitable tool for managing foreign exchange (FX) exposures is the use of foreign currency derivatives. Although the use of derivatives among emerging market economies (EMEs) has increased in recent years, their utilization in debt management remains low due to laws limiting the instruments that can be used for debt management, a lack of examples, low staff capacity and also a lack of markets for many EMEs currencies (Caballero and Cowan, 2006; Claessens, 2006; and Bordo and Meissner, 2006).Footnote 1 As a result governments can be exposed to FX risk from currency mismatches in their balance sheets. Currency mismatches could arise if, after matching the cash flows from assets and liabilities denominated in similar currencies, there still remains an open position in some foreign currency.Footnote 2 I thus focus on management of the FX risk inherent in an unhedged government debt portfolio while acknowledging the fact that some countries have to borrow in foreign currencies.Footnote 3 Hence, I do not attempt to contribute to the literature on the ‘original sin’ or explain how currency mismatches come about, and I take these circumstances as given. Based on the review of current approaches to FX risk management of government debt, provided in Bolder (2002) and Melecky (2007), solutions of typical economic problems dealing with optimal allocation of foreign currency debt across a spectrum of available currencies imply that the optimal currency structure of foreign debt is largely determined by relative magnitudes of variances of exchange rates with respect to the relevant foreign currencies, and covariances between domestic fundamentals and the exchange rates. In practice, however, not much guidance can be expected from the estimated covariances of nominal exchange rates with the domestic primary balance (Bohn, 1990a). This is due to the inability of fundamentals to forecast exchange rates (Engel and West, 2005) and the high degree of noise incorporated in exchange rates (De Grauwe and Grimaldi, 2005; and Melecky, 2007) which limits the information available from historical data. Also, the use of fixed exchange rates complicates the choice of currencies for denominating foreign debt, because it is not clear why debt managers should rely on the promise of the central bank to sustain a peg to certain currency, especially in EMEs. The volatility of managed exchange rates has proven to be no smaller than the volatility of floating exchange rates over a medium- to long-term horizon (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008). In this paper I propose a macroeconomic approach to use as a complement to existing portfolio approaches (Bohn, 1990b; or Giavazzi and Missale, 2004) when choosing the currency structure of foreign debt. The underlying idea of this paper can be summarized as follows. Consider the bilateral exchange rate defined as the relative value of two currencies. Unfavorable shocks to the domestic economy will result ceteris paribus in depreciation of the domestic currency relative to the foreign currency. The same is true for the foreign currency that rises with favorable shocks and falls with unfavorable ones. Consider now three scenarios. (i) If the domestic and foreign economies are converging in the sense that the shocks hitting both economies are becoming more correlated, the relative value of the two currencies, the exchange rate, is becoming less volatile. (ii) If, however, the economies are not linked at all, shocks either in the domestic or foreign economy will be purely idiosyncratic and fully reflected in the exchange rate. (iii) If the shocks are in general negatively correlated, the relative value of the domestic and foreign currency will be significantly more volatile than in case (i) or (ii). I propose to look across a spectrum of foreign currencies available for foreign debt denomination and pick those for which the domestic shocks and foreign shocks are positively correlated. Furthermore, it is not only the correlation of the shocks that matters, but also their transmission into the domestic and foreign fundamentals that determine domestic and foreign currency values. I thus propose to use a measure of synchronization in the movements of relevant domestic and foreign fundamentals when choosing currency(ies) for denomination of foreign debt. The proposed approach can be linked to the literature on optimum currency areas (OCAs) such as Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1998), the literature on modeling bilateral exchange rate volatility (Devereux and Lane, 2003), and the literature on currency preferences (Kingston and Melecky, 2007). In this paper the interplay between exchange rate volatility and exchange rate regimes is handled by using the exchange market pressure index (EMPI) following Eichengreen et al. (1996). Further, I attempt to frame the selection of explanatory variables for exchange rate volatility into a conventional New Keynesian Policy model that predicts that not only traditional OCA variables, but also variables considered by the literature on currency substitution and complementarity, such as money velocity, should be relevant for explaining exchange rate (EMPI) volatility. The empirical analysis carried out in this paper focuses on middle-income countries (MICs) for three reasons. First, high-income countries (HICs) have well-developed domestic markets or are able to issue debt in their own currencies offshore, that is, they do not suffer from ‘original sin’. On the other hand, low-income countries (LICs) rely heavily on official assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors that is provided at concessional rates, and thus the choice of currency denomination for their debt is usually determined by the supply side.Footnote 4 Second, the size of shocks varies significantly for developed and EMEs (Caballero and Cowan, 2006). Third, the institutional frameworks of HICs, MICs and LICs can differ considerably and one may prefer to analyze a more homogenous group of countries that is constrained to borrow in foreign currency and for whom the required data are readily available. Based on the empirical analysis in this paper, I find that countries trying to select a suitable currency for denominating their sovereign debt can use measures of inflation synchronization, money velocity synchronization and interest rate synchronization as indicators in order to minimize the expected variance of their FX debt charges due to exchange rate volatility. However, if a country increasingly uses interest rate differentials to intervene in the FX market, interest rate synchronization should be viewed as the main indicator when selecting the currency structure of foreign debt. If, on the other hand, the country is intervening in FX markets using its FX reserves to manage the exchange rate, the main indicator to be used is inflation synchronization. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents theoretical motivation of the empirical framework used in the paper. The section after that describes the data and estimation methodology. In the penultimate section, the empirical analysis is performed using regressions, and the last section concludes.",2

52,2,Comparative Economic Studies,03 June 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2010.5,Euro Membership and Bank Stability – Friends or Foes? Lessons from Ireland,June 2010,Patrick Honohan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"With the third largest bank having been nationalized, and the remaining locally controlled banks wholly dependent on a government guarantee for their access to liquidity, the Irish banking system was, by mid-2009, among the most severely affected in the global downturn. Yet the Irish banks had not indulged in the financing of US securitized mortgages, nor had they been involved in aggressive international acquisitions – flaws that characterized weakened banks in Iceland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK and elsewhere. Instead, the Irish banks had been fatally weakened by their involvement in a local property bubble. Ireland's world-beating property bubble took off on the eve of Euro membership. It swelled, based on huge capital inflows through the banking system especially after 2003 – more than 50% of GDP in about 4 years.Footnote 1 As Shiller (2005) has convincingly argued, boom-and-bust cycles are normally based on the propagation of a misplaced optimism built on a half-truth, which seems to foretell an unprecedented stream of prosperity. In Ireland's case the scene was set by the seeming effortlessness of the ‘Celtic Tiger’ boom which, starting in the late 1980s and especially after 1993 had soaked-up unemployment, attracted a huge increase in female participation and even caused a reversal in the traditional pattern of outmigration. Then, on top of this sustained growth in employment, income and household formation, Ireland became a founder member of the eurozone. The euro brought a dramatic and sustained fall in nominal and real interest rates. All the ingredients, then, to sustain a belief that equilibrium house prices would soar and that the demand for housing units would continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Given the timing, it is relevant to ask whether euro membership helped or hindered Ireland in this story. Euro membership continues to have a pervasive effect on the functioning of Irish economy, not least in the interaction of wage determination and competitiveness shocks (for which see Honohan and Leddin, 2006), but the focus of this paper is narrower, confining itself mainly to emergence and immediate management of the banking crisis. From one perspective, the sharp fall in realFootnote 2 and nominal interest rates which were caused by and accompanied Euro membership were the trigger that launched the property bubble. The higher capitalization rates warranted higher equilibrium asset valuations by a hard-to-pinpoint multiple. In addition, the inflow of funds through the banks was not restrained by any exchange rate risk. The economic consequences of the crash have been severe. The collapse in the construction and real estate business, the fall in property prices and the severe knock-on effects on the banking system have all undermined employment and the public finances, and left the economy in a weakened condition to face the global recession. Given this background, it is no wonder that Ireland looked set to experience one of the most severe downturns forecast anywhere in the world, with peak-to-trough fall in output expected to reach or exceed 15%. So was euro membership to blame? The answer to this question is one that must be exercising other potential eurozone members. Our conclusion is that, despite being clearly implicated in the Irish experience, euro membership was neither necessary nor sufficient for a crisis. It did help trigger the low interest rates that launched the property bubble and eased its financing, weakening some traditional automatic restraints on the emergence of imbalances. But, despite the loss of monetary and exchange rate policy autonomy,Footnote 3 the Irish authorities still had sufficient policy instruments to have combated the emergence of imbalances – though these might have had to include a much more restrictive fiscal than that which was actually pursued and which was comfortably compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact of the euro area. Furthermore, the other most adversely affected economies with weak banking systems such as Iceland and Latvia, are outside the eurozone, so membership was in no way a prerequisite of policy failure. Indeed, it seems that the hazards of financial globalization were transmitted across currency-zone boundaries, and that Ireland's failure to cope with its new situation does not mean that it would have succeeded better outside the eurozone. After the crash, eurozone membership helped ease financial market conditions, though the lack of a domestic currency means that restoring competitiveness is requiring nominal wage reductions. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly reviews the Celtic Tiger period. The subsequent section describes the emergence of the property bubble. The next section examines the evolution of the banking crisis to late 2009. The next following section discusses the potential role of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) membership in precipitating the fall in interest rates and muffling the warning signs of imbalances, while moderating the consequences of the crash for the financial markets. The penultimate section places the Irish experience in context with an overview of the experience of a handful of other small countries within and outside of the eurozone. The final section draws conclusions.",10

Many explanations have been offered for the rise and fall of that inflation. Among those are initially faulty models of the economy, political pressures, limited independence of the Federal Reserve, direct inflationary impacts of the two oil shocks, the breakdown of the Bretton-Woods System at the beginning of the 1970s, large and persistent underestimation of potential output by policymakers at the Fed and overexpansionary fiscal policy. During the 15 years between the early 1950s and the mid-1960s the US enjoyed virtual price stability. Over this period consumer price index (CPI) inflation seldom exceeded 2% and was normally between 0% and 2%. With the intensification of the military buildup in Vietnam during the second half of the 1960s, CPI inflation gradually increased reaching over 6% during the last quarter of the 1960s. Following the imposition of price controls inflation partially slowed back to the 3% to 4% range during the early 1970s but shot up dramatically following the first oil shock in 1973. It accelerated to almost 10% in the last quarter of 1973, and fluctuated above this figure throughout 1974 reaching over 12% in the last quarter of that year. Inflation receded to the 5% to 9% range between 1975 and 1978 but accelerated again following the second oil shock reaching a peak over 15% at the beginning of 1980. After almost 20 years as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board William McC. Martin was replaced by Arthur Burns during the first quarter of 1970. Burns was succeeded in 1978 by G. William Miller for about a year and Miller was replaced by Paul Volcker during the third quarter of 1979. Together, Burns and Miller presided over the decade of the 1970s that was characterized by the highest and most persistent inflation the US had experienced during the twentieth century. During his term, which ended in 1987, Volcker managed to finally stabilize inflation at great costs in terms of output. Alan Greenspan who succeeded him inherited a relatively stable economy allowing him to pay relatively more attention to the stabilization of output. Although different economists may differ on the relative importance of the contribution of different factors to the great inflation there is, I believe, a broad consensus regarding the following statements. First, long run structural changes in the Fed's objectives and policy rule were important factors both in the rise and fall of the great inflation. Second, the evolution of inflationary expectations played an important role in the propagation of the great inflation and their behavior under Volcker was an important reason for the pain and time required to restore the price stability of the 1950s and of the early 1960s. This paper provides direct empirical evidence on the implicit policy rule followed during the Burns/Miller great inflation period and compares it to the implicit rules followed during Volcker's disinflation and under Greenspan's and Martin's tenure as chair. In particular, it examines how monetary policy during the 1970s would have differed if conducted by means of those alternative policy rules. Those counterfactual experiments take the policy rules followed under the different chairs as given. The broader, Lucas critique-type question, concerning the impact of the state of the economy on the nature of policy rules is beyond the scope of these counterfactuals. Nonetheless, their results are consistent with the view that policy rules adapt, at least to some extent, to major changes in economic conditions.Footnote 1 The paper also provides evidence on unexpected inflation and on the impact of inflation uncertainty on evaluation of the real monetary policy stance by the Fed's staff during the great inflation and its aftermath. The paper is organized as follows. The first part of section ‘How would have interest rate decisions in the 1970s differed if taken by means of Volcker's, Greenspan's and Martin's policy rules?’ utilizes nonlinear interest rate rules for the Burns/Miller, Volcker, Greenspan and Martin chairmanships (estimated in Cukierman and Muscatelli, 2008) to examine how monetary policy during the 1970s would have differed if conducted by means of each of those alternative policy rules. With a new Keynesian economy a concave rule is indicative of dominant recession avoidance preferences (RAP) at the Fed and a convex rule is indicative of dominant inflation avoidance preferences (IAP).Footnote 2 The main results are: (1) If policy during the 1970s had been conducted by means of Volcker's rule, it would have been more restrictive during most of that decade. (2) If it had been conducted by Greenspan's rule, it would have been less restrictive for most of the decade. (3) If it had been conducted under a Martin policy rule, it would have been substantially and more persistently restrictive after the first oil shock. In a series of papers Orphanides convincingly argues that Fed's perceptions of the output gap were substantially biased downward during the 1970s (eg Orphanides, 2001). It is therefore possible that the RAP detected in Cukierman and Muscatelli for the Burns/Miller era is due to the fact that they had used retrospective, rather than real time, data to measure the output gap. To examine the robustness of the results to this potential problem the counterfactual experiments from the first part are repeated with linear interest rules estimated with real-time data in the last part of section ‘How would have interest rate decisions in the 1970s differed if taken by means of Volcker's, Greenspan's and Martin's policy rules?’ The main conclusion is that results 1 and 2 above stand and are even amplified.Footnote 3 Section ‘Inflationary expectations and the great inflation’ examines the extent to which monetary policy under Burns/Miller, Volcker and the early Greenspan years might have been affected by inflation forecast errors. Using data on inflation forecasts from the federal open market committee (FOMC) Greenbook (GB) and on private sector inflationary expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Livingston Survey (LS), the section shows that, for the most part, inflation was universally underestimated during the 1970s and overestimated during the credibility rebuilding period under Volcker. In particular, underestimation of inflation during the Burns/Miller period implies that the Fed's monetary policy stance as derived from the GB forecasts must have systematically considered the policy stance of the Fed to be more restrictive than what it turned out to be with hindsight. Or, in different words, ex ante real interest rates were largely considered by the Fed's staff to be higher than their realized ex post counterparts. It is therefore likely that the great inflation of the 1970s was reinforced by the Fed's overestimation of real interest rates. The section also demonstrates that inflation uncertainty, which was abnormally high by long-term US standards under Burns/Miller and Volcker, decreased substantially during Greenspan's term in office. This is followed by concluding reflections.",
52,2,Comparative Economic Studies,05 July 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2010.7,EU Accession: A Road to Fast-track Convergence?,June 2010,Uwe Böwer,Alessandro Turrini,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The economic growth record of the new member states (NMS) of the European Union (EU) after the recovery from transition in the early 1990s has been impressive. The region is widely believed to have benefited from catching-up dynamics as well as economic and institutional integration with the EU. However, the debate is open regarding the degree to which EU integration mattered for catching up and through which channels. Although the empirical growth literature is extensive, only a few studies have used growth regressions to analyse the impact of EU accession on growth. Crespo-Cuaresma et al. (2002) make explicit reference to EU membership in explaining growth, analysing pre-2004 accessions and finding the length of EU membership to have a significantly positive effect on economic growth. Schadler et al. (2006) analyse the growth experience of the NMS and other emerging market countries and find that income levels, population growth, investment, openness and institutional quality determine growth. Falcetti et al. (2006) and Iradian (2007) focus on the growth experience of transition countries and find a significant impact of institutional factors and transition reforms, as well as a significant impact of recovery from transition-related output losses. Cihák and Fonteyne (2009) conduct a cross-section growth regression augmented by an NMS dummy variable and find that economic growth in NMS exceeded that of their remaining sample of developed and developing countries. We make a step forward compared with the existing literature in two respects. First, we assess the impact of EU accession on the growth performance of NMS in a panel analysis after controlling for a series of institutional factors. This way, we check whether, on top of facilitating institutional convergence, and therefore growth, the prospect of EU accession had an additional significant impact per se. Second, we investigate which factors appear to be associated with stronger growth-enhancing effects of EU accession, testing in particular the effects of initial income levels, institutional quality and financial development in conjunction with the growth experience of the NMS during the accession stage. This paper employs a large cross-country data set to provide a significant control group. The panel data set comprises annual observations of advanced, emerging and transition economies starting in 1960. In addition to the standard determinants per-capita GDP, population growth, investment, openness and human capital formation, we also include variables related to economic transition and EU integration, namely initial output loss, terms-of-trade growth and institutional quality of the legal system, freedom of trade, and the regulatory environment. The role of institutional quality for growth is stressed, for example, by Acemoglu et al. (2005). Controlling for all these effects, the additional EU accession impact is measured in a difference-in-difference approach. The interaction of an accession time dummy with an NMS region dummy permits to assess whether the prospect of EU accession affected the growth rate of NMS, relative to the pre-accession period and to the old EU-15 member states (OMS). The results suggest a significant EU accession effect on top of the impact of the remaining explanatory variables. Although the NMS growth rates appear significantly lower than those of the OMS during the transition period of the early 1990s, the NMS perform significantly better than the OMS during the EU accession period, as compared to the 1994–1999 reference period. The results are basically robust with respect to the definition of the sample. Potential endogeneity of investment as an explanatory variable is addressed by using initial sub-period values and the relative price of investment in a set of instrumental variable regressions. Interacting the ‘accession dummy’ with various explanatory variables, it is found that the growth effect during the accession period was particularly strong for those NMS with relatively low initial income levels, weak institutional quality and lower degrees of financial development. EU accession seems to have had a fast-track convergence effect particularly on the economic laggards among the NMS. Furthermore, accession is likely to have improved institutional quality, further supporting the growth in the NMS. By triggering financial inflows and the reconstruction of the banking system, the prospect of accession may have fostered growth in those NMS with weak financial depth. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section presents some stylised facts, highlighting the growth performance of the NMS over time and investigating signs of convergence graphically. The subsequent section explains the data, methodology and results of various growth regression specifications to investigate growth effects of EU accession. The final section concludes.",9

This attention to production in technologically dynamic sectors is motivated, in part, by the idea that production and exports in these sectors may create positive spillovers for productivity in the rest of the economy. Some economists have argued that these links are sufficiently strong that countries should promote ATP exports explicitly in order to accelerate economic growth. However, measuring ATP trade is difficult, because different countries and international organizations use different definitions and classifications. As it turns out, measurement in this area is not value-neutral. The concept of ‘advanced technology’ is flexible, and in some cases may reflect underlying ideas about policy that are not always clearly stated. Moreover, while fact-based claims that a country runs a surplus or deficit in ATP can be used to promote various policies, these claims themselves may prove fragile in the face of alternative choices about measurement. This paper seeks to provide a more objective description of the emerging pattern of China–US ATP trade than has heretofore been available by taking advantage of complementary strengths in the trade data provided by the two partners. ‘ATP exports and economic growth: What is at stake?’ section discusses the various economic claims that have been made about the significance of China's ATP exports for economic growth and US competitiveness. ‘Defination and classification of ATP trade in China and the US’ section evaluates the various definitions of ATP or ‘high-technology and new products’ trade employed by the two countries. While there is some convergence in Chinese and US practices for statistical reporting in ATP trade, China maintains alternate definitions of ATP for the promotion of various policies. ‘Comparison of ATP trade statistics between China and the US’ section describes a method for employing jointly the trade data of the two countries to provide a fuller assessment, making use of the US statistical definition of ATP and Chinese data on the customs regime, ownership type, and geographical location of exports. The appearance of China's ATP trade surplus coincides approximately with China's WTO accession in 2001. The surplus is concentrated in consumer goods for final assembly while the US continues to maintain a bilateral surplus in certain ATP categories. ‘Structures and institutions in China–US ATP trades’ section illustrates the strong association of China's ATP exports with three factors; processing trade and production fragmentation, foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs), and economic policy zones. ‘Conclusions and policy implications’ section explores the implications of these patterns for economic policy in China and the US.",7

Simulation Results for Slovenia,June 2010,Milan Vodopivec,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Although the traditional system of unemployment insurance (UI) provides protection against the hardship of job loss, there is growing persuasion and new evidence that, in the words of Meyer (1995), ‘unemployment insurance is not a completely benign transfer; it affects claimant's behavior’ (p. 127). Indeed, evidence shows that UI even under the best program design and strict monitoring creates adverse incentives that reduce job search efforts and increase overall unemployment.Footnote 1 Spurred by adverse incentives created by traditional income support systems, new approaches to improve these systems have been proposed. The system of unemployment insurance savings accounts (UISAs) is among the most radical and perhaps also the most promising ones. Under the UISA system, each worker is required to save a fraction of earnings in his or her account and to draw unemployment compensation from it. By internalizing the costs of unemployment benefits, the UISA system is expected to radically change the incentives of workers and, therefore, to avoid the moral hazard inherent in traditional UI schemes. Moreover, some variants of UISAs can provide the same level of protection as the traditional UI system. Given that UISAs are still very much a novel idea, it would thus be premature to give a reliable evaluation of this system as an alternative to traditional unemployment support schemes. Several theoretical papers have shown that the UISA system can improve re-employment incentives in comparison the traditional UI system while conceivably providing the same protection (Orszag and Snower, 2002; Orszag et al., 1999). These papers credit the system with a potential to substantially decrease overall unemployment and, by lowering payroll taxes, increase wages.Footnote 2 Empirically, however, UISAs have been largely an ‘uncharted territory’. One of the rare studies is Kugler's (1999) evaluation of the Colombian program, but it does not shed light on the key question of whether UISAs improve job search incentives.Footnote 3 A new study by Van Ours et al. (2009), however, is the first to provide empirical evidence corroborating theoretical predictions that UISAs improve work incentives. Using a mixed proportional hazard rate model, Van Ours et al. (2009) examine the determinants of the job-finding rate of unemployment benefit recipients under the Chilean program and find that: (i) the larger the resources on the UISA at the start of the unemployment spell, and thus the lower the potential benefits from the solidarity fund, the higher the probability of exit from unemployment of benefit recipients; (ii) for a benefit recipient not using the solidarity fund, the amount of accumulation on the UISA does not affect the hazard rate from unemployment, suggesting that such individuals internalize the costs of unemployment benefits; (iii) for beneficiaries using the solidarity fund, the unemployment duration dependence pattern is consistent with moral hazard effects; and (iv) finally, for beneficiaries relying on UISAs only, the pattern is free of such effects. Faced with a dearth of empirical evidence, Feldstein and Altman (1998) simulated the working of the UISA system, taking the US as an example. They assumed that the level and duration of benefits provided by UISAs remain the same as under the current UI system and that UISAs are financed via a 4% contribution rate. They found that over a 25-year period, only a small proportion of workers (5%–7%) end their working life with negative balances, and concluded that the UISA system is a viable alternative to the standard UI system. Feldstein and Altman also argued that in the case of the US, the distributional effects of switching to UISAs are likely to be small. According to their simulations, this switch makes individuals in the bottom quintile worse off by 0.7%–1.1% and individuals in the top quintile better off by 0.6%–0.7% of lifetime annual incomes and barely affects other groups. This paper is an attempt to provide more insights into the working of the UISA system by simulating its introduction in Slovenia, a transition economy. In particular, it addresses the following two questions: First, how viable is the UISA system? UISAs eliminate pooling across individuals. If a significant proportion of workers cannot generate sufficient savings upon which to draw during their unemployment spells, such a system may be non-viable. Second, what redistributive effects are produced by the replacement of the UI system with the UISA system? According to Feldstein and Altman (1998), the redistributive effects for the US are likely to be small, but the magnitude of these effects in transition countries remains to be explored. For both substantive as well as data reasons, Slovenia is a very attractive case for a UISA simulation study. On substantive grounds, there are two main reasons. First, Slovenia has a comprehensive, well-developed system of UI. In the 1990s, the system offered relatively generous unemployment benefits to about one-third of the unemployed.Footnote 4 Second, the 1998 reform of the Slovenian UI system that reduced the potential duration of unemployment benefits offers a possibility to study the introduction of UISAs under two types of regimes of benefit generosity: a generous and a modest regime. The UI reform strongly reduced the potential benefit duration, for most workers even by half, allowing us to study the effects of the introduction of UISAs under both the generous, pre-1998 benefit regime, as well as under the modest, post-1998 benefit regime. Moreover, Slovenia's administrative databases have clear advantages: they offer exceptionally rich information with panel microdata covering labor market histories of all formal labor force participants covering the pre- and post-1998 UI reform period, thus allowing the application of the Feldstein–Altman simulation methodology that relies on long panel coverage of a representative sample of workforce participants. Our simulations show that the UISA system is a viable alternative to a modest UI system, but that its viability is jeopardized under generous benefits. Under the modest regime, here identified with the post-1998 period, our calculations show that only one quarter of workers end their working life with a negative cumulative balance and 43% ever experience a negative UISA balance; in contrast, under the generous regime, here identified with the pre-1998 period, 49% of workers end their working life with negative cumulative balances and 66% ever experience negative balances. Moreover, under the modest benefit regime workers are better able to recover a positive UISA balance. The simulations also show that the level of redistribution under UISAs lags substantially behind the UI system, even though the version of the UISAs studied permits borrowing and hence allows for redistribution. By analyzing viability and redistribution properties of various UISA designs, the paper offers important policy guidance for developing countries that are contemplating introducing an unemployment benefit system. Increasingly exposed to foreign markets and fearing global financial and economic crises, more and more developing countries such as Jordan, Sri Lanka and Syria are considering the introduction of an unemployment benefit system. Yet, introducing unemployment benefits to developing countries is not an easy task. These countries have weak administrative capacity and vast informal sectors, two features that exacerbate the employment disincentive problems faced by the standard UI system. Therefore, to strengthen incentives, some argue that unemployment benefit systems in developing countries should be based on a system similar to the one simulated above, that is, on UISAs with the option of borrowing.Footnote 5 The paper is organized as follows. Methodology and data section describes the methodology and data sources. Simulation results section presents simulation results for the viability of and the redistribution under UISAs, reporting both the baseline variant and the sensitivity analysis studying deviations from the baseline parameter values. Concluding remarks section concludes with policy implications.",5

In 2006, foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Czech Republic, as both a driver of this success and a reflection thereof, reached more than $60 billion in cumulative stock, translating to $6,337 per capita, the highest in the region (Berglőf, 2008).Footnote 1 In recognition of this success, the country has been placed in the category of ‘frontrunner’ (UNCTAD, 2007) in terms of inward FDI performance and potential, and the World Bank (2008) reports that annual inflows from 1993 through 2007 averaged 5.6% of gross domestic product, underscoring the importance of FDI to the economy of this landlocked Central European state. In pursuit of convergence with Western Europe, Czech leadership has striven to distinguish the country as the leader among transition states. The first democratically elected governments assertively courted constructive investment from abroad as an engine for development while limiting potentially negative effects (Pavlinek, 2004). Governments recognize the importance of marketing their national advantages as FDI destinations through promotion agencies as part of broader policy initiatives (Breznitz, 2007),Footnote 2 and recent work by Capik (2007), Benáček (2008), and Drahokoupil (2008) has explored aspects of such promotion in Central and Eastern Europe (hereafter CEE). As investment into CEE accelerated, a substantial literature also emerged from research into the determinants of the spatial distribution of these inflows. Location factors that are competently researched and empirically corroborated include trade links (Brenton et al., 1998), agglomeration (Head et al., 1999), trade openness (Kinoshita and Campos, 2003) and other relational factors (Bandelj, 2002), labor costs and gravity factors (Bevin and Estrin, 2004), policy consistency and economic stability (Ass and Beck, 2005; Grosse and Trevino, 2005), and political risks (Brada et al., 2006), among others (see Blonigen (2005) for a thorough review). Many of these factors simultaneously interact with industry (Eckert and Rossmeissl, 2005) and entry mode (Dikova and van Witteloostuijn, 2007). Another related literature critically assesses the impact of investment upon regional development in the host countries (Pavlinek, 2004) and broader convergence (Eckert and Rossmeissl, 2005). In part because the EU accession process occurred over several years and attracted great international attention, economic integration in Europe had already been identified in several works as an important enabling factor of FDI when the 2004 candidates had only preliminary EU status (Brenton et al., 1998; Bandelj, 2002; Deichmann, 2004), and this was confirmed in the Czech case as well (Kinoshita and Campos, 2003; Eckert and Rossmeissl, 2005). Recognizing the success of EU accession states, they are now generally considered a cohort distinct the former Soviet Republics such as Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, and the countries of Turkestan, which lag far behind Central Europe in nearly all socio-economic measures (Janicki and Wunnava, 2004; Brada et al., 2006; Berglőf, 2008; World Bank, 2008). The present paper's intent is to augment the existing literature by examining FDI from the angle of country-of-origin effects (hereafter ‘origin effects’), an approach that is essential, yet less thoroughly understood, according to Dunning (1980, 2001) and echoed by Hunya (2000). It is important to understand why the Czech Republic has differential appeal to firms from different locations around the world. The largest sources of FDI with values of $30 million or more are presented in Table 1, and they are concentrated in Western Europe, North America, and East Asia. The top five countries are Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Austria, and France, all of which are geographically close to the Czech Republic. Moreover, Germany and Austria also share long borders with the country, suggesting that effects of proximity might be at work. Outside of Europe, most of the other leading home countries – notably the United States (#6), Japan (#11), and Canada (#18) – are relatively large economies, as measured by GDP. In addition, it is worth noting that several former eastern-bloc trade partners, including Slovakia (#10), Poland (#13), Hungary (#21), Russia (#22), and Slovenia (#30) appear in the list of leading origins. As part of Czechoslovakia until 1993, Slovakia fares prominently probably because of remaining business units in the Czech lands. Cursory observation of the other patterns hints that explanatory variables identified elsewhere are worth investigating in this context, particularly border effects (O’hUallacháin and Reid, 1992), gravity model factors (Grosse and Trevino, 1996), and cultural factors (Zhao and Zhu, 2000; Bitzenis, 2004). The ranking of home countries should be interpreted with caution, especially the cases of the Netherlands and Spain. A favorable bilateral investment treaty between the Netherlands and Czech Republic facilitates transactions, and the Dutch registration of foreign corporations from third countries holds special tax benefits for companies as well.Footnote 3 For example, the Prague office of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (the Netherlands) is registered with Dutch – rather than Japanese – origins (BusinessInfo.cz, 2006). The Seychelles, Saint Lucia, and the Bahamas all rank among the top 40 origins for similar reasons. Outliers provide another reason for caution in interpretation: Telefonica's 2005 acquisition of Český Telecom for nearly $5 billion is the largest single transaction to date and is largely responsible for Spain's ranking of third after being ranked twentieth as recently as 1999.",7

Domestic markets have been almost fully liberalized, first in agriculture and then in industry and services. Previously collectivized land has been given back to peasant households. Most industrial and services enterprises are privately owned, and now produce the bulk of GDP, due mainly to their superior efficiency with respect to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) (see Dougherty et al., 2007). The country also opened to international trade by joining the WTO, thereby boosting labor intensive exports and acceding foreign, advanced knowledge, thanks to FDI spillovers. In sum, there is nothing so special about China, apart from its size that ensures a virtually unlimited supply of cheap unskilled labor to fuel export-oriented industrialization. Yes, relatively egalitarian land distribution, widespread literacy, and an innate, culture-based attitude towards thrift also contribute. However, the bottom line is that China is just one more developing country that is prospering since it traded its obsolete socialist model to embrace capitalism. Other, more acute, observers do acknowledge the depth of the structural differences between China and ‘normal’ capitalist countries, but dismiss the applicability of the term ‘socialism’ as a useful tool to analyze such a strange animal. Lindbeck (2008, p.116), for instance, argues that ‘the bulk of production today takes place in private firms’ and ‘most prices in China are formed on market, the main exceptions being natural resources and public utilities. Moreover, the label “socialism” is not usually associated with a strong reliance on economic incentives, competition, internationalization and (as in China) an apparent neglect of the distribution … of income, education and welfare’. Therefore, both terms ‘state capitalism’ and ‘market socialism’ are inappropriate, and the neutral term ‘mixed economy’ should rather be utilized to characterize China's economic system. Lindbeck is right when referring to the contradictions between China's present social reality and the traditional goals of socialism, which are particularly stark in the domain of income and social inequalities (see, for instance, Kanbur et al., 2008). Yet, in the present paper we are focusing on some positive (ie, objective) features of China's economic system, rather than on the country's social problems seen in a normativeFootnote 1 dimension. In this context, we show that Lindbeck's view amounts to a severe underestimation of the role of the state in China's economy, and to an overestimation of the relative autonomy and supposed commanding position of unplanned, market-based regulatory mechanisms. Thus, we consider it as appropriate to retain the term ‘market socialism’, even if it has to be taken with a grain of salt and to some extent as an ad hoc definition. There are two crucial differences between a ‘market socialist’ and a capitalist system. The first one is that in a market socialist system the role of the state is both quantitatively larger and qualitatively superior, thereby allowing the public sector as a whole to exert an overall strategic control over the country's development path, especially in crucial areas such as setting the economy-wide rate of the accumulation and determining the speed and direction of technical progress. The second difference is that in a market socialist system, although capitalists endowed with private ownership rights on some means of production do exist, they are not strong enough to constitute a hegemonic and dominant social class, as it happens in ‘normal’ capitalist countries (see Gabriele and Schettino, 2008). Our approach on the structural differences between capitalism and market socialism is consistent with (although not identical to) that of the late Giovanni Arrighi (2007), who argued that the presently existing Chinese economy is a ‘non-capitalist market economy’ rooted both in China's ancient economic history and in its more recent revolutionary tradition. This paper focuses on the role of the state in China's industrial sector. As available statistical data are of a very aggregate nature, the analysis is of preliminary nature, and it can only provide a broad and tentative interpretation of such a vast and unique phenomenon as China's contemporary industrial development. Moreover, too little time has elapsed since the inception of economic reforms to allow for a proper historical evaluation of their ultimate significance.Footnote 2 Without underestimating the relevance of such important caveats, the paper concludes that China's state is able to engage in a novel form of strategic planning, employing as a crucial tool its ownership and control rights over the largest and most advanced industrial enterprises. It also carries out huge and ever-increasing investments in infrastructure, institution- and human-capital building, and R&D, on a scale unequaled anywhere else in the world. This public investment drive generates a network of systemic external economies,Footnote 3 which in turn decisively enhance the competitiveness, productivity, and profitability of both public and privately owned/controlled industrial enterprises. In the long run, the dominant role of the state in China's industry might consolidate itself as a sustainable structural characteristic of market socialism. The paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly exposes a few basic facts about China's industrial reforms. The section after that reviews part of a sprawling literature on SOEs’ reforms and their relative efficiency and profitability, focusing mainly on studies that covered the 1990s and the early 2000s. The subsequent section presents some statistical evidence on China's industrial enterprises and R&D activities. We show that the role of public industry has been changing but is far from marginal. The performance of public industry in China has improved dramatically in recent years, and is likely to do so even more in relative terms in the near future, due to the collapse of large sections of small-scale, export-oriented manufacturing private firms. Moreover, it has to be taken into account the impact of China's extraordinary R&D effort (the bulk of which is conducted either in large state-owned and state-holding industrial enterprises (SOSHEs) or in public universities and research centers) has important implications for evaluating the overall contribution of the state to industrial development. Finally, the last section concludes.",21
52,3,Comparative Economic Studies,01 July 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2010.14,Corruption and the Institutional Environment for Growth,September 2010,Jac C Heckelman,Benjamin Powell,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The development policy community widely believes that reducing corruption would improve growth rates in less developed countries. Since 1996, the World Bank has supported more than 600 anticorruption programs and governance initiatives developed by its member countries and publicly sanctioned 338 firms and individuals for corrupt practices. The World Bank also maintains an Institutional Integrity Department that investigates corrupt practices with a staff of more than 50 employees and consultants, and expenditures of more than $10 million annually (World Bank, 2007).Footnote 1 According to Institutional Integrity Department director Suzanne Rich Folsom, ‘Corruption has a devastating impact on the capacity of governments to function properly; on the private sector to grow and create employment; on the talents and energies of people to add value in productive ways; and ultimately on societies to lift themselves out of poverty’ (World Bank, 2007).Footnote 2 Other development agencies express similar sentiments. For example, according to USAID: Corruption … undermines economic development. In the private sector, corruption increases the cost of business through the price of bribes themselves, the management cost of negotiating with officials, and the risk of breached agreements or detection. Although some claim corruption reduces costs by cutting red tape, an emerging consensus holds that the availability of bribes induces officials to contrive new rules and delays. (USAID)Footnote 3 Despite these widely held beliefs, some economists, going back to at least Leff (1964) and Huntington (1968), believe that corruption can enhance growth by allowing individuals to pay bribes in order to circumvent inefficient rules and bureaucratic delays. Simply put, in much of the third world corruption is needed to get things done. If corruption is reduced without corresponding changes to eliminate inefficient rules, business activity and economic growth may slow down. If a first best solution of ‘good rules’ is unavailable then corruption that avoids some of the restrictions created by bad rules becomes a second best solution and an alternative path to growth. To investigate this hypothesis we examine the empirical relationship between corruption and growth when we interact political and economic institutions with corruption. Previous studies (Aidt et al., 2008; Mendez and Sepulveda, 2006; Méon and Sekkat, 2005) have examined, with mixed results, how political institutions impact the relationship between corruption and growth. We directly build on this literature by first including proxies for political institutions into our analysis and then interacting them with a measure of corruption. We find the results differ dramatically depending on the type of institutions considered. In particular, corruption is found to be more beneficial to growth for greater levels of democracy, a seemingly perverse result, but one that is consistent with Mendez and Sepulveda (2006). The reverse, however, is found when considering economic institutions; corruption is more beneficial when economic freedom is low, and the benefits diminish as economic freedom improves. We also find that among the different types of economic freedom, this result is driven primarily by the size of government and extent of regulatory burdens. Our paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we discuss other studies that have examined the relationship between corruption and growth and in particular we focus on the recent studies that have incorporated political institutions into their empirical analysis and describe how our study differs. A description of our data follows in the subsequent section. Our empirical methodology and results are presented in the penultimate section. The final section highlights specific findings and offers suggestions for further research in this area.",68

In report after report, the European Commission has underlined the incompleteness of the Turkish alignment process on the Community acquis in the area of non-discrimination and gender equality.Footnote 1 Although researchers have provided vast amounts of evidence of gender bias in wages, showing that discrimination against women prevails in most countries, there is little evidence on this phenomenon in Turkey. A few papers have explored these topics and their main insight has been that the raw wage gap observed in Turkey is surprisingly low, but that a substantial part of it remains unexplained and thus can be seen as discrimination against women.Footnote 2 The existing literature suggests that Turkey's gender equality in pay is rather good compared to other advanced industrial countries. Relative to Blau and Khan (2003)'s ranking of the gender wage gap in 22 industrialized countries for the period 1988–1994, Turkey would rank as one of the best countries.Footnote 3 The same result would be true for a comparison with European countries (Beblo et al., 2003b; Meurs and Ponthieux, 2004). However, these comparisons should be interpreted with caution because wage gap decomposition results are highly sensitive to the methodology used. As we shall see, no real conclusion can be drawn unless a unified method is used. In our analysis of the extent and causes of the gender wage gap in Turkey, we will accordingly follow the same methodology as in Meurs and Ponthieux (2004) in order to properly situate Turkey in terms of wage discrimination in European countries. In this study, we will pay particular attention to the structural characteristics of the Turkish labor market because, as noted by Ilkkaracan and Selim (2007) for Turkey, and Meurs and Ponthieux (2004) for the European countries, structural effects play an important role in explaining wage gaps. This paper is organized as follows. The first section presents the data and gives a few key statistics to present the current state of the Turkish labor market and the place it gives to women. The second section describes the methodology used to estimate wage discrimination. The third section reports the wage equation estimates. In the fourth section, the decomposition analysis of the gender wage gap is conducted and the results obtained are compared to those obtained by Meurs and Ponthieux (2004) who use the same methodology for European countries. The final section concludes.",12
52,4,Comparative Economic Studies,23 November 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2010.22,From Reputation amidst Uncertainty to Commitment under Stress: More than a Decade of Foreign-Owned Banking in Transition Economies,December 2010,John P Bonin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The experience of transition economies (TEs) with foreign bank penetration has a time dimension and an organisational dimension that are intertwined. Before 1995, virtually all foreign bank entry in TEs took the form of greenfield subsidiaries set up by a foreign bank in the host country. From 1995 onward, foreign banks participated in government programmes to privatise large state-owned banks and eventually took control of these banks. Oftentimes, a foreign bank entered a TE initially as a greenfield subsidiary and, after acquiring a former state-owned bank, merged the two entities to create a large foreign-owned bank. This takeover and consolidation activity resembles financial mergers and acquisitions in many emerging market economies. What distinguishes the TE experience from foreign bank penetration in many other countries is the hybrid corporate culture of the resulting foreign-owned bank. Having a dominant market position, the foreign-owned bank is a blend of expertise in transaction-based banking from the parent and experience in relationship-based banking from the acquired bank. Thus, I characterise the resulting bank as a hybrid that combines the hard technical information and banking skills of the parent with the soft information about clients and expertise concerning the local business environment of the acquired bank. Tensions may arise in the parent's business strategy for this hybrid bank. Parent banks in TEs are large multinational banking groups. In allocating funding to their subsidiaries, the foreign bank may take a short-term portfolio approach and focus on the risk/return tradeoffs across several host countries. By contrast, the long-term business model of the foreign parent involves making a commitment to a TE host country so as to build up the requisite reputational capital necessary for further expansion in the region. From this perspective, the parent's long-term strategy begins with establishing trust and develops into a more mature relationship in which long-term commitment mitigates short-term portfolio concerns. Consequently, the parent bank may be held somewhat hostage when economic conditions in the host country deteriorate because it is unable to withdraw support from its subsidiary without damaging its reputation and affecting adversely its long-term business interests in the region. As a result, the impact of hybrid foreign-owned banks on host country lending depends on a combination of three factors, namely, the parent's long-term commitment to its subsidiary, the parent's pursuit of short-term portfolio allocation, and the parent's own financial situation. Viewed from the perspective of the host country, the first factor is countercyclical whereas the second is procyclical because deteriorating economic conditions lead to re-allocation across holdings in several host countries. Depending on the correlation between the business cycles of the home country and the host country, the third factor can be procyclical or countercyclical, as it is determined by economic conditions in the home country of the parent bank. The countries considered in this article are the seven non-Baltic TEs that belong to the European Union (EU) and three other countries, namely, Croatia, Serbia, and Russia.Footnote 1 The Baltic countries are excluded because of their dependence on a single Swedish bank. As the literature on cross-border linkages demonstrates (Arvai et al., 2009; Maechler and Ong, 2009), the three Baltic countries are ring-fenced financially so that the Baltic region can be treated as a special case. Croatia and Serbia are included because the former appears to be knocking on the door of EU accession and the latter has taken the first steps towards this objective; hence, both are likely to enter the EU in the near future. Russia rounds out the countries considered because it is too big and too important to leave out. For some large multinational foreign banking groups, Russia is the prize host country; for some TEs (in particular, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries), Russia is the home country for the foreign banks that are beginning to penetrate their markets. In the tables, these 10 countries are divided into two groups. The first group, denoted EU5, consists of five early accession countries, namely, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. The second group is comprised of four Southeastern European countries (SEE4), namely Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Serbia, plus Russia. Other designations for groupings used in the paper are EU7, which refers to the EU5 plus Bulgaria and Romania, and EU10, which includes the three Baltic countries with the EU7. The extent of foreign ownership of banking assets in many TEs and the rapidity with which bank ownership has changed are unprecedented. Hence, these 10 countries constitute an interesting laboratory within which the special organisational characteristic of foreign bank penetration in TEs can be examined. The hybrid foreign-owned bank is the result of a takeover of a large state-owned bank by a large international bank participating in the bank privatisation process in the host country. The foreign bank's primary motive for acquiring a formerly state-owned bank may be either to gain access to an underdeveloped and somewhat protected market, that is, market power, or to use its comparative advantage to upgrade the target bank's technology and provide access to capital on better terms, that is, improve banking efficiency in the host country. As an event encompassing all three factors that influence a foreign bank's lending response to deteriorating economic conditions, the recent global financial crisis provides an opportunity to revisit the traditional question of whether or not foreign bank entry is a net benefit to a host country based on the experiences of these ten TEs during the crisis period. The next section is a literature review in which I draw four consensus results from empirical work on banking in TEs. The third section provides an overview of the current banking landscape in the 10 countries; I also identify the six dominant European multinational financial institutions in the region. In the fourth section, I discuss the domestic credit booms in the TEs that were precursors to the global financial crisis and investigate the role played by the international banks. In addition, to complement the literature on cross-border financial transactions, I provide a structural analysis based on parent-bank market shares to identify countries that may be prone to financial contagion through a banking transmission channel. Finally, I attempt to discern whether these six international banks are maintaining a commitment to the region during the crisis.

52,4,Comparative Economic Studies,23 November 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2010.16,China's Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate,December 2010,Aaron Mehrotra,José R Sánchez-Fung,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"China's emergence as a global power raises concerns about its economic policies. Monetary policy commands attention, as maintaining low inflation is crucial for social and economic stability. High inflation could erode the value of Chinese households’ large savings in domestic banks – broad money M2 amounted to over 150% of GDP in 2008. And China's policymakers are also concerned about sustaining rapid economic growth. Hence, considering a central bank loss function including inflation and output gaps, as in Svensson (1999), is likely to further our understanding of the conduct of monetary policy in China. But China's institutional features, in particular the limited role of interest rates in the monetary transmission mechanism, precludes estimating benchmark monetary policy reaction functions that are popular for analysing more advanced economies. The paper models monetary policy in China using a hybrid McCallum–Taylor reaction function (McCallum, 2000; Sánchez-Fung, 2005). The main question we seek to answer is: how does the People's Bank of China react to developments in the economy, in particular to output, inflation and exchange rate gaps? In tackling that question, the investigation estimates reaction functions to capture the monetary authorities’ adjustments of the monetary base in reaction to the variables of policy interest. The econometric modelling also estimates a reaction function incorporating a survey-based measure of inflation expectations. Discussions about China's monetary policy have largely focused on the exchange rate, especially in the context of the 2007–2009 crises, where the country's dollar peg was thought to be important in feeding the global imbalances (Corden, 2009). That is why China's decision of returning to a de facto dollar peg in the summer of 2008 generated criticism. In principle, the problem is that fixing the exchange rate renders domestic interest rate policy ineffective in the presence of full capital mobility. But China's capital controls have been largely binding, so that determining the link between movements in the exchange rate and domestic monetary policy is an empirical matter. Previous studies use quantity-based rules in modelling China's monetary policy, but the ultimate aim was different from the present study. Burdekin and Siklos (2008) examine whether Chinese monetary policy could be modelled using a McCallum-type rule. They first compare the outcomes for money growth in China to those suggested by the McCallum rule, and use the data for estimating the coefficients for the policy rule. Koivu et al. (2009) use a McCallum-type rule to forecast inflation in China. Liu and Zhang (2007) used a quantity-based rule as part of a New-Keynesian model to analyse monetary policy in China. Zhang (2009) compares price and quantity rules in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium framework for China, and finds evidence that the impact of a price rule in the economy has become more important. He further argues that, when hit by shocks, following a price rule reduces volatility in the economy. But the policy rules examined in the study do not include the exchange rate as a target variable. Zhang (2009) also includes forward-looking inflation terms in the policy rules, but these are based on actual (instrumented) inflation outcomes rather than on surveys. We find that monetary policy in China has been procyclical in terms of reactions to inflation. The finding matches the fact that accelerated reform policies have generally coincided with increase in bank lending and inflation pressures (Naughton, 2007). But there is evidence of stabilising policy via reactions to the output gap, and that may reflect the importance to the authorities of supporting economic growth and employment. Importantly, exchange rate shocks do not seem to significantly impact domestic monetary policy. The outcome probably reflects effective capital controls that have allowed for conducting a largely independent monetary policy in China. There is no evidence of a structural break, in terms of the estimated monetary policy reaction function, following the end of the strict dollar peg in July 2005. The paper also includes survey-based inflation expectations in the Chinese monetary policy reaction function. Using business surveys to evaluate the relevance of including forward-looking elements in the estimated equations produces evidence of stabilising policy in terms of inflation. But the finding is dependent on the measure of inflation expectations. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section specifies the empirical monetary policy reaction function, relating it to the specific features of China's monetary policy and institutions. The subsequent section contains the econometric modelling of the benchmark reaction functions. The penultimate section estimates an empirical monetary policy reaction function, including a survey-based measure of inflation expectations. The final section concludes.",10

The assessment of the process leading to the realisation of the EMU is potentially a significant input to any assessment of the foundations of the EMU and can provide useful lessons for current international monetary relations. In this paper, the nature of this process is assessed by means of a comparison of the Delors Report with the Werner Plan of 1970. The rest of paper is organised as follows. In Section ‘The Delors Report and the Werner Plan’, the principal question of whether the success of the Delors Report can be attributed to the emergence of a favourable international monetary environment, or to the institutional approach it adopted, is put into a wider content. Section ‘The Werner Plan’ examines the emergence of the environment that led to the drawing up of a plan aiming to establish a monetary union in the European Economic Community (EEC) by 1980. In Section ‘The Delors Report’, the Delors Report is evaluated within the wider framework of the Single European Act (SEA) and the European Monetary System (EMS). Section ‘The Delors Report versus the Werner Plan’ compares and contrasts the Werner Plan and the Delors Report followed by the identification of those factors that were detrimental for the former.

Old and New Issues on Capital Account Liberalization and Emerging Market Countries,December 2010,Manuela Moschella,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Analysing the state of the Mexican economy from the perspective of the early 1990s, it was hardly disputable that the country had embarked on a significant transformation (Lustig, 1995). By that time, Mexico had reduced its inflation to the lowest rate in 21 years and recorded GDP growth at an average rate of around 2.5% in real terms from 1989 to 1994. The public sector deficit had been also significantly curtailed and major structural reforms were carried out, including a tax reform, the privatization of important public sector enterprises, and the allocation of an independent status to the central bank. Several reforms also contribute to domestic financial liberalization, including the elimination of credit controls, reserve requirements, interest rate ceilings, and directed lending. The government also proceeded to privatize a number of commercial banks and lifted the limits on the amount of commercial paper and corporate bonds that firms could issue. These reforms proceeded in lockstep with an outward-looking orientation based on financial and trade liberalization. After an initial opposition to accelerate liberalization voiced by the President Miguel de la Madrid, who came to power on December 1982, the Mexican presidency became a prominent sponsor of the benefits of international economic integration (Haber et al., 2008). At the same time, the view according to which trade and financial liberalization was desirable and appropriate course of economic policy became widespread among domestic political and business elites who participated to political life in key government positions, contributing to forge open national economic policies (Feinberg, 1992; Schneider, 1997).Footnote 2 As a result, starting in 1989, restrictions on financial transaction were significantly lifted, including the removal of restrictions on the purchase of stocks and government bonds by foreigners, on the opening of bank accounts, and on foreign direct investments. In May 1994, the country joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), that is, the organization of the most advanced economies in the world. Becoming a member, Mexico accepted, among others, the obligation to implement the 1961 Code for the Liberalization of Capital Movements. Specifically, the Code set an obligation for member countries to ‘progressively abolish between one another’ restrictions on the movements of capital ‘to the extent necessary for effective economic cooperation’ (Art. 1a). As these developments indicate, ‘Mexico went from being a very closed economy to one of the most open in the world’ (Tornell and Martínez, 2003, p. 41). Against this background, the renewed confidence of international investors in the economic outlook of the country translated into a dramatic increase of private capital flows. In a single year, 1993, Mexico received $31 billion of capital inflows, which amounted to 45% of the total inflows to Latin America, 8% of its GDP. Following the signing of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in January 1994, which created a free-market area between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, the Mexican stock market boomed, reflecting market's perception that the agreement would improve corporate performance in the country and that Mexico's macroeconomic policies and outward orientation were unlikely to be reversed. As Pedro Aspe Armella (1993, p. 131) put it, Mexico … shifted from a situation of transferring considerable amounts of resources to the rest of the world to being a net recipient of foreign capital. Mexico quickly became a role model for the international community and the ‘benchmark’ for other middle-income countries’ performance (IMF, 1995a, pp. 2, 36). Visiting Mexico City in February 1994, US Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, was reported having said that Mexico's policies are ‘an example for all of Latin America’.Footnote 3 In the words of two economists, ‘before December 1994, Mexico was hailed as the prime example of success of market-oriented reforms. It was widely believed that … the country was poised for ascending to a sustainable high-growth, low-inflation equilibrium. … the strength of the country's fundamentals was rarely questioned’ (Calvo and Mendoza, 1996, p. 170). The positive assessment of the Mexican economic choices and performance was widely shared by the IMF where its Managing Director Michel Camdessus (1995b) publicly pointed at Mexico as a ‘remarkable success on many fronts … an inspiration for many countries’. Even after the crisis, the voice coming from the IMF defined Mexico as ‘one of the most successful developing economies’ whose success could be attributed to ‘its increased openness to the world economy and integration into financial markets’ (Camdessus, 1995b). The IMF's view of the Mexican economy can be better understood against the Fund's approach to financial liberalization that characterized the organization in the early 1990s. Indeed, concomitant at the debate on the Washington consensus, the debate within the IMF led the organization to embrace a favourable view of capital account liberalization (IEO, 2005; Leiteritz and Moschella, 2010). In particular, as the analysis of IMF publications and archival documents reveals, in the early 1990s, the IMF's view on capital account liberalization was shaped around some specific propositions related to the benefits of liberalization and the ineffectiveness of capital controls on both inflows and outflows. On the one hand, financial liberalization was conceived as a desirable economic policy because of its positive impact on member countries’ economic prospects. Specifically, IMF staff maintained that liberalization was beneficial as a mechanism of economic growth (welfare-enhancing argument) and as a mechanism to enforce sustainable economic policies (discipline argument). In other words, the reasoning within the Fund was that the free movement of capital flows would have led to an efficient allocation of capital and diversification of risk. Augmenting domestic savings, the transfer of capital to its most productive use would have boosted investments and economic growth thereby benefiting individual countries as well as the world economy. The public stance of the IMF in the early 1990s leaves few doubts that seen from 19th street in Washington the benefits associated with the liberalization of capital flows were substantial. ‘The globalization of financial markets is a very positive development’, former Managing Director Michel Camdessus (1995c) forcefully and repeatedly argued, depicting capital flows as ‘one of the driving forces of global growth in recent years’. The IMF's policies also became progressively informed on the principle of capital mobility. For instance, until the late 1990s, ‘the Fund … tended […] to welcome members’ actions taken to liberalize capital account transactions’, while it ‘generally discouraged’ the tightening of capital controls.Footnote 4 On the other hand, the Fund systematically argued that capital controls, including market-based controls, were no longer an effective tool for policymakers to avoid overheating and vulnerability to crises because of their increasing costs and ineffectiveness. For one thing, in an environment in which the liberalization of current account transactions was a reality, the opportunity to circumvent controls abounded, thereby raising the costs of administering and enforcing those controls. For the other, numerous theoretical studies and empirical observations lent substantial support to the hypothesis that capital controls were becoming increasingly ineffective, especially in the long run.Footnote 5 For instance, drawing on the data of a large panel of developing countries’ experience with capital account liberalization, staff documented that capital flight is likely to occur the introduction of capital controls notwithstanding.Footnote 6 The experience of those countries that resorted to controls during the 1993 Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis is illustrative here. Indeed, from the Fund's perspective, the temporary controls imposed by Ireland and Portugal on short-term capital flows during the crisis proved ineffective in reducing the speculative pressures on their currencies (Quirk et al., 1995, p. 12). Next to their ineffectiveness, capital controls were also viewed as damaging in that ‘they may discourage longer-term portfolio and direct investment flows’ and spill over to other countries.Footnote 7 In essence, the mainstream view inside the Fund conceived of capital liberalization as the ‘first best’ solution. ‘The rapid integration of capital markets has shifted the balance of costs and benefits away from the controls’.Footnote 8 Although the emphasis was on the question of whether countries have to choose international liberalization, the IMF also devoted attention to the question of how member countries should manage such a liberalization. That is to say, although the debate inside the IMF was primarily focused on unveiling the benefits of global financial integration, discussions were also conducted on the set of policies that national authorities were required to adopt in order to reap the presumed benefits. In this connection, primary attention was devoted to the macroeconomic toolkit member countries could use to manage the consequences of large capital inflows, including inflationary pressures and asset bubbles. Specifically, the IMF showed a preference for the use of fiscal policy over monetary policy. In the words of the staff, for instance, a successful international financial liberalization should be based on ‘a strengthened capacity to adapt fiscal policy so as to keep resource pressures from arising when private demands mount’. Interestingly, then, at that time, the choice of the exchange rate was not deemed as a key factor in the choice of whether to choose international financial liberalization.Footnote 9 Next to the macroeconomic pre-requisites, the IMF also reflected on the role that structural reforms and their sequencing could exert on capital account liberalization. For instance, reviewing the experience of developing countries with capital account liberalization, the IMF staff recognized that ‘opening of the capital account could increase the risks for banks, through the impact of increased volumes of capital flows on the deposit base, and a possible increase in exchange rate volatility on banks’ open foreign currency positions. Capital account liberalization therefore required strengthened supervision related to foreign exchange risks, generally undertaken as part of a broad process of ongoing financial sector reforms’.Footnote 10 In this connection, prudential regulation and sound supervisory frameworks were recognized a key role in the path to international financial opening. For instance, in one of the early 1990s staff memoranda, IMF staff noted that ‘freeing capital account transactions should be undertaken subsequent to, or at least broadly simultaneously with, certain other reforms’. Among them, ‘the most important [to successful capital account liberalization were] domestic financial market reforms’ including ‘strengthening prudential regulations and requirements’ especially where there is a large government deposit insurance, or where there is a presumption that large banks will not be permitted to fail. Under these circumstances, indeed, IMF staff noted that there might be ‘incentives for banks to take on excessive risk, and capital account liberalization could open up further high-risk opportunities for depository institutions’.Footnote 11 In spite of the theoretical awareness on the risks to the success of international financial liberalization coming from domestic financial vulnerabilities, the IMF did not really elaborate and act on them. As the Independent Evaluation Office (2005, p. 4) report on the IMF's approach to financial liberalization in the early 1990s noted, although the Fund ‘acknowledged the need for a sound financial system in order to minimize the risks of liberalization’, its advice to member countries ‘largely remained at the conceptual level and did not lead to operational advice on preconditions, pace, and sequencing until later in the 1990s’. This point is further illustrated in the results of one of the internal reviews of Fund treatment of capital issues in developing countries. Indeed, the review of the Article IV consultations during 1993–1995 between the IMF and a group of countries (including Argentina, Botswana, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand, and Venezuela) reveals that the IMF's support to liberalization derived from its assessment of the macroeconomic outlook rather than from the analysis of the stage of domestic financial development.Footnote 12 That is to say, the Fund encouraged liberalization when appropriate fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies were deemed to be in place and in the presence of current account surpluses. The assessment of the domestic financial system, in contrast, only played a marginal role in the Fund's support to liberalization across its membership. As the next sections are going to show, the IMF interpreted the trajectory of the Mexican economy through the lens of its economic ideas on capital account liberalization as reviewed thus far. Hence, even in the aftermath of the 1994 Mexican crisis, the IMF pointed at Mexico to demonstrate the positive effects of financial liberalization on economic growth and the ineffectiveness of capital controls as a way to manage large capital inflows and outflows. The assessment of domestic financial vulnerabilities, in contrast, was less prominent, although the IMF started properly incorporating financial sectors issues in its analysis in the aftermath of the crisis.",3

The recent literature views a resource curse as a conditional relationship, into which some countries fall but other resource-rich countries do not, and has focussed on two sets of conditioning variables: institutional dysfunction, especially when there is competition for control over resource rents, and poor government spending associated with the volatility of state revenues.Footnote 1 A central question in this paper is whether countries in transition from a centrally planned economy and Communist polity are particularly vulnerable to a resource curse due to their fragile and changing institutions and to their inexperience with policy-making in a market-based economy.Footnote 2 After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the transition from a centrally planned economy, the resource wealth of the southern Soviet republics and Mongolia was seen as a major advantage for their national economic development. However, all experienced severe transitional recessions during the 1990s and, even though economic performance improved in the 21st century it has been uneven and there are doubts about sustainability. This paper examines the links between resource management and economic performance during the transition from central planning (effectively 1990–2010). The seven countries are small open economies whose exports are concentrated in a few primary products. Table 1 provides summary statistics at the end of the Soviet era and two decades later. All achieved reasonably high levels of human capital in the Soviet era, as measured by literacy rates and life expectancy. Since 1991 they have experienced an increase in per capita income at purchasing power parity, but economic growth has been extremely uneven. The energy exporters – Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and to a lesser extent Turkmenistan – attracted inflows of capital in the 1990s (Table 2) and enjoyed exceptionally rapid growth in the period 2000–2007 (Table 3).Footnote 3 Comparative analysis is complicated by the differing resource bases and evolution of world prices for different primary products. Oil is the principal export of Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and was the source of their rapid growth in the period 2000–2008. Natural gas is more important for Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and increasingly significant for Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Minerals (copper for Mongolia, gold for the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan) involve related issues of large capital requirements, technology, timing, distributing rents, price volatility, etc. In Central Asia water is a source of conflict between upstream and downstream countries, but there are energy aspects, especially the development of hydroelectric capacity in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan (and the hydroelectric-intensive aluminium plant that produces most Tajik exports in a good year). Water is also a critical input into cotton production, which is a significant export for all Central Asian countries, especially Uzbekistan. Although the paper will focus on energy and mineral resources rather than agricultural production, it is difficult to ignore cotton. An important economic policy variation is between more dirigiste regimes (Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan) and more liberal regimes (the Kyrgyz Republic or Mongolia).Footnote 4 This may be endogenous, as the dominant role of cotton in the Uzbek and Turkmen economies at the time of independence contributed to a rent-appropriating policy stance. Cotton required extensive government presence in maintaining irrigation channels and other functions, and this presence spilled over into the maintenance of state marketing monopolies and subsequent squeezing of farmers’ margins. Moreover, with buoyant cotton prices from 1992 until mid-1996 (Figure 1), the cotton-producing countries were able to maintain public expenditure relatively well and were under less pressure to reform their economic and political systems. When cotton prices fell, Uzbekistan in 1996 and Turkmenistan in 1998 resorted to draconian foreign exchange controls, which in turn led to other restrictions on economic freedom.

Source: World Bank Global Economic Monitor at http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/global-economic-monitor The economies reliant on energy and mineral resources were under more pressure to find foreign investors to help exploit the resources, and to be more market-friendly in their policies. From 1992 to 1998 world oil prices stagnated in a $12–$20 range (Figure 2). In the 2000s, as both their production and world oil prices rose rapidly, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan reaped the fruits of contracts signed in the 1990s. The smaller economies of Mongolia and the Kyrgyz Republic had greater difficulty striking a balance in negotiations with large foreign companies to explore and exploit their mineral reserves; for the Kyrgyz Republic the contract signed soon after independence for exploitation of the Kumtor gold mine has been a source of political controversy and of fears that too much was given away to the foreign firm, while Mongolian attempts to reserve a large share of the benefits for the state meant that exploitation of the country's best mineral reserves has yet to begin.

The specific details of PSAs impact on how resource abundance affects institutional development. The following sections examine individual countries’ experience, and identify key decision variables for national governments as: how and how fast to exploit natural resources, how to share revenues from resource exports between companies and the state, and how to use revenues accruing to the state. The emphasis is on the first two, because companion papers by Lücke and Seuring and by Nygaard and Kalyuzhnova analyse the use of oil revenues. The final section draws conclusions.",21

In practical terms, the resource rent is defined as the difference between the market price of the resource, which is determined by its scarcity relative to demand, and the cost of extraction. As a source of government revenue, natural resource rents differ in two respects from other sources such as taxes. First, resource rents tend to be very volatile, fluctuating with the world market price for the commodity. Second, for exhaustible natural resources such as mineral raw materials, the annual income stream will end when the stock of the resource is depleted (as any exhaustible resource, by definition, eventually will be). Thus the prudent use of natural resource rents poses two special challenges. First, since government revenue fluctuates with the world market commodity price, medium-term expenditure plans should be based on cautious assumptions about the future price and related revenue. In essence, when the price is high, governments should spend less than current revenues and accumulate savings, which may be drawn down to keep expenditures stable when the price is low. Second, to maximize the welfare from government expenditures in the long run, some proportion of natural resource revenues should be saved. In practice, this means building up a stock of capital (be it physical capital, human capital, or foreign financial assets) that will generate income and pay for government expenditures after the natural resource is exhausted. These strategic considerations need to be framed in time spans over several generations. Such (very) long-term thinking sits uneasily with most countries’ annual budget process that is often still driven by cameralistic accounting that says little about the impact of annual flows on a government's or a country's total assets and liabilities. Hence, what institutions can help to guide fiscal decisions to account for the volatility of revenues as well as the eventual depletion of the resource? One approach practiced by many resource-rich countries and sub-national regional bodies is to set up a stabilization and savings fund that is distinct from the annual budget and fed by certain streams of resource-related revenue. Inflows are invested in capital assets; detailed rules specify the allowable types of assets. A large share of investments often goes into foreign assets in order to dampen the Dutch disease effects that arise when resource revenues inflate demand for domestic non-tradable goods and services. Capital income from the fund's assets may be reinvested or transferred to the annual budget. Earlier studies have concluded that stabilization and savings funds are no panacea for the political pressures that often lead to the twin problems of overoptimistic price forecasts and insufficient concern for long-term fiscal sustainability (Davis et al., 2001). Whether a particular stabilization and savings fund is effective in accumulating assets for the medium and long run depends on whether its rules of operation (i) are appropriate and (ii) are being followed in practice. Against this background, this paper assesses the rules and operation of the stabilization and savings funds in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Since both countries became independent in 1992, their oil exports have risen sharply and now generate a large share of government revenues. Both countries have also implemented a stabilization and savings fund, aiming for prudent long-term investment of oil-based revenues. We start out by reviewing forecasts of the time profile of oil extraction and related government revenue in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Oil production in Kazakhstan will provide large revenues well into the 2050s, whereas Azerbaijan is projected to run out of oil before 2030, that is within less than a generation. In the following section we consider the economics of stabilization and savings funds in more detail and review the resource funds in Norway and Alaska as benchmarks for good practice regarding operating rules and transparency. Against this standard, we assess the Kazakhstani and Azerbaijani funds in the two subsequent sections. The last section concludes.",7

For the first time in 75 years, political parties other than the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) gained access to all levels of government in the country. A corporatist organizational structure and a clientelistic network had enabled the PRI to maintain a seven-decade power monopoly. The system allowed the existence of small opposition parties, but because of legal and institutional barriers, none posed a major threat to the PRI until the early 1990s. Electoral reforms in 1990 and 1993 significantly reduced the PRI's opportunities of manipulating electoral results and enabled opposition parties to gain representation in the legislature and in local governments. Two strong opposition parties emerged to contest the PRI's monopoly: to its right, the National Action Party (PAN), and to its left, the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD). Mexico's electoral competition dynamic provides a unique opportunity to compare policies undertaken in a one-party system with multi-party policy choices. Under a single-party regime, absent electoral competition, incumbents’ policy choices do not exert an externality on the party's probability of reelection, therefore, there is little need for the party to monitor and control office-holders’ policies. Furthermore, if office-holders are unable to run for reelection, reputation concerns become relatively unimportant as well.Footnote 1 I argue that during the one-party regime, incumbents engaged in rent-seeking behavior, favoring special interest groups and collecting most of the benefits of regulation for themselves (Stigler, 1971; Becker, 1983). My goal is to verify empirically whether the incumbents’ single-party policy choices change when three parties compete for office. For this between-regime analysis I use a case study that follows state collective labor policies for a 9-year period. The PRI had a monopoly in power for the first 4 years of such period. State collective labor policies encompass all the regulations and negotiations that occur between the firm's management, the union and a state-level government official. Collective labor conflicts in Mexico are usually settled with some government involvement. For instance, a government elected official is in charge of deciding whether a strike is legal or not. Furthermore, it is frequently the case that disputes between unions and managers are resolved in a pre-strike bargaining phase where government intervention is critical in determining the terms of the settlement. For example, during the pre-strike bargaining phase a government-appointed committee helps determine if a wage increase is to be granted to the union. I chose to study state collective labor policies because such policy choices satisfy the following criteria. First, the policy choice relied ultimately on the corresponding local authority, the state governor. Second, the existence of identifiable interest groups whose welfare could be increased or reduced by the incumbent's policy choice. The special interest groups affected by the governors’ policies are, on the one hand, the labor unions and, on the other, the owners or managers of the firms.",

In both countries, real income per person was above the federal average. At that time, in 1991, Croatia's gross domestic product (GDP) per person was appreciably higher than that of Latvia. During the period 1989–1993, Croatia and Latvia's per capita GDP sank by a third to a half in real terms, and thereafter grew together after reversing the initial output decline at the beginning of the transition from plan to market. Starting out with a lower level of initial per capita income, Latvia was on its way to catching up with Croatia until the financial crisis hit the Baltic country hard in 2008. Thus, Croatia managed to stay ahead (Figure 1). Two intriguing questions that arise in this context are why Latvia grew so much faster than Croatia and what role the different timing of European Union (EU) accession of the two countries and their concomitant institutional change may have played in their growth performance. Gross domestic product per capita 1991 and 2008 (constant 2005 international dollars at purchasing power parity) Note: Data for the Republic of Kosovo are not available.Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators 2010 This paper aims to shed light on these questions by applying a simple version of standard growth economics to a comparison of the recent growth record of the two countries. In an earlier paper, we compared Estonia and Georgia by reviewing the main determinants of their growth, and concluded that Estonia beat Georgia on virtually every score. Unsurprisingly, therefore, Estonia and Georgia grew apart after 1991. On the basis of simple growth accounting, education and efficiency were found to make similar contributions to growth, while investment made a relatively minor contribution. Hence, growth was primarily intensive rather than extensive. In this paper, we report by similar methods how Croatia and Latvia grew together after 1991, how Latvia caught up, and how Croatia remains ahead. As before, our choice of countries to compare is mainly dictated by the fact that Latvia decided at the outset of its transition from plan to market to apply for EU membership whereas Croatia took longer to make that decision. The two countries differ in several respects. Therefore, our comparison between them will not be as clear-cut as would be, for example, a comparison of North Korea and South Korea (identical twins with different institutional origins) or of Barbados and Jamaica (similar institutions, inherited from Great Britain, but different policies as demonstrated by Henry and Miller (2009)). Our story about Croatia and Latvia will involve a number of moving parts. Our aim is to use a broad brush to paint a picture of their growth performance after 1991 in view of the evolution of several well-established determinants of growth without, however, pursuing the possible interlinkages among those determinants. Croatia and Latvia are both small (64,589 km2, population 2.2 million and 56,594 km2, population 4.5 million). Both are poorly endowed with natural resources, which may be good for their long-run growth potential as suggested by Sachs and Warner (1995) and many others, and both had cities or regions that prospered long ago. Latvia prospered when Riga and other Latvian cities became part of the Hanseatic League from 1282 onward. Croatia or, more accurately, the Republic of Ragusa/Dubrovnik, also thrived through vivacious trade from around 1360 onward. Both countries share a history of foreign rule and influence: Latvia, that of Germany, Poland, Sweden, and Imperial Russia from 1710 onward, and Croatia as part of Austria and Hungary and as a tribute-obliged vassal state of Venice and the Ottoman Empire. Yet, economically speaking, there were periods when foreign dominance did not inhibit economic prosperity (eg, Southern Latvia's ‘golden age’ in the 17th century and Ragusa/Dubrovnik under Ottoman vassalage in the 15th and 16th centuries). Overall, Latvia fared less well in economic terms during Russian rule than Croatia did under Austrian, Hungarian, and Ottoman supremacy. Both countries became independent in 1918. Latvia, after a few chaotic years, remained independent until it was occupied by Soviet Russia in 1940 under the Hitler–Stalin Pact. After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918 Croatia chose to form a new state with Serbia and Slovenia, the ‘Kingdom of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs’, renamed as the ‘Kingdom of Yugoslavia’. Both countries were occupied by Germany in 1941. Between the end of World War II and renewed independence in the early 1990s both countries were part of larger socialist or communist states. There were, however, important differences. Latvia, one of the 15 Socialist Soviet Republics, had her economy organized along the lines of a classical socialist regime based on central planning, ‘decreed prices’, monopolized foreign transactions, and absence of market institutions and markets. Croatia was an integral part of the non-aligned Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that was politically and economically more open than eastern bloc countries. Private enterprise in agriculture, trade, and small business played a much larger (and politically tolerated) role and larger (nationalized) enterprises had more freedom and room for maneuver through the evolving system of workers’ self management. Latvia, after regaining independence in 1991, quickly embarked on bold and decisive political, institutional, and economic reforms that were carried out by successive governments. We surmise that the prospect of rapid EU integration, ‘the EU perspective’, provided a critical anchor for sustained political, institutional, and economic reforms across the political spectrum.Footnote 2 Further, Latvia benefited from being close to the Nordic countries as well as to Brussels. Croatia had less access. Within less than 15 years after regaining independence, Latvia was able to accede to the EU. In 2004, Latvia also joined NATO. Until 2008, Latvia's real growth rate was the highest among the EU states but also one of the most volatile ones. Purifield and Rosenberg (2010) describe the ‘EU Membership Boom’ of Baltic countries. Initially, the country had planned adopting the euro around 2007. Then the financial crisis struck. Latvia was hit hardest of all, with real GDP declining by a whopping 21.7% between 2007 and 2009. The country needed a substantial coordinated multilateral financial support package totaling EUR 7.5 billion provided by the IMF (∼EUR 1.7 billion), the EU (∼EUR 3.1 billion), the World Bank (EUR 0.4 billion), and the Nordic governments and other bilateral creditors (∼EUR 2.3 billion) to stabilize the economic and financial situation and to put into place structural reforms. In contrast, Croatia, after seceding from Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991, suffered a 4-year war of independence with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and only in 1995 could start with EU integration, which is expected to lead to EU membership in 2012 or 2013. With an average real growth rate of around 5% per year over the last decade, Croatia's growth performance has been less spectacular than that of Latvia, but growth has also been much less volatile. Naturally, Croatia was also significantly affected by the financial crisis, but much less so than Latvia. Croatia saw its real GDP contract by a cumulative 3.6%Footnote 3 from 2007 to 2009, and weathered the economic storm without needing an international financial support package. Earlier, as Figure 2 shows, Latvia had taken a deeper and longer lasting plunge. Latvia's per capita GDP fell by almost a half from 1989 to 1993 while Croatia's per capita GDP contracted by a third. From 1991, Latvia's per capita GDP has risen from 79% of Croatia's per capita GDP to 90% in 2008.

As in Gylfason and Hochreiter (2009), the section ‘Analytical background’ lays out, in the simplest possible terms, the theoretical framework guiding the discussion to follow. In the section ‘Quantitative evidence’, selected economic, political, and social indicators are employed to illuminate the possible reasons for the economic trajectories of the two countries under review and how they differ. We present a simple growth accounting computation in an attempt to quantify the contributions of investment, education, and efficiency, including labor market arrangements and governance, to the income and growth differential between the two countries. In the concluding section, before summarizing our main findings, we briefly discuss the policy implications of the output growth comparisons of the two countries and suggest potential lessons for other countries that lag behind their erstwhile equals.",1

PPP starts with the law of one price that says free trade in goods ensures identical prices across countries when we abstract from trade barriers and transportation costs (Froot and Rogoff, 1995). A casual review of the empirical literature shows that PPP is probably one of the most extensively tested theoretical propositions. The motivation behind testing PPP is often a practical one; PPP can indicate the degree of misalignment of the nominal exchange rate and the appropriate policy response. Although PPP is simple and intuitively attractive, empirical tests have often been unable to support conclusively this core principle of international economics. Development of new econometric tools in the last two decades, notably unit root tests, cointegration and nonlinear models, gave rise to a new wave of empirical studies. Nonlinear techniques in particular have performed somewhat better than their linear counterparts, but still have not conclusively validated the PPP hypothesis in developed and developing countries (Sarno and Taylor, 2001; Bahmani-Oskooee and Hegerty, 2009). The aim of this paper is to test whether PPP holds in Croatia. Debates about the possible overvaluation of the nominal HRK/EUR exchange rate are quite common in Croatia, and thus we feel it is important to establish whether the exchange rate is aligned with fundamentals suggested by a particular theory. To do so, we use PPP to model the long-run behaviour of the exchange rate in Croatia, although we are aware of the limits of PPP theory and the relevance of other indicators of currency misalignments including (a) persistent and large current account deficits, (b) external debt, (c) high inflation, and (d) low reserves. We use a multivariate approach to model the bilateral HRK/EUR exchange rate as a function of Croatian and Eurozone price levels. In order to test PPP, we use two cointegration methods. The first, Johansen cointegration (Johansen, 1988), assumes that both the long- and the short-run behaviour of the exchange rate and price levels are symmetric. With this approach we also specify vector error correction models in order to detect whether the exchange rate pass-through is present. The second method, threshold cointegration, assumes symmetry in the long run, but allows for nonlinear adjustment in the short run (Enders and Siklos, 2001). We apply both linear and nonlinear methods because the literature (Sarno and Taylor, 2001; Bahmani-Oskooee and Hegerty, 2009) shows that nonlinear methods are more successful at detecting PPP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that applies nonlinear methodology to test PPP for the Croatian exchange rate. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews the empirical literature on PPP, using both linear and nonlinear methods. Special attention is then given to the results for transition economies, particularly Croatia. The subsequent section presents the methodology, data and results of the empirical analysis, while the final section concludes.",1

Coincident with these changes, many countries in the region experienced a dramatic increase in mortality, especially among working-age males. Various studies have investigated this mortality spike, but debate continues on the underlying causal mechanisms.Footnote 1 In a recent well-publicized contribution to this literature, David Stuckler, Lawrence King, and Martin McKee, henceforth SKM, argue in The Lancet that ‘rapid mass privatization [of state-owned enterprises] … was a crucial determinant of differences in adult mortality trends in post-communist countries’ (Stuckler et al., 2009, p. 1).Footnote 2 The evidence offered in support of this claim consists of country-level regressions of the adult male mortality rate on measures of enterprise privatization. The authors’ primary interpretation is that rapid privatization increased unemployment and consequently illness, for which they offer support from country-level analysis of unemployment. The estimated effects of mass privatization on both mortality and unemployment are reported to be positive and statistically significant only in the FSU; no evident effects are reported among Central and East European countries. The publication of SKM's study has reignited debate over the effects of economic reform. The provocative tone of the Economist leader on the topic, titled ‘Mass Murder and the Market’, reflects the stakes involved: should reformers be held responsible for millions of premature deaths?Footnote 3 Jeffrey Sachs, an architect of ‘shock therapy’ in post-communist countries, suggests that the study is a ‘confused polemic that will not withstand serious epidemiological scrutiny’.Footnote 4 On the other side, Joseph Stiglitz argues that ‘[the] Lancet is right that Poland was an example of more gradual policies’, following SKM's suggestion that gradualism should be credited with reduced mortality, and he reasserts his view that ‘ “shock therapy” was a disastrous economic policy’.Footnote 5 Did mass privatization increase mortality in post-communist countries? In this paper, we reexamine this relationship. We find that the estimated effect of privatization in cross-country data is not robust to recomputing the mass privatization measure using original-source data, to assuming short lags between economic policies and changes in mortality rates, and to controlling for country-specific mortality trends. We also examine the relationship between privatization and mortality across Russian regions, finding no evidence that privatization was responsible for the large increase in Russian mortality during the early 1990s. Finally, we reanalyze the relationship between privatization and unemployment. Counter to the claims of SKM, there is no robust evidence that privatization increased unemployment in post-communist countries.Footnote 6",4

The development model of most CEECCA countries had many common features, such as deep political, institutional, trade and financial integration with the EU and significant labour mobility to EU15 countries. However, there were also substantial differences between countries, which became more notable in the run-up to the global crisis: in a few CEECCA countries, catching up was generally accompanied by macroeconomic stability, but most countries of the region became increasingly vulnerable due to huge credit, housing and consumption booms, high current-account deficits and quickly rising external debt.Footnote 2 It was widely expected even before the crisis that these vulnerabilities must be corrected at some point, but the magnitude of the corrections when they did happen were amplified by the global financial and economic crisis. Beyond the crisis, a major question is whether the crisis is likely to have lasting economic effects. This paper assesses pre-crisis growth drivers and the medium-term prospects of the CEECCA region using cross-country growth regressions, which estimate, in cross-section and panel regression frameworks, empirical relationships between growth and a number of potential growth drivers. Many papers have adopted cross-country growth regressions for CEECCA countries; see for example Schadler et al. (2006), Falcetti et al. (2006), Abiad et al. (2009), Vamvakidis (2008), Cihak and Fonteyne (2009), Iradian (2009), European Commission (2009) and Böwer and Turrini (2010), just to mention a few of the more recent papers. However, all of these papers used sample periods that ended before the crisis and covered only the boom years of the 2000s, this boom proving unsustainable in many CEECCA countries. Pre-crisis unsustainable developments have also characterised a couple of advanced countries, such as the US or some Mediterranean euro-area countries, yet to a lesser degree than in CEECCA. Other emerging and developing countries, however, were largely exempt from such developments. Pre-crisis vulnerabilities have likely contributed to the crisis response as well. In this regard, it is important to emphasise that CEECCA countries have been hit harder by the crisis than advanced countries and other emerging and developing countries, and post-crisis recovery is also generally slower for CEECCA countries (Bruegel and WIIW, 2010). Making estimates for a sample period that proved to be unsustainable will obviously bias the results towards the finding of higher growth. When the sample includes mostly booming countries, the estimated relationships between growth and fundamentals are distorted. When the sample includes a large cross-section of countries over a long time horizon, and the booming countries are in a minority, but are differentiated by a dummy, which is done in most of the literature, then the estimate of this dummy is likely biased upward. Therefore, even though the crisis-period data are also hardly representative of standard conditions and in most, if not all, countries the output gap turned to negative, including the bust phase of the economic cycle in the sample is necessary. In our paper, we attempt a comprehensive consideration of the crisis and perform extensive robustness checks of cross-country growth regressions. To this end, we extend the sample period up to 2010, using more recent data up to 2009 and forecasts for 2010; the forecasts are primarily taken from the IMF's October 2010 World Economic Outlook and the January 2011 forecasts of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Our extended sample till 2010 also includes the beginning of the recovery from the crisis. The use of forecasts brings uncertainty to the estimates, but perhaps the possible errors in 2010 forecasts made in October 2010 and January 2011 are not so large, and since we use time-averaged data, the impact of the use of forecasts is bound to be small.Footnote 3 We perform the calculations both for the pre-crisis sample and for this extended sample period, studying the results for different country groups, different sample periods and a number of possible explanatory variables. We aim to answer the following three questions: First, how much does the crisis alter the within-sample fit of cross-country growth regressions? We answer this question by presenting estimates for both the pre-crisis period ending in 2007 and for the full period ending in 2010 that also includes the crisis. Second, has growth in CEECCA countries or of some sub-groups within this region been different from the rest of world, in the sense that these countries grew more quickly than what would have been implied by their fundamental growth determinants? The literature has approached this question by studying the parameters of a dummy variable representing certain country groups in the growth regression. We also use this methodology and study the robustness of the estimated parameter of country group dummies in the context of the crisis. But we also use a novel methodology to study the impact of EU enlargement on fundamentals. For the 10 Central and Eastern European countries (CEE10) that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 we set up a counterfactual scenario for the fundamentals such as capital inflows, trade integration and institutional development, under which no EU enlargement occurred, basing the scenario on the developments in non-EU middle-income countries. We then use our estimated models to simulate the growth effects of the incremental improvement of fundamentals due to prospective and actual EU membership. Third, how much has the crisis altered future GDP growth scenarios? The change in projections can be traced back to two factors: (1) change in the model and (2) change in the assumed path of explanatory variables. The econometric estimates provide an explanation for the first factor, and we shall formulate different scenarios for the second factor, drawing on the experience of previous crises. We draw three main conclusions. First, the crisis has altered the within-sample fit of cross-country growth regressions. The downward revision of fitted values of GDP growth from the regressions is between 1% and 3% per year for most countries. Second, the positive impact of EU enlargement on growth is smaller than previous research has shown according to the point estimates, and even the point estimates are generally not statistically significant. The dummy variable approach indicated that in the 2000s overall, the CEE10 countries seemed to grow only about 0.3% per year more than what would have been implied by their fundamentals, while the counterfactual simulation indicated about 0.15% per year extra growth because of the incremental improvement of fundamentals due to EU enlargement. Adding these two results, EU enlargement may have boosted economic growth by approximately 0.45% per year. However, since the output gap may have turned more negative in CEE10 than in other countries of the world, these results may underestimate somewhat the positive impact of EU enlargement on growth in CEE10. And third, the crisis has also altered future GDP growth scenarios. Even in the optimistic scenario that assumes a return to the pre-crisis development of fundamentals, medium-term outlooks are below pre-crisis actual growth, especially in those countries that experienced substantial credit and consumption booms before the crisis. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The next section discusses our methodology and model selection issues. The results of the growth regressions are presented in the subsequent section. We also answer our first research question in this section. The section after that discusses the effect of EU enlargement on the growth of new EU member states, and presents a discussion of the second research question. The third research question is analysed in the penultimate section. The final section presents a summary.",4
53,2,Comparative Economic Studies,17 February 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2011.1,Do Islamic Banks Have Greater Market Power?,June 2011,Laurent Weill,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the creation of the first modern Islamic bank in 1975, the number of such institutions has increased to over 300 operating in over 75 countries. Total assets of Islamic banks worldwide are estimated at about US$ 300 billion with an annual growth rate exceeding 15% over the past decade (Chong and Liu, 2009).Footnote 1 Despite these developments, the academic literature has little to say about the economic implications of Islamic banking compared to conventional banking. This could have important implications if Islamic banks differ from conventional banks in ways that foster or hamper economic development. A key issue here is the market power of Islamic banks. Market power is the ability of a firm to influence the price of products and is therefore directly linked to competition since greater competition reduces market power. Islamic banks might benefit, for example, from a clientele with a more inelastic demand driven by religious principles that confers greater market power than conventional banks. In most countries with Islamic banks, a few Islamic banks coexist with conventional banks. Therefore, religious clients out of respect for the Sharia may be more loyal to Islamic banks than non-religious clients in all categories of banks. Indeed, El-Gamal (2007) mentions that some providers and observers of the Islamic banking industry refer to these additional charges and rates for clients of Islamic banks as ‘the cost of being Muslim,’ and stresses the possibility of such overpricing.Footnote 2 Kuran (2004) supports this view by observing that Islamic banks operating in Turkey managed to quickly attract one percent of total deposits in just a few months with a small number of branches. A comparison of market power of Islamic and conventional banks is a fundamental issue, as several studies have shown the importance of market power for economic development (Petersen and Rajan, 1995; Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996; Cetorelli and Gambera, 2001). In a nutshell, the argument here is that greater bank competition enhances access to credit at lower cost, which, in turn, leads to increase borrowing by firms and promotes growth. More generally, enhancement of bank competition can favor financial development by increasing access to financial products and, as the literature shows, creating a positive link between financial development and economic development (Levine, 2005) that fosters economic development. Here, we measure and compare the market power of Islamic banks and conventional banks by computing Lerner indices for banks from 17 MENA and Southeastern Asian countries, where Islamic banks and conventional banks coexist. The observation period covers 2000–2007. The Lerner index has been widely used in recent studies focusing on market power in banking (Fernandez de Guevara and Maudos, 2007; Pruteanu-Podpiera et al., 2008; Solis and Maudos, 2008). We also use the Rosse-Panzar model which provides a measure of competition, the H-statistic, which is commonly applied in the banking industry (Claessens and Laeven, 2004; Al-Muharrami et al., 2006) to strengthen our findings. Although no empirical work to the best of our knowledge has investigated this issue, several papers are loosely related to our work as they provide elements of comparison between Islamic and conventional banks through empirical works at the bank level. In an analysis of efficiency of Turkish banks for the period 1990–2000, El-Gamal and Inanoglu (2005) compare efficiency among various types of banks, including a few Islamic banks (‘special finance houses’). They find no significant difference in efficiency between Islamic banks and other banks. Al-Muharrami (2008) compares the technical, pure technical and scale efficiencies of banks from Gulf Cooperation Council countries over the period 1993–2002. He concludes that Islamic banks are more efficient than conventional banks. Olson and Zoubi (2008) compare the accounting ratios of Islamic and conventional banks for the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and find a greater profitability for Islamic banks. Finally Cihak and Hesse (2010) perform a comparative analysis of Islamic and conventional banks in terms of financial stability. They compare the Z-score, an inverse measure of the bank's probability of failure, for a sample of banks from 18 countries, and find that small Islamic banks are financially stronger than small conventional banks, while large conventional banks are financially stronger than large Islamic banks. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Methodology is reported in section 3. The empirical results are provided in section 4. Concluding remarks appear in section 5.",86

The Case of Macedonia,June 2011,Jane Bogoev,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The main research aims of this paper are to empirically investigate the existence of the bank lending channel and its determinants in Macedonia. We estimate two different loan supply functions by disaggregating the loans by currency, in denars and in foreign currency (mainly in euros). The rationale for examining the two loan supply functions separately is the relatively high share of foreign currency loans in the total loans in the Macedonian banking sector (see Figure 1), which is typical of many transition economies, and the belief that such loans may respond to variables different from those affecting loans in domestic currency (Kohler et al., 2005). Stock of total bank loans and stock of loans in denars to non-financial private sector, in millions of denars Source: NBRM (http://www.nbrm.mk/?ItemID=A55FFC32FC478E4A89444507A6C02C45) Hence, Macedonia's fixed exchange rate, banks’ dependence on foreign financing and the level of currency substitution through the presence of foreign currency loans may thus weaken the impact of domestic monetary policy. According to the ‘impossible trinity’, a country's independent monetary policy setting under a fixed exchange rate and relatively high openness is very limited (Mundell, 1963; Fleming, 1962). This may also be the case in Macedonia. Hence, with this research we investigate whether changes in the domestic reference rate really matter for banks in Macedonia or whether changes in the foreign reference rate are more important in determining their loan supply decisions.",4

In the downturns of 1975, 1982, and 1991 the GDP of developing economies fell further than that of the developed economies and recovered more slowly. In this crisis, the growth of developing economies outpaced that of the developed economies before the crisis, never reached the same lows during the crisis, and recovered more quickly in the aftermath. That faster recovery will contribute to the multipolarity of the global economy. By 2025, India and China will account for 36% of the world GDP. By 2015, half of China's trade will be with other countries in the developing world, compared with 13% in 1995. On the whole, emerging economies ‘had a very good crisis’. This is clear in East and South Asia, but also in Africa and, perhaps surprisingly, in Latin America. Peru's GDP did not contract at all. Between April and September 2010, the IMF upgraded Argentina's growth forecast from 3.5% to 7.5%. Why has a region known as a ‘laboratory for economic troubles’, become a model of economic stewardship? Mario Blejer, Governor of the Central Bank of Argentina during the deepest moments of the crisis 2001–2002, and now Vice Chairman of Banco Hipotecario gave five reasons. The first is that Latin America is now pragmatic about exchange rates. It had previously relied on hard pegs to curb the high inflation of the 1980s, believing that inflexibility added to credibility. Now it relies on floating rates, but not pure floats. Central banks intervene heavily to maintain competitiveness. As a helpful byproduct, they also accumulated sizeable foreign-exchange reserves. The second reason, related to the first, is that Latin America also benefited from judicious capital controls. Third, its banks were well regulated and capitalized, having learnt the lessons of the 1990s crises. Latin American countries were ‘one step ahead’ of global regulation, having already implemented many elements of Basel III, doing what was appropriate for them, even if it went above and beyond global rules. Unlike Europe's banks, Latin America's banks are no longer heavily exposed to government bonds, for example. Regulating the region's banks was also made easier by their eschewal of complex financial instruments. Fourth, Latin America's fiscal policy is also much improved. Public debt in the region has fallen to about 32% of GDP on average. Half of Latin America would meet the Maastricht fiscal criteria for entry into the euro area. Few, if any, of the euro's members now meet them. Fifth, Latin America maintained social peace through social programs. In the past, social spending eventually became counter-productive, because the high fiscal cost contributed to inflation, which hurt the poor. More recently, social policies have had happier effects. They reduced social conflict, which made it easier to implement structural reforms, which in turn, helped the economy to grow, making social spending more affordable. In short, Latin America, having crashed many times before, this time stopped at the red light. It is true that Latin America was lucky, enjoying high commodity prices. But the region made good use of its luck, whereas it had squandered it in the past. If developing economies weathered this crisis better than previous ones, the West suffered far worse. In its vulnerability to crony capitalism, the West has proved to be more like than unlike the Rest. Before the crisis, everyone knew that lobbying and special-interest politics could influence US regulations. But this was seen as a micro-problem. The crisis showed that this lobbying and crony capitalism could have a ‘macro-impact’ in the West, just as it had a macro-impact in Suharto's Indonesia or Mobutu's Zaire. In many of the earlier Latin American crises, problems in the real economy eventually migrated to the financial sector. There, the problems became magnified, such that the financial system became part of the problem itself. Something similar may have happened in the advanced economies in this crisis. Identifying the root cause will be the subject of academic research for years to come. But one plausible version is that, in the face of stagnant household incomes and worsening inequality, private consumption in the United States could only be sustained through over-borrowing and asset inflation, rendered possible by low interest rates in the United States and high savings in China and other developing countries. In sustaining the growth in private consumption, the financial sector rendered possible what should have been impossible. If that is the case, it casts into doubt some longstanding beliefs about the benefits of deep financial markets – explored in Paul Wachtel's paper in this Symposium. Empirical work in the 1990s appeared to demonstrate a link between growth and various measures of the size or depth of the financial sector. The link was strong: the deeper your financial markets, the faster your growth. A 10 percentage point increase in financial depth as a share of GDP increased growth by one percentage point. But perhaps this econometric result was too good to be true and needs to be revisited. The result relied more on variations across countries than on variations within countries over time. Some countries, where private credit is only 10%–30% of GDP, would clearly benefit from financial deepening. But episodes of financial deepening do not reliably produce spurts of growth. In the United States, for example, the debt-to-GDP ratio rose by a third in the 1980s and by another third in this decade. Did this deepening represent an improvement in the financial system, or did it simply represent increased leverage and risk-taking? The 15 severe financial crises of the past 30–40 years were all preceded by a significant deepening of the financial system. As a result, central bankers do not always know whether to celebrate or fear the growth of the financial system over which they preside. Probably there is a need for better measures of the evolution of the financial system. Sheer size may be the wrong metric. Some economic historians argue that eras of great progress, such as America's rapid industrialization in the late 19th century, require both innovative firms and also innovative intermediaries to finance them. How can economists distinguish between that kind of useful innovation and the financial extravagance that presaged the crisis? The workshop discussed whether 2008 represented a failure of the financial sector, or a failure in its regulation. The normal presumption is that rich countries have better rules – that is one reason why they are rich. But in this crisis, the worst regulated financial systems were in affluent countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Iceland, and Ireland. If the sophistication of rules rises with per capita income, another, offsetting factor must also rise to explain the regulatory failures of rich countries. Professor Paul Romer of the New York University Stern School pointed out that as economies grow in sophistication, the financial sector also grows as a share of GDP. A large financial sector may lobby for weak rules. It may also pay far better than the regulatory bodies that police it. Able regulators will not stay in their jobs for very long. In the United States, a regulatory job is a half-way house on the way to returning to the regulated sector, where you can cash in on your regulatory experience. That might be different if countries were prepared to pay their regulators competitive salaries, as in Singapore, where the top salary for a civil servant can be up to US$1.5 million. Weak financial regulation may also reflect the conventional wisdom of academics, whose theories legitimized high debt and high compensation as a way to align the interests of managers and shareholders. Academics can be vulnerable to herd thinking, with their ideas converging as they evolve through academic discussions and peer review. If academics are herd-like, then a little prodding by interested parties, such as financial institutions, may shepherd thinking in the wrong direction. The workshop discussed the role of fiscal policy in response to the crisis and the view that political and ideological beliefs prevented the use of more active fiscal policies. Nonetheless the public finances have deteriorated dramatically and fiscal repairs will take time. Ten years ago, developing countries were confronted with large deficits and debts, relative to the size of their GDP. What lessons emerged from their experience that could be useful for advanced economies? In his paper, Jeffrey Frankel suggested that advanced economies need to ‘reimport’ economic lessons they originally exported to other countries. For example, fiscal policy was historically countercyclical in advanced economies; procyclical in developing countries. In the United States, for example, Presidents George Bush senior and Clinton took advantage of economic recovery to narrow the budget deficit. Sadly, the United States forgot that lesson in the last 10 years. But Chile took it to heart. Chile introduced a fiscal rule in 2000 that was enshrined into law in 2006. The law required a balanced budget when, and only when, the copper price was on its long-run trend and GDP was at its full potential. The rule allowed deficits in bad times; and required surpluses in good. As copper prices rose, the proceeds were squirreled away. This abstemiousness earned the prime minister and finance minister the lowest approval ratings of any since the restoration of democracy. When the copper price plunged in the crisis, Chile drew on its fiscal savings, cushioning the recession. The prime minister and finance minister then enjoyed the highest approval ratings since the restoration of democracy. Chile's fiscal rule that sets budget targets according to the cycle is one example of a ‘big lesson from a small country’, which other countries should emulate. But they cannot leave it to politicians to judge what is structural and what is cyclical. The crucial innovation in Chile was not the rule itself, but the decision to allow independent experts to decide the long-term trend for GDP and the copper price. It would be advisable to give such fiscal experts the same independence now enjoyed by central banks. During the workshop discussion questions were raised, however, as to whether Chile's remarkable fiscal rule could be exported elsewhere. Rules and institutional innovations do not always travel well. There have been futile attempts to export New Zealand's civil-service reforms, for example. Other failed transplants include the poorly enforced traffic lights in St Petersburg, which cause more accidents than they prevent. In Vietnam, the National Assembly sets a budget target. But all that means is that much of the ‘budget’ is simply called something else. In the future, countries might benefit from emulating Chile's fiscal rule, but first they must cope with the fiscal legacies of the past. Given the strain it added to the public finances, was fiscal stimulus a mistake? Economists do not agree on the size of the fiscal multiplier, or if it even exists, but it is hard to argue that no fiscal stimulus was needed. One way to demonstrate the benefits of fiscal stimulus is to look at its effects industry by industry. Some industries are inherently vulnerable to credit constraints, because they depend heavily on external finance or because their assets are less tangible and therefore less useful as collateral. It can be shown that those industries do better when fiscal policy is countercyclical. In a crude Keynesian view, indiscriminate spending stimulates the economy regardless of how the money is spent. There, however, a good case to be made for targeting stimulus spending on measures such as Germany's kurzarbeit policies that subsidized a shorter workweek, helping to preserve jobs. Fiscal austerity should also be targeted. As countries bow to fiscal constraints, they should be careful what they cut, and equally careful about how they raise revenues. Some kinds of government spending helps growth more than other kinds, and some taxes damage growth less than others. Indeed, the effect of taxes on growth depends largely on how the tax revenue is spent. In corrupt countries, where taxes are misspent, they do seem to damage growth. In countries with little corruption, taxes and growth are positively correlated.",1

53,3,Comparative Economic Studies,24 March 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2011.5,"Crisis and Growth in the Advanced Economies: What We Know, What We Do not, and What We Can Learn from the 1930s",September 2011,Barry Eichengreen,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"As this paper is drafted, it has become commonplace to observe that there is a high degree of uncertainty about the course of the economy. Those making this observation are typically concerned with the high level of uncertainty surrounding the short-term growth prospects of the advanced economies: whether the expansion now underway will continue or be interrupted by a double dip. I would like to suggest that a comparably high degree of uncertainty surrounds the question of whether the medium- and long-term growth potential of the advanced economies has been impaired. This uncertainty arises for three reasons. First, experience in other recent recessions is of dubious relevance to the current episode. Typically, studies of this question have looked at the trend rate of growth and its determinants before and after a set of banking crisis dates. The crises considered are heterogeneous: while some are as serious as the recent episode, others are considerably less so.Footnote 1 Financial crises also differ in how effectively they are resolved; growth experience following the Swedish crisis of the early 1990s, in the wake of which damage to the banking system was repaired relatively quickly, is unlikely to tell us much about the medium-term effects of the current crisis. Whereas the crises considered are, with few exceptions, idiosyncratic national events, the recent crisis infected the entire OECD; thus, the opportunity for individual countries to export their way out of domestic difficulties did not arise to anywhere near the same extent in the recent episode. Where previous studies look at growth performance in the wake of banking crises, the recent episode is more than just a crisis for the banking system. It affected the shadow banking system and securitization markets at the same time it affected the banks, and in some cases it affected them even more powerfully. Second, empirical work focusing on aggregate effects is inconclusive and unconvincing. Estimating what has happened to the trend rate of growth as a result of a crisis presupposes an ability to estimate the trend. This is something on which economists do not agree. Growth potential is not constant in the absence of a crisis. A pre-crisis trend estimated over a relatively long period may under-state pre-crisis growth potential and therefore overlook post-crisis damage if productivity growth was accelerating prior to the crisis. Recall the ‘new economy’ argument that US productivity growth accelerated around the middle of the 1990s due to the adaptation to new information and communications technologies. If there really was and is a new economy, then attempting to measure the trend rate of growth over a longer period will underestimate it. Alternatively, measuring pre-crisis growth over a shorter period, say as growth between the two immediate pre-crisis business-cycle peaks, creates the danger that estimates of the trend will be distorted by peculiar features of the cyclical expansion and the unsustainable growth that sowed the seeds for the crisis itself. This approach will tend to over-estimate pre-crisis growth and exaggerate the damage. It is no surprise, then, that studies seeking to identify changes in trend growth before and after crises reach a variety of conclusions. Third, there is little agreement on the relative importance of the mechanisms through which major recession and financial distress may impact long-term growth potential. Some analysts emphasize the danger that investment will fail to recover because the return to capital will have fallen permanently as a result of the crisis and the misallocation of pre-crisis investment. Financing constraints will be tighter because bank balance sheets have been impaired, because borrowers have less collateral, and because of tighter regulation. Finance being harder to come by, there may be less investment in research and development and related activities that throw off positive externalities for growth. Other observers emphasize the pernicious effects of the policy uncertainty that inevitably arises in a crisis and its aftermath. The list goes on. Public debt loads will be higher in the wake of a crisis: this implies higher taxes and interest rates. Structural and hard core unemployment will rise, causing skill acquisition on the job to suffer. Labor force participation will be discouraged. The long-term unemployed will become demoralized and apathetic. Finally, there is the danger that, the problems that brought on the crisis not having been dispatched, instability may be back.Footnote 2 In the remainder of this paper, I will argue that progress on determining whether growth potential been impaired will occur through research on specific mechanisms through which recession and financial distress affect growth capacity. I will suggest that historical evidence from earlier episodes like the 1930s, when the recession was deep, the crisis was global, and financial distress was pervasive, is a promising source of information on the issues at hand. On the basis of this evidence, I will argue that there is little reason to think that the long-term growth potential of the advanced economies has been significantly impaired, at least insofar as such damage operates through the standard economic channels. Neither financing constraints, nor public debt burdens and structural unemployment was a binding constraint on long-term economic growth in the wake of the Great Depression. Insofar as the conclusions carry over, it is unlikely that they will be binding constraints today. Rather, the operative constraint in the 1930s was fractionated, polarized politics that resulted in reactive policies. Where such policies predominated, they hindered the economy's adjustment to its new circumstances and depressed productivity growth. If one is concerned to avoid permanent damage from the crisis, this is the channel of which to beware. The next section first elaborates my argument about the inconclusiveness of studies using aggregate data on GDP growth in an effort to determine whether growth potential is impaired by crises. The two subsequent sections then consider specific mechanisms through which crises may lead to secular growth slowdowns – damage to the financial system, increased public debt, heightened policy uncertainty, structural unemployment, and less spending on research and development – and tests them against data from the Great Depression. The penultimate section highlights the danger that the political polarization may prevent a constructive policy response. The final section concludes.",5

Other countries around the world should and would follow it. Japan's admired institutions included relationship banking, keiretsu, bonus compensation for workers, lifetime employment, consensus building, strategic trade policy, administrative guidance, pro-saving policies, and corporate goals of maximizing companies’ industrial capacity or market share. These features were viewed as elements of Japanese economic success that were potentially worthy of emulation. The Japanese model quickly lost its luster in the 1990s, however, when the stock market and real estate market crashed, followed by many years of severe stagnation in the real economy.Footnote 1 A decade ago, many thought that the lesson of the 1990s had been that the United States’ variant of capitalism was the best model, and that other countries should and would follow. The touted institutions included arms-length banking, competition for corporate control, Anglo-American securities markets, reliance on accounting firms and rating agencies, derivatives, bonus-compensation for executives, an adversarial legal system, deregulation, pro-consumer credit policies, and corporate goals of maximizing companies’ profits or share price. These features were viewed as elements of US economic success and potentially worthy of emulation. The American model quickly lost its attractiveness in the 2000s, however, when the stock market and real estate market crashed. Poor economic performance left per capita income and median household income below their levels of 2000 – even before the severe US-originated recession of 2008–2009.Footnote 2
 Where should countries look now, for models of economic success to emulate? Perhaps they should look to the periphery of the world economy. Some smaller and less-rich countries have experimented with policies and institutions that could usefully be adopted by others. Singapore achieved rich country status with a unique development strategy. Among its many innovations was a paternalistic approach to saving. Costa Rica in Central America and Mauritius in Africa are each conspicuous performance standouts in their respective regions. Among many other decisions that worked out well, both countries have foregone a standing army. The result in both cases has been histories with no coups and with financial savings that could be used for education and other good things. Slovakia and Estonia in Central/Eastern Europe have simplified their tax systems by means of a flat tax.Footnote 3 Some of the lessons from emerging market countries can be useful for the big advanced countries. Two illustrations from microeconomics: First, Singapore pioneered the use of the price mechanism to reduce traffic congestion in its urban center. London emulated Singapore when it successfully adopted congestion pricing in 2003; other big cities should do the same. Second, Mexico pioneered Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT). CCT programs, which make poverty benefits contingent on children's school attendance, have been emulated in many countries, and embraced even in New York City.Footnote 4 Some emerging market and developing countries also have lessons for the United States in areas of macroeconomics, specifically regarding the cyclicality of fiscal policy. To state the message of this paper most succinctly, over the last decade countries from Chile to China learned how to run properly countercyclical fiscal policy: taking advantage of boom periods such as 2003–2008 to achieve high national savings, and in particular to run budget surpluses, which then allows some fiscal ease in response to downturns such as 2008–2009. During this same period, advanced countries such as the United States and United Kingdom forgot how to run countercyclical fiscal policy. Perhaps the ‘leaders’ could look to the ‘followers’ for some tips on how to get back on track.",3

The crisis has also revealed that we are in a new world, with multiple sources of growth and new powerful links between developing and developed countries and among developing countries. The crisis accelerated the change in the global economic landscape, one in which developing countries have acquired increasing importance in global economic growth and share of global GDP. Nearly half of global growth today comes from developing countries. The crisis and the new global economic landscape that has emerged with developing countries taking center stage has not only given rise to the Group of 20 (G-20) as the relevant forum for global economic cooperation, but it has also compelled policymakers and researchers to question whether development economics in its present form is well positioned to tackle the most urgent issues of the day. What can developed countries learn from the rise of the emerging economies? These two landmark developments, the severe 2008–2009 crisis and the changing global landscape, have led to a serious questioning of the old orthodoxy. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we document the changing global landscape before and after the crisis, emphasizing this shift toward multipolarity. In particular, we emphasize the ascent of developing countries in the global economy before, during, and after the crisis. Second, we explore what these global economic changes and the recent crisis imply for shifts in the direction of research in development economics. We place a particular emphasis on the lessons that developed countries can learn from the developing world. We emphasize four sets of issues that deserve attention moving forward. First, we emphasize the importance of structural transformation in the process of economic development, and the role that the government can play in accelerating or retarding that process. Second, we discuss the importance of promoting inclusive growth, which we refer to as broadening opportunities. Third, we highlight the increasingly risky global environment, with fluctuations in weather, capital flows, and trade highlighted in particular. Finally, we underline the importance of aid effectiveness, and seek to understand how we can better learn from results. These four areas we refer to as the ‘TORR’ framework, which is shorthand for a focus on transformation, opportunities, risks, and results. The paper is organized as follows. The first section, ‘A new global economic landscape’, presents stylized facts of the global economic landscape since the early 1980s and projections into 2030. The second section, ‘What can developed countries learn from developing countries?’, discusses the researchable questions and lessons that have emerged post crisis, grouped into four set of issues: transformation, opportunities, risk, and results (TORR). The last section concludes.",2

Since the early 1990s, the government had used fiscal stimulus in response to the weak performance of the economy in the wake of collapsing real estate and stock market prices. Stimulus was applied in an on-again, off-again manner.Footnote 1 Nonetheless, the consequence was that by the time of the 2008–2009 global recessions, the ratio of gross government debt to GDP was approaching 200%, the highest among industrialized countries. Particularly after the exposure in 2010 of the problems facing Greece, political debate in Japan focused on the dangers of using fiscal stimulus given the high level of outstanding debt. However, this was not a problem for Japan. The government was able to issue new debt at extremely low interest rates of roughly 1%, because the banking sector was willing to absorb bonds because of the weak demand for commercial loans. Furthermore, virtually all government debt was held by Japanese investors rather than foreigners. The government was unlikely to face market resistance to its bond issues for a number of years to come. Nonetheless, the economic recovery was somewhat hampered by the political unwillingness to use more aggressive fiscal policy. The second issue was a rising exchange rate. The 2002–2007 recovery had been fueled by a weak real effective exchange rate. But during the global recession, the yen strengthened. Although the real effective exchange rate was only slightly above its 30-year average by late 2010, it had risen roughly 20% since 2007. Going forward, therefore, the economy will not benefit from the boost that a weak yen had provided for the exports in the early 2000s. Third, the economy continued to experience mild deflation. Starting in 1995, Japan has experienced almost continual deflation. Although the level of deflation has not been high enough to cause households to postpone purchases in the hopes of buying at a lower price in the future, it has hampered monetary policy because of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Economists have debated on the use of quantitative easing, but the conservative Bank of Japan has been reluctant to carry this experiment very far. These factors imply that the economic recovery in 2010 and 2011 was likely to be relatively weak, paralleling the situation in a number of other industrialized countries. At some point, gradual strengthening of domestic demand should cause economic growth to accelerate, but by then the economy will be facing the long-run factors considered in the rest of this paper.",2

53,4,Comparative Economic Studies,30 November 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2011.29,The Way We Were: Reflections on the Comparative History of Comparative Economics,December 2011,Peter Murrell,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"‘The Way We Were’ is a fitting subject for a Presidential address of the Association for Comparative Economic Studies.Footnote 1 Having spent my career studying comparative economics, this is an appropriate juncture for me to step back and assess the characteristics of the field in which I have been immersed. ‘The Way We Were’ (Pollack, 1973) was a popular movie at the time I began my career, a movie whose themes are resonant with the history of our field. In the movie, a disillusioned socialist with a sense of history and an admirer of a capitalism unrestrained by institutions interact with each other, only managing to agree to disagree. This was what our field sometimes seemed like in the early years of my career and especially in the critical 1989–1992 period when the now-formerly socialist countries began their long transition process. But I want to look forward as well as backward. The transition has shared its years with perhaps an even bigger revolutionary force, the consolidation of the era of computers for all and the birth and spread of the internet. The ease of computing, the massive amount of information now being stored, and its easy accessibility on the internet give us the ability to conduct intellectual history in a new way, which has recently been coined culturomics (Michel et al., 2011). This paper presents detailed statistics on the character of publications over time, showing how the tastes and concerns of comparative economists differed from others. It is no exaggeration to say that the information that appears below would have taken several years of full-time research to collect had this been tried only a few years ago. Now amassing this type of information is relatively trivial. The basic methodology is to collect data on the occurrence of critical keywords in articles published in journals from 1977 to 1992, showing fluctuations over time in usage. The journal used to define our field is the Journal of Comparative Economics (JCE), the Association's flagship publication.Footnote 2 The paper presents data on the frequency of words that are emblematic of different concepts and then compares time-series of frequencies in the JCE to those in other salient journals, hence the double use of the word comparative in the paper's subtitle – a Comparative History of Comparative Economics. The beginning year of the time-series is the inaugural year of the Journal of Comparative Economics. The ending year is unfortunately early, determined by a lacuna in a critical database, to be described below. The words are combined in Boolean searches that correspond to subject and methodological areas of interest. Thus, for example, when I examine the amount of attention paid to socialism, I search in papers for the use of terms that are variants on socialism or communism. Complete details of categories and of search terms are presented in the following section and in Table 1. This paper, being a revised Presidential Address, has only touched the surface of what these new methods of conducting intellectual history can offer. Nevertheless, the paper does highlight some significant characteristics of our field. Comparative economics was overly concerned with the characteristics of socialism and the comparison of socialism and capitalism. But in contrast to others in our broad discipline, we did make economic systems a centerpiece. And we were concerned with all the features of systems, including institutions, law, and culture, which were not staples of economic research in the 1970s and 1980s, but are now. Perhaps these emphases explain the fact that comparative economists were much more focused on the building of institutions at the start of transition than were other economists (Easterly, 2006). Among its other observations, the paper shows that comparative economics paid due attention to empirical issues but was much less focused on theory than was the rest of the discipline. Indeed, a significant subset of papers in the comparative field relied solely on verbal reasoning, a stark contrast with the elite journals. In all likelihood, this was a product of the difficulties of using standard analytical techniques to examine complete, complex, existing systems. Comparative economists chose a distinctive point on the trade-off between pushing new analytical techniques and focusing on the difficult tasks of understanding examples of real-world economic systems. The paper begins with a discussion of methodological matters in the next section. Then I provide examples of the use of the methodology, by examining a central set of related issues – the degree to which the field was focused on socialism, the degree to which it was truly comparative in nature, and the extent to which it studied economic systems. Subsequent sections discuss the amount of attention paid to institutions, law, and culture, the use of theory or empirics, or neither, the degree to which advanced analytical techniques were employed, the degree to which the field was normative in nature, the use of neoclassical economics, and the relative focus on micro- or macroeconomics. All of this is underpinned by comparisons between the economics discipline as a whole and the comparative economics field. The conclusion provides a summary of all of these analyses and some further reflections. The figures contain much more information than I can comment upon in a relatively brief paper. Readers are invited to study those figures themselves, to draw many further lessons about the comparative history of comparative economics.",5

53,4,Comparative Economic Studies,01 September 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2011.9,Extreme Risks in Financial Markets and Monetary Policies of the Euro-Candidates,December 2011,Hubert Gabrisch,Lucjan T Orlowski,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Volatility shocks associated with the global financial crisis of the period 2007–2009 have magnified extreme risks in both mature and emerging financial markets (Orlowski, 2010b). This study investigates the proliferation and scale of these risks as well as their repercussions for the conduct of monetary policies in the euro-candidate countries. Extreme tail risks result from the leptokurtic distribution of financial market variables. This phenomenon is well known in practice and widely researched in the literature. In essence, a leptokurtic distribution means that observations are more dispersed around the mean value and assume more extreme values (ie have fatter tails) than they do in a normal distribution. Thus financial variables that are close to the mean value in normal market periods may be widely dispersed at turbulent times, which results in their ‘fat tails’. Interest rates and other financial variables that serve as instruments or policy monitoring parameters for central banks are characterized by such distribution. These variables are vulnerable to sudden volatility outbursts, and thus may become very unstable (Orlowski, 2010b). Extreme tail risks of these financial variables impair implementation of monetary policy when the policy is based on parsimonious rules that commonly assume normal distribution of key variables, thus ignoring their leptokurtic time-pattern. In essence, extreme volatility shocks inhibit monetary policy transmission mechanisms and reduce the efficiency of standard interest-rate policies (Curdia and Woodford, 2010; Svensson, 2010). We argue that outbreaks of extreme tail risks in the euro-candidates during financial crises call for extraordinary monetary policy responses that cannot be based on standard Taylor rules. To mitigate tail risks, monetary policies ought to be comprehensive and supplemented with appropriate macro- and micro-prudential regulatory policies. These policy requirements, coupled with international coordination, are precepts of our proposed new financial stability framework for economies converging to the euro. Our empirical investigation is focused on detecting extreme tail risks (or fat tails) in the distribution of selected financial market variables, namely, equity market indexes, interbank rates and exchange rates, all of which are relevant for the conduct of monetary policies in converging economies. We analyze volatility patterns of these variables in the euro-candidate countries that are pursuing relatively independent monetary policies with flexible exchange rates, including the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Romania. For comparative purposes Slovakia is also included. Although it has already adopted the euro as of January 2009, it embraced a flexible exchange rate regime during the euro-convergence period. The selected countries have been pursuing inflation targeting without a formal disclosure of a specific instrument rule (Orlowski, 2005, 2008a). However, a recent examination of their monetary policies’ possible adherence to open-economy instrument rules (Orlowski, 2010a) suggests that, in the case of the Czech Republic and Poland, the inflation gap is still a predominant driver of central bank reference rates. In contrast, adjustments of the Hungarian reference rate are associated mainly with changes in the exchange rate gap. There is no evidence that the central bank reference rates in these countries respond to the desire to lower the output gap. In light of these findings, we support the argument of Svensson (2003) that a targeting rule is less rigid than an instrument rule. However, we intend to examine whether the flexible inflation targeting pursued by our selected countries has played any role in lowering extreme tail risks associated with the recent financial crisis. Our analysis is focused on three types of market risks that directly affect monetary policy decisions: equity market risk, interest rate risk and exchange rate risk. We employ GARCH volatility tests augmented with the in-mean GARCH variance as a proxy of a risk premium or discount. For the purpose of evaluating the degree of leptokurtosis, that is, the prevalence of fat tails in the conditional volatility patterns, we apply the generalized error distribution (GED) parameterization. Our working assumption is that the estimated GED parameters of the examined financial market variables are considerably lower than 2, indicating the existence of fat tails. The next section reviews the literature on the sources of extreme risks and their severity during the financial crisis of the period 2007–2009. The setup of the analytical models is explained in the subsequent section. The empirical results based on the GARCH-M-GED testing are presented and discussed in the section after that.

Since then and until the recent bout of financial turbulence initiated in 2008 by the sub-prime crisis in the US, the drop off in the frequency of such crises has been notable. However, the absence of a crisis episode does not in any case mean that there are not some potential risks looking forward. Indeed, some pressure has been associated with very large private capital inflows and a weaker-than-expected growth performance in the developed world. During recent years, Southeastern European economies experienced favourable prospects for future growth such as large net capital inflows, high growth rates, success in containing inflation, steadily increasing foreign exchange reserves, closer institutional links with the EU and extensive foreign ownership in their banking systems. Nevertheless, there are some worries going forward due to potential vulnerabilities, especially at a time when the growth rate in advanced Europe is falling (see Bank of Greece, 2009; Gardó and Martin, 2010). These worries include high current account deficits worsening the country's external financing requirement; the strong economic downturn putting additional pressure on general government balances; a resurfacing of inflation pressures; high unemployment rates; a large external gross borrowing requirement; high private credit growth; however, a healthy, competitive and a dynamic private sector has not yet been fully established. Although most of the 1990s had been characterized by an expansion in private infrastructure investment and in aggregate demand and supply, emerging Europe had experienced many episodes of economic and political crises. Past financial crises were driven by factors such as poorly developed financial systems, excessively volatile macroeconomic policies, a weak domestic banking sector, dependence on external money flows and uncertain growth prospects. The underlying triggers of these crises were likely to operate simultaneously in the foreign exchange market, the market for bank assets and for sovereign debt paper.Footnote 1 These crises involved real losses, increased investors’ perception of market risk and their awareness of the need for adequate country risk management. In this paper, we use the theoretical framework of international banking and the country risk calculus in an effort to study the experience of Greek banks in Southeastern Europe (SEE) over the past decade. In particular, we try to assess any potential pressures and study their determinants. These pressures can be seen as the product of two factors. The first factor is value at risk, that is, the banks’ exposure, and the second is the probability of a sovereign risk event. We focus on both factors. As a sovereign or a country risk event is largely independent of the credit standing of the individual loan to the borrowers, a lending decision to a party residing in a foreign country should be a two-step decision (Saunders and Cornett, 2003). First, the lender assesses the underlying credit risk quality of the borrower, as for a normal domestic loan. Second, the lender assesses the sovereign of the country in which the borrower resides. Broadly speaking, country risk is the risk of the loss due to country-specific factors related to political, financial and economic instability that impact the value of the country's bonds and equities (Harvey, 1995, 2004). Here, we focus mainly on macroeconomic threats such as economic crises that are important to all investors and lenders, and not on microeconomic threats such as discriminatory taxation or regulation. Country risk includes sovereign risk, the risk that a government would fail to honour its sovereign obligations because of either unwillingness or inability to pay; transfer risk, the risk of restrictions on the international transfer of funds; and collective debtor risk, the threat country-wide events will cause simultaneous default by a large number of private debtors.Footnote 2 Hence, country risk is high when currency mismatch is high; the real exchange rate is overvalued; and large portfolio capital inflows paired with a weak banking system make it less likely that credit expansion will go towards the most efficient borrowers (Goldstein, 2007). Analytically, when financial liabilities are mostly denominated in domestic currency, while assets are mainly denominated in foreign currency, depreciation of the local currency will result in balance sheet problems that cause economic growth to decline. This is because if a sharp deterioration in the borrowers’ prospects is expected, portfolio inflows may quickly reverse direction, and the overvalued local currency may plunge and asset losses may rise. Ultimately, bank failures and bankruptcies multiply, aggregate demand declines and growth falls. Conceptually, we can see three basic types of country risks facing foreign banks that operate in SEE. First, as the local economic conditions deteriorate, households and firms face increasing difficulties in meeting their obligations, leading to a rise in non-performing loans.Footnote 3 Second, as the gap between assets denominated in foreign currency and liabilities denominated in domestic currency becomes larger, the exchange rate risk increases. Third, in view of a bank deposit withdrawal, foreign banks might face liquidity problems.Footnote 4 We first present the key characteristics of the geography of the Greek banking system exposure in SEE.Footnote 5 We find that lending concentration in this particular European periphery is high. Second, given the high degree of lending concentration, we look for a diversification effect of this concentrated risk. In a portfolio framework for country risk analysis, the risk of holding a well-diversified portfolio of loans may be smaller than that of having a portfolio heavily concentrated in a few countries. Our identification process has two steps. The first step is to pick a set of macroeconomic variables that may be important in explaining rescheduling probabilities and may directly or indirectly affect a sovereign risk event. The second step is to divide total risk into a non-diversifiable systematic risk element and to an unsystematic or country risk element. To this end, we consider the well-known capital asset pricing model (CAPM). On the basis of a panel data for eight countries in the region and for 10 risk indicators over the period 1995–2007, results support the view that, for most SEE countries in the sample, unsystematic risk is much more important. Therefore, diversification of bank activities among different countries in SEE seems to be important. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the key characteristics of the geography of the presence of Greek banks in emerging Europe. Emphasis is placed on lending concentration risk. The penultimate section assesses country risk on the basis of a portfolio analysis approach and finds out whether there is a risk diversification effect. The final section concludes.",

The use of one lender is often termed relationship lending and is most often cited as a characteristic of the German banking system.Footnote 1 Available anecdotal evidence suggests that this model is also present in other economies, including emerging markets. This article sets out to determine which bank financing model predominates in the Czech Republic, what its main characteristics are, and what factors the choice of bank financing model depends on at firm level. We also analyse whether the model chosen has a significant effect on the credit risk in the portfolios of relationship lenders. The value added of our research is twofold. First, it analyses the phenomenon of relationship lending using a new data set with essentially full coverage of an emerging market. We use internal data from the database of the Czech National Bank's Central Credit Register (CRC), which, since 2002, has been recording all credit relationships between companies and banks in the Czech Republic. These data have not previously been used for analytical purposes, so this paper represents the first research study drawing on this original source of data.Footnote 2 Compared with the only other existing paper on relationship lending in the Czech Republic (Ongena and Smith, 2000) which analysed a sample of 59 observations from the year 1996, we offer much more reliable and robust evidence. The full coverage of all loans is not typical even in studies on developed markets (Degryse et al., 2009, pp. 82–84). Second, we analyse the effect of the presence of relationship lending on the level of credit risk in financing banks’ portfolios. To our knowledge, this effect has not been extensively studied to date. In their extensive discussion of research questions and available literature on relationship banking, Degryse et al. (2009) show that most studies focus on effects of relationship lending on firms’ performance but almost none discuss the effect of the selected financing strategy of a bank on its own portfolio. By relationship lending we mean a long-term close bank-customer relationship. For emerging markets that have undergone a major transition to a free-market economy, one of the sources of ‘close and long-term’ bank-customer relationship especially in the 1990s was the fact that lending decisions were driven by the incentive to help certain companies, for example due to common joint ownership of both banks and firms, often by the state. These features also existed in the Czech Republic during 1990s and were analysed under the terms ‘soft-budget constraints’ or ‘banking socialism’ (Kreuzbergová, 2006). As this paper covers the period 2002–2009, a period where all formerly state-owned banks and most firms were fully privatized and the bad assets that had emerged as a result of this crony lending were transferred outside the banking sector (Bárta and Singer, 2006), the direct role of this phenomenon is limited in our analysis. However, indirectly, the structure of bank financing models prevailing in the 2000s has been, of course, influenced by developments during the 1990s. The next section provides a short review of the literature, while the subsequent section presents the data used. The latter section contains descriptive statistics regarding the model of bank financing of firms in the Czech Republic followed by an analysis of the determinants of the choice of the number of lending relationships at firm level. The penultimate section tests the effect of the application of relationship lending on the credit risk of banks. The last section concludes.",4
53,4,Comparative Economic Studies,30 June 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2011.17,"Rent-Seeking, Hierarchy and Centralization: Why the Soviet Union Collapsed So Fast and What it Means for Market Economies",December 2011,Guinevere Liberty Nell,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The opening of the Soviet archives renewed academic interest not only in the history of the Soviet Union, but also for economists and political scientists interest in the functioning of the classical socialist system. During the Soviet period there were many disputes in the West over the nature of the socialist economy and its production potential.Footnote 1 Traditional accounts (Berliner, 1957; Krylov, 1979; Kornai, 1980, 1986; Nove, 1986) describe shortages in the socialist economy as endemic to national economic planning. Janos Kornai (1980) argues that the soft budget constraint creates infinite demand in a supply constrained economy, and paternalism and control create a culture that allows the hierarchical system to dominate. Joseph Berliner (1957) points to the ‘safety factor’, or hoarding, as a cause of shortage. In general, scholars of the Soviet economy find evidence of coordination problems between plan elements and point to them as a primary reason for shortage and poverty. However, around the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, some observers questioned the traditional account. For example, some economists (Boettke, 1993; Anderson and Boettke, 1997; Shleifer and Vishny, 1992) questioned the description of the Soviet Union as a planned economy and modeled the Soviet system as a rent-seeking economy not different in kind from a market system, although more heavily regulated. According to these models, shortages result from rent-seeking activity. Managers of Soviet enterprises lobby ministers for lower prices or lower output in order to obtain side payments for goods in shortage. However, the rent-seeking models depend upon a decentralization of supply and price choices that did not exist in the Soviet Union. Recent studies by Lazarev and Gregory (2002); Gregory (2002) and Harrison (2002), which make use of newly available archival material, confirm what Sovietologists had long depicted. Firm managers in the Soviet economy actually lobbied for higher, not lower, prices. Rent-seeking not only did not drive the economy, but also could not drive it in the classical socialist society. However, there was a good reason that those economists mistakenly believed what they did: the Soviet Union was in fact collapsing into a rent-seeking economy at the time that they wrote. Although the rent-seeking models miss the mark in describing classical socialism, they may help to illuminate the collapse of the Soviet system and the tipping point between market and socialist systems. Models showing how the incentive structure was conducive to rent-seeking in the hierarchical socialist society are important. These models, taken together with an understanding of why the command economy excluded rent-seeking as a central driving force, can help to illuminate how the Soviet economy collapsed so fast and why the Russian economy has taken the form it takes now. Rent-seeking decentralizes a command economy, though it drives a market economy toward a more centralized allocation of resources. This is an important dynamic of interventionism, and it can help to shed light on transition economies, mixed economic systems and development economics.",8
53,4,Comparative Economic Studies,15 September 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2011.23,Evaluation of Mass Privatization in Bulgaria,December 2011,Jeffrey B Miller,Vladimir Lazarov,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Mass privatization (MP) programs have been carried out in many transition countries, including Bulgaria, Russia and the Czech Republic. These programs had several purposes. Given that these countries had very large state sectors, MP provided a means for rapidly privatizing these sectors. Also in countries where citizens had limited resources to buy these state companies, these MP programs provided a means of transferring these assets to the population at large. In Bulgaria, MP occurred after attempts to use cash privatization and management–employee buyouts provided only limited privatization. The first wave of the MP program, which was the only part that resulted in significant privatization, was completed in June 1997. About one-fourth of Bulgaria's state-owned enterprises (1,040) were partially privatized through the program. While this represented less than one-sixth of the estimated assets of the state enterprise sector, the MP program privatized twice as many assets as had been previously privatized through other programs.Footnote 1
 It was difficult to evaluate the MP program immediately after the program was completed. Most companies in the MP program had suffered from deterioration of their existing capital stock and needed capital infusions. Also there was a major financial crisis with very high inflation at the time of the MP program. This made it difficult to evaluate the potential viability of the firms that were auctioned. Several years have passed since the program was completed so it is now possible to evaluate the program. We investigate two aspects of the program: (1) How well have the firms that were privatized through the program performed since privatization? Did they perform better or worse than firms that were privatized through other programs, that is cash privatization, management–employee buyouts, etc? (2) Did the program succeed in passing valuable assets to the public? Were valuable ownership rights established for new shareholders? This second question is particularly important in establishing the legitimacy of the program since the program was sold to the public as a means of sharing the wealth that was previously under state control.Footnote 2
 While there have been many criticisms of MP programs in other countries, the Bulgaria MP program had several advantages. Because the program was carried out after programs had already been implemented in other countries, the Bulgarians were able to design their program to anticipate some features of the privatization process that had not been foreseen earlier.Footnote 3 For example, the Bulgarians had observed the creation of privatization funds (ie mutual funds created to participate in the voucher auctions) during the Czech privatization program. The Bulgarians anticipated the participation of privatization funds and established regulatory institutions for licensing and monitoring these funds before the MP program began. They also established a Securities Commission to oversee and regulate the new stock markets. Thus one might see the Bulgarian MP program as a program that had many advantages relative to other similar programs in other countries. Indeed, there are some indications that Bulgarian firms that were part of the MP program performed reasonably well during the years immediately following their privatization (Atanassov, 2003). Improved firm performance is only one criterion for judging the success of a MP program. A major reason that privatization programs were so politically difficult to implement was that they involved a transfer of wealth. Events since the program was implemented in Bulgaria provide a mixed picture as to the success in transferring wealth. Of the nearly 1,000 firms that were initially listed on the stock exchange, only about a fourth are listed today, and the shares of only a few trade actively.Footnote 4 On the other hand, privatization funds collected over 80% of the voucher books and acquired 87% of the shares purchased in the auctions. Of the original 81 privatization funds, around 57 are still listed on the exchange and 15 funds trade actively. These tend to be the larger funds that initially controlled a substantial portion of the shares sold at auction.Footnote 5 Thus evaluating the transfer of wealth involves analysis of a complex web of relationships. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part we use extensive firm level accounting data for the period 1996–2001, and for some firms through 2003, to determine the extent of dilution of share ownership. By dilution we mean the issuing of new shares at a level that dilutes total equity per share. Using similar investment fund (ie holding company) accounting data, we are able to determine the extent of further shareholder dilution that occurred through this second level of potential dilution of shareholder value. We are able to compare the dilution of shareholder value in both MP firms and non-MP firms. We are also able to compare dilution levels in firms that continue to be listed on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange (BSE) and those firms that are not listed on the exchange. This latter category includes both MP firms that chose to delist from the exchange and firms that did not participate in the MP and were never listed on the exchange. We found that the majority of firms did not engage in any dilution, but a few issued so many shares that original shareholder stakes are now worthless. A comparison of dilution levels among various groups (MP listed, MP delisted and non-MP firms) does not indicate that any of these groups have a significantly higher level of dilution than the others. In the second part we investigate the performance of the firms in the MP program. While there has been very little investigation of dilution in MP programs, there is an extensive literature on the performance of privatized firms in transition economies. There are several extensive surveys of this literature. The survey by Djankov and Murrell (2002) finds that the ‘(e)conomic effects (of privatization) are quite often very large, for example adding several percentage points to enterprise growth rates. The privatization effect is, however, statistically insignificant in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)’ (p. 740). They also find that performance varies depending on the new ownership type, with investment funds, foreign owners and large controlling block holders producing significant restructuring. In another survey, Megginson (2005) found that the results of MP were disappointing. A later survey by Estrin et al. (2009) looks at more recent studies. They find that as time has passed differences in performance have shifted from questions of insider/outsider control and domestic/foreign ownership, to a more focused issue of domestic versus foreign ownership. Whereas productivity of domestic private firms does not differ significantly from state firms, foreign ownership has a positive effect. Since our focus here is the impact of MP, there are two other studies of note. Bennett et al. (2007) and Gouret (2007) investigate whether the methods used in privatization matter. In these cross country studies Bennett et al. (2007) find that voucher privatization is associated with faster macroeconomic growth. On the other hand, Gouret (2007) finds that gains in growth come only from gradual privatization. Gouret argues that the dramatic differences in these conclusions are due to his attempt to include the impact of macroeconomic stabilization and reforms in his analysis. He also notes that the results are very sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of the Caucasus.Footnote 6
 Our paper fits in this literature as a contribution to explaining the part of MP differences stemming from the change in ownership. We do not look at any other method of privatization, nor do we make a distinction among the others. We measure not only the change of ownership, but also the redistribution/concentration of ownership. To investigate the impact of the MP program on firm performance, first we compare the performance of these MP firms with the performance of firms that did not participate in the MP program. While the MP program was the first major effort at privatization in Bulgaria that successfully privatized a large number of firms, many other firms were privatized in the following years (see Table 1). So this comparison is not a comparison between the performance of state firms and private firms but rather between firms that were privatized through MP and firms that were privatized using other methods of which labor–management buyouts and sales to foreign companies were often used. While we were able to obtain data on the types of ownership of MP firms, we do not have data on types of owners of non-MP firms, so we are unable to compare the performance of, for example, MP firms now owned by foreign interests and non-MP firms that are owned by foreigners. On the other hand, we are able to investigate other issues. In particular, we investigate whether dilution affected firm performance. As Estrin et al. (2009) point out, when arguments are made about the possible benefits of privatization, the controls exercised by the capital market over management is an important issue in determining whether there exists pressure for private firms to perform better than state firms. Measures of dilution provide us with a measure of how well the capital markets are performing this function. If firms experience significant dilution, this is an indicator that smaller shareholders (and indeed the market itself) have little power to control the actions of firms. On the other hand, once dilution has occurred, firm ownership will be more concentrated in the hands of those who control the firm. Therefore, we would expect that where dilution occurs, firms will perform poorly before the dilution occurs and better afterwards. Consistent with this hypothesis we find that dilution led to better performance of MP firms. In terms of overall performance we found that MP firms generally performed better than non-MP firms, supporting the Bennett et al. (2007) argument. Within the group of firms that went through MP, higher ownership concentration was associated with better performance. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes our data. The section after that calculates the level of share holder dilution. The subsequent section is subdivided into two parts: (a) dealing with the impact of ownership on performance for privatized firms, and (b) investigating the performance differences between mass privatized and non-MP firms. The last section concludes.",2

However, experience has shown that the drastic and extreme concept of a socialist economy as one that would simply and totally negate all the basic tenets of capitalism and the role of the market and monetary-commercial relations, did not work in practice. This factual realization led to various reform attempts, from the New Economic Policy in the early 1920s to the market socialism-oriented restructuring of the Chinese and Vietnamese economies that began in the late 1970s and mid-1980s, respectively. The outcomes of these reforms – or lack thereof – proved to be dramatically uneven, from the collapse of the Soviet Union to the emergence of China as the second and the most dynamic economy in the contemporary world. These experiences demonstrated that the high and ever-increasing degree of complexity of modern economies, linked as it is to continuous and stratified knowledge accumulation on the part of numerous and diverse agents, does not allow for simplistic or over-centralized solutions to the core problem of governance. At the same time, they also showed that market-socialist economic systems can exist and flourish. In these systems, the public sector is endowed with a high degree of direct and indirect control over the means of production, so high that it implies a discontinuity and a key qualitative difference with respect to the various forms of capitalism prevailing in most other countries. As a result, social production relations under market socialism are different from those prevalent under capitalism. History has shown that market socialist economies can be highly effective in fostering economic growth and reducing poverty, as well as (so far, at least) in ensuring a relatively high degree of stability and sustainability. In my view, the latter proposition can be considered as a general law of socialist economic development: therefore, it constitutes the key theoretical and methodological assumption of this work. This paper focuses on the case of a relatively small socialist country, Cuba, which – especially in the last two decades – has faced particularly adverse external conditions. The goal of this paper is to discuss the past and present problems and contradictions of Cuba's socialist economic fabric and the endogenous policy alternatives that might assist in overcoming them. The main thesis, consistent with the theoretical assumption mentioned above, is that – short of the definitive demise of socialism itself – the only sustainable reform option available to Cuban policymakers is a radical one, centered around a systemic shift from state-socialism to a nationally suitable form of market socialism.",2

The fall of the Eastern Bloc meant a greater scope for market relationships in economic management of these countries. The pace and degree of liberalization varied from country to country, from relatively high levels in Eastern Europe to lower levels in the southern republics of post-Soviet Central Asia. This economic and political transformation resulted in great changes for the transport of goods and people. All countries have experienced growth in private car ownership with less reliance on public transport and changes in ownership of transport companies, and the growth in international trade has meant that significant changes have taken place in the direction and quantity of goods transported (Pucher and Buehler, 2005). This post-communist transition has only had a limited coverage from the transport literature, and there has been virtually no focus on the countries and cities of Central Asia (eg Hall, 2010; Taylor and Ciechanski, 2008). This paper intends to contribute towards closing the existing gap in the literature by examining policies of urban transport development in the capital of Uzbekistan – Tashkent. Tashkent is the largest city in post-Soviet Central Asia with a population of 2.3 million people living in an area of 334.6 km2.Footnote 1 The city contributes approximately 14% to Uzbekistan's GDP and has a well-developed transport infrastructure (Tashkent City Council, 2010). Figure 1 presents the map of Uzbekistan with Tashkent located in the north-eastern corner of the Republic. Map and location of Tashkent Source: http://davidderrick.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/uzbekistan_map.jpg and http://tashkent.uz/ru/articles/26/
 The process of transition to the market economy in Uzbekistan, as elsewhere has faced two main political economy constraints, ex ante acceptability and ex post reversibility (Rodrik, 1993; Akimov and Dollery, 2008). Unlike some individual countries, which chose to solve both constraints by applying a ‘shock therapy’ approach, Uzbek policy makers methodically applied a more gradual approach taking into consideration potential socio-political consequences. In case of urban public transport in Tashkent that meant that the liberalization/privatization effort was only directed to the taxi/shuttle taxi sector, but not to buses and the underground, as policy makers wanted to ensure public transport continued to function. At a later stage, the policy makers showed a similar approach when some negative consequences of poorly enforced regulations in taxi market (such as congestion, pollution, tax evasion) became apparent. The lack of will to deal these problems can be attributed to a concern over the significant socio-economic consequences for the numerous taxi drivers and their families that rely on the income from transportation services. The paper has four main sections. The next section traces the emergence of organized public transport and its development before independence in 1991. The subsequent section examines post-independence development, and it reviews policies that authorities have undertaken in an effort to reform the urban transport system. The developments of each major mode of transport are then looked at in detail. A discussion of the outcome of the policy reforms provides the central part of the paper, where the general trends of development and their socio-economic and environmental impacts are identified. The paper concludes with some policy recommendations.",6

54,1,Comparative Economic Studies,24 November 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2011.28,Labour Market Institutions and Unemployment: Does Finance Matter?,March 2012,Christophe Rault,Anne-Gaël Vaubourg,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The increase in unemployment rates due to recent financial turnmoils and the fact that countries are affected in different extent by the crisis interestingly renews the debate on the heterogeneity of employment performance, focusing the attention on their financial determinants. In the new-Keynesian view, imperfections within the financial system (such as adjustment costs and information asymmetries) play a crucial role in firms’ labour demand and in employment fluctuations. Greenwald and Stiglitz (1993) and Arnold (2002) show that financial constraints induced by information asymmetries make firms’ labour demand dependent on their balance-sheet position. As a consequence, employment fluctuates according to the financial pressures that firms face. These theoretical arguments are confirmed by firm-level econometric investigations. Sharpe (1994) documents that the sensitivity of American firms’ labour demand to sales increases with their leverage ratio. Using a set of British firms, Nickell and Wadhwani (1991) show that employment decreases with firms’ leverage ratio and increases with their market capitalization while Nickell and Nicolitsas (1999) establish that employment falls with the ratio of interest payment to cash-flow. Moreover, Caggese and Cunat (2008) obtain that financial constraints influence firms’ employment policy and the mix between permanent and temporary employment. For Acemoglu (2001), financial factors also affect employment through their impact on firms’ creation. Financial constraint harms employment because it hinders the emergence of new innovating firms, which create jobs. The author observes that, since the 1960s, the employment rates of firms dependent on external finance has been higher in Europe than in the United States, arguing that this is due to the stronger regulation of European financial systems. In the same vein, Fechs and Fuchs (2003) and Belke et al. (2004) underline the importance of venture capital in firms’ emergence and job creation. They explain the poor employment performance in Continental European countries compared to Anglo-Saxon economies during the last decades by an insufficient development of venture capital. But the role played by financial factors is not limited to their direct impact on unemployment. They also have an indirect influence, through interactions with other key drivers of employment such as labour market arrangements. These interactions are twofold. On the one hand, labour market devices influence the way finance affects unemployment. While theoretical models by Rendon (2001) and Belke and Fehn (2002) conclude that weaker labour market rigidities mitigate the favourable effect of financial development on employment, Koskela and Stenbacka (2004) obtain that they amplify the positive effect of intensified banking competition. This issue is empirically dealt with by Gatti et al. (2011), using a data set of 18 OECD countries between 1980 and 2004. They establish that increased market capitalization as well as decreased banking concentration reduce unemployment if the level of labour market regulation, union density and coordination in wage bargaining is low. Moreover, increasing intermediated credit and banking concentration is beneficial for employment when the degree of labour market regulation, union density and wage coordination is high. On the other hand, financial factors also influence the relationship between labour market arrangements and unemployment. Rendon (2001) obtains that financial development reduces the positive effect of lower labour market imperfections on employment. However, Wasmer and Weil (2004) find that fiercer competition in the credit market exacerbates it. Unfortunately, dynamic panel estimations conducted by Gatti et al. (2011) do not provide strong evidence that finance influences (neither favourably nor unfavourably) the impact of increased labour market flexibility on unemployment. The goal of this paper is precisely to re-examine this issue in a country-specific framework. As financial factors do not affect the relationship between labour market arrangements and unemployment at the whole sample-level, we check whether such an impact exists at the country-level. In doing this, we also aim to contribute to the literature on the heterogeneity of national employment performance by emphasizing the diversity of interactions between financial factors and labour market arrangements across countries. For example, finance may mitigate the effect of increased labour market flexibility in some countries while it may exacerbate it in some others. We thus test for Granger-causalities from labour market variables to unemployment in order to check whether these causalities are affected by financial variables for each country of the sample. We estimate a panel Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) model using the same data as Gatti et al. (2011). We implement the panel-data approach of Kónya (2006), based on Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) system and Wald tests with country-specific bootstrap critical values. In the specific framework we use, we allow for cross-country correlation, without the need of pretesting for unit roots and cointegration (as in Phillips, 1995). The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the theoretical and empirical background of our study. The section after that is devoted to the econometric investigation. The subsequent section proposes some extensions to our analysis. The final section concludes.",

Morocco and Tunisia were the first to commence in 1983 and 1986, respectively; they were then followed by Jordan in 1989 and Egypt in 1991. Economic theory, backed by an accumulating wealth of developing countries’ empirical experiences, indicates that such comprehensive liberalisation programmes are bound to have a profound impact on the level and structure of labour earnings in the short and medium terms. There is less agreement, however, on the direction of the expected change in real wages and inequality, as outcomes have diverged across countries and even for the same country over time. The Egyptian and Jordanian labour markets offer an interesting area for comparative analysis due to the similarities and contrasts in their structures and in the process of economic adjustment followed. Following import substitution industrialisation strategies, both economies grew rapidly throughoutthe 1970s, but were also characterised by a strong state presence in both production and employment. State intervention operated within an implicit social contract whereby rentier income was used to pacify the population and buy support for incumbent regimes through the use of subsidies, free health and education, rents to favoured entrepreneurs, and guaranteed jobs in the public sector. The large public sectors were also large employers of women, where they faced little or no gender-based wage discrimination. As a result, rapid improvements in social welfare and declining poverty were experienced (Harrigan and El-Said, 2010). The turn to formal adoption of economic liberalisation programmes took place at similar times in both Jordan and Egypt. Jordan's debt reached unattainable levels in the early 1980s, where it increased more than fourfold. This rise in foreign debt was the result of government borrowing from foreign commercial banks to maintain the rapid economic growth rates experienced in the 1970s. In the light of this, negotiations began in 1989 to reschedule their debt with the IMF and World Bank (Rivlin, 2009). Initially, economic growth was sustained due to workers’ remittances and grants from oil-rich Arab states. But all that was reversed with return migration at the onset of the 1990 Gulf War, resulting in high rates of open unemployment. In Egypt, the situation was largely the same, with its debt reaching unsustainable levels in the late 1980s. Growth had turned negative by this time, and by 1990 its foreign debt had reached nearly 50 billion dollars. With a debt/GNP ratio of roughly 150%, it was arguably the highest in the world (Richards and Waterbury, 2008). However, the politics surrounding the Gulf War led to differing economic liberalisation programmes and debt rescheduling schemes. Egypt, unlike Jordan, aligned with the United States. As a result, Egypt was able to adopt a reasonably conventional IMF-endorsed stabilisation and structural adjustment in 1991 and benefitted from massive debt relief. This relieved the public sector from having to undertake painful and unpopular employment and wage adjustments. As the stabilisation and structural adjustment reforms progressed in the 1990s and new millennium in both countries, it became clear that the conditions necessary for creating self-sustaining growth of the type needed to solve their vital socio-economic problems were not met. Despite the similarity in a labour market dominated by public sector employment, especially for women in both countries, there are also important differences in wage and employment outcomes. Unlike Egypt, the Jordanian labour market has an additional important segmentation in which lower-skilled and lower-paid jobs are dominated by foreign workers, whereas higher levels and quality of education are observed among its nationals who also suffer from the incidence of high unemployment rates due to a lack of labour demand. In addition, in Jordan the private sector is less inhospitable to married women who tend to be concentrated only in public sector employment in Egypt. The similarities and differences between these two economies can offer new insights into the impact of economic liberalisation policies on labour market trends and the extent to which the onset of the 2008 financial crisis helped accentuate or reverse them. In the case of Egypt, the availability of two comparable nation-wide labour force sample surveys – the 1988 Labor Force Sample Survey (LFSS) and 1998 Egypt Labor Market Survey (ELMS) – has facilitated the analysis of changes in wage structure over the first decade of implementing these programmes, which have mostly taken the form of a fall in real wages and narrowing of wage gaps for all groups (Said, 2002; World Bank, 2004). As the pace of liberalisation and privatisation has continued unabated since 1998, coupled with important institutional changes in the labour market including the passing of a new labour law in 2003 and the onset of the 2008 financial crisis, it would be interesting to examine, on the basis of more recent data, whether the above trends were reinforced or reversed in the new millennium, and to compare the results with another reforming economy in the MENA region – Jordan. This is now possible due to the availability of two new similar and highly comparable labour force sample surveys, following almost identical questionnaires on all major labour market variables that will be used in this paper. These are namely the 2006 Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS) and the 2010 Jordan Labor Market Panel Survey (JLMPS) collected by the same regional institution, the Economic Research Forum (ERF) in collaboration with the national statistical agencies of Egypt (Central Agency of Public Mobilization and Statistics) and Jordan (Department of Statistics (DOS)). Moreover, for Egypt, the ELMS 1998 is highly comparable to the ELMPS 2006, again following very similar questionnaires collected by the same research and data collection institutions, whereby 2006 is viewed as the second wave in the panel. To update the data over the period of the financial crisis, the 2007–2009 Quarterly Labor Force Sample Statistics will also be utilised in Egypt. Thus, this paper investigates the distributional and structural developments of real hourly wages and monthly earnings in Egypt before and during the World Financial Crisis on basis of the 1988–2009 Egypt Labor Surveys, and compares these to recent developments based on the recently available 2010 Jordan Labor Market Panel Survey. Although the recent global crisis is recognised to have strongly impacted labour markets around the world, very few studies were undertaken to examine its impact on wage inequality outcomes in emerging and transition economies due to data limitations. The analysis here contributes to this literature by focusing on the estimation of selectivity-corrected gender-based and public–private wage differentials, using a joint model of work status allocation and wage determination for Egypt and Jordan. The results point to two distinct phases in Egypt: an initial one of wage erosion and narrowing pay differentials, and a subsequent phase of recovery of real wages and decompression of the wage structure. Estimates based on data after the onset of the financial crisis in both countries point to a combination of real pay erosion again, but this time coupled with widening gender and sector pay differentials. The analysis in the paper will proceed as follows. The next two sections provide a brief overview of related literature on wage differentials during economic reform and crises and introduce the main stylised facts and structural features of real wage and inequality adjustments in the Egyptian and Jordanian labour market during the recent liberalisation episodes. A subsequent section describes the wage determination model used in calculating wage differentials and presents the data and descriptive statistics of the sample underlying the estimation. The penultimate section discusses the wage estimation results, while focusing on public–private and gender wage gaps and changes in returns to education over the past decade. Finally, the last section concludes and draws implications for the reform of the labour market in the wake of the financial crisis.",7

54,1,Comparative Economic Studies,09 April 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2012.1,Diagnosing the ‘Russian Disease’: Growth and Structure of the Russian Economy,March 2012,Masaaki Kuboniwa,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In general, the relationship between the natural resource curse and economic growth in resource-rich countries is elusive in the long run (Alexeev and Conrad, 2009). Nevertheless, the Lehman shock, combined with the collapse of the oil bubble, clearly showed that Russian economic growth relies heavily on changes in the price of oil. We here characterize the present Russian situation as the Russian Disease (R-D), the major symptom of which is a strong positive relationship between the country's real growth of output (GDP and manufacturing output) and international oil price changes in the long run. This symptom of R-D is quite different from a major symptom of the Dutch Disease (D-D), which is characterized by slower growth of manufacturing (The Economist, 1977; Ellman, 1981; Corden, 1984). A positive relationship between changes in Russia’s GDP and oil prices has often been reported in the literature, including publications by Gaddy (2004), Tabata (2006) and Gaddy and Ickes (2010), to show Russia's oil dependency. Rautava (2004) demonstrated such a relationship using a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model with two cointegrating equations for 1995–2002. Based on an equation with three variables, oil prices, GDP, and the real exchange rate, he presented two propositions: (a) a positive long-run relationship between changes in oil prices and GDP; and (b) a negative long-run relationship between changes in the real exchange rate (REER) and GDP. Point (a) is accepted as our starting point. Point (b) is counterintuitive in light of single non-VEC estimators for parameters among the levels of variables. Hanson (2003) and Kemme and Roy (2006) did not address point (b), whereas Beck et al. (2007) tried to support point (b). Although Rautava’s result may not be an outlier that the Johansen estimator for the VEC cointegration parameters often produces (Phillips, 1994; Brueggemann and Luetkepohl, 2005), it was perhaps premature to conclude the long-run relation including REER. We will show that the real exchange rate did not have a negative long-run impact on the GDP from 1995 through 2002 and from 1995 through 2010. Many economists have diagnosed D-D in Russia (Egert, 2005; Roland, 2006; Oomes and Kalcheva, 2007; Merlevede et al., 2009). One of the symptoms of the D-D is the slower growth of manufacturing due to the appreciation of the REER. Oomes and Kalcheva carefully examined this aspect of D-D in Russia and concluded that there was a negative relationship between changes in oil prices and the overall growth of manufacturing output for 1997–2005. Roland observed healthy growth movements in GDP and manufacturing for 2003–2005, while he cautiously stated that conclusion of the existence of D-D in Russia was premature, given the continued health of some non-oil exports. Egert showed increases in the ratio of crude oil to overall industrial output in the volumes for 1993–2004 prior to the booming of manufacturing and the stagnation of mining. Merlevede et al. systematically examined whether the Russian business cycles suffered from D-D symptoms, but they did not report any explicit relationship between manufacturing and oil prices or REER. In this paper, we show the long-run (cointegrating) positive relationship between changes in oil prices and the growth of Russian manufacturing output for 1995–2010, which we regard as the major symptom of the R-D. This R-D symptom has a serious implication for policymakers because Russian attempts to diversify to mitigate the dependence on oil also depend on oil prices. Our description of the R-D may be included in syndromes of Russia's addiction to oil (Gaddy and Ickes, 2010) whereas we limit our study to a simple econometric analysis specialized in major macroeconomic symptoms of the R-D in relation to the D-D. In the literature, there is little empirical research on the direct long-run relationship between the REER and oil prices. This relationship was elusive before 2002 but is now clear. Using monthly data, we show that now it takes a long-run (cointegrating) positive relationship for 1995–2010. This suggests that Russia shares a symptom of the D-D, which is a real appreciation of its currency with rising oil prices during its favorable growth period. This also suggests that oil prices and the REER may not be simultaneously included within the single cointegrating equation. Although the real appreciation did not cause the slowdown of GDP and manufacturing output growth, it induced marked increases in imports that, in turn, caused a demand shock through the slower growth of real exports. In growth accounting on the expenditure side, an increase in real imports is captured as a negative element of GDP growth. However, a conventional import function shows a co-movement of GDP and imports in volumes along with changes in the REER. Russia's favorable growth (recession) in the 2000s is characterized by the negative (positive) trade balance in volumes and the large (small) positive trade balance in current prices. Both rapid increases (decreases) in real imports and current exports were caused by the marked increases (reductions) in oil prices. Despite the aggregate demand shock of reduction in real trade balance, Russia showed favorable growth for 2000–2007 due to increases in oil prices. To clarify the role of oil prices in Russia in the framework of national accounts, based on SNA 1993/2008 or the US BEA's practices, OECD (2006), Kuboniwa (2007), and Tabata (2009) suggested that the real gross domestic income (GDI) (‘command-basis GDP’ in the BEA terminology), defined as the real GDP plus the real trading gains (TG) due to improvements in the terms of trade (ToT), may be better than the real GDP indicator from the viewpoint of the real purchasing power of income in the Russian economy. Furthermore, they attributed the favorable GDP growth to the increases in oil prices and the ToT. To summarize, if we can show a positive relationship between real GDP and TG (real GDI minus real GDP), this may complete our economic understanding of the Russian economy in the framework of SNA without claiming real GDI as the substitute for real GDP. This consideration of the TG and ToT with GDP is expected to be empirically equivalent to that of the long-run relationship between oil prices and GDP. The economic causality is arranged as follows: changes in oil prices cause those in ToT, which cause changes in the TG, and then the changes in the TG induce those in GDP. In this paper, we show long-run positive relationships among oil prices, ToT, and TG. In other words, we show that, in fact, current oil prices are good proxies for ToT and TG as well. This result may be consistent with Granger causality, where changes in oil prices cause changes in ToT and TG. Although booming imports cause a demand shock reducing the volume of the trade balance in the growth accounting on the expenditure side, they may contribute to the growth of the trade sector on the production side through the growth of trade margins for final purchases of imports on the expenditure side. We will demonstrate that the very high GDP growth rate of the trade sector was a result of booming imports.Footnote 1 In this context, the Russian growth was import-led. So far, this relationship has not been analyzed in the literature. This can be characterized as a symptom of the R-D. As accelerated growth of the service sector is a symptom of the D-D, this R-D symptom can also be characterized as a Russian variant of the D-D.",21

This paper aims to contribute to the analysis of social models in the enlarged European Union (EU). Instead of assigning the new Central and Eastern European EU member states (EU10) to existing typologies, we focus on exploring social policy dimensions, an approach so far largely neglected in the literature (Hicks and Kenworthy, 2003). Social policies can be described by a potentially vast number of empirical indicators. Our indicators, with a strong emphasis on labour markets, include social protection indicators to reflect the productivity-enhancing role of social policy, pointed out by numerous studies (Midgley and Tang, 2001; Room, 2002; Fouarge, 2003; Jepsen and Pascual, 2005; Hermans, 2005; Draxler, 2006; Hudson and Kühner, 2009). We identify major social policy dimensions by means of Principal Components Analysis (PCA), which allows for reducing our large list of variables to a few independent synthetic variables. The PCA factor scores are subsequently used as a basis for clustering countries into different social policy groups, that is, social models. We thus, deduce the relevant dimensions of social policies and social models from socio-economic statistics. The paper is organised as follows: the section ‘Dimensions of social policies and classification of social models’ gives a brief survey of existing classifications of social models and underlying dimensions of social policies. The section ‘Data and methodology’ presents data and our two-step methodology, a sequence of principal components and cluster analyses (CA). Our motivation of choosing policy indicators derives from Boeri (2002), who distinguishes three main tasks assigned to labour and social policies: (i) reduce poverty and, more broadly, income inequalities, (ii) protect against uninsurable labour market risk, and (iii) increase the rewards from labour market participation. Section ‘Result’ presents the results of the PCA, which yields four synthetic policy dimensions as the basic components of social models. The subsequent CA along these dimensions positions the EU10 into the mix of European social models (ESM), answering the question whether the distribution of EU15 countries is appropriately described by the often cited classification of a Nordic, Continental, Anglo-Saxon, and Mediterranean Model after a major enlargement of the EU.",2

(2005) argue that China may be an important counter-example to the focus of the law and finance literature on formal systems. They suggest that alternative financing channels, rather than formal external finance, support the fastest-growing Chinese firms, namely private firms. In response to their argument, several studies have investigated whether alternative financing channels really work as a substitute for a formal financial system and support the growth of firms and the economy in China (Cheng and Degryse, 2007; Ge and Qiu, 2007; Cull et al., 2009; Ayyagari et al., 2010). An important candidate as an effective alternative financing channel is trade credit. Among the studies mentioned above, Cull et al. (2009) and Ge and Qiu (2007) explicitly explore trade credit in China and try to elucidate its role in China's economy through econometric analysis using firm-level microdata.Footnote 1,Footnote 2 The analysis by Cull et al. (2009) mainly considers bank loans (proxied by interest payments) and accounts receivable data, namely data for granting of trade credit. They find that trade credit likely provides a substitute for bank loans for the customers of private firms that have been shut out of formal credit streams such as bank loans. Furthermore, they find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which have privileged access to formal credit, redistribute bank loans to their customer firms in the form of trade credit. However, they argue that this redistribution occurs involuntarily, with SOEs granting trade credit as they face financial arrears and seek bank loans to cover these, and that trade credit does not play an economically significant role in China. In their analysis, Ge and Qiu (2007) use accounts receivable and payable data, reflecting both the granting and receiving of trade credit, in addition to bank loan data. Their findings show that, compared to SOEs, non-state-owned firms use trade credit more extensively. They further show that this higher usage is primarily for financing rather than transactional purposes. The results suggest that the non-state-owned sector actively exploits trade credit as a non-standard financing channel to finance its growth in China, which has a poorly developed formal financial sector. However, Ge and Qiu (2007) do not attempt to investigate the efficiency of financial intermediation through trade credit itself. Thus, whether trade credit really works as a substitute for a formal financial system in China needs to be examined. Cull et al. (2009) try to investigate the efficiency of trade credit in China by studying the attributes of trade credit offerer rather than receiver firms. This is because the trade credit data available for such firms correspond to accounts receivable, namely trade credit granted by offerer firms. Here, we investigate the efficiency of financial intermediation through trade credit by studying the attributes of trade credit receiver firms, in other words, what attributes enable firms to receive more trade credit (see footnotes 5 and 6 for the types of trade credit used in this work, and corresponding definitions and explanations). Specifically, we seek to determine whether firms with better performance, as measured by profitability or productivity, receive more trade credit. Therefore, we use accounts payable trade credit data for this study. We believe this provides a more direct investigation of the efficiency of financial intermediation through trade credit compared with previous studies. This is because, first, lending to firms with higher profitability and productivity is necessary for a financial intermediation measure to be efficient. Furthermore, information on the bank finance of each sample firm is available in our firm-level microdata. This enables us to compare the efficiency of trade credit to bank finance by looking at the attributes of trade credit receiver firms and those of bank finance user firms. The relative efficiency of trade credit to bank finance in this sense is an important condition in that trade credit effectively works as an alternative financing channel to formal streams, including bank finance. Our study is motivated by examination of this possibility. We classify firms that use trade credit as a finance measure by size and age to determine whether the efficiency of financing by trade credit differs between these types of firms. Several important studies have investigated whether the development of financial intermediation measures, including trade credit, promotes the entry of new firms and their post-entry survival, in other words, whether or not trade credit helps small or young firms. Using industry-level data across countries in a highly influential empirical study, Rajan and Zingales (1998) find that the development of a financial market has a disproportionate impact on the growth of new establishments. This suggests that financial development facilitates economic growth by financially encouraging the entry of new firms and the survival of young firms. Aghion et al. (2007) assess the effect of financial development on the entry of new firms and their post-entry survival and growth using harmonized firm-level data for industrialized and emerging economies. These data enable them not only to compute the net entry of firms, but also to fully track the entry and exit of firms and to consider firm size at entry and post-entry growth. Their findings are largely consistent with those of Rajan and Zingales (1998). Although the observation that financial development aids the entry of new firms and their post-entry survival seems to be robust, it cannot by itself provide sufficient policy implications for developing or emerging economies. It is necessary to specify really effective financial intermediation measures that will help small or young firms to find funds among various external sources. As Cull et al. (2009) state for China, large existing firms in developing and emerging economies tend to have privileged access to formal credit in the form of bank loans (and, of course, capital markets), a major source of external finance. Small and/or young firms tend to be excluded from such formal external finance streams. For China, many studies have found empirical evidence consistent with the existence of this type of financial environment (Park and Sehrt, 2001; Boyreau-Debray, 2003; Duenwald and Aziz, 2003; Karacadag, 2003). If such a financial environment remains without reform, the current banking sector (or capital market) will not work well as a major source of external finance to help small or young firms to find funds or encourage the entry of new firms or their post-entry survival. Thus, we focus on trade credit as a prospective candidate in helping small or young firms in developing and emerging economies. A comparison with bank finance is also presented. The rich information on borrower firms included in our firm-level data facilitates this investigation. We should note the argument of Fisman and Love (2003), whose interest is close to ours in this respect. Using industry-level data across countries, they find that trade credit is a more important source of growth for mature firms (growth in average size) than young firms (growth in the number of firms) that have not yet established a reputation for credit worthiness. Our aim was to obtain empirical evidence consistent with their argument. Our firm-level data allow us to investigate the effect that differences in size and age have on the use of trade credit and its efficiency in greater detail. It should be mentioned here that a preliminary analysis using provincial-level aggregate data on rural firmsFootnote 3 in China gives inconsistent observations on analysis by Fisman and Love (2003) (Table 1). Table 1 shows that a province with more developed trade credit at the beginning of the study (1996) experienced faster growth in the number of firms and slower growth in the average firm size during the subsequent 6 years (1996–2002).Footnote 4 The reason for this inconsistency will be clarified by our study incorporating firm-level data. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section explains the empirical models and estimation strategy. The subsequent section describes the data used and includes several important observations regarding the level of descriptive statistics. The penultimate section considers the estimation results of the econometric analysis, and the final section presents the conclusions.",11

The labor market impact of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the 2008–2009 Great Recession has been remarkable in developed economies, and noteworthy for its persistence in European countries, especially due to the 2010–2012 sovereign debt crises. Nevertheless, in Europe there are considerable cross-country differences in labor market performance that have persisted for some time, so that during the recent crisis each country uniquely reflects its labor market institutions and initial pre-crisis conditions. Innovative empirical research, investigating key structural, institutional and cyclical factors determining these differences among developed economies and within EU countries can significantly contribute to a better understanding of desirable economic and labor market policies and reforms for creating a highly longed-for virtuous model of growth, which would be able to create ‘more and better jobs’.Footnote 1 The first part of this paper provides some perspective on the comparative labor market performance of the US, Japan and the European countries both for the past decades, but focusing on the crisis years. In the second part, recent empirical studies and results, including the papers published in this special issue, are presented in a wider context in order to highlight some key features and determinants of the long-run and recent performance of the developed economies and, especially, the European countries.

These schemes exist in all OECD countries, and although the exact mechanisms and regulations differ from country to country, the backbone of the schemes is almost the same everywhere: the UI schemes provide periodic payments to unemployed individuals for a defined period of time, subject to some eligibility criteria that workers have to meet. While helpful in mitigating the adverse conditions that unemployed workers may face, job search theory stresses that unemployment benefits may reduce the probability of re-employment and increase unemployment duration. However, things are more complicated than this simple depiction and, as Atkinson and Micklewright (1991) stresses in their survey on this subject, the actual mechanism that governs the implementation of benefits is certainly relevant in establishing the exact link between benefits and unemployment duration. As a matter of fact, actual UI schemes have some eligibility criteria and some of these criteria require workers to prove they are actively searching for a job and to devise a plan, together with employment centers (ECs) or similar institutions, on appropriate steps to take for an effective search. The existence of these incentives to search actively and the support and counseling obtained from ECs may outweigh the incentives to reduce search efforts, and, thus, UI schemes could, in principle, reduce unemployment duration. Even from an empirical point of view the actual effect of benefits on duration is not so clean cut.Footnote 1 Atkinson and Micklewright (1991) review a large number of empirical studies and conclude that the evidence is mixed and, all things considered, benefits seem to affect positively duration but their effect is, at most, weak. Another relevant aspect that should be considered when investigating the determinants of unemployment duration is related to liquidity constraints. The liquidity constraints of individuals largely affect both reservation wages and search effort and, through them, unemployment duration. In particular, we can imagine that the wealth and degree of financial stress faced by the unemployed affect duration. Unemployed workers in wealthier households facing less financial stress are likely to feel less pressure to search for a job or to accept any offer they might receive. Thus, all things being equal, wealthier unemployed should experience longer spells of unemployment. This latter aspect has received some attention but has not been fully assessed nor has it been analyzed in a comparative perspective. An interesting analysis is Bloemen (2002) where a proxy variable for wealth is computed and its effect on the probability of obtaining a job is tested. However, the analysis does not focus on unemployment duration. The role of wealth on benefits has been tackled more in detail by Chetty (2005 and 2008, with the latter being an extend version of the former). The author uses data from the United States to disentangle the moral hazard and liquidity constraint effects that benefits have on unemployed workers. The results indicate that the liquidity constraint seems to be more relevant than the moral hazard effect. Similar conclusions were reached by Card et al. (2007) using a regression discontinuity approach on Austrian data. Our paper contributes to these analyses on the determinants of unemployment duration, and it focuses both on the effect of UI schemes and on the role of liquidity constraints. In particular, we take a comparative approach, analyzing three different countries. The comparative dimension is particularly useful because, on one hand, it allows us to exploit institutional differences in the mechanisms regulating the UI schemes to better assess the exact relationship between UI and duration, and, on the other, it allows us to assess which schemes are more effective in terms of unemployment duration. We analyze three countries: Finland, Italy and Poland. This allows us to analyze a wide spectrum of economic systems and UI schemes characteristics. Finland is an advanced country with a strong welfare system. Its UI scheme is generous and long in duration, and it provides support in the job search process and imposes and effectively supervises active search by individuals. On the other hand, Poland is a former transition economy that is still facing some economic problems, unemployment being probably the most relevant. Its UI scheme is not particularly generous, it offers only minor employment services, and it does not have any job search requirements. Italy lies between these two extremes, being an advanced country, but with problems of growth and regional income disparities. Its UI scheme is among the least generous, and while, in principle, the law establishes both employment services and active search requirements, their implementation is left to the local employment services so that the effectiveness of these measures vary considerably across the country. Our investigation uses data on employment status, income and wealth of individuals for the year 2007 from the EU-SILC survey. The data allows us to determine the exact unemployment duration and the payments received from UI schemes. We focus only on workers who have just become unemployed so that the duration of unemployment before the period of observation is equal to zero for all individuals. This yields more homogenous observations and eliminates any possible left censoring problem. We develop a survival analysis where the non-survival condition consists in finding a job and we use Cox hazard models to estimate the determinants of the duration of unemployment, paying particular attention to the role of unemployment benefits, both at the start of the scheme and during the duration of the unemployment spell, and of liquidity constraints. We use three main variables to assess the stringency of liquidity constraints: the payment of interest for mortgage, the amount of taxes paid on wealth, which can be seen as a proxy for actual wealth, and the self-assessed degree of economic stress. We allow for the effect of benefits and of the financial variables to be different across the three countries, so that we are able to assess how the different UI schemes affect the unemployment duration as well as to measure the differences in the role of liquidity constraints. The results we obtain are interesting both with regards to the effect of unemployment benefits and to the role of liquidity constraints. In particular, while the more developed and search supportive schemes of Finland and, partially, of Italy seem to initially have a positive effect on re-employment probabilities, they turn out to affect negatively those probabilities as time passes. Apparently, the initial boost to the effort and to the quality of the job search wears off and the standard effect of benefits on reservation wage and search effort takes over. This is true even for Finland where strict control of employment services and search activity is maintained through the duration of the benefits. The Polish scheme, on the contrary, does not affect duration, either positively or negatively. The results on the effect of liquidity constraints are also interesting. The financial conditions and the degree of financial stress of individuals are particularly relevant in Italy but not in Finland, suggesting that individual financial conditions are less relevant in countries whose economy is doing well and that has an extensive welfare system. Results for Poland are mixed as only some dimensions of financial stress reduce unemployment duration. The paper is organized as follows: in the next section we present the UI schemes for the three countries, in the subsequent section we describe the data and we highlight some descriptive differences between the countries, in the penultimate section we perform our empirical analysis and discuss possible interpretations of our results and in the final section we conclude.",7

Economic analysis has long viewed this dynamic from an aggregate perspective, focusing, within a Keynesian framework, on the role of demand fluctuations. In this article we want to integrate this perspective with the consideration of changes in supply structures, exploring how the evolution of industries and the diversity of technological change affect employment in the different phases of economic cycles. We argue that the relationship between specific innovative strategies and their employment outcomes, taking into account changes in demand and wages, are radically different in upswings, when new products may open up new markets and offer new jobs, and in downswings, when new processes may come to dominate technological change, leading to restructuring and job losses. In order to investigate these issues, different streams of literature are woven together in the next section, a model is developed in the section after that, an econometric test is carried out in the subsequent section and conclusions are discussed in the last section. The findings support the view that innovation-based growth and job creation may operate in drastically different ways during different phases of the cycle, suggesting the need to move beyond the assumption that employment dynamics are affected by the same factors and in the same way in upswings and downswings. In particular, the key role of demand in shaping job creation has to be integrated with new attention to industry-specific innovative strategies, which have contrasting employment effects over the cycle.",33

The debt burden and debt-servicing burden increased steeply and suddenly in many countries (EBRD, 2010). As a consequence, the non-performing loan ratios in banks’ portfolios soared (Rainer and Haiss, 2010, p. 4). To alleviate balance-sheet effects, monetary authorities in countries with higher levels of credit euroizationFootnote 1 were often forced to respond to depreciation pressures with monetary measures to support the domestic currency. But many of these measures were pro-cyclical, and thus it is unclear what their total effects on the quality of banks’ assets were. Monetary policymakers face a difficult dilemma in small open highly euroized countries when simultaneously faced with exchange rate pressures and economic downturn, hardly independent events. Attempting to preserve a stable nominal exchange rate in these circumstances can be pro-cyclical; allowing the exchange rate to adjust increases balance-sheet risks, and can also turn out to be pro-cyclical. Clearly, the more rigid the exchange rate regime, the greater the risks associated with letting the nominal exchange rate adjust. Regardless of the regime type, the expected cost of exchange rate adjustment is likely to be proportional to the level of credit euroization at the time of the shock. Regulatory limits on the direct foreign currency exposure of financial institutions that require ‘covering’ foreign currency denominated lending by foreign currency denominated liabilities create another policy dilemma in non-crisis times. Many highly euroized countries have suffered from high and persistent deposit euroization, typically due to a history of high inflation or other forms of political or financial instability. Policymakers in such countries often attempted to develop their credit markets by allowing or even stimulating the development of foreign currency denominated lending. So, sometimes, a choice must be made between slower financial development and a higher level of euroization. Thus, the causation between credit and deposit euroization might run both ways, possibly creating a vicious circle of total financial euroization. On these grounds, a sensible policy recommendation for highly euroized countries would be to increase nominal exchange rate flexibility and to take steps to reduce both deposit and credit euroization levels during good times, to make the financial system more resilient in bad times. This is precisely the advice found in most recent literature on credit euroization, such as Zettelmeyer et al. (2010), Rainer and Haiss (2010), and Kokenyne et al. (2010). This literature analyzes the causes and implications of credit euroization in theory and practice, as well as policies deemed successful at de-euroization (or de-dollarization in the case of Latin American economies). In this paper, we test the robustness of their findings on the interesting case of Croatia, one of the most euroized countries in Europe in terms of both financial sector assets and liabilities. Policymakers in Croatia have spent considerable efforts trying to prevent the adverse effects of rapid credit growth fueled by abundant capital inflows. One of the presumed adverse effects of capital inflows is financial euroization. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first in-depth country case study, based on very detailed in-house central bank data, to assess the impact of specific regulatory and macroprudential policies on financial euroization. Our analysis indicates that the monetary and financial policies implemented by the Croatian central bank in 2004–2010 had a profound impact on the evolution of both deposit and credit euroization in Croatia. However, due to the large number of intertwined central bank measures, it is difficult to assess the effect of specific measures. Unexpectedly, feedback between deposit and credit euroization, at least in the period under review, runs only from credit euroization to deposit euroization. We find strong statistical evidence that central bank measures to curb foreign borrowing and domestic credit growth by domestic banks have contributed, if not actually caused, partial financial de-euroization in 2004–2007, while crisis fighting central bank measures in 2008–2009 might have contributed to partial re-euroization. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the literature, focusing mostly on the recent literature on the causes of and policies to combat financial euroization in small and open emerging market economies. In the third section, we present a descriptive analysis of the history of financial euroization in Croatia. The fourth section is devoted to monetary and financial (prudential) policies implemented in Croatia in 2004–2010 to reduce the negative consequences of rapid capital inflows, and how they might have affected financial euroization. In the fifth section, we present an econometric analysis of determinants of financial euroization in Croatia, with emphasis on central bank policies, and the last section discusses how these results could be generalized to other countries.",1
54,3,Comparative Economic Studies,05 September 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2012.27,Credit Euroization in Eastern Europe: The ‘Foreign Funds’ Channel at Work,September 2012,Peter R Haiss,Wolfgang Rainer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Emerging Europe, that is, countries in transition from planned to market economies in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) has been one of the most dynamic growth regions in the past years. Robust economic growth, rising incomes, integration into the European Union (EU) and the anticipation of joining the Euro Area fostered financial deepening and triggered high credit growth (Bonin et al., 2009; ECB, 2006a, Eller et al., 2010; Fink et al., 2009a; Haiss and Ziegler, 2007), particularly before the global financial crisis. The denomination of a high share of these credits in foreign currency (FX)Footnote 1 has become a distinctive feature of the catching-up process in most of the region (Rosenberg and Tirpák, 2008; Brown and De Haas, 2012; see Figure 1). This phenomenon, which is also referred to as credit dollarization or credit euroization,Footnote 2 however, exposes the financial system to a number of additional risk factors (Bordo et al., 2010). The situation is further aggravated by an increasing share of foreign currency borrowing by households. Retail borrowers normally do not have foreign currency income and thus are directly exposed to currency fluctuations, though some foreign currency deposits or remittances may help in certain cases. In the corporate sector, risks tend to be less pronounced, as firm's export revenues can, at least to some degree, provide a natural hedge to foreign currency debt (ECB, 2008; Brown et al., 2010).Footnote 3 The question thus arises what the motives are of lending and borrowing in foreign currency, is it, for example, driven by the high level of foreign bank ownership in the region? Against this background, we analyze the following hypotheses: The availability of foreign funding is a key driver of credit euroization. The ownership-type of lender drives the credit euroization process. Particularly, foreign-owned banks, which play a dominant role in the banking system of most CESEE countries, are the main cause compared to domestic banks. The weight of factors driving credit euroization depends critically on the type of borrowers, ie differs between households and corporate borrowers. Share of FX loans in total private sector loans in Emerging Europe (2009).Note: Owing to data restraints, the figures do not include FX indexed loans for Croatia and Macedonia.Source: Author's own calculations, data from National Banks of the individual countries Our main contribution lies in investigating the impact of foreign funding empirically for the pre-crisis period and by delineating the ‘foreign funds channel’. The impact of funding from abroad on FX-lending in Eastern Europe has not yet received ample attention empirically in this context, with a few exceptions of, for example, Brown and De Haas (2012) who analyze bank-level data only for the very early transition years of 2001 and 2004. In differentiating among FX-borrower types, we contribute by shedding light on the impact of foreign bank ownership, that is, the desirability of privatization to foreigners and of encouraging foreign direct investment (FDI) in the banking sector for both CESEE and other emerging markets. Our third contribution lies in empirically analyzing drivers for FX loans in aggregate (for the private non-financial sector) and separately for household and for non-financial corporate borrower segments. While previous research (eg Brown and De Haas, 2012) suggests that there could well be important differences in the demand for FX-funds inherent in the borrower type (eg based on the availability of cash inflows in foreign currency), as well as differences in costs to the banks and therefore supply (eg from regulation), these have not reached ample attention. So far, most studies on this matter concentrated on FX lending to the private sector as a whole (with eg Basso et al. (2011) as a prominent exemption) or are concentrated on single or a few countries (eg Bogoev, 2011 on Macedonia; Pellenyi and Bilek, 2009 on Hungary; Brown et al., 2010 on Bulgarian firms; Chailloux et al., 2010 on Serbia; Metin-Özcan and Us, 2009 on Turkey; Pann et al., 2010 on Austrian banks). We aim to fill this gap by estimating a model of credit euroization for households, corporations and the private sector separately, paying specific attention to the foreign funds channel. Over the 1999–2007 period, we apply pooled OLS in first differences and cross-check with generalized least squares (GLS) to test for drivers of FX-lending in 13 Emerging European countries. We find evidence that aggregate credit euroization in the non-financial private sector is driven by foreign borrowings by both domestic banks’ foreign borrowing as well as via funds channeled into the system through subsidiaries of foreign banks. While we find no difference among origin of FX-lender (domestic or foreign), we confirm different drivers by borrower type. We find that FX loans to households are to a higher degree determined by domestic supply of foreign currency, that is, FX deposits of residents, as opposed to foreign sources of foreign exchange. Our results provide evidence to regulators, policy makers and market participants into the pre-crisis drivers of FX-lending in CESEE. Given the importance of FX deposits for FX-borrowing by households, we advocate the selective use of loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratios to ensure that banks have a balanced refinancing structure. Rather than restricting wholesale funding or foreign banks’ activities, we suggest that policymakers should concentrate on encouraging domestic savings in local currency as efficient means of lowering the propensity for household borrowing in FX. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section gives an overview of empirical studies on credit euroization. The subsequent section introduces the concept of the foreign funds channel. The section after that presents the empirical models. The methodology and underlying data are presented in the section after that. The penultimate section presents the results of the estimations. The final section concludes.",5

They consist of a set of measures that are implemented by one or more sending countries on one or more target countries and range from the prohibition of scientific, cultural or sports relationships to a ban on economic relations with the sanctioned country.Footnote 1 Recent empirical work has evaluated the impact of international sanctions on trade. Evenett (2002) shows that sanctions against South Africa in the late 1980s reduced its exports by about 30%, and Caruso (2003) estimates that US sanctions have reduced exports to the target countries by 89%. However, international sanctions are often implemented concurrently with wars. For example, in the 1990s, international sanctions were implemented against Iraq, Somalia, Liberia, Angola and, in Europe, Serbia.Footnote 2 In the case of these countries, the sanctions were a response to either civil wars or to wars with other countries. However, previous research has not accounted for this concomitance when measuring the effects that sanctions have on international trade. Indeed, recent studies have shown that wars have a significant impact on international trade. Glick and Taylor (2010) estimate, using a sample of 172 countries spanning the period 1870–1997, that wars have reduced the average mutual trade of belligerent nations by 83%. Martin et al. (2008) show, by estimating a gravity equation for the period 1948–2001, that inter-state wars increase bilateral trade costs. Inter-state wars thus cause a decline in bilateral trade of between 15% and 26%. In addition, the negative effects of war on trade remain significant more than 10 years after the end of the war. This article attempts to disentangle the respective effects of these events. We estimate the effects of wars and sanctions that have affected successor states of the former Yugoslavia on their mutual trade and their trade with third countries. Our estimates improve the established understanding of these phenomena in several ways. First, we provide more precise estimates than those of previous studies by accounting for both war and sanctions. Thus, our results have strong implications for economic policy. Second, we separately evaluate the effects of war and sanctions on the exports and imports of the countries involved, and we show that the effects differ depending on the trade partners. Third, we evaluate the persistence of these effects over time. The case of the former Yugoslavia is relevant for several reasons. From a historical perspective, the republics were a unified and relatively centralized state for more than 70 years, with the exception of the period from April 1941 to November 1945.Footnote 3 The economic ties between these republics were strong when the war began in early 1990, and their shared institutions encouraged mutual exchange. The disintegration of the former Yugoslavia was characterized by an outbreak of war in several locations in the territories of the successor states and the international community's implementation of sanctions against the belligerents. These events, beyond their direct human and material costs, had dramatic effects on the economies of these nations and affected the volume and direction of trade for the belligerents. Thus, we can isolate the effects of the sanctions and wars from other trade barriers. We can also evaluate how the intensity of the trade relationships and complementarities between the republics moderated the effects of these events. Our empirical work is based on a gravity equation. One difficulty in using this approach is the lack of disaggregated trade data for the individual Yugoslav republics prior to their breakup. We therefore reconstruct the trade data for 1988. This empirical work led to several conclusions. First, we show that the wars and sanctions led to a reduction in trade for the countries involved. We then show that other countries were also affected by these events. Finally, we show that the effects remained persistent for several years after the end of the wars and sanctions but that they tended to fade. The article is organized as follows. The next section is devoted to a brief history of the wars and sanctions in the former Yugoslavia to provide readers with some important background information. The section after that summarizes the existing literature on the effects that wars and sanctions have on trade. The subsequent section then reconstructs the data on the trade flows of the republics of the former Yugoslavia before the breakup. In the penultimate section, we present the empirical study. The last section concludes the paper.",9

Under the skin of every international economist lies a deep-seated belief in some variant of the PPP theory of the exchange rate.  (
Dornbusch and Krugman, 1976
).
 In its absolute form, purchasing power parity (PPP) suggests that an identical basket of goods should cost the same value in two different countries when prices are expressed in a common currency. In an illuminating critical review of the literature on PPP, M. P. Taylor (2004) explains that the earliest reference to a PPP-based idea dates back to the Catholic Church ban of usury in the 15th century. Apparently, lenders could circumvent this ban by lending in foreign currency and arguing that higher interest rates were needed to compensate for changes in relative prices between countries. From a policy perspective, PPP represents a level of long-run equilibrium, where the real exchange rate is expected to revert to. Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC), which were transition economies for much of the last two decades, underwent radical price and exchange rate liberalization, as well as substantial economic restructuring. Therefore, for these countries, examining whether there is an equilibrium toward which the real exchange rate gravitates, and understanding the process of adjustment is essential. Many transition economies experienced considerable real appreciation in the first decade of market reform. Egert and Kutan (2005) observe that the real appreciation for some of these transition countries was too persistent to be seen as a simple adjustment toward equilibrium. They identify three factors behind this sustained trend appreciation: (a) the Balassa-Samuelson effect driven by a faster productivity growth in these countries, (b) increased export capacities resulting from a higher domestic and foreign demand for improved quality domestic products, and (c) adjustments due to deregulated prices. While these factors are a large part of the transition experience and would explain persistent behavior in real exchange rates, the more basic question of whether PPP holds for CEEC economies remains underexplored by the literature. The very short time series available for these countries, starting typically in the mid-1990s, make the application of conventional time series techniques challenging to say the least. From a policy perspective, the stakes are high. The capability of a transition economy or Central and Eastern European economy to return to their long-run PPP equilibrium is critical, whether it is a member of the eurozone, or it aspires to become one. Entering a monetary union with an overvalued real exchange rate implies an economy can become competitive primarily via the painful path of deflation, or profound structural reform that increases productivity and contains production costs. Neither is a simple feat. Likewise, entering a monetary union with an undervalued real exchange rate would require adjustment via inflation, which runs against the eurozone inflation limits. The inflation criterion for EMU membership requires that the inflation rate cannot exceed by more than 1.5% the average inflation of the three lowest inflation EU economies. Coupling the inflation criterion with a nominal exchange rate criterion charges the central bank with a next-to-impossible responsibility: two nominal objectives. In this light, the seemingly persistent appreciations of several CEEC economies that aspire to join the EU, or others that have become members of the EU with the objective of becoming part of the eurozone, is a cause for concern. Against this backdrop, a CEEC economy with a rigid or persistent real exchange rate may relive the recent experience of older eurozone members like Greece, Italy, and Portugal, whose lagging competitiveness, or overvalued real exchange rate, was a main factor triggering their debt crisis. In short, it is important to see how flexible the real exchange rate is over time. In the general literature on PPP, numerous empirical studies during the late 1980s failed to find support for the PPP hypothesis using unit root tests, or even the less strict framework requiring nominal exchange rates to be merely cointegrated with home and foreign prices (Taylor, 1988). In the face of such inexplicable lack of evidence for the PPP, subsequent research zeroed in on the low power of unit root tests (Frankel, 1990). Tests attempting to detect stationary properties in a real exchange rate over a short time span were found to be unreliable, even if the real exchange rate is in fact mean reverting in the long run (Taylor and Taylor, 2004). To alleviate the problem of low power, the literature has resorted to long spans of data as well as panel data. Lothian and Taylor (1996) examine dollar-sterling and franc-sterling real exchange rate data over two centuries and find indirect supporting evidence for PPP during the post Bretton Woods period. Although long-span time series studies in general favor PPP, their findings can be suspect insofar as they cover different exchange rate regimes, and may also have structural breaks in the equilibrium real exchange rate (Taylor, 2004). Panel data techniques aim to alleviate the low power problem by analyzing variation over time and across countries. In a comprehensive panel data examination of PPP for 84 countries, Alba and Papell (2007) find that evidence of PPP is stronger in countries with more open trade, closer to the United States, with lower inflation, moderate exchange rate volatility, and similar growth as the United States. They observe that PPP does not hold for panels of African or Asian countries. Noting that in general panel studies tend to find evidence that favors PPP, Taylor and Sarno (1998) point out an important shortcoming: the null hypothesis is joint non-mean reversion of all countries’ real exchange rates. This null will therefore be rejected even if one single country has a stationary real exchange rate. The correct interpretation of a rejection of the null would be that at least one (not all) of the real exchange rates in the panel is mean reverting. So results from panel data studies can be challenging to interpret. The low power of unit root tests, which necessitates using long time series, is a focal reason for the paucity of PPP studies on transition economies, most of which abandoned central planning only two decades ago. Choudhry (1999) employs a cointegration technique on nominal exchange rates and prices for Poland, Romania, Russia, and Slovenia and finds only long-run equilibria for the latter two countries. Christev and Noorbakhsh (2000) use Stock and Watson (1993) and the Johansen (1992) cointegration technique to also find the presence of long-run relationships between exchange rates and prices for Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. The PPP hypothesis, however, does not hold because of the rejection of the symmetry and proportionality conditions in the cointegrating vectors. Sideris (2006) reaches the same conclusion using time series and panel cointegration techniques. Bekő and Borsic (2007) arrive at a similar finding using time series for the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia. Baharumshah and Borsic (2008) use a panel data seemingly unrelated regression augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF) test and find that PPP holds for 7 out of 13 CEEC in transition. Tkalec and Vizek (2011) apply Johansen cointegration as well as nonlinear methodology for Croatia and report evidence that absolute PPP holds for the Kuna exchange rate. This study's main goal is to wrestle with the combination of very short time series for CEEC economies and the low power of conventional unit root tests in order to offer more reliable evidence with respect to their long-run real exchange rate behavior. To that end, I apply a covariate-based test developed by Elliott and Jansson (2003), which yields significantly greater power than conventional unit root tests (see Amara and Papell, 2006; Elliott and Pesavento, 2006). The covariate optimal point test (CPT) achieves power improvements by exploiting information in stationary covariates. Given the challenge of interpreting panel unit root tests, the improved power of the CPT test is a desirable alternative for short time span data. Existing CPT studies have focused on examining evidence of PPP in industrialized countries. To the best of this author's knowledge, there are no such empirical studies for CEEC or transition economies. I test the validity of the PPP for six transition economies (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, and Slovenia) for the period 1990–2010. CPT tests provide support for the PPP hypothesis in four of the six countries. Evidence of PPP is strongest for the Czech Republic, Poland, and the Slovak Republic. The section ‘Theoretical framework’ summarizes the theoretical framework of the PPP hypothesis. The econometric methodology is explained in the section ‘Model and estimation methodology’. The section ‘Data and results’ reports the results of the estimation followed by a summary and conclusions in the section ‘Conclusion’.",1

The global financial crisis ignited in 2008 forcefully introduced another role for intergovernmental transfers (previously pointed out in the discussion on the lack of automatic stabilizers in the European Economic and Monetary Union, EMU), that is stabilizing idiosyncratic regional shocks. This takes place when the central government gathers and pools revenues from regions and then redistributes it back to regions so that those under hardship receive more than they gave out. Regional stabilization can also appear in the form of exchange rate movement and inter-regional labour mobility. However, during the global financial crisis we have witnessed massive stimulation and bailout packages in the US and the EMU region for example, as well as in the major transition countries of China and Russia, where an exchange rate adjustment is not available among the member countries and regions. The natural question that arises is why countries or regions do not insure themselves (at least partially) through national or international capital markets. Concerning the EMU member countries and the US states that this is a legitimate question, but Russia is an example of a Federation where the member regions face impediments for access to capital markets. These impediments are due to the regulatory rules and immature financial markets. This is why the regions in Russia are dependent on Federal financial flows, especially at times of economic distress. In the first half of 2009, Federal financial transfers became the biggest revenue source of Russian regions at the aggregate level (BOFIT, 2009). Furthermore, even if there was complete access to capital markets, there are still economic incentives for a region to participate in a Federation-wide inter-regional insuranceFootnote 1 scheme carried out through the fiscal policy of the Federation. Von Hagen (1998) argues that especially if the self-insuring region is small, it might face higher borrowing than lending rates, making a fiscal-based insurance scheme preferable. After the global crisis triggered in autumn 2008, a massive economic stimulus and aid was granted by the Russian government to the regions (oblasts). The sum constitutes approximately 10% of Russia's GDP. This has been possible due to the unprecedented fiscal capacity of the Russian government, built up from soaring energy export incomes. Due to the government action in the current crisis, actual impediments for self-insurance and scarcity of earlier research on Russia, we think that Russia provides an interesting case for analysing inter-regional insurance. In this study, we will examine the role of the Russian fiscal system as a regional shock-stabilizer prior to the current crisis (1995–2007). We do this by somewhat transforming the approach by Mélitz and Zumer (2002, M-Z henceforth) to fit the Russian conditions better. Our main methodology is non-parametric estimation to account for poolability and endogeneity issues but as a benchmark we also provide standard panel method estimations. We will also analyse the importance of accounting (highlighted by M-Z) – by examining different specifications for the model variables. Our main results can be summarized as follows. First of all, the Russian transfer system should be seen foremost as a stabilizer against budget flow shocks, rather than against gross product or population income shocks. Second, we find that the distribution of estimates obtained by the non-parametric estimation is determined by Federation-wide policy changes rather than differences in asymmetric treatment between the regions (ie asymmetric Federalism). The rest of this paper will proceed as follows. In the next section, we present a review of the previous empirical literature. The section after that presents and discusses our data as well as our estimation framework and methods. The subsequent section presents our results and the last section concludes the paper.",

They attract the brightest minds and the most productive firms. The largest cities in transition countries lag behind. This paper investigates factors that slow down growth of the prime cities in transition countries. In particular, it aims at explaining low population mobility. For a long time, central planners had been restricting internal migration to and industrial production growth in the prime cities, while encouraging development of the secondary cities. De jure, restrictions were softened with the fall of the communism. De facto, economic and political factors that prevent people from moving are still in place, as internal migration in the region remains at a very low level. As a result, convergence of the urban systems in transition countries from the centrally planned equilibrium to the market-based one is slow. The early stages of transition drew substantial attention of researchers in urban economics.Footnote 1 However, the literature has relatively little to say about more recent developments that have occurred during the last decade. To access what factors contribute to low internal migration during the last decade, I look at the Life in Transition Survey (LITS) II that describes, among other things, housing conditions and satisfaction with local governments for almost 39,000 households from 34 countries in 2010.Footnote 2 I identify that the housing market inefficiencies played the major role in explaining low internal mobility. Two factors are found particularly important. First, there is a strong and robust positive correlation between population mobility and availability of rented housing. Second, high mobility is associated with the share of households with mortgages in the urban area. The effects are economically important. A standard deviation increase in the share of rented housing in transition countries is associated with a 50% closing the gap in mobility between Western Europe and transition countries, while a standard deviation increase in the share of mortgaged dwellings is associated with a 25% closing the gap in mobility. Absence of properly functioning land markets during the socialism further exacerbates the problem of low mobility and lead to spatial distortions in the distribution of economic activities within urban areas (Bertaud and Renaud, 1997). In the market-based economy with efficiently functioning land markets, land prices act as signals that help to recycle inefficient use of the valuable land within city limits and replace it with more economically sound activities. Absence of such signals in centrally planned economies led to economically inefficient allocation of economic activities within socialist cities. Since the transition to the market economy has started, land markets have developed in all transition countries, but the institutions regulating land markets are still underdeveloped and lack the legislative base. Quick reformers in Eastern Europe that have created those institutions and developed the legislative base early on were more successful in urban development, while slow reformers are still lagging behind, having difficulties to revitalize their urban areas. Under-sized prime cities in the region relative to the prime cities in other parts of the world are a challenge for the policymakers. Larger cities are more attractive to skilled workers and investors due to positive externalities brought in play by the agglomeration forces. Therefore the findings presented in this paper lead to a conclusion that the urban development policies in transition countries should be channelled towards increasing internal mobility of population by means of reducing inefficiencies in the housing market and developing market-based institutions that regulate land use within city limits. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section focuses on urbanization and distribution of city sizes in the region. The subsequent section discusses factors that contribute to low mobility and distort the spatial equilibrium. The penultimate section draws policy implications of under-urbanization. The last section concludes.",12

Wages are, however, converging as a result of two forces: the rapid growth of developing countries, and the integration of global product and service markets. Of those two forces, integration, enabled both by policy and technology, is having the quicker impact. Integration will also reduce the time developing countries require to catch up. But even in the best of circumstances that time will be counted in decades.

54,4,Comparative Economic Studies,25 October 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2012.32,The Evolving Structure of the American Economy and the Employment Challenge,December 2012,Michael Spence,Sandile Hlatshwayo,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the post-crisis environment, issues of sustainability in the trajectory of the US economy have come to the fore.Footnote 1 Among the problems pointed to are a large current account deficit, the paucity of household savings, overleveraging in the financial and household sectors, and the stagnation of middle-class incomes. However, what appears to be missing is a detailed look at the structural shifts in the economy over longer periods, and the way in which emerging economies’ growth patterns are affecting the pattern of industry employment and value added in the United States. This paper attempts to close the gap, offering a fresh look at the US economic structure over the past 20 years and exploring the implications of such shifts. Employing historical time series data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, US industries are separated into internationally tradable and nontradable components, allowing for employment and value-added trends at both the industry and the aggregate level to be examined. We find that:
 Employment growth in the US economy between 1990 and 2008 was substantial, on the order of 27.3 million jobs, off a base in 1990 of 121.9 million. Virtually all (97.7%) of the incremental employment stems from the nontradable sector. This occurred despite dramatic labor-saving technology in information processing that ran across all sectors of the economy. The leading employment sectors are government and health care, in that order, both on the nontradable side. Together, these two sectors generated more than 10 million additional jobs over the period, accounting for almost 40% of the increment. The tradable sector accounted for only a negligible number of new jobs due to gains in service industries (eg, finance and consulting) being offset by losses in manufacturing and agricultural employment. Manufacturing sectors that suffered a loss of employment also experienced rising value added. Therefore, value added per job rose, in some cases dramatically. High-income jobs remained in the tradable sector. For the tradable sector as a whole, value added per job rose substantially, an increase of 54.9% from 1990 to 2008, far above the increase of 23.5% in the economy as a whole. The tradable sector is gravitating toward higher value-added components of global supply chains. These consist, in broad terms, of high-end services, some in manufacturing industries and some, such as finance and insurance, in pure service industries. Notably, and in contrast to employment trends, the nontradable sector saw growth in value added per job of only 13.9%, far below the tradable sector's 54.9% increase. One implication of the mismatch between sectors driving employment and sectors driving value added per job is that income inequality has increased and is likely to intensify in coming years. Until the crisis of 2008, the US economy did not have a conspicuous job crisis due to the ability of the nontradable sector to continue to absorb entrants to the labor force. In our view, it is unlikely that this pattern will continue. The pace of employment generation on the nontradable side will slow. Fiscal constraints, the costs of the health-care sector, a resetting of real estate values, and the elimination of excess consumption all point to the potential for a longer-term structural employment problem. Given the prospect of slowing employment growth in nontradables and rising competitive pressure on tradables, major employment problems in the near future are a certainty. Even if the nontradable sector was able to continue to absorb the growth in the labor force, pressure on wages and salaries will be downward, and consequences for income distribution unavoidable. To create jobs, contain inequality, and reduce the US current-account deficit, the scope of the export sector will need to expand. That will mean restoring and creating US competitiveness in an expanded set of activities via restrained pre-tax income and wage growth, as well as heightened investment in human capital (including skills upgrading), technology, and hard and soft infrastructure. The challenge is how to do it most effectively. Rather than intervening directly in market dynamics, we suggest that government try to shift incentives at the margin by investing in both physical and human capital to encourage an expansion of manufacturing and high-tech activity. Otherwise, the United States will have a longer-term employment problem. The American economy does not exist in a vacuum; some of its most striking and evolving characteristics are tied to long-term trends in the developing world, namely, the large emerging economies. The first section describes the evolving structure of the global economy and offers perspective on how emerging economies have increased their influence on the US economy since the early 1950s. The next section describes the tradable and nontradable parts of the economy. The main body of the paper is a detailed and data-intensive look at changes in employment and value added in US industries. The paper concludes with an assessment of the structural and employment challenges and begins a preliminary exploration of possible policy responses. For readers who are interested in the major trends and findings, but not industry-level detail, we suggest reading the next section on the evolving structure of the global economy, then, near the end, the last two sections, which discuss policy responses that may help shift the trajectory. Finally, for those who wish to see an extended version of the paper, which includes more detail on the intertemporal dynamics of the US economy, see Spence and Hlatshwayo (2011).",32
54,4,Comparative Economic Studies,16 August 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2012.28,Addressing the Problem of Stagnant Wages,December 2012,Frank Levy,Thomas Kochan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the three decades after World War II, a central feature of the American economy was a mass upward mobility in which each generation lived better than the last and workers experienced earnings gains through much of their careers. In short, the American Dream was alive and well. The central drivers of mass upward mobility were real wages for most workers that grew in line with overall labor productivity. Because of rising real wages a 40-year-old male blue collar worker earned more in the late 1960s than most managers had earned in the late 1940s. The alignment of wage growth and productivity growth resulted from two main factors: labor markets for most groups of workers in which demand matched supply, and a post-World War II Social Compact that emerged from the Great Depression and helped to propagate wage norms throughout the economy, norms that were enforced in part through collective bargaining and professional personnel/human resource management practices. By the 1980s, both of these factors had reversed. Labor demand increasingly shifted toward more educated workers – particularly well-educated women. At the same time, the post-war Social Compact was challenged by the inflationary 1970s and collapsed in the 1980s. Nothing has emerged to replace it since then. Now, in the absence of a labor market boom like that of 1996–2000, increased labor productivity no longer translates into rising real wages for many groups of workers. The following figures illustrate this trend by comparing 25 years of labor productivity growth and median weekly compensation for 35–44-year-old men and women full-time workers classified by education. In these figures, compensation is defined as median weekly earnings adjusted for fringe benefits and compensation is adjusted for inflation using the GDP deflator.Footnote 1 As shown in the figures, between 1980 and 2009, labor productivity increased by 78% but:
 The median compensation of 35–44 male high school graduates (with no college) declined by 10%. The median compensation of 35–44-year-old male college graduates (without graduate degrees) grew by 32%, less than half as much as overall productivity growth. Only the median compensation of 35–44-year-old men with post-graduate training came close to keeping up with labor productivity growth increasing by 49%. The corresponding data for women are slightly more positive. The median compensation of women with either a BA or post-graduate training has largely kept up with productivity growth. But only one-third of working women in this age group have a BA or more while the compensation for the other two-thirds of working women generally lags behind productivity growth. The broken connection between labor productivity growth and compensation growth for the average worker has undermined the mass upward mobility and ideal of a growing middle class.Footnote 2 The impact has been particularly severe for male and female high school graduates. The stagnant/declining compensation of high school graduates is one potential cause in the high school graduates’ falling marriage rates and of the increasing fraction high school educated mothers who are raising children on their own.Footnote 3 Stagnant/declining compensation may also play a role in the very slow increases in the fraction of US high school graduate who complete a BA. 
In our view the United States needs a new Social Compact not in the mirror image or with the same institutions as the original Social Compact, but with policies, institutions, and organizational practices suited to the current economy and workforce.
 In the sections that follow we will outline some challenges that will need to be addressed to forge a new Social Compact, review several key factors that led to the breakdown of the prior Compact, and then suggest potential elements for a new Compact. Before turning to a discussion of the factors that led the prior Compact to break down, we need to note two big challenges have to be overcome to put a new Social Compact in place. The first is political and in some respects ideological. Since the 1970s, large corporations have dramatically increased their economic power and political influence (Barley, 2010), leading to substantial legislative changes that deregulated major industries, liberalized banking rules, undercut labor law enforcement and reform, prevented improvements in the federal minimum wage, and fostered an ideology of free market liberalism and the maximization of shareholder value at the expense of other stakeholders. Prior to these changes, American business practiced a managerial capitalism that shared the returns on investments in new goods and services among the firms’ investors, science and engineering professionals, managers, and other employees. Today, American business emphasizes a form of financial capitalism that rewards financial innovations, transactions, and restructuring. As a result of this shift, a disproportionate share of the gains of recent productivity gains has gone to those in the financial sector who engineered this shift and to the top executives in corporations who applied these principles in their firms. Over three decades, this evolution has been supported by a public belief in the proposition that left alone, unregulated market forces and corporations that maximize shareholder value would generate the economic growth and shared prosperity needed to raise living standards for all Americans. The 2008 financial collapse disproved this proposition as it involved financial markets. The compensation data in Figures 1 and 2 disprove the proposition for most workers. A realignment of corporate and public interests begins with an honest discussion of these facts. Median weekly compensation of 35–44-year-old men who work full time: Non-farm business productivity (right-hand axis) Median weekly compensation of 35–44-year-old woman who work full time: Non-farm business productivity (right-hand axis) The second problem is analytical. While the past three decades have generated a number of localized organizational and institutional innovations in response to changing markets, technologies, and workforce characteristics – and many of these innovations have demonstrated their effectiveness on a small scale – few if any have diffused widely enough to be tested for their potential as national strategies. This paper will address both the political and analytical challenges by reviewing the causes of the breakdown in the Social Compact and the evidence on elements that could be part of a new one.",3

54,4,Comparative Economic Studies,11 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2012.39,The Two German Labour Market Miracles: Blueprints for Tackling the Unemployment Crisis?,December 2012,Holger Bonin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"At a time when the unemployment crisis is hardly improving in the United States and most of the European Union, many decision-makers looking for policies to boost employment are turning their attention to Germany, a country where the labour market has shown remarkable strength in a highly unfavourable global economic environment. Real German GDP dropped 6.6% during the great recession of 2008–2009. Thus the decline in global trade in the aftermath of the financial crisis hit the economy hard, compared with the average OECD country. Yet despite of what has actually been the strongest negative output shock after World War II, the unemployment rate in Germany only rose by 0.5 percentage points – the mildest increase among all OECD member states. Many international observers have called the surprisingly moderate employment response to the great recession Germany's labour market miracle. This success story, however, may distract from the greater labour market miracle that becomes apparent considering the country's long-term labour market development. At the turn of the century, Germany still showed typical symptoms of Eurosclerosis – slow job creation in spite of overall economic growth. Structural unemployment had increased with each recession since the 1970s and high shares of long-term unemployment prevailed. But what The Economist then called the ‘sick man of Europe’, the sick man has remarkably well recovered. Two facts may illustrate the labour market turnaround. In April 2012, the number of employed reached 41.4 million, a gain of 1.5 million compared with the average employment of 2000, and a record high in post-reunified Germany. In the same month, Germany's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate according to Eurostat declined to 5.4%, which was about half the euro area average (11%), and also well below the US unemployment rate. In 2000 the German unemployment rate of 7.5% was much closer to the euro area average (8.5%) and clearly above the US rate (4%). This paper reviews the factors that can explain the exceptional performance of the German labour market since 2005. I will argue that progress was achieved through a series of labour market reforms which were initiated already before the great recession, in conjunction with a long period of considerable wage moderation. Owing to these structural improvements, the German labour market miracle might well develop into a lasting phenomenon. The favourable pre-recession state plays a major role in explaining why Germany's labour market fared so well during the great recession. In contrast, discrete policy measures and traditional German labour market institutions that facilitate buffering demand shocks within firms were less important for this other labour market miracle. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section explains the labour market reforms Germany adopted prior to the great recession and highlights the core success factors. The subsequent section focuses on the peculiar response of the German labour market in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The last section concludes with a reflection on what countries struggling with soaring unemployment may learn from the German case.",4
54,4,Comparative Economic Studies,02 August 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2012.25,The Cost of Rigidity: The Case of the South African Labor Market,December 2012,Johannes Fedderke,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"South African labor market conditions are unusual by international standards. High and persistent unemployment rates do not prevent real labor costs from rising. Job losses are rapid and sustained even in the presence of very mild exogenous shocks. It follows that the labor market faces significant rigidities that prevent clearing from taking place. The purpose of the present discussion is to collate evidence on what the source of these rigidities might be. The suggestion that South African labor markets suffer from significant rigidities is rendered immediately plausible by a consideration of the evidence to emerge from the most recent financial crisis. The evidence shows that South African output was negatively impacted by the international financial crisis of 2007, with a decline in real output from the middle of 2008 through the middle of 2009. The decline in real aggregate output in South Africa was of the order of 1.5%, while aggregate employment fell by 6.7%. Thus the negative shock to output was relatively mild, certainly in terms of the international experience surrounding the sub-prime crisis. By contrast, the reaction in the labor market was stronger by several (close to four) orders of magnitude. Employment losses in response to the crisis were immediate, strong, and have proved to be sustained. The rapid recovery of output in the economy has not been associated with an employment recovery. Further indication of the presence of significant rigidities in the labor market comes from a consideration of South African unemployment rates, and real unit labor cost. What is striking about the evidence is that during the 1995–2005 period in which the unemployment rate was not only high, but rising dramatically (on the narrow definition of unemployment it doubled from 15% to 30%, while on the broad definition of unemployment it increased from 30% to more than 40%), the real cost of labor not only showed no sign of falling, but in fact rose dramatically instead. The inference of this descriptive evidence is that the labor market faces severe rigidities that prevent it from adjusting to any exogenous shock to the economy, that prevent the price of labor from adjusting to market clearing levels, and that therefore result in significant levels of unemployment. What is more, the persistence of the unemployment over now more than two decades suggests that the rigidities are not only significant, but that little has occurred either structurally in the economy, or by virtue of policy intervention, to address the source of the problem. In this paper we consider the evidence that has emerged on the South African labor market, and which has a bearing on the functionality or otherwise of the South African labor market. Two broad sets of conclusions emerge from a consideration of the evidence. The first is that the South African labor market is subject to strong rigidities, which have their source both in the labor and in the output markets of South Africa. The rigidities interact so as to inhibit the market from clearing – above all by placing constraints on the real cost of labor to adjust so as to generate an increase in labor demand. The second emerges from the provision in this paper of a theoretical framework that allows prior work on the labor market to be placed in a unifying framework. Virtually all studies to date have focussed on a narrow aspect of the labor market, or have generated results that are of significance to an understanding of the functioning of the South African labor market but as a by-product of analytical concerns focussed on other questions. As such, it is not obvious how the various pieces of evidence relate to one another. For this reason, in the present paper we begin with the presentation of a theoretical model, that allows the disparate pieces of evidence to be brought into relation to one another, and to be judged for consistency. The model demonstrates that in a labor market model related to underlying output growth, the range of elasticities that South African studies have been concerned with (wage, supply, output) are not independent of one another. This allows us to interpret the accumulated evidence systematically. Organization of the paper is as follows. In the next section we present some background structural features of the South African economy, relevant to the labor market. The subsequent section presents the theoretical framework through which we interpret the empirical evidence on South Africa. In the latter sections we review and interpret the evidence on output and on labor markets respectively. The last section concludes.",11
54,4,Comparative Economic Studies,22 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2012.41,"Education, Jobs, and Equity in the Middle East and North Africa",December 2012,Djavad Salehi-Isfahani,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Just a few months before the Arab uprisings of 2011, when media portrayal of Arab economies as development failures became common, the United Nations Human Development Report listed several of these countries, notably Tunisia, among its top –10 most improved countries since 1970.Footnote 1 Egypt and Tunisia, the two countries where revolutionaries succeeded first, had grown at a respectable rate of about 5% over the previous decade and scored high on health and education. Despite popular notions to the contrary, poverty and inequality have not been particularly high in the Arab world, especially relative to Latin America, and have been in fact quite low in two of the three countries that experienced successful uprisings in 2011 – Libya and Tunisia.Footnote 2 To the extent that economic issues were responsible for the massive discontent that has been on display during the ‘Arab Awakening’, the two most important factors are unemployment of educated youth and a general sense of unfairness about how the fruits of economic growth have been distributed. Unfairness is not easily captured by standard measures of inequality of outcomes, such as the Gini coefficient; it is closer to inequality of opportunity. Countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) have unusually high rates of unemployment of educated youth (high school and university educated). They also suffer from high degrees of inequality of opportunity, as measured by the degree to which family background and other circumstances beyond an individual's control accounts for success in school and in the labor market, despite moderate levels of income inequality. New governments in countries where uprisings have been successful, and older ones that have so far survived the Arab Awakening, are busy reconfiguring their development strategies. New development strategies must offer solutions to the twin challenges of high rates of unemployment of young educated workers and the sense of unfairness that permeates their societies. The search for solutions must begin with understanding how the state-led modernization project has failed to deliver on its main promise of education as the path to social and economic mobility. In most of the region, post-independence governments in Egypt, Libya, Iraq, Syria, and Tunisia, some espousing socialism, offered their citizens access to free education and used secure government jobs as inducement. Both systems were founded on meritocratic principles, vastly different from the class-based feudal systems they replaced. Even the few monarchies that survived the wave of populist revolutions in the early part of the 20th century, such as Iran, Jordan, and Morocco, adopted a similar model, offering free education followed by government employment as a way to promote modernization. Furthermore, to encourage popular participation, they offered access to both on a competitive and meritocratic basis. It is useful to view this top-down approach to modernization in the context of an ‘Authoritarian Bargain’ as proposed by Desai et al. (2009). According to them, authoritarian governments buy political acquiescence by providing various services to their citizens. Free education, followed by access to public jobs for the educated can be considered as part of such an appeasement equilibrium in MENA societies. Authoritarian governments in these societies bought political stability because they were able to find jobs for the graduates of the education systems. This bargain worked quite well for a while, perhaps too well, for it was successful in changing the perspective of the average family away from the traditional rural way of life toward the modern urban lifestyle. Families aspired for their children to succeed in school and land a secure government job rather than stay on the family farm to raise large families. But, decades on, in most MENA countries, the social pact implicit in the state-led modernization has unraveled. Millions of high school and university graduates are not only without job prospects, they have also lost confidence in the system's fairness and do not consider the playing field level. In this paper I trace how this model has come to fail and the likely paths forward. I focus on two sets of factors that have contributed to the unraveling. The first is demographic, and for the most part exogenous: an unusual surge in the population of youth has put strong pressures on the education system and the labor markets. The second set of factors is inherent in the state-led development strategy in which the state played a strong role both as provider of education as well as employer of the educated. As the state reached its inevitable limits of expansion and hiring of graduates could not keep pace with supply, educated youth had to seek employment in the private sector. But the transition from public to private employment was not a matter of mere reallocation. Under the influence of the strong state, the education system had specialized in producing what the public sector had been demanding, namely, formal credentials, rather than productive skills that the private sector would need to compete globally. Furthermore, the crony capitalists that had emerged in recent decades under the tutelage of authoritarian governments lacked the political independence to chart their own course for promoting education and employment and offer the Arab societies a new development model. A smooth transition to a modern market economy was therefore not in the works for most of these societies, leading to the uprisings. While the uprisings themselves cannot offer consistent blueprints for the future or even solutions for the failures of the systems they challenge, they provide the opportunity to forge a new social contract. The next section lays out the basic demographic picture with an emphasis on its labor market implications. Demographic pressures on the markets for education and labor in MENA are more intense than any other region of the world. The cohorts of youth entering schools and looking for jobs after graduation are unusually large now but will significantly decline in coming decades, allowing the quality of schooling to enhance and their absorption into the labor market to ease. The section ‘Youth unemployment’ argues that MENA labor markets further intensify the demographic pressures because they exclude youth from access to formal jobs, causing high rates of unemployment for educated youth. The section ‘Education’ discusses how the authoritarian development strategies in MENA have shaped their education systems, giving rise to a ‘credentialist equilibrium’ in which education reduces to acquisition of diplomas that are rewarded by the public sector but are not useful for private employers. The section ‘The unraveling of the credentialist equilibrium’ shows how this equilibrium has unraveled as overextended public sectors have restructured and for some time have been unable to fulfill their promise of employment for educated youth. The section ‘Equality of opportunity’ argues that the failure of the state goes deeper than unfulfilled promises of public jobs: The meritocratic system of education, while relatively immune to corruption that has permeated other aspects of the state, has become increasingly unfair as children from more advantaged backgrounds take greater advantage of scarce slots in top universities and in the formal labor markets. The section ‘Conclusion’ offers concluding remarks.",33

Many economists cite domestic factors – the process of transition and the lost institutional credibility in the early 1990s – as the main force underlying the instability. Frequently these factors were of political nature. The economic result of such an environment has been high and volatile inflation jeopardizing the conduct of economic policy. With the principal objective of curbing inflation, many CESEEs pegged their currency to a credible anchor currency, which in turn reduced inflation to reasonable levels. However, in some cases, the pegged currency became an object of attack by large changes in capital flows, undermining monetary policy credibility and hence weakening the confidence of financial markets. These countries, subsequently, had to rethink the conduct of monetary policy. Other countries resisted the pressures on the foreign exchange market and endured the pegged currency until recently, likely opting for faster and smoother adoption of the euro as a single currency. In this paper, we explore whether the monetary policy regime changed. In particular, we opt to disentangle if monetary policy responses to inflation, output gap and the exchange rate changed in a systematic way in the seven CESEE countries. We demonstrate that there is a significant difference in the way in which monetary policy was conducted in the Czech Republic and Poland in the early 1990s, late 1990s and 2000s; that there is a negligent difference in Hungary in the 1990s and 2000s; and that the monetary policy in the rest of the sample was likely governed by one main regime, despite the fact that early short-lived regime is identified therein. In some cases, the level shift of the interest rate, while in others the changing volatility of the monetary environment, drives the inference of the switch between regimes. Moreover, findings are consistent with the shifts announced by policymakers and/or documented by researchers. The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents some monetary developments in CESEE to motivate the discussion. The subsequent section discusses the characterization of the monetary policy and the empirical method. The section after that discusses the data. The penultimate section reports the findings and presents further discussion. The last section concludes.",3

Easterly and Levine (1997) showed a negative association between ethnic heterogeneity and economic growth.Footnote 1 Ethnic heterogeneity is thought to influence economic growth through several channels. First, ethnic heterogeneity has been found to reduce investment (Mauro, 1995; Montalvo and Reynal-Querol, 2005a, 2005b), thus reducing public and private capital formation and economic growth.Footnote 2 Second, ethnic heterogeneity has been shown to be positively associated with the probability of conflict (Montalvo and Reynal-Querol, 2005a, 2005b) and it is negatively related to trust (Dincer, 2011).Footnote 3 Trust plays a key role in reducing transaction costs in the market (Zak and Knack, 2001). Thus, we predict that ethnic heterogeneity impedes not only market transactions but also information spillovers including learning from others. This inevitably hinders economic growth. However, the effect of ethnic heterogeneity on growth is open for discussion because heterogeneity also appears to have a contrasting effect: social diversity, which seems to be captured partly by ethnic heterogeneity, is thought to promote innovation (Jacobs, 1969, 1984). If this is true, then heterogeneity may enhance economic growth. In the analysis used in this paper, technological progress, regarded as a proxy for innovation, is exogenously determined. Hence, this paper does not examine the influence of ethnic heterogeneity on growth through enhanced innovation. Data envelopment analysis, hereafter DEA, enables us to analyze how ethnic diversity influences economic growth. We use DEA analysis to construct a world production frontier, and then decompose labor productivity growth into three components: technological catch-up, capital deepening, and technological change (Kumar and Russell, 2002).Footnote 4 Alternatively, we have used regression analysis to examine how initial outputs per worker influence these components (Yamamura and Shin, 2007a, 2007b, 2008; Yamamura, 2011). This paper aims to examine the influence of heterogeneity on growth and therefore provide new empirical evidence by analyzing the channels through which ethnic heterogeneity affects growth. The key finding is that heterogeneity has a negative effect on efficiency improvements, which impedes growth. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: two testable hypotheses are proposed in the next section; the subsequent section describes the data and estimation strategy; the penultimate section presents the estimation results; and the final section concludes.",1

However, the use of the most popular extended version of the probability method (Batchelor and Orr, 1988) during the episodes of non-positive inflation rates encounters difficulties. This study proposes an adjustment to the extended version of the probability method, allowing quantification of survey data in such circumstances. It also presents the results of its application in the quantification of consumer inflation perception and expectations in the euro area and Ireland – the economy, in which the recent financial crisis led to the most negative inflation among the euro zone economies.",5

Recent panel data studies (eg, Dobrinsky, 2003; de Broeck and Sløk, 2006) have found comparatively high point estimates for corresponding price-productivity elasticities for transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEEC), which seems to contrast with findings from cross-section regression analyses, where the inclusion of poorer countries tends to generate lower elasticities (Maeso-Fernandez et al., 2005). Whether or not a special status for transition economies exists in the Penn effect appears important for two reasons. First, it might lead to higher observed inflation in these countries, which the ECB, among others, could be concerned about. Second, it might lead to losses in competitiveness, which policy makers in these countries should be concerned about. The idea of this paper is to put the price-productivity behaviour of transition economies into international perspective. For this purpose, we first review the literature on the Penn effect. This literature seems to show a special status for transition economies. In the subsequent section, we demonstrate that within the time-series dimension, estimated price-productivity elasticities for transition economies are indeed different from those of non-transition OECD countries. In the following, however, we argue that (i) the Penn effect is by its nature a cross-section rather than a time-series phenomenon, and (ii) that estimates of price-productivity elasticities without the inclusion of other explanatory factors might suffer from omitted variable bias and omitted variable inconsistency. As a solution, we propose an extended approach in order to take account of reform effort as the driving force behind deregulation, reallocation, and restructuring during transition. The results of estimating the extended approach with panel data and fixed period-effects suggest that the price-productivity elasticity for transition economies is not different from that of OECD economies.",2

However, the activities of Gosbank are little known, mainly because the Soviet authorities published scant financial and monetary data. Gosbank published its annual balance sheets until 1937, after which it withheld them (Powell, 1972). Gosbank did not publish its balance sheet again until 1991, which was also the last time the balance sheet was published (Narkhoz SSSR, 1991, p. 28). After the collapse of the Soviet system, the state archives became open to the public, including to foreigners. This change greatly enhanced access to official economic documents from the Soviet period. Nevertheless, it is still difficult for researchers outside of Moscow to find the materials that they need among the enormous quantity of archive materials. Kashin and Mikov (2010) made a significant contribution by publishing a collection of Gosbank's balance sheets from 1922 to 1990 that included detailed comments. This publication enabled us to take a first significant step toward a quantitative analysis of Soviet banking. Using the newly available Gosbank balance sheets, this study investigates Gosbank’s activities by focusing on the relation between cash and non-cash money and the financial sources of Gosbank’s loans.Footnote 1 Soviet and non-Soviet economists have long discussed this issue in qualitative terms but not in a quantitative manner. This study aims to quantitatively analyze the issue and deduce new inferences on the performance of the Soviet management of monetary and financial flows. The relation between cash and non-cash money concerns a basic institutional premise of Soviet money management: the separation of cash and non-cash money (see Ericson, 2006, pp. 58–64). According to the Soviet standard, cash and non-cash money were separated as follows: cash was used only to settle household transactions, while non-household transactions were settled with non-cash money in the form of either bank transfers or netting. The Soviet authorities permitted enterprises to convert their non-cash funds into cash money only to pay wages, including various monetary benefits to households, and to defray small expenses. Enterprises were neither required nor permitted to have cash money except for wage payments.Footnote 2 Therefore, wage payments were the sole source of the cash money supply. The planned total amount of wages was supposed to impose a ceiling on the cash money supply; the cash money supplied to the households should have flowed back to the banking system through the households’ consumption and deposits. Most non-Soviet economists doubted the effectiveness of the separation between cash and non-cash money (Gregory, 2004, pp. 220–221; Kim, 2002). It was, however, difficult to empirically assess the effectiveness of this separation because of the lack of data. Nakamura (2011) analyzed the relation between cash and non-cash money by using the household monetary income and outlay balance, which has recently become available. Nakamura (2011) found that the correlation between cash and non-cash money was weak and negative, if it existed at all, and concluded that the division between cash and non-cash money was largely effective. This study analyzes the relation between the cash and non-cash money supplies by using the traditional balance sheet analysis method.   where CAS denotes the cash money in circulation, NFA is net foreign assets, NCE is the net credits to the economy, NCG is the net credits to the government, and NOA is the net other assets. See the explanation of the indicators in Table 1 and the data in the Appendix. In equation 1, t denotes the year t, and Δ indicates the difference in the stock amounts at the end of years t−1 and t. That is, ΔX

−Xt−1. If the result of the analysis does not differ from that of Nakamura (2011), then cash issuance was likely an unimportant source of Gosbank's loans. If this implication is true, then what was the main source of Gosbank’s funds? The structure of the sources of the loanable funds is expressed as follows:   where NFL denotes the net foreign liabilities, NLG is the net liabilities to the government, HDP is household deposits, and NOL is net other liabilities. See Table 1 for the other notations and the Appendix for the data. Birman (1980, pp. 97–98) wrote that Soviet economists were mostly concerned with the sources of Gosbank’s funds, rather than with the factors influencing cash issuance. One of the reasons for this conclusion is that the Soviet researchers believed in the division between cash and non-cash money. If the division was effective, the total wage bill imposed a ceiling on the cash money supply. In this case, there is not much point in analyzing the factors that influence cash issuance. Another reason is the fact that Gosbank supplied almost all of the bank loans to the economy (Table 2). The official financial sources that Soviet enterprises were allowed to use were restricted to the profits retained by the enterprises, the budget funds provided by the government, the funds redistributed to the enterprises by their supervising organizations, and bank loans. It is thus understandable that Soviet economists were more interested in Gosbank as the provider of funds than as the guardian of the money supply. The structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows. The next section provides a brief review of the historical and institutional backgrounds of the Soviet banking system, a quantitative sketch of the overall development of Gosbank, and a short explanation of the methodological issues in the compilation of Gosbank's balance sheets. This piece is followed by two sections that analyze the relation between cash and non-cash money and the financial sources of Gosbank's loans. Each of these two sections explains the data, the methods applied, and the results. The final section discusses the results and their implications for understanding the Soviet monetary economy.",2

The factors that have been highlighted as playing an important role in explaining why certain countries were hit by the crisis harder than others include fast pre-crisis credit growth, large current account deficits, trade openness, business friendliness (ie the extent of market regulation), the international openness of the banking sector and the level of GDP per capita (see, in particular, Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2010; Blanchard et al., 2010; Berkmen et al., 2009; Berglöf et al., 2009; Giannone et al., 2011; Rose and Spiegel, 2009a, 2009b, 2011). Somewhat paradoxically, there is one potentially important factor which these studies have not considered so far, although it was believed to have played a crucial role in previous crises, at least when it comes to emerging market economies. It is the extent to which a country has assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, that is, its so-called degree of ‘unofficial dollarisation/euroisation’. This aspect is particularly important for emerging economies, as forcefully shown in countless crises examples, such as the Latin American sovereign debt crises of the 1980s, the currency crises in emerging Asia of the 1990s, the Argentinean crisis of the early 2000s, as well as the subsequent Brazilian and Turkish financial crises. For almost three decades, unofficial dollarisation/euroisation has been the focus of controversial policy debates in emerging market economies, giving rise to a body of analytical and empirical work that has looked at its causes and costs, as well as at policy measures that could help mitigate its adverse effects (see eg Aghion et al., 2000 and 2001; Balino et al., 1999; Céspedes et al., 2004; Reinhart et al., 2003; Eichengreen and Hausmann, 1999 and 2005; Berkmen and Cavallo, 2009; Honohan and Shi, 2001; Broda and Levy Yeyati, 2006). Empirical work on this issue has yet been severely constrained by the absence of comprehensive and systematic data on unofficial dollarisation/euroisation, however (see eg Arteta, 2003a, 2003b). The literature traditionally highlights three main costs/risks associated with unofficial dollarisation/euroisation, namely: reduction in monetary policy autonomy/effectiveness; inability/ineffectiveness to act as a lender of last resort; and adverse currency mismatches that arise for unhedged borrowers when the domestic currency depreciates (see eg Levy Yeyati and Sturzenegger, 2003, for a survey of this literature). Although these costs are well-established in theory, existing empirical studies have provided mixed results as to whether they matter in practice, however. Several studies have indeed failed to find compelling evidence that the magnitude of these costs is significant and, in particular, that unofficially dollarised/euroised economies are more crisis-prone than other economies, or that crises are more severe in unofficially dollarised/euroised economies (see eg Arteta, 2003a, 2003b; Levy Yeyati, 2006; De Nicoló et al., 2003). The costs associated with dollarisation/euroisation may yet be visible only when crises are sufficiently severe. Hence, it could well be that past crises used in previous empirical studies might not have been of a significantly large magnitude to allow detecting these costs in the data. The Great Recession of 2007–2009, which is unrivalled in severity by any crisis since the Great Depression, offers therefore a potentially unique opportunity to reveal these costs and test whether they have significant real implications or not. The Great Recession can therefore be seen as an almost ‘natural experiment’ that could have made more visible the three main theoretical costs of dollarisation/euroisation which the literature traditionally highlights. It is this episode that this paper seeks to exploit in investigating whether unofficial dollarisation/euroisation acted as an amplifier of the global crisis of 2007–2009 and if so, through which channels. It builds on a novel data set on unofficial dollarisation/euroisation, notably loan dollarisation (ie foreign-currency lending), which has become the focus of current policy discussions, in emerging Europe notably. The paper aims to further deepen the literature on the cross-country incidence of the Great Recession of 2007–2009, while enhancing our understanding of the risks associated with unofficial dollarisation/euroisation. One of the paper's key contribution also consists in providing the first comprehensive data set on loan dollarisation for around 60 emerging economies from all main regions in the world (namely Latin America, Middle East, Africa, Emerging Europe and Asia), which is constructed from a range of national and international institutions sources. The empirical investigation is carried out in two steps. In the first step, we test whether unofficial dollarisation/euroisation acted as an amplifier of the Great Recession of 2007–2009 in a cross-section of around 60 emerging economies. We regress to that end the change in the real GDP growth rate between 2009 and 2007 on pre-crisis loan dollarisation/euroisation and a large set of control variables identified in the literature as being good predictors of the severity of the Great Recession. We perform a large number of sensitivity checks to test whether these results are robust to different metrics of crisis severity, samples, set of controls or estimation methodologies. In the second step, we turn to the analysis of the channels through which the costs of unofficial dollarisation/euroisation have been transmitted to the real economy, which we proxy through interaction terms between loan dollarisation and its three standard costs on domestic balance sheets (currency mismatches) and monetary policy (changes in policy rates and liquidity provision). The results suggest that unofficial dollarisation/euroisation was an important contributor to the severity of the crisis, once other of its well-established determinants are taken into account. According to the estimates, real GDP growth declined on average by around 0.84% point more in economies where loan dollarisation was 10% points higher. These results are robust to a number of sensitivity tests on the definition of crisis severity (ie capital outflows and stock market correction in 2007–2009), sample (ie including also fully dollarised economies and/or advanced economies), model specification or estimation methods (OLS, robust-to-outlier and Bayesian model averaging estimation). Moreover, we find that the adverse impact of dollarisation/euroisation has been transmitted through all the main channels traditionally highlighted in the literature, that is, currency mismatches, reduced monetary policy autonomy and limited lender of last resort ability, all of which became more binding constraints in the midst of the crisis. Assessing whether the Great Recession was more severe in unofficially dollarised/euroised economies than in other economies is also of relevance from a policy perspective. It helps shed some light on ongoing discussions on macro-prudential risks associated with potentially excessive lending in foreign currency in emerging economies, notably in Emerging Europe (eg Rancière et al., 2010a, 2010b; Zettelmeyer et al., 2010). It also allows to revisit a long-standing policy debate on the optimal conduct of monetary policy in unofficially dollarised economies in crisis times, which emerged during the Asian crisis. According to one view, emerging economy authorities should abstain from tightening monetary policy in crisis times, as this would only further deteriorate growth prospects and prevent the economy's recovery (eg Stiglitz, 2002; Furman and Stiglitz, 1998). According to another view, however, higher policy interest rates might be a temporary necessity in unofficially dollarised/euroised emerging economies in order to stabilise the exchange rate (Fischer, 1998). Failing to defend the currency, as the view goes, would unleash potentially destabilising effects due to currency mismatches that would ultimately hurt growth. The paper's finding that currency mismatches were a key transmission channel of the adverse impact of dollarisation/euroisation to the real economy is relevant to this debate and rather supportive of the latter Fischer view. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the theoretical motivations underlying the econometric specification. The subsequent section examines the data and presents some key stylised facts. The penultimate section reviews the baseline empirical results together with robustness and extensions. The final section concludes and draws policy implications.",4

The sovereign debt crisis that followed the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 has shown that advanced economies are not immune to cutbacks in external financing. Large and persistent current account deficits in a number of major advanced economies turned out to be closely linked to the build-up of domestic imbalances via credit and asset price booms and other vulnerabilities that until recently used to be mainly associated with developing countries. This suggests the importance of looking at the experience of both advanced and emerging economies when addressing the question of current account rebalancing. Most of the literature on external rebalancing has focused on current account reversals, that is, large reductions in deficits, mostly in EMEs (eg Milesi-Ferretti and Razin, 2000; Edwards, 2004; de Mello et al., 2011). Changes in surpluses have not received much attention, even though they are perhaps more important from the global perspective at the current juncture. This paper attempts to fill this gap: we study 285 episodes of macroeconomic adjustment to large changes in current account deficits and surpluses, using country-specific definitions of ‘large’ current account changes, which are based on the time series properties of such changes. Like the earlier literature, we find that current account deficits are persistent and that large reductions in deficits have negative effects on real economic activity. But we also find that large reductions in external surpluses result in better macroeconomic outcomes than large increases in surpluses. As the deficits and surpluses narrow and approach a certain threshold, there is a strong tendency for the process to reverse and for the imbalances to start widening again. Reflecting the spread of global finance, the threshold at which external financing becomes a binding constraint on the size of deficits seems to have risen over time. This implies that imbalances may now last longer and their reduction may have become more disruptive than in the past. Finally, we argue that a significant external rebalancing could be achieved if major economies implemented adjustment measures in line with their own recent experience. However, it is not clear if the incentives for individual countries – deficit countries, but perhaps even more so surplus countries – are strong enough to adopt the policies needed to achieve such rebalancing. The paper is organised as follows. The next section sets the stage by reviewing some stylised facts on global imbalances. The subsequent section describes the empirical approach and analyses large current account changes in a sample of 26 advanced and emerging market economies between 1980 and 2012. The last section concludes with a discussion of some implications of the results for the current debate on global rebalancing.",

From 2000 to 2006, house prices rose in most advanced countries. For example, they soared in the United States and other Anglo–Saxon systems, fuelled by financial innovations. In Spain, house prices were buoyed by easy credit conditions, namely, extended mortgage periods and record-low interest rates resulting from monetary easing and fierce inter-bank competition, increasing household incomes, strong employment growth, high foreign real estate investments, and demographic factors (explicitly record levels of immigration and the Spanish baby boom that increased household formation) (IMF, 2009). In the Netherlands, the rise in house prices was triggered by robust income growth and the pro-cyclical lending standards of the banks. In 2007, house prices started to fall, first in the United States and then elsewhere. It seems that house prices in many industrial countries follow trends in the United States, with a lag of at least 6 months and up to 2 years (Deutsche Bank, 2010). Rollercoaster house prices are often seen as a major cause of the current global financial crisis and recession and have been commonly considered a threat to global prosperity since the Great Depression (Loungani, 2010). It is, therefore, important to understand the drivers of real estate prices, as doing so would contribute to the preservation of macroeconomic and financial stability, and facilitate household consumption and saving/investment decisions. In this context, the present study examines real house price dynamics in two groups of industrialized countries: one belonging to the Euro area, the other to the Anglo–Saxon group. In particular, the analysis focuses on the five largest Euro countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands) and on the two largest Anglo–Saxon economies (the United Kingdom and the United States). This would help to investigate common features and broad differences in house price dynamics across countries. In the two country groups, real house prices have shown peculiar trends. Looking at their development from a historical perspective, four striking aspects appear from a graphical inspection (Figure 1). First, there have been periodic run-ups in the real house prices of these countries during the past 40 years. This means that real house prices show cyclical movements. Second, the size of real price increases during the period from 1997–2007 was impressive. Afterward, the global recession induced significant price drops. Third, price hikes and falls occurred simultaneously across countries. Put differently, real house prices have a tendency to co-move and to be highly synchronized. Fourth, Germany is a special case: real house prices have been rather stable; in particular, modest price movements and even drops have been observed over time. The pattern of declining real house prices in Germany can be ascribed to the interaction of several factors. These include the excessive supply of houses that resulted from the construction boom that followed German unification (Terrones and Otrok, 2004), slowdowns in population growth (Ahearne et al., 2005), restrictive financing conditions including the absence of ‘innovative’ mortgages product, which contributed to hold back demand for houses (Westerheide, 2010), and the moderate growth in real disposable income (Kholodilin et al., 2010). Evolution of real house prices 1970=100Note: House prices are deflated by CPI and then normalized to equal 100 in 1970. Source: Elaborations on Bank for International Settlements Table 1 offers more evidence on real house price variations at an average annual rate. The Anglo–Saxon countries registered real price growth from 1970 to 2007. The same trend holds true for France. Italy and Spain have instead registered a real price contraction during the decade 1991–2000, while the Netherlands experienced a small drop in 1981–1990. During the years 2001–2007, house price growth was particularly strong in the United Kingdom, France, and Spain, with an average annual growth rate, in real terms, of 8.8%, 9.10% and 9.84%, respectively. Lesser increases have been registered in the Netherlands, Italy, and the United States, with average annual growth rates of about 3% and 6%. The fact that the United States belongs to the latter group is significant, given that the financial storm, which first struck the United States in August 2007, has its roots in the biggest house and credit bubble in history (The Economist, 11.10.2008). Nevertheless, the gap between the first and second group narrows if we consider the percentage price increase between 2005 and 2007. Germany is the only country to show counter-cyclical price developments. In general, the synchronization of price movements across most of the countries has induced some observers to believe that the house price boom is a bubble (Hilbers et al., 2001; Klyuev, 2008; Girouard et al., 2006). Thus, the house price run-ups may partly be driven by factors that are unrelated to economic fundamentals, especially the record-low interest rates registered in the new millennium. This study thus tries to shed light on fundamentals and underlying factors that cause price fluctuations within an error correction mechanism. Technically, it introduces, in addition to the traditional triggers of real house prices, such as interest rates and disposable income, an unobserved component in the form of a time-varying trend, in order to pick up on the stochastic un-modeled behaviors of the series. Underlying factors could include economic elements that are unknown, unobservable, unquantifiable, or not easy to compute, such as structural changes in markets (eg land use restrictions) or in the level of government interventions in markets that are difficult to measure (eg homeowner's interest deducibility from taxes, grants for first time home buyers, and cuts in rental properties’ taxes), and those factors of ‘irrational exuberance’ or changing tastes. Most studies have estimated equilibrium prices for house and their deviation from fundamentals without providing information with respect to the underlying unobserved drivers. This study goes one step further than other studies by capturing the veiled factors that influence price development in the form of stochastic trends. This is done to characterize unmodeled long-run real house price movements, reduce the residuals in estimations, and better gauge the elasticity of the fundamentals. If stochastic trends are appropriate, but are not explicitly modeled, their effects will be picked up indirectly by time trends and lags on the variables. This can lead to a proliferation of lags that have no economic meaning, and which are subject to common factors and problems of inference associated with unit roots (Harvey and Shephard, 1993). In addition, the omission of important long-run information implies that the long-run equation is misspecified, thus raising the problem of spurious regression and omitted variables or measurement errors. The inclusion of the unobserved time series components adds an extra dimension to the interpretation and specification of certain aspects of the price dynamics. The rest of this article is organized as follows. The next section presents a literature review of the determinants of house prices. The section ‘Econometric methodology’ describes data and methodology. The section after that, ‘Estimation of House Prices’, presents the results, and the final section concludes.",13

In more recent times the term has been applied to factories operated by developed-country MNCs or by their subcontractors in developing countries. Both the scholarly and the popular literature have used the term ‘sweatshop’ pejoratively when writing about conditions in such establishments, arguing that working conditions, wages and worker protection in such establishments are below either labor market standards in the host countries or inadequate when judged in the broader context of an adequate subsistence wage.Footnote 1 In this study, we examine worker attitudes in two firms that have been characterized as sweatshops by the National Labor Committee (NLC), one of the more influential anti-sweatshop organizations (National Labour Committee (NLC) and CEADEL, 2007, NLC and CEADEL, 2009). This study surveys workers at two firms that have been identified as exemplifying sweatshop conditions by the NLC to evaluate how outsourcing of labor-intensive activities to third-world countries has contributed to the working conditions and wages in these countries compared with the alternatives faced by the workers, to evaluate if the mix of compensation reflects employee preferences, and to evaluate how company responses to protests have impacted worker satisfaction. While our study does not support the characterization of these firms as sweatshops, we use this term for them so as not to deflect any criticism of the firms by changing the semantics of the discussion. A substantial scholarly literature has developed debating the relative merits of sweatshops. However, a substantial gap in the empirical literature on working conditions remains. On the theoretical level, scholars have questioned whether the background conditions necessary for textbook economics to work are present in sweatshop labor markets, and they have attempted to identify economic mechanisms that may not make the sweatshop labor demand curve downward sloping (Arnold and Bowie, 2003, 2007; Arnold and Hartman, 2005, 2006; Arnold, 2010; Miller, 2003; Pollin et al., 2004). Other scholars have argued that these critics are mistaken that the lack of perfect information, possibility of efficiency wages, consumer demand for ethical goods, or presence of high profits does not undermine standard economic predictions (Powell, 2006; Sollars and Englander, 2007; Powell and Zwolinski, 2011).Footnote 2 On the empirical front, a group of international trade economists was quick to point out that multinational firms pay more than do domestic firms in third-world countries (ACIT, 2000, also see Brown et al., 2004). However, a rival group, Scholars Against Sweatshop Labor (SASL), circulated a letter pointing out that ‘While this [the fact that MNC's pay more] is true, it does not speak to the situation in which most garments are produced throughout the world – which is by firms subcontracted by multinational corporations, not the MNCs themselves’ (SASL, 2001). Economists had made comparisons of a single sweatshop job to some other less desirable alternative such as scavenging or agricultural employment, but little systematic evidence existed comparing sweatshop wages with domestic alternatives until Powell and Skarbek (2006). They documented 43 individual cases of sweatshop wages in 11 countries that were reported in US popular press sources.Footnote 3 They found that the reported sweatshop wages were higher than average national income in 9 of the 11 countries. This paper uses survey data from Guatemalan workers to empirically address the claims of the NLC. We organized our survey to address three hypotheses. The first is that workers choose to work in these factories because both the wages and working conditions are better than the available alternatives. Second, although total compensation is low by US standards, how the mix of compensation is divided between wages and other working conditions largely reflects employee preferences. Third, activism from the NLC failed to improve the lives of the workers in the firm they protested. Skarbek et al. (2012) is the most closely related scholarly study to ours. They investigated how El Salvadoran apparel industry working conditions compared with the workers’ other available alternatives. They interviewed 31 workers at two factories on a range of questions related to working conditions, wages, and other alternatives. They found that workers generally thought their wages and working conditions had improved relative to their previous employment. Their results were more mixed when workers were asked how their jobs compared with those of their peers. Most workers’ jobs were superior to that which their parents had held, and the vast majority of workers who had children were able to send them to school with their factory earnings. The open-ended interview technique was useful for extracting a range of information from workers but also limited their ability to make direct comparisons between interviews and to draw quantitative conclusions. In the following section we outline how our firms were selected and the specific questions were chosen to allow us to directly investigate the hypotheses set out above. We also provide descriptive statistics for the data. The subsequent section is our main contribution and contains our survey results organized around the above three hypotheses. The last section concludes.",8

In the process, the Gini index of inequality rose from one of the lowest in the world to a level higher than that of the United States (Brainerd, 1998). The headcount index of poverty, although measures of this vary, grew by a factor of about three (Klugman and Braithwaite, 1998); there was a general deterioration in health, extensively surveyed by Stillman (2006); and even suicide rates experienced a sharp upward trend (Brainerd, 2001). Political consequences of transition were manifested in miners’ strikes in the Kuznets Basin in 1989 and 1990 and – as Russia's shock therapy gained momentum – in other forms of collective action such as street protests and outbreaks of industrial unrest. In the process of this adjustment, the traditionally powerful and centralized Russian state underwent extreme stresses, and through much of its early transition to democratic forms of government stood ‘on the precipice of state failure’ (Giuliano, 2006, p. 276).Footnote 1
 The wave of public protest following the recession of 2009, and, more recently, the general election of December 2011 have reawakened interest in the modalities and dynamics of political protest, and their interrelationship with the stability of government. This paper, therefore, attempts to contribute to survey-based research on political protest by identifying and analyzing influences on individuals’ willingness to participate in protest activities. We focus on the Russian financial crisis of August 1998 and model the impact of economic and welfare factors on protest intentions. We test the model by examining the impact on individual behavior of these determinants. Empirically, the results show that the likelihood of protest relates powerfully to economic discontent – similar to what McAllister and White (1994) found. The structure of this paper is as follows. The next section gives a background to political economy, protest and social issues. In the subsequent section, we present the model. In the next section, we introduce the empirical framework. In the latter section, we describe the data set and define the used variables. Empirical results are presented in the penultimate section. The final section concludes.",1

55,3,Comparative Economic Studies,17 January 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2012.44,EMU's Problems: Asymmetric Shocks or Asymmetric Behavior?,September 2013,Andrea Boltho,Wendy Carlin,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The literature on common currency areas has, since its Mundellian beginnings, stressed the danger of asymmetric shocks for countries participating in a monetary union. These, it was feared, could arise from changes in technology, as in Mundell's original article (Mundell, 1961), from shifts in tastes (Kenen, 1969), or, conceivably, from changes in the terms of trade. Little attention seems to have been devoted to differences in the behavior of economic agents between countries, possibly because of the dominant influence of the ‘representative agent’ model. Thus, many of the critical appraisals of European Monetary Union (EMU) have concentrated on the potential for idiosyncratic disturbances of this kind in an area that, unlike the United States, had little intercountry labor mobility and no common fiscal policy. Early quantitative research, for instance, pointed out that Europe's periphery, in particular, had suffered from large asymmetric shocks in comparison to Europe's core, let alone to United States regions (Bayoumi and Eichengreen, 1993). Absent interest and exchange rates, it was plausibly argued that adjustment to shocks could turn out to be very costly in terms of output and employment. Partly because of this, fears were even expressed that the imposition of a common monetary policy might bring a resurgence of conflict in Europe (Feldstein, 1997). At the time, extreme opinions such as these were dismissed as alarmist, if not preposterous, yet they now look ominously prescient in the light of the recent tensions that have arisen between, for instance, Germany and Greece. A minority strand in the literature had earlier also expressed some worries about the possibility that private or public sector agents in member countries might follow divergent, or asymmetric, behavior. According to one view, differing institutions and, in particular, different trade unions could generate different inflation trends (Fleming, 1971). In a related vein, it was feared that countries might pursue diverging macroeconomic policies reflecting their different preferences towards, for instance, unemployment and inflation (Willett and Tower, 1970). These ideas, however, were not much pursued in the 1990s discussion on Europe, in part because it was felt that German-style macroeconomic orthodoxy had been embraced by all EMU's potential members through the explicit acceptance of the Maastricht treaty criteria and their aims of low inflation and sound public finance (Boltho, 1998). As for wage-setting, it was implicitly assumed either that the necessary changes in behavior would follow automatically from the change in the rules of the game that came with a single currency, or that governments would deregulate labor markets, allowing market forces to keep cost inflation in line with the area's inflation target. A decade or more down the line, the project is in trouble and this trouble seems to stem, after all, more from asymmetric behavior than it does from asymmetric shocks. The latter do not seem to have been particularly severe. By far the biggest shock the area suffered from was the common shock of the so-called ‘Great Recession’. This had some differentiated effects across the area: Spain and Ireland were hit by the collapse in construction activity; Germany and Finland suffered because of the large weight of manufacturing in their economies, etc, but looking at overall outcomes, every member country registered post-war record declines in its GDP. Divergences in behavior, on the other hand, have been quite striking. The first was the way households, firms and governments in different countries responded to the introduction of the single monetary policy across the Eurozone. There was large private sector borrowing in some countries stimulated by low interest rates. In some others, excessive borrowing took place in the public sector. An additional important source of divergence came from different trends in wage inflation and in productivity growth across the area, which have led to the opening of large and persistent gaps in international competitiveness. Thirdly, and more arguably, standards of governance already quite dissimilar at the outset, rather than converging, have further diverged. These various differences seem to have become particularly acute between what could be loosely called a Northern and a Southern Eurozone. To simplify, in what follows, the Northern Eurozone will be defined as Germany, plus the Benelux, Austria and Finland, while the Southern one will encompass Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal. France and Ireland will be excluded, the former because it is, perhaps, not fully Northern, and the latter because it is, obviously, not Southern. Many of the arguments developed below would, however, be equally valid if the two economies were to be included in the North and South, respectively. The area totals that will be shown will usually be based on GDP weighted averages, thus giving a good deal of importance to Germany in the North and Italy in the South, but unweighted averages in virtually all the dimensions that will be looked at present broadly similar outcomes. The text that follows will briefly go through the excessive borrowing, competitiveness and governance divergences that were mentioned above, before concluding on a note that, hopefully, is unduly pessimistic about the long-run future of the project. According to many observers, the obvious major culprit behind the Eurozone's problems today was past fiscal incontinence, particularly in peripheral countries. There is an obvious element of truth in this view. If one looks at today's budget deficits or public sector debt positions, it is clear that Southern Europe is in a much worse position than is the North (Figure 1). And to some extent this has been due to lack of discipline by the public sector in the Eurozone's first decade, ie, before the crisis. Portugal and especially Greece clearly ignored the calls for rigor. Thus, the scope that falling long-term interest rates on entry to the Eurozone gave them to painlessly reduce debt was misused, instead, to raise expenditure. Italy did not misbehave to quite the same extent but, under the very unfortunate long rule of Berlusconi, it also frittered away some of that windfall. The country's contrast with Belgium is particularly striking. When the euro came into being in 1999, public debt ratios were very similar in the two economies, namely 121 per cent of GDP in Belgium and 128 per cent in Italy. By 2008, they had been reduced to 91 per cent in Belgium, but to only 113 per cent in Italy, even though long rates had fallen much more sharply in the latter country. On the other hand, public debt in Spain had declined until 2007, as it had in Ireland, and by a good deal more than in, for instance, the ‘virtuous’ Netherlands or Finland. Budget deficits and public debtSource: Oxford Economics Database Looking at the long-run trends since EMU's inception confirms this more mixed picture. Between 1999 and 2008, the South's aggregate deficit and debt positions did not behave very differently from those in the North. Indeed, it was the North that swung into substantial deficit between 2000 and 2003, the year in which Germany, together with France, broke the Growth and Stability Pact conditions. It is really only in the aftermath of the crisis that the performance of the South on debt and deficits has worsened substantially in both absolute and relative terms. The most important proximate reason for this has to do with a worse economic growth record. The negative impact of the Great Recession on output was larger, and the subsequent recovery has, so far at least, been more subdued in the South than in the North. Thus, the structural budget deficit for 2011, as estimated by the OECD (2012), is less than 2 percentage points of GDP greater in the South than in the North, as against a gap of over 4 percentage points between the two areas’ actual deficits. However, why would recession have been both more severe and recovery less robust in the South than in the North? Earlier public sector profligacy obviously plays some role as it has now forced countries such as Greece and Portugal, in particular, into a very restrictive fiscal stance. But other, and probably more important, reasons stem from differences in the behavior not so much of the public but of the private sector. One of these, the growing loss of competitiveness of Southern tradeable production, will be looked at below. A second and related one has to do with the huge incentive to incur debt that financial liberalization, falling interest rates and rising house prices gave to both households and corporations in, particularly, Spain, but also Ireland, through much of the early 2000s. Between 1999 and 2008, for instance, Spain's ratio of household and non financial corporations’ debt to GDP rose from 100 to 220 per cent. But the trend was widespread: for the South as a whole, this ratio rose by some 75 percentage points over the period; for the North, the equivalent figure is of only 6 percentage points, or 25 points for the unweighted total (Figure 2). Private sector indebtednessSource: Oxford Economics Database With the onset of the common shock of the Great Recession, house prices in many countries fell, or even collapsed, and credit dried up. Households and companies were thus forced into retrenchment. The ensuing sharp swings back into financial surplus by the private sector inevitably led to offsetting swings into deficit by the public one, plus some less pronounced changes in the external account. In the South, for instance, between 2007 and 2010 the financial balance of the private sector went from a deficit equivalent to 5 per cent of GDP to a surplus of 2.3 per cent of GDP, with the public sector's balance deteriorating by just over 6 percentage points. In the North, the equivalent swings were of 2.7 percentage points for the private sector and of −4.1 points for the public sector. These shifts into deficits had nothing to do with fiscal profligacy, but merely reflected the working of the automatic stabilizers, plus some countercyclical efforts. Had such changes not been allowed, the Great Recession would have turned into a twenty-first century version of the Great Depression. The upshot of all this is clear. A major reason for differences in today's fiscal positions of North and South lies in the much greater willingness that Southern households and companies seem to have had over the early years of the decade in incurring what turned out to be unsustainable debt levels. Falling interest rates were one reason, lax supervision of the banking sector another. Yet, the Northern countries must also share some of the blame. For every willing borrower, be this the Greek government or a Spanish household, there must be a willing lender, and Northern banks went overboard in extending credit to the European periphery. Ideally, the private sectors in the South should now gradually reduce their indebtedness, with the public sectors being ready to continue running large deficits as the process unwinds. Unfortunately, however, both the EU Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) as well as Germany, are insisting on a rapid reduction in budget deficits by imposing extraordinary austerity on Greece and Portugal, and strongly urging it on Spain and Italy. Does all this threaten EMU? It could, as many have argued. The private sector's deleveraging strengthens the ongoing recession and raises public sector deficits and debts. This, in turn, generates additional calls for austerity that further worsen the macroeconomic picture. Greece's debt restructuring and the ECB's large liquidity provisions temporarily calmed the waters in early 2012, but long-run fears for, in particular, Spain, and increasingly also Italy, have not gone away. Default in a member country does not necessarily mean exit from EMU, but for a defaulting country devaluing the currency could be a powerful short-run growth stimulant, given that competitiveness has sharply declined across Southern Europe since EMU's inception. And if one country leaves the common currency, contagion may well spread to others. Absent a concerted ECB strategy to buy sovereign debt and prevent bond spreads from rising, supported by all member countries and, especially, by Germany, EMU could well unravel. The South's falling competitiveness is the second divergence that was mentioned above. Since 1999, there have been significant differences between trends in the Northern and in the Southern Eurozones in the evolution of wages and productivity (Figure 3). Compensation levels per employee rose by over 40 per cent in the South between 1999 and 2011, as against some 27 per cent in the North. The most notable development was in Germany where wages grew by less than 20 per cent over the period, as opposed to the 50 per cent or so increases in, for instance, Spain or Greece. Elsewhere, however, the differences are not as marked, and on an unweighted basis the cumulative gap between North and South shrinks from some 13 to 6 percentage points. Italian wage growth, for instance, was relatively modest and well below what was recorded in, among others, the Netherlands or Finland. Wage and productivity growthSource: EU Commission Yet, even modest wage growth was not always warranted, as productivity, defined as GDP per employed, grew by more than 10 per cent over the period in the North, while it only rose by some 3½ per cent in the South. Here, by far the worst performer was Italy, a country in which productivity, in 2011, stood 1½ per cent below its level in 1999. It is this contrast between what happened to productivity and to compensation levels in what is, after all, a monetary union that is particularly surprising. Under Bretton Woods, wages rose significantly more rapidly in the poorer countries of Western Europe, but those rapid increases were at the time almost fully matched by similarly above-average productivity increases. Given, in addition, some exchange rate changes along the way, with, for instance, Germany and the Netherlands revaluing and Spain devaluing, this ensured catch-up on the more advanced economies. Since EMU's creation, it is economic divergence, rather than convergence, that has occurred between poorer and richer countries (Figure 4). This matters as, in contrast to what happens to regional divergences within countries, there are no discretionary, or even automatic, mechanisms that redistribute income across the Monetary Union. Convergence and divergenceSource: Basic Data from the conference Board Total Economy Databased Evidence for the changes in competitiveness comes from estimates of real exchange rates made for the manufacturing sector by both the EU Commission, for intra-Euro trends (http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/competitiveness/index_en.htm), and the IMF, for trends vis-à-vis Euro and non-Euro countries together (IMF, International Financial Statistics). These come to similar conclusions. Between 1999 and 2011, the competitiveness of the Southern Eurozone may have deteriorated by some 25–30 per cent relative to that of the North, whereas the opposite had happened over the previous decade and a half. And not surprisingly, according to OECD estimates (OECD, Economic Outlook, various issues), Southern Europe after having gained shares on world markets for its exports of goods and services between 1986, the earliest year for which figures on the same basis are available, and 1998, suffered significant losses over the period 1999–2011. The Northern Eurozone, on the other hand, broadly maintained its world market share in the earlier period, but achieved some gains in the latter. Wage bargaining institutions have always differed across Europe. Countries like Germany and Finland have unions that are much more conscious of external constraints than countries like Italy or Spain (Carlin, 2012). The industrial relations literature has provided some evidence on which wage-setting systems can deliver a real exchange rate consistent with sustainable external balance: either so called ‘pattern bargaining’, in which the lead in wage negotiations is taken by an exposed sector union, or ‘peak level coordination’ bargaining, in which it is a national all-encompassing union that sets wage aims (Traxler and Brandl, 2011). Within the Eurozone there would seem to be a clear split between Germany, the Benelux countries, Austria and Finland on the one hand, all of which benefit from either one or the other of these two wage-setting mechanisms and in which there is a high degree of control over lower-tier wage settlements, and Italy, Portugal, and Spain on the other, in which there is no mechanism to produce wage increases that are consistent with maintaining competitiveness. As long as there was an ample potential for catch-up and exchange rates were flexible, this did not matter. With more limited catch-up possibilities and a fixed nominal exchange rate, the upshot has been sharp changes in international competitiveness. In addition, persistently higher Southern inflation reduced real interest rates and reinforced easy credit conditions. This increased the divergence between thriving non-tradeable sectors and buoyant domestically driven growth in the South, and the greater reliance of the North, and especially Germany, on export-led growth. Calls for deregulating rigid labor markets and weakening unions in countries without coordinated wage-setting were frequent following the original OECD Jobs Report (OECD, 1994). These policy proposals were, however, mainly focused on reducing unemployment rather than on the implications of labor market arrangements for competitiveness. Neither the OECD nor the European Commission highlighted the particular urgency of this last point for countries about to enter a currency union. The implicit assumption appears to have been that wage and price setters would adjust automatically to the rigors implied by the removal of the devaluation option. This did not happen and labor market rigidities continued unabated. In the post-crisis period, features such as job protection for established workers, generous redundancy provisions and working hour regulations have been reflected, in countries such as Italy and Spain, in rapidly deteriorating employment conditions, especially for young people (Brada and Signorelli, 2012). Further indirect evidence confirming the divergence in competitiveness comes from developments in the current accounts of the two areas. Between 1980 and 1999, according to the Oxford Economics Database, the current balance of the Northern countries was in rough equilibrium, that of the South in a small deficit equivalent to 1 per cent of GDP. Since 2000, the former current account has gone into surplus to the tune of nearly 4 per cent of GDP, the latter into an equivalently large deficit. In 2009–2011, despite extremely weak demand pressures and very high unemployment, the South suffered from a current account deficit equivalent to some 4½ per cent of its GDP. Does all this threaten EMU? An often-heard argument is that current account imbalances do not matter in a monetary union and, indeed, nobody seems to mind whether California runs a current account surplus or deficit vis-à-vis the Mid-West. Unlike a fixed exchange rate system in which a deficit country sees its official reserves dwindle, or its public indebtedness rise, unless private capital flows fill the gap, in a monetary union the financing occurs automatically. The central banks of deficit countries provide the necessary coverage that is then credited, at the ECB, to the central banks of surplus countries. Yet, within EMU, worries have begun to be expressed, in particular in Germany (Sinn and Wollmershäuser, 2011), by the accumulation of such balances. Although over the first years of EMU, a Spanish deficit would have been financed by private capital flows from Germany or elsewhere, since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008, private flows have dried up and it is, de facto, public flows that now fill the gap. The Bundesbank, for instance, has over the last few years amassed large such claims against other member countries – by Summer 2012 these amounted to nearly 30 per cent of German GDP (University of Osnabrück, http://www.iew.uniosnabrueck.de/en/8959.htm). In the circumstances, it is understandably worried that, in case of defections, it could suffer significant losses. On its own, this is unlikely to lead to breakdown, though it may well cause frictions. The large divergences in competitiveness could, however, have much more severe consequences. If uncorrected, they would lead to growing gaps in growth and/or unemployment rates, unless they were to be offset by transfers from richer regions/countries. This is, of course, what happens, at least to some extent, in Europe's preexisting monetary unions. Be it in Belgium, in Germany, in Italy or in Spain, the central government redistributes resources from, say, the more competitive regions of Flanders, West Germany, the Centre-North and Catalonia to the less competitive Wallonia, East Germany, the Mezzogiorno and Andalusia, respectively. These transfers have hardly ever been able to solve the competitiveness problem, though East Germany may be an exception to this rule (Carlin, 2011), but they sustain demand and usually prevent the gaps in living standards from growing. As mentioned above, such mechanisms, however, are absent in the Eurozone. Restoring competitiveness in Southern Europe is, thus, imperative, but, in the absence of a nominal exchange rate instrument, requires, bar an unlikely sharp rise in Northern labor costs, either rapid growth in productivity and/or lasting and significant wage moderation. Liberalizing reforms, as those that Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are at present attempting, could have some favorable effect on productivity and labor market rigidities, but past experience shows that such effects tend to be small and take a long time to come through. Wage moderation is also occurring, but in a world of low growth and low inflation the need is for significant cuts in nominal and real wages that may only be possible in the presence of substantial increases in unemployment. In other words, restoring competitiveness without the help of the exchange rate could be an extremely difficult and costly process. Returning to national currencies would be a strategy obviously surrounded by huge risks, as changes in the nominal exchange rate often fail in leading to changes in the real one, but given that continuing austerity is highly unlikely to either reduce budget deficits and debt ratios, or to ensure a return to external competitiveness, let alone restore growth, it may increasingly appear as the lesser of all evils. The biggest sources of tensions in the single currency area outlined so far come from Southern Europe. Yet, arguably, the North too may feel that continuing friction with the South might militate in favor of a more skeptical attitude towards EMU. It is, of course, true that the competitiveness gains that the North has achieved over the last decade or so have hugely helped its macroeconomic performance. Yet public opinion has often been swayed not by estimated economic gains, but by the costs of transfers, real or imagined, through the EU budget and of the rescue packages for Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Hostility in the South towards what is felt is Northern arrogance has been increasingly matched by discontent in the North about what is felt is Southern inefficiency or downright incompetence as well as ingratitude. These diverging public attitudes raise a separate issue that has not been given much importance in the literature, but that could be pointing to a third area of tension between North and South. Since ever, governance standards between the two regions have been quite different, largely because of the very different social and political histories of the countries concerned. And, very broadly, most observers would argue that these governance standards are somewhat higher in Northern Europe than in the South, be this in areas such as trust, transparency, sense of civic responsibility, absence of corruption or in democratic accountability, etc. This, of course, was well known when EMU was launched and it was clearly felt that it need not be an obstacle to a common monetary policy nor, hopefully, to a greater long-run integration. Implicitly, it was probably also felt that increasing integration would, through demonstration effects, lead to the gradual convergence of Southern to Northern standards, as, on the whole, has probably occurred over the first 40 years of Western European integration and has clearly occurred over the last 20 years of integration between Eastern and Western Europe. Yet, the EMU area appears, since its inception, to have seen a number of trends going in the opposite direction. Some of these cover purely economic variables. Thus, economic reforms that in earlier decades had brought Southern Europe closer to the North appear to have stalled during the last decade, judging from the ‘Economic Freedom’ indices produced by the Fraser Institute or the Heritage Foundation (Figure 5). If anything, gaps, rather than declining, appear to have increased. Some indirect confirmation of this comes from the World Bank's rankings of its ‘Ease of doing business’ indicator across the world. In 2005, the first year available, the North's ranking averaged 21 and the South's 60 out of over 170 countries. By 2011, the North's position had worsened marginally to 23 and the South had fallen to 70, though it should be noted that unweighted averages show no such pronounced changes. Reform fatigue may well be a possible reason for such trends. And it may be partly because of this, that the attractiveness to Foreign Direct Investment(FDI) that in the 1980s and early 1990s was higher in the South than in the North, has declined in the 2000s. Despite high labor costs and little scope for economic catch-up, the North attracted significantly more FDI in 1999–2011 than did the South. The opposite had been the case in 1980–1998. In the earlier period, inflows were equivalent to 1.1 and 0.9 of Southern and Northern GDP, respectively; since the Euro was created, the figures have been 2.1 and 4.9 per cent. Trends in economic reformSources: Fraser Institute; Heritage Foundation Equally significant may have been similar trends in some broader governance indicators. Transparency International has for a number of years published a well regarded index of ‘Perceptions of Corruption’. In 1990–2000, at EMU's inception, this stood at 7.8 in the North and at 5.5 in the South, with higher values denoting less corruption. This finding may not be that surprising. What is more surprising is that by 2010–2011, the former index had risen to 8 and the latter had declined to 4.8. Unweighted averages give virtually identical results. Divergence, rather than shrinking, increased. Turning to estimates of the shadow economy (Schneider and Buehn, 2009; Schneider, 2011), these show declines in its share of GDP over the period in both North and South, from 16 and 24 to 13 and 21 per cent, respectively, but there is no reduction in the large gap, as one might have hoped for. The World Bank has in recent years produced data on six governance indicators: presence of the rule of law, control of corruption, regulatory quality, government effectiveness, voice and accountability, and political stability (World Bank, 2011). Not only are the Northern countries’ scores higher than those of the South in all six of these dimensions, but the gap between the two areas also rose between 1998–2000 and 2009–2010 in all six. The relative absence of the rule of law in Southern Europe, if compared to the North, is particularly striking and the relative worsening in performance particularly worrying (Figure 6). Other indicators often point to similarly divergent developments. Governance standardsSource: World Bank Does all this threaten EMU? On the surface, it clearly does not. Policy makers may be worried by the public finance and/or competitiveness trends discussed above. Governance has never really been at the center of discussions in Brussels or Frankfurt. Yet, if some sort of fiscal union is in the making, if plans for growing integration go ahead, if the pooling of sovereignty continues, and all this happens, as might well be expected in the light of past trends, with little democratic consultation, it is not impossible that citizens in Northern countries may object. As it is, trust by Northerners in Southerners is not much in evidence, as suggested by earlier Eurobarometer surveys (Guiso et al., 2004). When asked whether they trusted other countries’ people strongly, 21 per cent of Northeners felt they could trust other Northeners, but only 10 per cent felt similarly about Southerners. These results predate EMU and there is no way of knowing how perceptions have changed. But in recent times, at least, the rise of support for Eurosceptic parties in Finland, in the Netherlands and in Austria, as well as increasing German resentment at Greece, do not augur well for Euroharmony. Although all this does not imply that breakdown is imminent, it points to a danger for greater European integration. It is true that differences in governance exist within countries. Italy is probably the best known West European example of an economy that suffers from sharp divisions in productivity levels, huge competitiveness gaps and very different behavioral standards between North and South. Civic consciousness, for instance, seems lacking in Southern Italy relative to the Centre-North (Putnam et al., 1993; Ichino and Maggi, 2000; Guiso and Pinotti, 2011); the underground economy may, according to tentative estimates, be nearly twice as large in the Mezzogiorno than it is in the rest of the country (Bovi and Castellucci, 2001); differences in government effectiveness between the two areas (Arpaia et al., 2009) may also be more pronounced than those found by the World Bank for the Northern and Southern Eurozones, though this variable may be differently measured; the same is even truer for crimes such as murder, whose incidence differs little across Europe, but differs massively within Italy (Boltho, 2010), etc. Yet, and despite the rise of a separatist political party, these long-standing differences have not threatened the country's union, which was, after all, the outcome of a prolonged process of, often enthusiastic, nation-building, involving several wars. In addition, of course, Italian monetary union also benefited from a high degree of labour mobility and, since the war, from massive transfers from North to South, features deemed crucial by the optimum currency area literature. The Eurozone, by contrast, lacks both these characteristics and is, in addition, a fragile bureaucratic creation that has hardly ever raised much popular enthusiasm anywhere. If standards of behavior across the area remain as different as they have been in the past, let alone diverge further, the project may run the risk of popular backlashes, if not immediately, then over the long run.",12
55,3,Comparative Economic Studies,28 February 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2013.2,Lessons from a Comparative Analysis of Financial Crises,September 2013,Roberto Frenkel,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Cesaratto (2012) and Bagnai (2012) have developed analyses of the Eurozone crisesFootnote 1 making use of our description of the macroeconomic dynamics that precedes the crises in emerging markets (as presented in Frenkel and Rapetti, 2009). On the other hand, I became very interested in the comparison between the macroeconomic performances of the Eurozone and the emerging market countries in early 2010, when the Greek sovereign risk premium started to rise. In a short paper (Frenkel, 2010) I discussed the similarities and differences of country risk premiums between both sets of countries. In this article I attempt a broader comparison, taking my own analysis of crises in emerging markets as the point of departure. This perspective could be useful to shed some additional light into the understanding of this important issue. The article is presented in two parts. The first part presents a comparative analysis of a set of financial crises that occurred in the period of financial globalization, which lasted from the late 60s of the past century up to present times. The second part focuses on the recent Argentine experience of crisis, foreign debt default and recovery (late 1990s and early 2000s). The first part is presented in two sections. In the section ‘Comparing financial crises in the globalization period’, I compare the macroeconomic behavior of some of the Eurozone economies (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy: GIPSI countries) with that of a set of emerging market economies that experienced financial crises in the second period of financial globalization. I focus on the stylized facts of the critical processes, looking for commonalities and differences. My first point is that all the mentioned experiences have in common a cyclical macroeconomic dynamic, which resembles that originally described and explained by Hyman Minsky. This observation allows me to separately analyze and compare the booming phases (ie the formation of the crises) on the one hand, and the second contractive phases (ie the processes that lead to the systemic financial crisis) on the other. I show that analogous events put in motion the first phase and that similar dynamics are observed in this phase in both sets of countries. I conclude that the same factors (ie capital inflows and swift private credit expansion) have planted the seeds (ie the appreciation of the real exchange rate and the generation of important current account deficits) of the turning point and the second phase of the cycle in both emerging market and the mentioned Eurozone economies. With regard to the second phase, the comparison focuses on the exchange risk and the risk of default of the debts issued in the first phase. The inexistence of a lender of last resort in international currency for the emerging market economies makes their behavior differ from that of the Eurozone countries. In the former, the exchange risk and the risk of default of the debts in international currency (both private and public) issued in the first phase have a key role in the dynamics leading to the financial and currency crises. In contrast, in the Eurozone cases, the main source of negative feedback effects in the second phase of the cycle is the risk of default of public debts. These effects result from the reluctance of the European Central Bank (ECB) to play the role of lender of last resort of Eurozone governments. However, I also observe that the GIPSI economies would be trapped in contexts of debt deflation and low competitiveness even if the ECB would have acted as lender of last resort of the governments. Next, the comparison focuses on the pro-cyclical fiscal policies implemented in common by emerging market and Eurozone countries in the second phase of the cycle. I explore the political economy of these policies, which privilege the issuing of signals to the financial markets above measures to foster the recuperation of growth and employment. The Keynesian beauty contest provides an appropriate framework for this analysis. The section ‘Lessons from the comparative analysis of crises’ focuses on the lessons that can be drawn from the comparative analysis of crises. One conclusion of the comparison is that the macroeconomic policies implemented by emerging market countries in the 2000s suggest that they have learned from their past experience with crises, whereas the monetary and financial design of the Eurozone and the policies currently implemented have made the same mistakes that emerging market countries have committed in the first 30 years of the modern financial globalization, up to the late 1990s. A brief description of crisis resolution experiences in emerging market economies follows. Successful resolutions included devaluation in all cases (with the exception of the Argentine Tequila crisis in 1995). In most cases the resolution included massive international rescue packages or the substantial alleviation of the debt burden together with the refinancing of private debts in favorable terms subsidized with significant fiscal resources. The present orientation of Eurozone policies does not seem to draw any lesson from these historical antecedents. Taxonomy is the activity of grouping individuals into species, arranging species into larger groups, and giving those groups names, thus producing a classification. I apply this methodology to a set of financial crises that took place in the second period of financial globalization, which lasted from the late 60s of the XX century up to present times. The set comprises the most important crises as experienced by emerging market economies from the early 80s and the crises that Eurozone economies are suffering nowadays. Instead of the form or shape of the individuals recorded by the naturalists, the classification looks at the stylized facts of the critical processes. Emerging market economies are developing countries that entered into the expanding international financial system after implementing policies of deregulation and liberalization of their financial systems and capital accounts. Almost all of these countries were net receptors of capital flows from developed countries from the beginning of the financial globalization process up to the late 1990s (Frenkel and Rapetti, 2010). In the past three decades of the last century (expanded to include the first 2 years of the 2000s) those countries experienced two waves of crises. The first wave swept the Latin American region in the early 1980s. This experience is related to the fact that Latin American economies entered into the globalization process much earlier than other developing countries: Brazil began to tap the Eurodollar market in the late 60s and other Latin American economies began to receive international credits in the second half of the 70s. Most of these economies experienced foreign debt crises in the early 80s, but some of them did not experience systemic financial crises (Brazil, for instance). I take advantage of the work by Laeven and Valencia (2008) in order to identify the financial crises cases. In the early 80s deep financial (and currency) crises were experienced by Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Mexico.Footnote 2 The second wave of financial crises in Latin America began with the 1995 Mexican and Argentine crises, which were followed by the Brazilian currency crisis in 1998 and the financial and currency crises in Argentina and Uruguay in 2001–2002. On the other hand, five economies in East Asia and Russia experienced financial crises in 1997–98. The Asian and Russian crises had important financial spillovers and negative real impacts on developing countries. Finally, Turkey in 2001 experienced a financial and currency crisis that, together with the Argentine and Uruguayan mentioned crises, constitute so far the last financial crises in emerging markets.Footnote 3 It seems important to stress that each wave of crisis was preceded by booms of capital inflows to developing countries. The crises in the Eurozone were triggered by the US sub-prime crisis. The initial impacts of the contagion were proportional to the degree of exposure of the national financial systems to toxic assets in the United States, irrespective of their balance of payments situations. For instance, gross domestic product (GDP) contraction in 2009 was greater in Germany, which showed a current account surplus, than in other Eurozone economies showing current account deficits but less exposure to US assets (Servén and Nguyen, 2010). I am interested in the further development of the critical processes in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy (GIPSI). In these countries a second surge of critical developments led by Greece started in early 2010. The first stylized fact I observe is shared by all the episodes in the mentioned set of crises. They were preceded in all cases by a cyclical macroeconomic dynamics, with an initial phase of expansion, followed by growing financial fragility and ending up in financial crises (in all the mentioned cases except Brazil in 1998) and in currency crises in all the emerging market cases (with the exception of the Argentine in 1995). This cyclical dynamics is clearly related to the work of Hyman Minsky (1975, 1977). Minsky stressed that unregulated market economies are systems cyclical in nature, in which crises are not unusual events. A key element of this cyclical pattern is the endogenous behavior of agents’ risk perception and expectations. In the development of the boom phase, optimism spreads and confidence increases. Optimism and confidence tend to reduce the perception of risk and agents – investors and intermediaries – take riskier positions. Asset price bubbles that support the financial expansion inflate in the process. In the booming phase, the balance sheets become increasingly fragile. At some point a negative episode draws people's attention to the high degree of risk exposure and a period of distress begins. Concern about the exposure to risk leads many players to prefer liquidity and undo positions. Bubbles deflate and many agents are forced to assume wealth losses. Pessimism replaces the previous optimism while the contraction process feedbacks. The development of the downturn leads to the systemic crisis. It was impressive to realize how accurately the Minskyan cycle described the pattern followed by the American economy in the period preceding Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy. Minsky's insights were then broadly recognized and this helped to bring them back from the intellectual exile where they had been relegated. Actually, the Minskyan cycle is observed in many other financial crises.Footnote 4 The processes that led to financial crises in the emerging market economies and the Eurozone economies exhibit Minskyan features similar to those verified in the US economy. Crises were always preceded by booming periods in which credit expanded and risk taking increased. Analysis of the range suggests that the crises emerged as the culmination of the same processes that caused a growing optimism and encouraged greater risk taking in the boom phase. Besides the above-mentioned cyclical dynamics, the comparative analysis of the crises in emerging market and Eurozone economies crises reveals other common stylized facts: Similar triggers of the booming phase. In Frenkel and Rapetti (2009) we pointed out an important difference between the triggers of the booming phase in the US sub-prime crisis and the emerging market crises. In the United States, the real state bubble and the financial innovations that started with the securitization of mortgages (and other debts) are the key ingredients of the booming phase of the cycle. Both are processes that developed and nurtured one to another during a relatively long period. These facts are consistent with the Minskyan view about the endogenous character of the trigger of the booming phase in developed economies. In contrast, a distinguishing characteristic of the emerging market crises is that the booming phase began not with innovations in the financial markets, but with the implementation of macroeconomic policies that give rise to a profitable environment for financial arbitrage between domestic and foreign assets. Hence, the trigger of the Minskyan cycle in emerging market countries crises has an important exogenous component, associated to the implementation of new macroeconomic policies. This stylized fact is shared by the peripheral Eurozone crises. The booming phase in emerging market economies was generated by relatively drastic changes in macroeconomic policies and regulations, which typically included the liberalization of the capital account of the balance of payments and local financial market jointly with the implementation of some sort of exchange rate fixation (pegs or active crawling pegs).Footnote 5 The implementation of new regulations and macroeconomic arrangements operated as an exogenous shock on the financial system, which quickly established incentives for arbitraging between domestic and foreign assets and led to booming phases. The initial booming phase in the Eurozone economies also resulted from a drastic change in macroeconomic policies. The introduction of the common currency operated as a shock on the national financial systems, which established stronger incentives for arbitraging between core and peripheral countries assets and led to the booming phase in the periphery of the Eurozone. Lax financial regulation. The regulation of local financial markets was weak in both the emerging market economies and the Eurozone economies. In the emerging market cases it may be because local financial markets had been recently liberalized or because the expansion of financial intermediation during the boom exceeds the existing regulatory capacity. In the Eurozone cases, the introduction of the common currency, by increasing the incentives to international capital flows, generated renewed risks without a contemporaneous reinforcement in financial regulation. Crucial role of capital movements. International capital movements had a crucial role in the boom and the contracting phase in both the emerging market economies and the Eurozone economies. The triggers put in motion similar macroeconomic dynamics. In what follows I present a narrative of a stylized cyclical dynamics based on my analysis of crises in emerging market economies.Footnote 6 The ability of the narrative to depict the macroeconomic dynamics of the GIPSI cases is discussed in Cesaratto (2012) and Bagnai (2012). Complementary evidence can be found in Bibow (2012), European Commission (2009) and European Commission (2010). The combination of credibly fixed (or predetermined) exchange rate and capital account liberalization generates important arbitrage opportunities by exploiting significant spreads between the yields of foreign and domestic assets. Capital inflows expand liquidity and credit in the economy and feed bubbles in financial and real assets. As a result, output and employment growth accelerate. The expansion of aggregate demand leads to non-tradable price increases, which under fixed (or predetermined) exchange rate regimes provokes an appreciation of the real exchange rate. The real appreciation trend reinforces capital inflows seeking to obtain capital gains by holding domestic assets. This in turn feeds back into the real economy, accelerating the expansion of credit and output growth. In this context, domestic agents’ financial positions became increasingly fragile (in Minsky's sense). Simultaneously, the combined effect of the real exchange rate appreciation and economic growth stimulates the demand for imports, while exports tend to weaken. The worsening of the trade balance together with the increase in the interest and dividend payments turns the current account into deficit. A steady increase in current account deficit is typically observed. As, initially, capital inflows are higher than the absolute value of current account deficits, foreign exchange reserves accumulate during the booming phase in the emerging market economies. At some point, however, current account deficit becomes larger than capital inflows, turning negative the balance of payments result and inducing a contraction of liquidity and credit in an already fragile financial system. This is the beginning of the contracting phase. Asset prices bubbles gradually begin to deflate and episodes of illiquidity and insolvency emerge, first as isolated cases and then as a systemic financial crisis. In the emerging market economies, financial tensions or crises precede currency crises in most cases. The above narrative describes a process in which the credit expansion is fed by international capital inflows while current account deficits widen.Footnote 7 The process reaches the turning point when the balance of payments result turns negative. The following contracting phase is described as a gradual process leading to the financial crisis (in all cases) and the currency crisis (in the emerging market cases). This description is intended to emphasize that what leads to the turn of the cycle is the increasing financial and external fragility attained by the economy along the expansionary phase (ie the permanency of the expansionary phase would require a permanent growing trend in capital inflows). However, in fact, instead of a gradual process, the contracting phase can be an abrupt fall triggered, for instance, by a sudden stop of capital flows induced by contagion effects, as it happened in a number of emerging markets and in the GIPSI cases.Footnote 8 In any case, being the sudden stop triggered by a fundamental or non-fundamental contagion, its damaging effects are proportional to the financial and external fragility previously attained by the economy.Footnote 9 The narrative (and the model on which it is based) tells the story of one country, but the actual boom-and-bust processes have taken place simultaneously in groups of countries, not only in the Eurozone,Footnote 10 but also in the emerging market cases. Hence, contagion effects have been present in different degrees in many cases. I have presented so far the similar roles that capital flows and current account deficits had in emerging markets and Eurozone crises. Beyond this common stylized fact, the critical processes took different paths in the emerging market economies and the Eurozone economies. A key differential factor relates to the existence or not of a lender of last resort able to dissipate the default risk on the debts in international currency issued during the booming phase. In the emerging market economies case, given the absence of a lender of last resort in foreign currency, exchange risk and country risk are key determinants of the critical processes, as I explain below. Before that, I briefly discuss the consequences of the inexistence of an international currency lender of last resort in the emerging market economies cases. Country risk and its price – the country risk premium – are central to the analysis of foreign debt sustainability in emerging market economies. These debts have a specific default risk associated with the currency in which the debt is nominated (Frenkel, 2008). The default risk of the debts issued in foreign currency affects both public and private debts. A private debtor may be liquid in domestic currency and able to service its debt without difficulty at the current exchange rate. However, if liquidity in foreign currency becomes insufficient to serve all international debts, the government could appeal to convertibility suspension in order to avoid the depletion of reserves, forcing the private agents to default on their debts. On the other hand, if sufficient liquidity in foreign currency is available, it is highly unlikely that the public sector fails to fulfill its commitments in that currency because of the lack of liquidity in domestic currency. Therefore, only insufficient liquidity in foreign currency can force a default on public debt issued in that currency. Consequently, public debt is the lower risk between the debts in foreign currency issued by domestic agents. This is why country risk premium is typically indicated by the sovereign risk premium, and measured as the difference between the yield on a sovereign bond in US dollar and the equivalent yield on the US bond, which is taken as the risk-free asset. It is not difficult to understand why the state and expected evolution of the balance of payments are crucial in the assessment of sovereign (country) risk in emerging market economies. The debtor country has financing needs in foreign currency, consisting of the sum of the current account deficit and the foreign debt capital payments. A crucial point is that the possibilities of adjusting the balance of payments are not unlimited, even after devaluing the domestic currency. Consequently, in emerging market economies default risk is closely associated to the possibility that the country does not get all the foreign currency liquidity needed to meet its obligations (Frenkel, 2008).Footnote 11 I would like to emphasize that this risk would disappear if emerging market economies had a lender of last resort able to provide the country with the needed foreign currency liquidity. Under conditions of high foreign debt in an emerging market economy, a large proportion of the financing needs must necessarily be covered with funds from capital markets, even after adjustments have been made in the external sector. The assessment of the future path of the debt and its sustainability depends on the interest rate faced by the debtor and thereby on the risk premium determined in capital markets.Footnote 12 Multiple-equilibria scenarios are not uncommon. In their assessments of debt sustainability, each investor has to guess the behavior of the rest of the market participants. The predominance of optimistic assessments may result in a relatively low risk premium and sustainable debt projections. On the contrary, predominantly pessimistic perceptions may result in high risk premium and unsustainable debt projections. Through the determination of risk premiums, market participants determine whether the debt is sustainable or not in a standard self-fulfilling behavior. I discuss this issue more in depth below. Given the absence of a lender of last resort in foreign currency, exchange risk and country risk are key determinants of the critical processes in the emerging market economies. The evolution of external accounts and foreign exchange reserves reflect one aspect of the Minskyan cycle in these economies. As already mentioned, there is a steady increase in the current account deficit in the first phase of the cycle. Initially, capital inflows are higher than the absolute value of current account deficits and reserves accumulate. At some point the current account deficit becomes larger than the capital inflows. The stock of international reserves reaches a maximum and then contracts, inducing the contraction of money and credit. The portfolio decisions of domestic and foreign agents – regarding the portion of the portfolio exposed to country and currency risks – are affected by the evolution of the balance of payments (Frenkel, 1983). The evolution of domestic interest rates reflects the financial aspects of the cycle in the emerging market economies. The local interest rate tends to decline in the first phase and to increase in the second. As exchange rate policy initially enjoys credibility, arbitrage between domestic and foreign assets leads to a reduction of domestic interest rates. Low interest rates contribute to the real and financial expansion. In the second phase the interest rates rise. The increase in nominal and real interest rates in the second phase is also explained by the arbitrage between domestic and foreign assets. The sum of the exchange risk premium plus the country risk premium – the added price of devaluation and default risks – sets a floor for local real interest rates and is the main variable that drives their increase. The persistent increase in the current account deficit – and from a certain point the contraction trend in international reserves – reduces the credibility of the exchange rate rule, on the one hand, while increasing, on the other hand, the probability of default of the debt issued in international currency. The maintenance of the exchange rate rule and the regular service of external obligations require increasing capital inflows. Therefore, risk premiums tend to increase. Higher risk premiums and consequently higher interest rates are required to balance the portfolios and attract foreign capital. The economic activity contracts and episodes of illiquidity and insolvency further contribute to reducing the credibility of the exchange rate policy. At the end of the process there is no interest rate high enough to sustain the demand for local financial assets. There are runs on central bank foreign exchange reserves, which ultimately lead to the collapse of exchange rate regime. In contrast to emerging market economies, neither private debts nor public debts in the Eurozone economies have an additional risk of default associated to the potential lack of foreign currency liquidity at the national aggregate level. This is so because the Eurozone payments system warrants the availability of liquidity to fulfill all international payments. On the other hand, ECB has performed the role of lender of last resort of commercial banks (and indirectly to firms) located in the Eurozone economies. In association with the different settings, the critical processes have evolved differently in the emerging market economies and the Eurozone economies. In the emerging market economies’ crises, as was already mentioned, the evolution of external accounts and international reserves feedback negatively in the second phase of the Minskyan cycle throughout their effects on the exchange rate risk and the specific default risk of international currency debts, public and private. This stylized fact is absent in Eurozone economies’ crises. In the Eurozone economies, the exchange rate risk has had no role in the portfolio decisions leading to capital outflows (at least until the GIPSI critical processes were well advanced, when the possibility of Greece abandoning the euro and issuing a new currency became visible). Neither have capital flows been directly influenced by the evolution of the external accounts. Eurozone countries do not carry stocks of international reserves whose evolution could indicate risks of devaluation and default, as in the emerging market economies. The Eurozone economies’ balance of payments results (the sum of current and capital account results) are approximately recorded in the Target2 balances of the ECB and do not seem to have a significant influence in the countries’ risk assessments.Footnote 13 On the other hand, public debts in the Eurozone economies do have a specific liquidity risk of default similar to that of public debts in emerging market economies issued in foreign currency. This is so because governments in the Eurozone do not have a (highly credible) lender of last resort able to dissipate this risk.Footnote 14 The debtor government in the Eurozone economies has some financing needs, made up by its fiscal deficit (the primary deficit plus interests) plus the principal maturities. The possibilities of adjusting public finances are not unlimited. Consequently, there is a risk that the debtor does not count with sufficient liquidity to cover its financing needs and be forced to default on their obligations. The role of the default risk premium in the sustainability of public debts in the Eurozone is similar to the role it has in the sustainability of foreign currency debts (public and private) in emerging market economies. As in the emerging markets cases, a large proportion of the financing needs of the GIPSI governments must necessarily be covered with funds from the market, even after adjustments have been made in the public accounts. The process that follows is also similar to the experience of emerging market economies with their foreign currency debts. The markets’ assessments of risks tend to place the countries in financial traps with increasing public debt ratios and risk premiums.Footnote 15 In the Eurozone economies’ crises, in absence of the influence of the exchange risk and the international liquidity risk in the portfolio decisions, the main source of negative feedback effects in the second phase of the cycle is the evolution of public debt ratios and sovereign risk premiums, throughout their effects on the portfolio decisions of the private sector. These effects would not occur if the Eurozone governments had a credible lender of last resort. So far we have pointed out stylized facts of the macroeconomic dynamics determined by the interaction between agents’ behavior and the institutional settings. In addition, we could also consider as another stylized fact of the crises dynamics the pro-cyclical fiscal policies implemented by the governments in the second phase of the cycle in order to gain credibility from the markets and revert the capital outflows and the recession trends. Actually, this stylized fact was observed in almost all emerging market economies’ crises and on the other hand, pro-cyclical fiscal measures are presently a crucial ingredient in the development of the Eurozone economies’ crises. An obvious motivation of these policies is the conditionality imposed in exchange of financial support by the multilateral institutions. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has imposed fiscal austerity in all cases in which its support programs were involved in the emerging market economies’ crises. On the other hand, fiscal austerity is the main objective of the policy orientation of the European Union and the main conditionality presently claimed by the European financial institutions to the support given to the Eurozone economies. In what follows, we want to discuss other motivations and objectives pursued by governments that implement pro-cyclical fiscal policies both in the emerging market economies and the Eurozone economies, besides the conditionality imposed by international institutions. The second phase of the cycle is currently in full development in the Eurozone economies’ crises. The turning point of the cycle could be dated in September 2008, when the contagion of Lehman Brothers bankruptcy spread to the entire world. Hence, the second phase of the cycle in the Eurozone economies’ crises has lasted so far about 4 years. In order to make a valid comparison with regard pro-cyclical fiscal policies between the crises in the Eurozone economies and the emerging market economies, we should look at the emerging market economies’ crises dynamics in the period between the turning point of the cycle and the abandoning of the fixed exchange rate. As was already mentioned, all the emerging market economies’ crises ended up in devaluations (the only exception is Argentina in 1995, when the currency board exchange regime survived the financial crisis). The period between the turning point of the cycle and the devaluation has usually been relatively short in the emerging market economies. For instance, between 1 and 2 years in the Latin American crises in the early 1980s, about 1 year in the 1995 Mexican crisis and less than 1 year in the East Asian crises. The Argentine crisis in 2001 is an exception in this regard because the turning point of the cycle occurred in mid-1998 whereas the devaluation took place at the end of 2001. The contraction phase was a prolonged depression that lasted three and a half years in which pro-cyclical fiscal policies were intensively implemented. This makes the Argentine case particularly relevant in comparison with the Eurozone crises because, both in Argentina and in the Eurozone crises, the second phase of the cycle has lasted much more than in other cases, giving room for clear observations of the implementation and effects of the pro-cyclical fiscal policies. In order to discuss the motivations and effects of pro-cyclical fiscal policies, I take as a fact that they have direct contraction effects on aggregate demand (Jayadev and Konczal, 2010; DeLong and Summers, 2012; Guajardo et al., 2011).Footnote 16 The idea that a fiscal deficit reduction may have a net expansionary effect on output rests on the existence of indirect positive effects on private expenditures, throughout the impact of the policy on expectations and credibility. In an emerging market economy case, the potential effect of the policy on the domestic real interest rate, throughout the reduction of the country risk premium, points to a visible link between the policy and its hypothetical positive indirect effects. In the case of a Eurozone economy, the potential expansionary effect also rests on a reduction of the sovereign risk premium, but there is no visible link between the reduction of the risk premium and the hypothetical consequent increase in private expenditures. In this case, the indirect expansionary effects of a deficit reduction seem to rest on more ambiguous mechanisms than in an emerging market economy. However, beyond their hypothetical foundations, a bet on the indirect expansionary effects does not seem to be the main motivation of a government that pursues pro-cyclical fiscal policies in the contraction phase. Governments may or may not believe in indirect expansionary effects, but it seems clear that in all cases debt sustainability is the main objective of those policies: the sustainability of both the aggregate external debt of the country and the public debt issued in international currency, in the case of an emerging market economy; and the sustainability of the public debt in the case of an Eurozone economy. SustainabilityFootnote 17 means the ability of the debtors to fulfill its financial commitments as they are written in the involved contracts. Obviously, sustainability is not a guarantee that the contracts will actually be fulfilled. Sustainability is an assessment about future uncertain events, based on present information and probable conjectures. An investor has to evaluate both the prospects of the capital flows and the ability of the country to make necessary adjustments in the external accounts (in an emerging market economy case) and in the public accounts (in both emerging market economy and Eurozone cases). Domestic information cannot provide a complete assessment of the risk. Even the quantitative components of the sustainability assessment depend on the behavior of the financial market. Present and expected risk premiums are necessary information to forecast the evolution of the debt burden and the future financing needs. As the prospects of the country risk premium are essential components of the sustainability assessment, each of the investors has to conjecture the behavior of the rest of the market. Consequently, there is room for multiple equilibrium and self-fulfilling prophecies. The composition of the present and forecasted financing needs provides information about the proportion that should inescapably be backed by new lending in the market, even after adjustment policy measures have been taken. When the debt burden makes up for the bulk of the present and projected financing needs, the effects of current domestic policy measures on the financing needs are relatively small. Consequently, the assessment of sustainability depends in this case mostly on conjectures about the behavior of the rest of the financial market (and also on conjectures about the behavior of the international institutions). Sustainability is then a self-fulfilling prophecy of the average opinion of the market. The average opinion can suddenly change from sustainable to unsustainable. The changes can be triggered by relatively small variations in the fundamentals or other news affecting the fundamentals. Or the change can be caused by domestic or international news less connected with the fundamentals. The sufficient condition for that to happen is a conventional opinion shared by most of the market participants. Consequently, sustainability is highly vulnerable to contagion effects or other sources of volatility, international or domestic. The valuation of the assets issued by a country in the above situation is a neat example of the Keynesian beauty contest. What can the country do to make their financial assets look more beautiful? For the mentioned reasons, the government domestic policies have relatively little room for improving in the short run the fundamentals in which the sustainability assessments are based. However, this does not mean that domestic policies are irrelevant. They are relevant, not because of their effect on the fundamentals, but as signals to the financial market. The signals should make the country look more beautiful in the eyes of the average beauty criteria of the market. Signals are intended to convince individual investors that the average opinion will be favorably influenced. Hence, they have to harmonize with the more generalized conventions of the market participants. Fiscal austerity measures are valuable signals if, as it is actually the case, generalized conventions see them always positively, even if an independent analysis could show that they worsen the sustainability fundamentals. The effects of the announcements of pro-cyclical fiscal policies should be seen well before the adjustment measures objectively show their results on economic variables. A country in this context loses most of its policy degrees of freedom. The financing of the debt burden becomes the main focus of domestic policies because it is the most important and urgent government target. The default of the debt would impose a high political cost and consequently, the government perceives the loss of funding as the most important threat it faces. Policy signals to the market may be, and usually are, socially or politically problematic and may actually have negative impacts on the economic performance. Experience shows that governments choose to confront the domestic social and political conflicts and risk a worsening of the economic performance in order to give priority to the issuing of signals to the market. Governments always prefer to play for time. The threat of default is tangible, while the effects of the signals are more uncertain, take more time to appear or simply are comparatively less costly for the government. In no case in the emerging market economies crises the pro-cyclical fiscal policies have helped to stabilize the financial market, reduce the risk premiums and avoid the abandoning of the fixed exchange rates. The signals were not capable of turning the vicious circle of higher risk premiums and worsening debt ratios into virtuous circles of lower risk premiums and improving debt ratios, even in the case of Argentina, where the fiscal austerity announcements were effectively implemented along a period long enough to make fully observable their effects on output and the fiscal accounts (Damill et al., 2010). In the Eurozone economies crises pro-cyclical fiscal policies and signals are in full operation. So far, they have been incapable of turning the mentioned vicious circle into a virtuous one. The main lessons provided by the above comparative analysis refer to how to prevent the occurrence of crises. In the first place, the crises in both developed and developing countries have highlighted the shortcomings of poorly regulated domestic financial systems. The general lesson is that reinforcing and extending financial regulation is essential to avoid instability and crisis. A specific conclusion with regard to emerging market economies is that the prevention of crisis involves elements that go beyond the regulation of the domestic financial systems. In emerging market economies, the conjunction of macroeconomic policies with the pattern of insertion into the international financial system has a crucial role in the financial performance. The study of crises in emerging market economies suggests that in addition to strengthening and expanding financial regulation, these countries should: (1) adopt exchange rate regimes that prevent speculation and provide flexibility to policymakers, (2) implement measures pointing to the regulation of capital flows and (3) implement policies that ensure the robustness of the external accounts, including the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the preservation of competitive (or non-appreciated) real exchange rates. The emerging market economies seem to have taken advantage from those lessons. Significant changes took place in many countries in the 2000s with respect to the dominant features in the 90s and before. There were important changes in the patterns of insertion into the international financial system, in macroeconomic policy regimes and in the regulation of national financial systems. Many countries adopted managed floating exchange rate regimes, generated current account surpluses and accumulated considerable foreign exchange reserves (Frenkel and Rapetti, 2010). These changes are consistent with the preventive measures suggested by the study of emerging market economies’ crises briefly presented above. Hence, it can be concluded that the robustness exhibited recently by developing economies can be seen as confirmation a-posteriori of those recommendations. Before the emergence of the Eurozone economies crises, suggestions of crisis prevention policies were usually accompanied by initiatives that should be implemented at the international level. The building of an institution able to perform the role of lender of last resort in international currency for emerging market economies was one of the most often mentioned recommendations. In fact, some of the recommended domestic policies – for instance, the accumulation of large volumes of foreign exchange reserves – were mainly intended to have a substitute role for such an institution. The recent experience in the Eurozone shows how far we are from the possibility of constructing a more rational and stable international financial architecture with an international lender of last resort as one of its central elements. The reason is simple: if governments’ coordination to set up an efficient international arrangement to prevent and manage crises is so difficult in the Eurozone, what would be the possibility of such an arrangement at the global level? With regard to the Eurozone, the comparative analysis shows that the establishment of the Euro resulted in a type of crisis with strong similarities to the crises in emerging market economies. In both emerging market and Eurozone economies the crises originated in the conjunction of fixed exchange rates, full capital mobility and weak financial regulation, that is, in the conjunction of failures in macroeconomic policies and failures in financial regulations. A preventive lesson for Europe should be: do not adopt the common currency, but the lesson is irrelevant now. A more concrete and practical lesson refers to the negative feedback effects in the contraction phase of the Minskyan cycle. The main sources of these effects in the Eurozone economies are the vicious circle dynamics of public debt ratios and risk premiums. These mechanisms could have been stopped by the operation of the ECB as a credible lender of last resort of the Eurozone governments, in the same way as did the central banks in United States, United Kingdom and Japan after the financial crises burst in these countries. Maybe there is still time in Europe to do it. Even if the ECB had performed from the beginning of the crises as a credible lender of last resort for governments and the negative feedback mechanisms had been consequently neutralized, the GIPSI countries would be anyway trapped in contexts of debt deflation and low international competitiveness. Has the experience of the emerging market economies something to teach us in this regard? As was already mentioned, all emerging market economies crises ended up in devaluations, and so, a more depreciated real exchange rate was the general condition for the following recovery processes. However, devaluation was not a sufficient condition. For instance, the Latin American crises of the early 1980s were followed by big devaluations and a number of rounds of foreign debts restructurings. However, none of the debt restructurings in the 1980s included substantial alleviation of the debt burdens. As a consequence, the biggest countries in the region experienced about 8 years of stagnation, high inflation and hyperinflation. The stabilization and the recovery of growth were inconsistent with the fulfillment of the debt obligations. In other more successful crisis resolutions (for instance, Mexico after 1995 and the East Asian countries after 1998) the debts restructurings did not include significant haircuts, but were facilitated by massive international rescue packages led by the IMF. Almost in all cases the resolution of the crises in the emerging market economies comprised the bailout and deep restructuring of the domestic financial systems, which included the refinancing of private debts in favorable terms (subsidized with fiscal resources) and involved significant fiscal costs. The Argentine crisis in 2001 is a singular case. Argentina defaulted on its external debt, as did the Latin America countries suffering crisis in the early 80s, but then suspended debt payments to private creditors for about 4 years. In 2005, Argentina reached an agreement with creditors to restructure most of the debt with a haircut that at that time was an historical record. As in other cases, the crisis resolution involved a huge devaluation and the bailout and restructuring of the domestic financial system, with favorable refinancing terms for domestic private debts. The economy began to grow soon after the devaluation and sustained a very high rate of growth in the following years. This experience makes the Argentine case particularly interesting for people looking for lessons from crisis resolutions.",2

With regard to the monetary regime, the Congress defined the unit of account and adopted the bimetallism regime in 1792 (Sylla, 2006). Specie was legal tender and all bank notes were legally convertible at the issuing bank's office at face value into silver or gold specie. Shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War, convertibility into specie was suspended in December 1861. The Congress adopted the Legal Tender Act in February 1862, which legalised the government's ability to issue inconvertible paper money (the greenback) and the legal amount reached US$400 millions in March 1863. After the hostilities, the federal government planned to return to convertibility at the old parity: it started a policy of contraction of the quantity of greenbacks and froze it at $356 millions in 1868. The Coinage Act of 1873 cancelled the free minting of silver and the Resumption Act of 1875 hastened the return to convertibility into gold specie only. The Treasury reintroduced the policy of contraction until the premium on gold in terms of greenback vanished in May 1878. The amount of greenbacks was definitely frozen at $346 millions and from 1 January 1879, the greenbacks were convertible into gold specie (Mitchell, 1903; Timberlake, 1993). With regard to the banking architecture, the Congress adopted the National Currency Act in 1863 – renamed the National Bank Act in 1864 – which inaugurated the NBS that prevailed until 1913. The NBS was the first attempt to unify the system of bank issuing to the extent that the national notes issued by the banks under federal charter (the national banks) should henceforth be exchanged at a one-to-one ratio from coast to coast. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the Treasury was created in order to ensure the application of the regulatory components of the NBS. Three of them are worth recalling, as they appear important for our purposes. First, the rule for the issue of the national notes corresponded to a bond collateral requirement. The national banks were authorised to issue up to 90% of the amount of Treasury bonds after having purchased and deposited them with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Analytically, it may be noted that the NBS rule dissociated the issue of bank notes from the discount or the acquisition of bills and linked their circulation to the bond collateral requirement – a circulation of backed notes, as I shall call them. Such a rule of issue turned its back on the traditional technique of discount by the issuing banks. In effect, the long-established practice associated the issue of bank notes with a discount or a purchase of private or public sector bills or securities – an issue of asset notes, as I shall call them. Second, the NBS defined the reserve requirement in lawful money (mainly, specie and greenbacks) against net deposits. Central reserve city banks of New York, Chicago and Saint Louis were required to maintain 25% of reserves (that should all be kept in vaults), reserve city banks throughout the nation were required to carry 25% of reserves (up to one-half of them could be held in central reserve city banks) and the country banks were required to carry 15% of reserves (up to three-fifths of them could be held in central reserve and reserve city banks). Goodhart (1969, p. 17) summarises the situation nicely: ‘the entire banking system, partly by design, partly by accident, was intertwined by a spreading network of interbank balances’ and ‘the chain of interbank balances ended in New York’. Third, the national notes were legally convertible at face value into greenbacks until 1879, and also into specie after 1879, and were mutually exchanged at par at the issuing bank's office. In order to improve par redemption of national notes outside the issuing bank's office, the Comptroller of the Currency put the National Bank Redemption Agency (NBRA) into operation in 1874, which was a bureau of redemption and not a genuine, federally organised clearing system. As we shall see in the next section, the absence of technique of asset notes issuing created an upward rigidity of the supply of the currency. On the other hand, the absence of a federal clearing institution that would have improved the reflux of national notes involved a downward rigidity of the currency. In other words, the procedure of national notes issue did not help national banks to respond promptly to the aggregate demand for currency – a problem known as the ‘inelasticity’ of the currency.",2

Although it also affected numerous other sectors such as energy, telecommunications, and transportation (Crandall, 2007), it was doubtlessly in the field of finance that this process went farthest (Wilmarth, 2002). Beginning in the 1980s, the banking sector in the United States experienced a thorough transformation (Strahan, 2002). The US Congress passed no less than five major lawsFootnote 1 between 1980 and 1991 (Sherman, 2009), all of which were aimed at deregulating the banking sector, along with numerous other measures. Finally, in 1999 the Glass–Steagall Act was repealed and the power of banks considerably reinforced. However, this phenomenon was not limited to the Anglo-Saxon world. For example, France, too, was affected by this process of deregulation, even if it sometimes took on other forms due to the initial context and the respective roles of banks and financial markets in the economy. And there, too, the consequences were significant. The purpose of this article is to examine the impact of deregulation on the business practices of banks in two countries, the United States and France, during the period between the early 1980s and the 2007–2008 crisis. Although the causes were complex and no one reason can fully account for why the world economy entered the biggest crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, we try to demonstrate that deregulation in both the US and France led to banks taking risks greater than what they would have otherwise been allowed to take, bringing the financial system to a precipice. Deregulation has assumed different forms in the two countries, yet has led to similar results: excessive risk taking. However, it is the specific path of each country that makes this story not only fascinating but also instructive if one wants to discern current patterns. History matters and helps to understand today's similarities and differences. When, where, and why banks came to adopt the particular form they have today, and how these forms have evolved over time, matters. The path used by each country has necessarily influenced the outcome (North, 1991). The first part of this paper compares the historical context and the process of deregulation that took place both in the United States and France. The second part deals with the impact of deregulation on the business practices of banks in these two countries.",1

With a large domestic market and developed financial settings, it had reached the height of its development – by far the world leader in the sector. Not only did US management companies amass and manage substantial investments, but they also undertook ever larger transactions and moved internationally to diversify their businesses. Furthermore, similar to most alternative asset management industries, US private equity management was unregulated, and its business environment was incredibly favorable, marked by bullish financial markets, cheap and abundant debt, investors hungry for high yields and structured products, and so on. However, the boom was short in duration, lasting only from 2004 to 2008. The financial crisis sparked a sudden and massive downturn in both transactions and fundraising. A major crisis of any kind offers an opportunity to rethink current practices and challenges. In the US private equity market, these thoughts mainly focused on the potential risk that large-scale transactions created for the stability of the financial system, as well as the relationships between investors and fund managers. Five years after the most acute phase of the financial crisis, a new landscape is emerging for private equity. Few actual defaults of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) occurred, yet the sector underwent profound changes, in response to the combined impacts of considerable business declines and disappointing results. This balance of forces emerged as unfavorable to management companies in their relations with investors but highly favorable for the introduction of new regulations. By addressing this situation, this article seeks to analyze the various modifications at work in the US private equity industry and their likely outcomes. For this analysis, venture capital constitutes a different business than other forms of non-listed equity investments (eg, LBO, mezzanine, real estate) and thus falls outside the scope. In the next section, the state of the industry, both before and after the crisis is briefly described. This description leads into an analysis of the evolving landscape, focusing mainly on the changing balance of power between management companies and investors and the impacts of new regulations, on both investors’ protections and systemic risk. The final section is dedicated to a discussion of the ongoing consequences of these significant changes in the private equity industry.",
55,3,Comparative Economic Studies,25 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2013.21,Derivatives Markets in Bankruptcy,September 2013,Mark J Roe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code bars bankrupt debtors from immediately repaying most of their creditors, including their secured creditors, so that the bankrupt firm can reorganize without creditors forcing an otherwise viable business to liquidate. However, there are exceptions to Chapter 11’s reorganization orientation, with one of the most important being that accorded to the bankrupt’s derivatives and financial repurchase (known to all involved as ‘repo’) counterparties. They, unlike typical creditors, can seize and liquidate collateral, terminate their contracts with the bankrupt, and keep both preferential eve-of-bankruptcy payments and fraudulent conveyances they obtained from the debtor, which other creditors would have to return to the bankrupt. The impact of this favorable treatment is to graft a fast liquidation-oriented system onto a traditionally reorganization-oriented Chapter 11, but only for repos and derivatives. Derivatives’ and repos’ power under bankruptcy law to leap-frog other creditors, including other secured creditors, reduces their pre-bankruptcy incentives for market discipline in dealing with counterparties. Because the derivatives and repo players need not be as concerned about a counterparty’s failure as with an ordinary debtor’s failure, they have less incentive to ration their dealings with derivatives and repo debtors as carefully. If they were made to account for counterparty risk in ways similar to how most creditors must, they would be more likely to insist that there be stronger counterparties than otherwise on the other side of their derivatives bets and they would substitute at the margin away from short-term derivatives and repo financing into more stable financing, thereby insisting for their own good on strengthening the financial system. Without the strong bankruptcy protection they have for derivatives and repo contracts, they would substitute some of their investments away into alternatives. Bankruptcy rules thereby affect financial markets’ stability and discipline. Here they do so unfavorably for financial stability, as they encourage more short-term financing than would otherwise be the case. True, if derivatives and repo counterparties bear less risk, as they do, due to the Bankruptcy Code’s favoritism, then other creditors that are poorly prioritized in relation to repos and derivatives bear more risk and thus have more incentive for market discipline. This is a basic application of the well-known Modigliani–Miller framework. But the other creditors – such as the United States of America as guarantor of too-big-to-fail institutions – are poorly positioned contractually to consistently anticipate problems and to react quickly and well when problems arise anyway. A worthwhile policy agenda to consider is for bankruptcy institutions to harness private incentives for market discipline by cutting back on the large advantages that Chapter 11 and related insolvency legislation, such as Dodd–Frank’s resolution regime, bestow on these derivatives and repo investment channels. When we subsidize derivatives and repo via bankruptcy benefits unavailable to other creditors, we get more of that subsidized activity than we otherwise would. Bringing these bankruptcy benefits back down toward the level accorded most creditors would induce the derivatives and repo markets to better recognize the risks of counterparty financial failure, which in turn should dampen the possibility of another AIG/Bear/Lehman financial melt-down, such as that which occurred in 2007 and 2008. American and world-wide financial stability would be enhanced. Moreover, quick liquidation by counterparties of an excessively large portion of a financial firm’s portfolio, which the safe harbors allow, makes it harder to quickly reposition a weakened financial firm’s divisions and product lines without large losses. Regulatory action could move the system in that direction, but has not yet strongly or persistently done so.",

It has focused on the desirability of the Euro area, its original design flaws, faults of policies pursued by different countries within the existing institutional framework and the preferred future(s) of the arrangement. Much has been made of the differences between the European Union North, usually characterized by Germany, and the South, the Mediterranean countries plus Portugal. This contrast is revealing, but there are interesting questions that cannot be addressed with this setup. The Nordic and Baltic countries – the Far North of the Union – offer a perfect laboratory for approaching some of the interesting questions that rarely have been raised. This geographical area divides neatly into two subgroups both of which are exceptionally homogenous. First, (bypassing Iceland which is interesting for reasons other than those addressed here), take the four Nordic countries. Almost five centuries have elapsed since they were part of the same political union, but still their homogeneity in dimensions deemed crucial in New Institutional Economics is remarkable: geography, geology (with the obvious exception of Norway with hydrocarbons), history, religion, culture, political and labor market institutions and so on. Differences among the three Baltic nations may be somewhat greater, in language and religion at least, but even they remain minor. All seven northern states are small open economies. In spite of their great similarities, choices of currency regimes within the Nordic groups could hardly have been more divergent. Finland is the only Nordic country belonging to the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). At the other extreme, Norway, as befits a resource-dependent country, floats its currency. Denmark nominally maintains a sovereign currency but in fact follows the policies determined by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. Sweden in principle floats, though the practice is a different one, as will be seen. Why did such similar countries adopt currency regimes seemingly so divergent? To keep the discussion manageable this paper concentrates on just two countries, Finland and Sweden. Although the languages are different, in other respects the countries share almost all possible characteristics. Finland, after all, was part of Sweden from the twelfth century until 1809, which is longer than the southernmost part of Sweden, Skåne, has been until now. Skåne was a part of Denmark until it was united with Sweden only in 1658. Another question in comparing Finland and Sweden follows naturally. Has the difference in currency regime had an impact on the relative economic performance of the two countries? Sweden has access to sovereign exchange rate and monetary policies. Has it used the possibility, and if so, has that made a difference in performance? Sweden has performed slightly better than Finland since 2009, but is that because of currency independence or some other factors? The case of the Baltic countries is a different one. Estonia joined the EMU in 2011, Latvia will do so in 2014 and Lithuania intends to do the same ‘as soon as feasible’. Why do small nations in the European Far North still aim at membership in the Euro area? This question is answered here using the example of Estonia, but the discussion could easily be extended to its two southern neighbors as well. In fact, this case is so straight forward that it must be handled first.",
55,4,Comparative Economic Studies,25 April 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2013.7,Asymmetry in the Unemployment–Output Relationship Over the Business Cycle: Evidence from Transition Economies,December 2013,Emrah Ismail Cevik,Sel Dibooglu,Salih Barişik,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Okun's law relates changes in unemployment to changes in output or the output gap. It is an important empirical concept in macroeconomics as it gauges the output–unemployment trade-offs, which makes it useful in policymaking and forecasting. Combined with the Phillips curve, Okun's law provides a short-run aggregate supply curve. Moreover, the relationship is important for policy makers as it can be used to ascertain whether the growth rate is sustainable. Okun (1962) found a negative relationship between unemployment and output in the United States. Specifically, Okun's empirical results showed a 3% increase in output that is associated with a 1% decrease in the unemployment rate. Since then, a large number of studies examined the unemployment–output relationship and generally confirmed its empirical validity; however, estimates of Okun's coefficients seem to vary substantially across countries and over time. There are several reasons why Okun's coefficients are not robust over time and across countries. Model specifications where the relationship between unemployment and output is specified in terms of differences (the differences model) versus deviations from a trend (the gap model), various econometric methods, static versus dynamic specifications all have a role, although Weber (1995) found that the latter is not as important as the model specification. Finally, using different decomposition methods to estimate cyclical components of output and unemployment may lead to different estimates of Okun's coefficients. Moosa (1997) tested the validity of Okun's law for G7 countries and found the highest Okun coefficient was in North America and the lowest was in Japan. This was in part because of labor market flexibility in North America as labor market rigidities tend to influence Okun coefficients across countries. Lee (2000) examined the robustness of the Okun relationship for 16 OECD countries and found supportive evidence for Okun's law for most countries. However, quantitatively the Okun coefficients were found to diverge across countries. Perman and Tavera (2005) investigated the convergence of Okun coefficients among several alternative groupings of European economies. Empirical results provided evidence in favor of convergence of Okun coefficients among Northern and Central European countries. Villaverde and Maza (2009) analyzed Okun's law for the Spanish regions and found different estimates of Okun's coefficients for the regions because of regional disparities in productivity growth. There have been numerous studies examining nonlinear behavior in the output–unemployment relationship and the empirical results question the validity of the hypothesis that expansions and contractions in output have the same effects on unemployment. A linear response of unemployment to output growth over the business cycle is restrictive in macroeconomics, as a large body of literature has confirmed many macroeconomic time series behave asymmetrically over the business cycle. For instance, Neftci (1984) found the US unemployment rate increases more sharply during downswings than it declines during upswings. Gomme (1999) and Schettkat (1996) showed that the response of unemployment to output shocks is asymmetric in real business cycle models. Harris and Silverstone (2001) argued that testing for asymmetry in the output–unemployment relationship is important for at least four reasons. First, it could assist in discriminating among alternative theories of joint labor and goods market behavior. Second, it would strengthen the case for an asymmetric Phillips curve if a country's Okun relationship is also asymmetric. Third, knowledge about the extent of asymmetry in the output–unemployment relationship could be useful for both structural policies (eg, labor market reforms) and stabilization policies (eg, appropriate monetary policy responses). Finally, ignoring asymmetry in Okun's law, when it is present, could lead to forecasting errors. Moreover, Holmes and Silverstone (2006) emphasize factor substitution, changes in labor force participation and sectoral growth rates, asymmetric adjustment costs between expanding and contraction firms, and the role of mismatch all contribute to an asymmetric relationship between unemployment and output over the business cycle. Recently a large number of studies have focused on asymmetry in Okun's law using nonlinear models. Viren (2001) investigated the nonlinear relationship between output and unemployment using a threshold model for the 20 OECD countries. The study provided evidence in favor of nonlinearity in Okun's law. Harris and Silverzstone (2001) confirmed asymmetry in Okun's law for seven OECD countries using a threshold model. Sögner (2001) used a regime-switching model for the Austrian economy and found evidence of asymmetry in Okun's law. Cuaresma (2003) examined the existence of a nonlinear relationship between output and unemployment in the United States. The study confirmed the contemporaneous effect of output growth on unemployment is asymmetric and significantly higher in recessions than in expansions. Silvapulle et al. (2004) also corroborated the asymmetric relationship between output and unemployment using data from the US economy. Huang and Chang (2005) examined the empirical validity of Okun's law for Canada using structural break tests and threshold autoregressive models. Their empirical results provided evidence of structural breaks and nonlinear behavior in Okun's law in Canada. Huang and Lin (2006) followed up on nonlinearity in Okun's law for the United States and found evidence in favor of a nonlinear and negative relationship between unemployment and output. Holmes and Silverstone (2006) tested the presence of asymmetry in Okun's law within and across regimes for the US economy using a Markov regime-switching model and found asymmetry within and across regimes. Huang and Lin (2008) investigated Okun's coefficient for the United States by means of a smooth-time-varying parameter approach and found evidence of a smooth-time-varying Okun's coefficient. Even though the literature is replete with work on Okun's law in advanced economies, few studies focused on transition economies. Izyumov and Vahaly (2002) examined relationship between output and unemployment in 25 transition economies. They divided the countries into groups of reform leaders and reform laggards and examined the validity of Okun's law for reform leaders. Gabrisch and Buscher (2006) investigated the relationship between unemployment and output for eight Central and East European countries, which joined European Union (EU) in 2004. Using country and panel regressions, they found a limited role for labor market rigidities and that GDP growth is dominated by productivity growth in these countries. However, in spite of the evidence supportive of an asymmetric output–unemployment relationship over the business cycle and time-varying Okun coefficients, the existing literature has paid scant attention to a nonlinear and possibly time-varying relationship between output and unemployment in transition economies. Testing for asymmetry in Okun's law for the transition economies is important for several reasons. It is well known that, at the beginning of the transition period, unemployment levels in transition economies were quite low and continued to be low in the first stage of transition. After the transition to a market economy, unemployment rates increased sharply. Moreover, Gabrisch and Buscher (2006) show that because of fluctuations in unemployment rates, output evolved in the form of a J-curve in most of the transition economies between 1990 and 1994. Therefore, these fluctuations in unemployment rates may lead to a relationship between unemployment and output that varies over time. Second, economic crises in transition economies (such as the Czech Republic crisis in 1997, the Russian crisis in 1998) and developing economies (the Asian crisis in 1997) caused a significant decrease in output in the transition economies so that unemployment rates increased during the 1997–2000 period. Consequently, the relationship between unemployment and output may not be stable in the medium term, and, therefore, regime-varying Okun coefficients may be more appropriate and realistic for transition economies. Finally, it is important to understand the precise nature of Okun's law particularly if it entails jobless recoveries. To this end, we examine the relationship between output and unemployment by means of a Markov regime-switching model in nine transition economies as regime-dependent Okun coefficients are more appropriate for transition economies. Our focus on the former transition economies is motivated by several factors. First, for these countries, the nature of the business cycle and its empirical regularities are important to document. Are labor markets ‘flexible’ in transition economies? Do recoveries imply ‘jobless growth’ in post transition? Except for the Slovak Republic and Slovenia, which are part of the Eurozone, and Russia, which is outside the EU, these countries are aspiring to adopt the Euro. As a result, understanding output–employment trade-offs is particularly important in the absence of monetary policy instruments that would disappear if these countries were to join the Eurozone. Moreover, closer integration with the EU in the form of a common currency for some countries would likely subject these countries to additional shocks emanating from an enlarged Eurozone. Hence, understanding the behavior of unemployment and output over the business cycle would provide valuable information to policymakers in these countries. In order to introduce the Markov regime-switching model, the section ‘Okun's law and econometric methodology’ contains an empirical formulation of Okun's law and discusses our modeling strategy. We apply the strategy to nine transition economies, namely, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Slovenia and Slovak Republic in the section ‘Data and empirical results’. Our selection of sample countries is motivated by data availability. To preview our results, we find a statistically robust Okun's law for all countries. We also find support for a regime-dependent relationship between output and unemployment changes in all countries except Estonia. Our results imply a limited flexibility of labor markets in transition economies and mostly larger unemployment response in downswing than upswing regimes implying poor job growth in recoveries in all countries except for Latvia, Poland, Slovak Republic and Slovenia. We check the robustness of our results with an alternative specification of Okun's law in the section ‘Alternative specifications’. Conclusions follow in the last section.",18

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, fundamental reforms in agriculture fostered productivity gains that led to the reallocation of labor from the primary to the secondary sector, preparing the ground for rapid economic growth. In the 1980s and 1990s, the industrial sector experienced a significant boom as state-owned enterprises were restructured and corporatized, private manufacturing companies flourished, and joint ventures with foreign firms provided much-needed technology and know-how. As a result, over the past decade China has become the largest manufacturer in the world, enabling Chinese companies to expand their operations across the globe. At the same time, the service sector has grown in importance, but mostly at the expense of agriculture. The share of the primary sector in China’s gross domestic product (GDP), which exceeded 30% in the early 1980s, gradually declined to a low of 10% in 2009. In contrast, the tertiary sector saw its share double from 21% in 1980 to 43% in 2009. The share of the secondary sector remained relatively stable at between 42% and 48% over the same period. At the sub-national level, structural change has occurred at different speeds, thereby contributing to regional disparities. For instance, the GDP share of agriculture in some interior provinces, such as Sichuan and Yunnan, still exceeds 15%, while it represents less than 5% in coastal provinces with high concentration of manufacturing, such as Guangdong and Zhejiang. The largely metropolitan regions of Beijing and Shanghai, on the other hand, rely mostly on the tertiary sector that claims a share of more than 60%. This paper examines labor productivity growth in the three main sectors across Chinese provinces and its effect on regional disparities. The analysis of sectoral productivity over the past 30 years is crucial at a time when China is on the brink of another major structural transformation from an investment-driven economy with a predominant manufacturing sector to a consumption-driven economy, where the service sector plays a major role. The regional dimension of this process, which has been driven by labor shortages and increasing production costs in coastal provinces in recent years, is evident in the intensifying migration of manufacturing industries and foreign direct investment (FDI) to interior regions. Exploring the regional patterns in labor productivity growth in the three sectors offers important insights into the relationship between structural change and regional disparities that have been a key feature of China’s transition to a global manufacturing power. The goals of this paper are twofold. First, we examine the regional distribution of labor productivity in agriculture, industry, and services over the period 1978–2006. In particular, we model labor productivity growth as a discrete-time Markov process and estimate the transition probabilities across different ranges of sectoral output per worker relative to the mean. This approach allows us to detect and analyze convergence tendencies in each sector and forecast the evolution of the shape of the sectoral productivity distribution across regions over the long run. In addition, we test the robustness of the results in a continuous state space by using a non-parametric approach. Second, we employ a multinomial logit regression model to identify the determinants of labor productivity growth dynamics and their marginal effect in each sector. The sectoral regressions include a number of sector-specific variables that assess the contributions of capital, land, infrastructure, human capital, technology, environmental pollution, foreign trade, financial factors, and government policies. The existing research on sectoral productivity at the regional level in China can be generally divided into three groups. The first uses a regression model of the production function to test for convergence in productivity across regions in agriculture (McErlean and Wu, 2003; Ito, 2010) or industry (Bai and Li, 2004; Jefferson et al., 2008). The second group of studies decomposes productivity growth into efficiency and technological change, and then uses regional variations in the contributions of these components to identify convergence patterns (for agriculture: Chen and Song, 2008; Chen et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008; for industry: Marti et al., 2011; for services: Qin, 2006). The third group conducts a comparative analysis across several sectors. For instance, Lu (2002) and Dekle and Vandenbroucke (2006) examine productivity growth and factor reallocation across various sectors but only at the national level.Footnote 1 Wu (1995) is the only comparative sectoral study that takes the regional dimension into account as it decomposes productivity growth and tests for regional convergence in agriculture, rural industry, and state industry over the period 1985–1991. In contrast to previous studies, we employ a very different methodology with a focus on distribution dynamics that measures both productivity growth and convergence across regions in a given sector in terms of transition probabilities. The resulting analysis provides a far more detailed account because it relies on the entire distribution of sectoral output per worker across regions rather than just on the first two moments of the distribution. An additional advantage of the paper is that it utilizes a unique data set of capital stock by sector and region in China that accounts for province- and sector-specific depreciation rates and sector-specific deflators. Furthermore, our comparative analysis includes the service sector, which has received relatively little attention in the existing literature (Qin, 2006; Wu, 2007). Lastly, our sample covers all 31 Chinese provinces over almost 30 years, allowing us to investigate long-run patterns of convergence and structural transformation as well as their determinants. Convergence in labor productivity across provinces is not necessarily the expected or desirable outcome. For instance, it is unlikely that labor productivity in the primary sector will ever converge across provinces, mainly due to differences in geography and climate. However, regional divergence in the long run may create a number of policy challenges that would have to be addressed by the central government. More importantly, it is crucial to determine whether government policies and institutional factors impede convergence in productivity resulting from structural transformation, market forces, and globalization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next two sections describe the methodology and data, respectively. The subsequent section presents the results of the analysis and the last section concludes.",4

Framed in terms of the relation between debt and inflation, this paper analyzes whether there is a distinction between mature and transition economies in this regard. The individual Maastricht criteria were thought of as supporting each other, in the sense that, for example, a country satisfying the inflation criterion would find it easier to also satisfy the debt criterion and vice versa, while a country in violation of, say, the debt criterion would find it also more difficult to satisfy the inflation criterion. For example, excessive public debt relative to GDP raises concern not only because it puts into question the prospects for full debt repayment, but it also raises inflation concerns as it is feared that debts would eventually be monetized and endanger price stability. Thus, responsible debt management is understood to reduce the propensity for inflation to become a serious concern, and the criteriaFootnote 1 on debt and inflation can be viewed as complements in the classical microeconomic sense. While this may be true for mature market economies, this paper shows that it does not generally hold for transition economies, in that there the individual criteria can act more like substitutes: Far from supporting each other, moving toward satisfying the debt criterion makes it more difficult to also satisfy the inflation criterion and vice versa. While complements for mature economies, we show a potential alternative relation between debt and inflation among transition economies. This paper presents a model that shows how and why it may be more difficult for a transition economy to satisfy the Maastricht criteria on debt and inflation than it is for a mature market economy. This difficulty does not simply stem from transition countries being generally relatively weaker economies; rather it originates in structural factors, in particular in the economies’ inter-sectoral unbalanced growth, compared with mature market economies’ relatively balanced growth across sectors. This brings about a situation where attempts to reduce inflation in order to satisfy the inflation criterion may make it simultaneously more difficult to satisfy the debt criterion and vice versa. The model shows how the ability to fulfill the debt and the inflation criterion, while complementary for mature economies, is replaced by substitutability for transition economies. Distinguishing between transition economies according to their structural flexibility and prevailing industrial structure reveals the context-specific nature of a transition economy's ability to fulfill either one of the two Maastricht criteria. While it is the debt criterion that is hardest to fulfill for some, it is the inflation criterion which is problematic for others. Which of the two criteria presents itself as the more formidable barrier is shown to be context specific. Transition economies, for example in Central and Eastern Europe, have undergone profound restructuring during the past 20 years, and are still continuing to do so. These countries will, in general, be exposed to structural inflation, that is, inflation originating in differing performance of their various sectors and anchored on the real side of the economy. That is, differing productivity growth between sectors induces changes in relative prices, which again stimulates the shifting of resources between sectors and structural shifts as such. These shifts, lying at the heart of the transition process, find expression in structural inflation. In transition economies, this part of inflation is unavoidable and, in fact, being at the core of the transition process, desirable. Furthermore, structural inflation will not disappear owing to cyclical developments or short-term stabilization policy measures. In this paper, we focus on one of the principal variants incorporating the structural inflation hypothesis that has become known as the Scandinavian Model of Inflation, SMI. This model captures structural causes and consequences of inflation in a way that is related to, but also extends beyond the Balassa-Samuelson effect, B-S, which has received considerable attention in the literature on transition economies. The SMI also incorporates the Baumol-Bowen effect, allowing labor in one sector of production to subsidize labor in the other. When wage growth is equalized across sectors (the Baumol-Bowen effect), despite differences in the productivity growth (the Balassa-Samuelson effect), the structural inflation that emerges is in fact a subsidy from one sector of production to the other. While hampering growth, the subsidy impacts positively on inflation and, as shown below, also on the debt sustainability of transition economies. Furthermore, structurally relatively more flexible economies might find it more difficult to satisfy one or the other of the criteria compared with relatively less flexible economies, with the Maastricht criteria seemingly punishing those among the transition economies that are set to make rapid progress toward catching up to mature economies. This raises the question whether judging transition economies according to the Maastricht criteria really sorts countries in meaningful ways. Furthermore, it raises the question whether for a transition economy an extreme focus on meeting these criteria may be a retarding element toward catching up to mature market economies. The theoretical framework is a two-sector supply side model of a small open economy with endogenous industrial structure and cross-sectoral subsidies. Differences in productivity growth between sectors are the core drivers of structural change. The degree of pass-through from the productivity growth differential to structural change is, however, determined by a country's structural status quo. Hence, identical impulses for structural change may have different effects on structurally distinct countries. The residual part of the incentives for change will turn up as structural inflation. The basic message of the paper is that when assessing the compatibility/incompatibility of the Maastricht criteria on debt and inflation, it is not just an economy's growth that matters but also the composition of growth, as well as the country's position on the transition trajectory, as described by its industrial structure. The model questions the one size fits all approach even when only considering the class of transition economies. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: the second chapter presents the model and our distinction between mature and transition economies; the third chapter considers economies where sector sizes are fixed; the fourth chapter allows for changes in sector size and opens up channels between transition, debt and inflation, respectively; the fifth part analyzes the potential Maastricht incompatibility among different transition economies; and the last part concludes.",2

The first group consists of those countries in which the law requires domestic firms to adopt a single-tier board system whereby a single corporate board carries out the dual functions of execution of the business and management control. Many countries, including the US, the UK, and Japan, are in this category. The second group consists of those countries where the law requires domestic firms to adopt a multi-tier board system in which the dual functions reported above are shared by multiple boards through the division of tasks. It is well known that German company law requires the establishment of a board of directors and of a supervisory board. In addition to Germany, countries in this group include the Netherlands, Denmark, Iceland, Estonia, Lithuania, and some other European countries as well as China, Taiwan, and some other Asian countries. Lastly, the third group consists of those countries in which corporate law allows domestic firms to arbitrarily select either a single-tier board system or a multi-tier board system under certain conditions. For example, French firms are allowed to choose either an Anglo-American-style single-tier board system or a German-style double-tier board system. Countries in this group include Italy, Finland, and Latvia.Footnote 1 Russia, which has been adapting and upgrading its corporate law system since the collapse of the Soviet Union, also belongs to this third group. As we will explain later, in accordance with the Federal Law on Joint-Stock Companies (Law on JSCs), joint-stock companies that have been established in the territory of Russia may set up not only a board of directors (sovet direktorov in Russian) and a single executive body (edinolichnyi ispolnitelnyi organ), which refers to a top manager (CEO, President, or General Director), but also a collective executive board (kollegialnyi ispolnitelnyi organ) as a third corporate board in charge of the execution of company management (Law on JSCs, Chapter 8).Footnote 2 The establishment of a board of directors and that of a single executive body are enforced by law. In contrast, with regard to a collective executive board, the Law on JSCs does not contain any special requirements for either the establishment or the number of board members. These issues are left to each firm's discretion. Furthermore, each firm with a collective executive board is allowed to establish the scope of the board's authority, the ways of making resolutions, and other matters related to the board in the articles of incorporation to the extent that they do not conflict with the Law on JSCs and other laws (Shapkina, 2009). In this way, Russian firms can design their management control system with some degree of flexibility by utilizing a collective executive board. There is no doubt that the types and nature of corporate board systems have a strong influence on the direction and performance of company management and corporate governance. Accordingly, the determinants of the selection of a board system warrant study from the viewpoint of both organizational economics and corporate finance. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, in previous studies on relevant countries in which company law leaves the selection of a board system to a firm's discretion, there is no research on the firm-level determinants of board system choice, and, consequently, this issue remains unexplored. In this paper, using a unique data set of joint-stock companies based on a Japanese-Russian joint enterprise survey conducted in 2005, we cast light on a collective executive board as a core element of the multi-tier board system of Russian firms and empirically examine the determinants of the choice and size of this unique corporate organ. The history of joint-stock companies in Russia is so short that a large number of firms retain investors and management executives as their founding members. Furthermore, domestic firms in this country are changing their company organizations, including management control systems, as a matter of common practice in order to respond to the dramatic environmental changes during the transition period to a market economy. These circumstances provide a great opportunity to examine the impact of ownership structure, lineup of management executives, nature of a firm's organization, and business activities on the formation of a collective executive board in Russian firms. We show that about one-third of surveyed firms have a collective executive board with a membership ranging from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 23 persons. We also found that there are statistically significant gaps between different industrial sectors in terms of the probability of establishing a collective executive board and its membership size. Furthermore, the empirical analysis in this paper identified the factors that have a statistically significant and economically meaningful impact on firm-level decision making for the formation of a collective executive board, in line with our theoretical predictions. They include ownership by outside investors and management groups, presence of the federal government as a shareholder, affiliation with a business group through stock ownership, the relative authority and status of the top manager within his or her management group, the complexity of the company management, and differences in the form of incorporation. At the same time, our empirical evidence strongly suggests that Russian firms, in the pursuit of the internationalization of their business activities, might be avoiding the establishment of a collective executive board, which is a non-standard form of corporate governance from the viewpoint of international corporate governance systems. The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section looks into the legal framework of executive bodies in Russian joint-stock companies. The subsequent section describes the Japanese-Russian joint enterprise survey, and, based on the findings, it provides an overview of the actual state of the executive bodies and identifies its structural features. The latter section presents the testable hypotheses concerning the determinants of the choice and size of the collective executive board, and the penultimate section empirically tests these hypotheses. Finally, the last section summarizes the major findings and concludes the paper.",5

55,4,Comparative Economic Studies,04 April 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2013.5,Inflation and Sectoral Output Growth Variability in Bulgaria,December 2013,Muhammad Khan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Mild inflation and its impact on output growth or its variability has been a controversial research question in both the theoretical and empirical literature. Broadly speaking, monetarists and structuralists advance opposing views on the relationship between inflation and output growth or its variability. Monetarists argue that inflation affects relative prices, investment decisions and hiring and firing by firms. In this way, it entails high welfare cost for an economy (Lucas, 1973; Friedman, 1977) and hence must be avoided altogether. These propositions of the monetarists have also been complemented by a variety of endogenous growth models analyzed by Chari et al. (1996), where changes in monetary policy affect the long-run inflation rate and, as a result, output growth. The authors explain how the otherwise negligible effects of inflation on growth, shown by the endogenous growth literature, can become larger if we expand the notion of monetary policy (used by this literature) and incorporate financial regulations in it.Footnote 1 These overall negative effects of inflation on output growth have been further empirically substantiated by a range of studies (see Gylfason and Herbertsson, 2001, for a survey). Structuralists, on the other hand, support mild inflation for its role in enhancing output growth and reducing its variability when real markets are rigid and the economy is facing supply-side shocks. To this view, with the existence of real market distortions, an inflation target of zero or below is considered more costly in terms of output loss during recessions (Akerlof et al., 1996; Blanchard et al., 2010). Moreover, proponents of mild inflation also find some support from the policy rate discussion where a general consensus prevails that a slight positive inflation will yield an extra policy tool in terms of positive nominal interest rate. As recovery from recession requires a reduction in nominal interest rate, a higher nominal interest rate will keep this option open (William, 2009). This view has also been supported by the empirical literature in the last two decades that, following Fischer (1993), finds a non-linear relationship between inflation and output growth. This non-linearity in the inflation-growth relationship implies a positive effect of mild inflation and an adverse effect of high inflation on output growth. Papers bringing empirical substantiation to this view include Sarel (1996), Ghosh and Phillips (1998), Khan and Senhadji (2001), Burdekin et al. (2004), Omay and Kan (2010) and López-Villavicencio and Mignon (2011), among others. All these studies identify different inflation thresholds below which it is either innocuous to growth or exerts a positive influence on it and above these inflexion points it is growth inhibiting. Now, concerning the direct test of the inflation and output growth variability relationship, the empirical literature also brings same competing views on it.Footnote 2 Strangely, these conflicting results of the previous literature did not provoke a lot of literature on analyzing the direct relationship between these variables, rather this relationship is mostly tested indirectly; mainly through the relative-price-variability channel. More precisely, assuming a one-to-one relationship between relative price variability and the variability of output growth, the literature generally tested the link between inflation and relative price variability and found a positive relationship between the two variables.Footnote 3 However, Parsley (1996), in an attempt to test the effect of inflation on relative price variability, found that the effect of inflation on relative price variability is not very persistent and hence the welfare implications through this channel are minor. Therefore, to assess the effects of inflation on output growth, it is imperative to test this link directly. Iscan and Osberg (1998), inspired by Parsley's remarks, examined the direct effect of inflation on output growth variability and found a very fragile relationship between these two variables (see also Blanchard and Simon, 2001). All these ambiguities of the previous literature note that the direct testing of the inflation and output growth variability relationship is not sufficiently addressed, and the results of the existing studies are not robust. This paper aims to bring some further empirical substantiation on this issue. Besides, this study tries to fill three other major deficiencies in the existing literature. First, the previous studies are based on developed economies with very low and stable inflationary regimes. The issues related to the emerging economies working under a wide range of inflation are not analyzed.Footnote 4 Second, the previous literature assumed linearity in the inflation and the sectoral output growth variability relationship (ie Iscan and Osberg, 1998), and any possible threshold in the relationship between these two variables is not probed. Finally, the influence of some specific monetary policy arrangements on this relationship has not been addressed before. The unique currency board setting of the Bulgarian economy (to be discussed in the next section) allows the government to ‘exclusively’ influence the money supply, which can cause abrupt inflation changes in an otherwise stable monetary regime. Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, inflation is positively linked with both cross-sectional output growth variability (consistent with Iscan and Osberg (1998) and average output growth in Bulgaria). This supports the structuralists’ view regarding the effects of inflation on long-run growth. As Bulgaria is a small open economy, it is more vulnerable to both supply and demand shocks.Footnote 5 The role of a currency board under these conditions becomes important to assure stability and to reduce extra inflation pressure from the economy. Furthermore, in contrast to the US, the Bulgarian economy also faces a structural change, causing larger output changes across sectors. Output growth variability under these conditions does not necessarily lead to lower average output growth.Footnote 6 Finally, our findings do not support the existence of a non-linearity in the inflation-growth relationship; supporting the view that there is no threshold inflation for Bulgaria. Since developing economies are characterized by financial market imperfections and structural rigidities emanating from protective labor markets, any particular threshold inflation is hard to define (Singh and Kalirajan, 2003). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section highlights some key characteristics of the Bulgarian currency board. The subsequent section describes the methodology and the main specifications. The latter section presents the data set used in the study. The penultimate section reports the main results obtained. The final section concludes.",

Recently, however, CIS members have become more vulnerable to global shocks (EBRD, 2012). In particular, during the global financial crisis, output declined and the exchange rate depreciated in all CIS countries. This led to concerns of a rebound to instability and high inflation. The majority of the CIS members operate a managed float exchange rate regime. With the exception of Russia, they are predominantly small and import-dependent economies (especially regarding their energy consumption). Understanding exchange rate pass-through, defined as the impact of the exchange rate on domestic prices, is therefore important to policymakers with regard to the stabilization of CIS economies following the global financial crisis. Using monthly data, we investigate exchange rate pass-through from the US dollar (USD) and the Euro on the consumer price index (CPI) between January 1999 and March 2010. First, we compare the exchange rate pass-through in the short run using VAR models for the individual countries and in the long run by applying panel cointegration methods. Second, we compare the exchange rate pass-through from the USD and from the Euro. Although the members of the CIS share a common history of nearly 70 years in the Soviet Union with central planning, there are enormous differences among the economies in their transition to a market economy (Pomfret, 2003). We exclude Belarus, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan from the empirical analysis, as some prices in these countries are administered, which might cause a significant estimation bias of the exchange rate pass-through. Azerbaijan had a currency reform in 2006, which leaves a very short stable period for the estimation of exchange rate pass-through up until the global financial crisis. Therefore, our empirical analysis focuses on Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine. We do not include the remaining former Soviet Union countries (Baltic States) because they face very different international and institutional conditions within the European Union. We build upon the work by Korhonen and Wachtel (2006), which is the only study that estimates exchange rate pass-through in more than one CIS country and has a comparative focus. We extend their analysis in several dimensions. First, we update the original results that are based on the years 1999–2004. This is of particular relevance, as we want to investigate the impact of the economic stabilization and increased vulnerability to global shocks, which had not occurred within the time period of Korhonen and Wachtel's analysis. Second, we provide a first estimate of the long-run exchange rate pass-through in a panel cointegration framework for CIS countries. Although theories of exchange rate pass-through contain a long-run steady-state relationship between domestic prices and the exchange rate, the long-run dimension is often disregarded in the empirical literature. Our estimation of long-run exchange rate pass-through follows on from the work of de Bandt et al. (2008), who study long-run pass-through for euro area countries. We estimate exchange rate pass-through in the short run to be between 30% and 50% with regard to the USD, and around 20% for the Euro. Our results confirm that the application of the long-run approach to exchange rate pass-through is highly important in the CIS countries. In the long run, we confirm a higher extent of the exchange rate pass-through (above 60%) for both USD and the Euro. The paper is structured as follows. The next section provides a brief but comprehensive literature review with regard to publications estimating exchange rate pass-through in one or more CIS countries. The section ‘Empirical analysis’ presents the empirical analysis, and the section ‘Conclusions’ concludes.",6

Here, we understand the term ‘structural change’ as changes in the relative importance of the agricultural, manufacturing and service sectors, measured either in terms of value added or employment.Footnote 1 The structural change literature provides impressive evidence that this process usually goes along with an increasing share of services in GDP and in employment (see, eg, Fuchs, 1968; Kuznets, 1971; Maddison, 1989, 1995, 2007a; Kongsamut et al., 2001). China still has, in comparison with other countries at similar stages of development, a low share of services in GDP and in employment. This paper argues that this will (or has to) change for both economic and socio-political reasons. It also stresses that the implications for the economic and the political system of China are significant. The paper is structured as follows. The next section ‘The service sector in China in comparison’ shows that the service sector in China is ‘relatively small’ compared with other developed and developing countries in their historical context of structural change. The subsequent section ‘Why the service sector in China has to change’ discusses – against the background of the experiences of former emerging economies that have, in the meantime, progressed towards ‘developed’ economies – why the service sector in China has to change. The penultimate section ‘Challenges China is confronted with in the context of ongoing structural change’ analyzes the challenges that China is confronted with in relation to ongoing structural change. The final section ‘Implications and conclusions’ draws some policy implications and then concludes.",10

In the context of civil war it is unlikely that a country is able to produce near an efficient level because of increased transaction costs associated with the lack of formal political and economic institutions, as well as the disruption of informal norms of trust. The economic growth literature has found a robust relationship between capital accumulation, measured as investment as a percentage of GDP, and economic growth (Barro, 1991; Johnson et al., 2005). Collier (1995, 1999) applies the neoclassical growth model to civil war recovery, suggesting that long wars will be followed by a robust recovery because of the re-accumulation of capital per worker, will cause above steady state growth. Collier finds evidence for his theory; however, he does not explicitly measure investment or the capital stock,Footnote 1 but rather implies the role of capital accumulation from differences in recoveries between long and short civil wars. The only study of post-civil-war economies that explicitly controls for investment finds that it is insignificant in determining the pace of recovery, and that political institutions are more important (David et al., 2011). The present paper finds evidence that investment is a significant determinant of civil war recovery, as the neoclassical model predicts, but only once economic intuitions are introduced into the model. The importance of institutions in structuring the incentives of economic exchange have been expounded by North (1990) and Olson (1996), and tested by Acemoglu et al. (2001). The empirical growth and institutions literatures are synthesized by Hall et al. (2010) who use an interaction between institutional quality and growth in capital stock; their main finding is that capital accumulation contributes to GDP per capita growth, but only in the presence of quality institutions. Most game-theoretic models of civil conflict are structured as a competition over an asset where institutions that protect property rights are weak or undefined, and where agents expend resources in the creation of effective property rights (Grossman, 2001; Hirshleifer, 1989). Motivated by these models and the empirical regularity that institutional structures are in flux during a conflict and continue to be uncertain during the post-conflict period, I apply the logic of Hall, Sobel and Crowley to the post-civil war recovery (Collier et al., 2003). I investigate the relationship between investment as a percentage of GDP and an index of legal and property rights institutions; and the growth of GDP per capita during the post-conflict recovery period. To capture the interdependence between institutions and investment, I run growth regressions using an interaction between an index of property rights and legal institutions, and investment as a percentage of GDP. I find that weak and uncertain institutions inhibit investment from contributing to economic recovery in the post-conflict environment. Once institutional structures have been established and trust has been built in those institutions, investment, in particular private investment, can once again become an important factor in economic recovery. The results in this paper constitute the first empirical support of investment-led recovery from civil war, confirming Collier’s peace dividend hypothesis, once controls for institutions are considered. Concurrently, I find evidence that a minimum proportion of investment to GDP is required for stronger institutions to contribute to post-conflict recovery, demonstrating the interdependence of these two factors. These results are of policy relevance in that post-conflict recovery depends on high levels of productive investment, which requires sound legal and property rights institutions.",13

Figure 1 plots per capita income growth and the Gini coefficient of inequality for the period 1975–2009.Footnote 1 Riskin et al (2002) While incomes grew 26 fold, the Gini coefficient more than doubled. characterize this recent period of economic transition with a fitting book title, China’s Retreat from Equality. Per capita income growth and the Gini coefficient of inequality (China, 1975–2009)Data Sources: The World Bank (2012) and National Bureau of Statistics (2000) During their tenure as Party General Secretary, Hu and Premier Wen proposed a model of development called the Harmonious Society. Their aim was to reduce inequality and redirect the strategic planning away from the current ‘GDP First and Welfare Second’ policies. Hu and Wen recognized that certain segments of the Chinese population had been left behind and took a number of high-profile trips to the poorest areas of China with the stated goal of understanding these areas better. Hu and Wen also attempted to move China away from a policy of favoring economic growth at all costs and toward a more balanced view of growth that factors in social inequality and environmental damage. In order to assess Chinese people’s responses to rising inequality during a period of economic transition we incorporate data from two sources, the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) and the World Values Survey (WVS). Both of these data sources contain responses to questions related to income distribution. These questions contain subtle differences in their wording and may elicit different responses from the respondents. However, in each case we hypothesize that those who have benefitted most from the economic reforms will be less critical of the current income distribution. While there is much anecdotal evidence in the press (c.f., Xinhua News Service, 2005) as well as in statements by government leaders (see above quotation) that the Chinese people believe that the current growth path is ‘unfair’ there has been very little systematic research on this topic. Wang and Davis (2008) and Whyte (2010) provide evidence from the 2004 China Justice Survey that more than 80% of urban households considered income inequality ‘too large’. Furthermore, in the same data they find that more than 70% of households found that the income distribution became ‘more polarized’. Han and Whyte (2009) use survey data on opinions of distributive injustice in China to assess the likelihood of widespread discontent. Similar to Knight et al. (2009) who study happiness, Han and Whyte find that subjective variables (such as feelings about the degree of corruption) are more useful than objective variables such as age and education. Han and Whyte state that ‘distributive injustice attitudes in any society are influenced not simply by current objective status positions, but also and sometimes even more powerfully by subjective factors’, such as subjective perceptions of one’s social status, past experiences with upward and downward mobility, relative aspirations and using other reference groups to judge one’s success or failure. They conclude that ‘objective status is a poor guide to perceptions of current inequalities as unjust, subjective measures of relative status and mobility experiences are a much better guide’. Han and Whyte (2008) compare popular attitudes toward distributive injustice between Beijing and Warsaw. They suggest that ‘it is apparent that objective social status predictors generally have fairly weak and inconsistent associations with the four distributive injustice scales’ and conclude that ‘generally subjective predictors have stronger and more consistent association with these distributive justice scales than do the demographic and objective social status measures’. Grosfeld and Senik (2010) provide evidence of changing attitudes to inequality during the transition to a market economy. They argue that ‘the subjective perception of inequality is one of the key elements of the attitudes toward reforms’ (p. 2). Similar to the case of China they find ‘increasing public sentiment that the process of income distribution is flawed and corrupt’ (p. 1). Finally, Sanfey and Teksoz (2007) use the WVS to study the effect of economic transitions on subjective well-being. They find mixed results in terms of the relationship between happiness and inequality. For non-transition countries, a higher Gini coefficient is associated with higher levels of reported happiness. For transition economies, they find the opposite result that they attribute to a ‘lingering dislike of inequality that was characteristic of socialist systems’ (p.726). The use of subjective variables in analyzing people’s attitude toward fairness can be problematic. For example, there may be cognitive factors that affect the way people answer the survey questions. Furthermore, the ordering of the questions can affect the answers: if people are asked their employment status before being asked about primary factors of inequality, it is more likely for them to answer ‘unemployment’ in the later question. The survey wording is also important. People often provide different answers based on the positive or negative framing of the question. Finally, the social nature of the survey procedure also appears to play a large role in shaping answers to subjective questioning. Respondents might try to avoid answering questions that might bring negative consequences to themselves such as questions about income, tax, and other social issues when the survey is administrated by a government agent. These survey design issues result in several possible sources of measurement error. First, the mean of the measurement errors will not necessarily be zero within a survey. For instance, this could be caused by the design of the survey such as positive/negative framing, and as a result the upward and downward biases may not cancel each other in the survey sample. In addition, the measurement error may be correlated with observable individual characteristics. It is also possible that the misreporting/accuracy of the questions may vary in different demographic groups. For example, in politically more liberal regions citizens may be more likely to point to corruption as a source of distribution unfairness. For a more complete discussion of measurement error in survey data see Greene (2012, pp. 784–798). One way to address the criticisms of subjective survey results is to use multiple data sets. In our empirical analysis we use both the CHIP and WVS data. We also estimate alternative models using different measures of income to assess the robustness of our analysis and comment on the predictive power of various control variables.",1

Drawing from their list, I chose the following variables to hold constant so that the impact of the systemic transition could be isolated in my regression analysis.
 
Per capita GDP: According to the well-known Kuznets hypothesis, per capita GDP should lead to a low degree of economic inequality in economically undeveloped and agricultural nations and should then rise as countries begin to industrialize since the average income differences between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors increase. However, after a certain point as the modern sector grows and the agricultural sector’s share in GDP declines, income inequality should begin to fall. The empirical support of this hypothesis is mixed (Angeles, 2010), and for the countries in my sample, the facts do not consistently support this hypothesis. For the regressions reported below, the calculated coefficients of per capita GDP and its square are statistically significant, income inequality rises after a point as per capita GDP increases.Footnote 2
 
Governmental expenditures on social protection: Although governments’ transfers to the low-income population are designed to equalize income in a nation, the actual outcome of such expenditures depends in part on the efficiency of the system (Afonso et al., 2010), which cannot be determined with the data at hand. I measure these transfers by the ratio of governmental social protection expenditures to GDP and find, as expected, that inequality is lower where such expenditures are higher. 
Trade openness: The ratio of exports and imports to GDP can have two opposite impacts on income inequality. By providing more competition for domestic producers, economic rents from trade protection are lower and, as a result, economic inequality is lower. On the other hand, a country’s trade with nations having lower wages can have a negative impact on domestic wages and can increase income inequality in the importing higher-income nation. I calculate this openness variable as an average for the years 1990 through 2000 and it proves a significant determinant in some of the reported regressions. 
Transition economy: This is measured by a dummy variable and the regressions are calculated both with and without it. The eight transition countries covered in the calculations are the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia. I also tested several other possible determinants of income inequality, but found no significant relationships and therefore dropped them from the final regressions. These included national attitudes toward income inequality, two macro variables for the period 1900–2000, educational quality, spatial segregation of ethnic, language, and religious groups, land area and population density.Footnote 3",8
56,1,Comparative Economic Studies,05 December 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2013.29,Institutional Resilience and Economic Systems: Lessons from Elinor Ostrom’s Work,March 2014,Paul Dragos Aligica,Vlad Tarko,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The increasing public salience of themes related to economic, political and environmental crises has marked the contemporary public debate and brought to the limelight the problem of how societies cope with the challenges posed by natural catastrophes, social and political disruption, and economic shocks. The capability of social systems to withstand deep turbulence, to survive shocks and to ensure the continuity of their most basic functions has been revealed and reaffirmed as fundamental. Yet, although the relevance of the issue is unequivocal, economics and political science have yet to cope with the challenge. Fields such as comparative politics or comparative economic systems have very few things to say when it comes to the topic of resilience. There are entire literatures dedicated to various facets, elements and features of social systems or to performance evaluation standards such as efficiency, growth, freedom, equality etc (Gregory and Stuart, 1999a, 1999b). The list of these ‘systemic functions’, ‘performance areas’ and ‘system performance criteria’ may vary from author to author but the core elements are always present in one form or another. Frederic Pryor (2005, p. 32) lists the following performance indicators: economic growth, economic stability, dynamic efficiency, static efficiency of production, consumer sovereignty, and an equitable distribution of income and wealth. But he notes that the list is open. Other indicators may be added to it: a low level of unemployment or underemployment; a high degree of economic security; a low degree of concentration of economic power; a lack of exploitation etc. In the same vein, M. Bornstein (1994) outlines a set of criteria that comprise the following: The level and the rate of growth of output; the composition of output; single period (‘static’) and inter-temporal (‘dynamic’) efficiency; stability of output, employment and prices; economic security; equity and equality of opportunity; economic freedoms of consumption, property and occupational choice. Similar lists of functional criteria and indicators are a trademark of the comparative economic systems literature but for the purposes of our discussion the point is not so much what is on such list but what has been neglected, what constantly fails to make the list. It is very interesting that although it is so obvious that ‘the ultimate test of an economic system is its long-term viability’ (Gregory and Stuart, 1999a, 1999b, p. 47), the problem failed to become an object of active and intense research interest. Nonetheless, resilience is a fundamental condition for the very existence of a system and indeed, for its performance. To find more consistent contributions, one needs to step outside the mainstream social sciences, in an interdisciplinary area emerging at the boundary between social and environmental sciences. There one could find that the interest in the topic has taken many forms but one of the most significant research directions has started to converge around notions such as ‘institutional resilience’, ‘institutional robustness’ and correlate concepts such as ‘institutional adaptability’ or ‘institutional vulnerability’. The institutional resilience and adaptability theme has received a great boost in 2009, when Elinor Ostrom, one of the key authors leading the effort to develop and apply this perspective, has received the Nobel Prize in Economics for her contribution to the study of governance and institutional arrangements. Yet, despite the potential, its integration in mainstream political economy still remains more a desideratum than a reality. The objective of this paper is to illuminate and draw attention to Ostrom’s contribution in this regard and implicitly to show how Ostrom’s work opens the way for incorporating the theme of resilience in comparative economic systems and institutional analysis. With this end in view, the article will introduce a set of important insights regarding resilience as they emerge from the work of Ostrom and her associates, will present them systematically, and will explain their significance. The article is organized around the following key insights: (1) Institutions are critical because the structure and functioning of institutional arrangements are the key to social and economic systems’ resilience both with respect to natural disasters and endogenous social-economic developments. (2) Social rules are the basic constitutive unit of institutional arrangements and, as such, they represent the conceptual backbone of resilience analysis and design. (3) Institutional design focusing only on efficiency often leads to a system of rules with ‘highly optimized tolerance’ (HOT) to specific sources of risk, evaluated in the light of previous experience and data. Focusing exclusively on efficiency often misses the point because, while efficiency can only be assessed in terms of risk, the system is also vulnerable to wider problems of uncertainty. Hence, a trade-off between efficiency and resilience often exists and needs to be considered. (4) Resilience is more than mere ‘absorptive capacity’ or ‘speed of recovery’. Resilience is a function of innovation and creative socio-cultural adaptation, and alternative systems of rules vary in their ability to be conducive to innovation and adaptation. The underlying argument of the article is that the notion of resilience needs to be further developed and that better methods to operationally deal with it are needed. It encourages a conceptualization that goes beyond the current emphasis on the ‘socio-ecological’ facet, (ie only on the relationship between natural resources and the social system). The concept of resilience can and should be understood and developed in more general terms, by taking a closer look at the forces and factors that are endogenous to the social and economic system. Institutions matter. The social-institutional facet is crucial even within the current conceptualization of resilience defined within the socio-ecological systems (man–nature interaction) framework but even more so when it comes to endogenous socio-economic dynamics. The key corollary is that both approaches, in order to be meaningful, require, sooner or later, the employment of a certain type of social theory whose conceptual structure is best suited to capture the intricate dimensions of adaptability in social systems. This social theory is institutionalism, a middle range theory having Ostrom as one of its main promoters.",44

In countries such as Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, for example, retail clients now hold a similar or larger share of their loans in foreign currency than do corporations (European Central Bank, 2010). These retail loans in foreign currency are popularly believed to be ‘small men's carry trades’, that is, loans in which households and entrepreneurs seek lower interest rates and take unhedged exchange rate risk upon themselves (see Sorsa et al., 2007 and Beer et al., 2010).Footnote 2 Empirical work, due to a lack of micro data, has yet to investigate in detail the drivers for the rapid expansion of foreign currency mortgages and car loans to households in transition countries in the decade before the financial crisis. In Brown et al. (2011), we document, however, that foreign currency borrowing by small firms in transition countries is strongly related to their foreign currency revenues and age, an oft-used proxy for the availability of public information about the firm, than it is to between-country interest rate differentials. Degryse et al. (2012) show that foreign banks that enter via greenfield investment, and hence face an acute information asymmetry about potential borrowers, lend more in foreign currency than do foreign banks that take over existing local banks (that have established relationships with local firms).Footnote 3 Brown and De Haas (2012) confirm that foreign-owned banks lend more in foreign currency to corporate clients but not to households than do domestic banks. This evidence suggests that information asymmetries may actually limit the provision of foreign currency loans to the more financially opaque retail clients. Hence, an information asymmetry between banks and firms may be a key determinant of the demand and supply of foreign currency loans. Our paper fills a gap in the theoretical literature by introducing information asymmetry in a framework that also features a trade-off between the cost and risk of firm debt. Assuming an interest rate differential in favor of foreign currency funds, we compare the currency structure of borrowing by small firms under two information conditions. Under perfect information, banks can verify the currency in which the firms contract their sales. Under imperfect information, the banks cannot verify the currency structure of firms’ revenues. Our model confirms that under perfect information all foreign currency earners and all local currency earners with low distress costs will choose foreign currency loans. By contrast, local currency earning firms with high distress costs will prefer local currency loans. Under imperfect information, more local earners will borrow in foreign currency, as these firms do not bear the full cost of the corresponding default risk. The intuition behind this result is the following: as the banks cannot distinguish the risky from the safe FX borrowers, they will charge a single interest rate to both types. This interest rate will be lower than the interest rate that prevails when the banks can identify the risky firms. Thus, it will be profitable for the risky firms to pool with safe firms and pay a lower risk premium for a foreign currency loan. Consequently, our model identifies the information asymmetry between lending banks and borrowing firms as a so-far overlooked potential driver of dollarization or euroization in credit markets. We establish the conditions under which all firms will be borrowing in foreign currency (full pooling equilibria), as well as when no foreign currency loans will be offered by banks to firms that cannot prove they have either high or foreign currency income (market failure). The key predictions of our model are consistent with suggestive evidence in Brown et al. (2011) in which we document that foreign currency borrowing by small firms in transition countries significantly decreases in their age (though not in two alternative yet crude proxies for the existing bank–firm information asymmetry, ie, whether the firm was audited or received income through a bank account). Our result is also consistent with the recent evidence in Degryse et al. (2012) who find that foreign banks that enter via greenfield investment, and that may face more information asymmetry than those foreign banks that enter via domestic takeovers, lend more in foreign currency. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The literature is reviewed in the next section. Then our model assumptions are introduced, followed by the analysis of the model with perfect information. In the last-but-one section, imperfect information is introduced. The last section concludes.",12
56,1,Comparative Economic Studies,05 December 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2013.26,Why Do Large Firms Opt for Islamic Loans?,March 2014,Laurent Weill,Christophe Godlewski,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There has been an enormous expansion of Islamic financing activities over the past two decades. The Financial Times put the value of the industry globally at $1 trillion in 2010 (Financial Times Special Report, 2009), up from $140 billion in 1995 (Blominvest, 2009). These activities are of particular importance in the Middle East and Southeast Asia in countries with large Muslim populations. However, despite considerable practitioner-generated material on Islamic financial products, the academic literature remains distinctly thin with regard to discussion on the causes and consequences of this phenomenon. A number of studies analyze the differences in behavior between Islamic banks and conventional banks (eg, Cihak and Hesse, 2010; Weill, 2011; Beck et al., 2013). Their main conclusion is that the expansion of Islamic banking is unlikely to have any major economic impact because differences in behavior from other banks are slight. Even so, the dearth of literature on the emergence of Islamic finance is difficult to explain. For example, the intuition that Islamic finance simply is an extension of the share of the Muslim population in a country does not consistently hold true. Malaysia hosts a vibrant Islamic finance industry in comparison to Turkey, whereas the share of Muslims in the population is much lower. One approach to gathering evidence on what might be driving lenders and borrowers to favor Islamic bank loans over conventional loans is to examine those areas where Islamic banking flourishes. Our aim in this paper is to investigate the determinants of the choice of an Islamic loan over a conventional loan. To this end, we employ a dataset of syndicated loans containing Islamic and conventional loans from countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia for the period 2001–2009. A syndicated loan is a risk-spreading form of financing that requires at least two banks to grant funds jointly to a borrower. Focusing on syndicated loans has two advantages. First, information on single-issuer loans is difficult to obtain and tends to be confined to studies using loan-level information for one country (eg, Baele et al., 2012, for Pakistan). In contrast, the data on syndicated loans are readily available and provide a basis for cross-country analysis. Second, syndicated loans are typically granted to large companies, which allows us to focus on major corporate financial decisions. However, our results also provide relevant information for all types of loans because syndicated loans are lending transactions in which information asymmetries are notably involved. We test several hypotheses to examine three categories of potential determinants of the choice of an Islamic loan. First, we test the influence of loan-specific determinants. We verify whether loan characteristics might influence the choice of a type of loan. It can indeed happen that borrowers are restricted in their choice of loan by the fact that banks are not willing to provide a similar loan in terms of maturity and amount if it is an Islamic or a conventional one. Borrowers may assume that the different nature of Islamic financings leads to a different default risk. Second, we test the impact of borrower-specific determinants with the hypothesis that the financial condition of the borrowing firm exerts an influence on the choice of loan. Godlewski et al. (2013) show that companies issuing sukuk were more likely to be in worse financial shape than firms issuing conventional bonds. Therefore, we ask whether the same distinction holds true for firms seeking bank debt financing. If borrowers with poorer financial status are resorting to Islamic financing, this practice should be reflected in lower loan quality for Islamic banks and should hamper their expansion. Third, we analyze the influence of country-specific determinants. Under country-specific determinants, we look at the prevalence of Islamic religious practice in a country, the quality of institutions, and levels of financial development and economic development. We test the hypothesis that religious practice in Islam plays a significant role. Furthermore, a key assumption is that better quality of institutions might favor the use of Islamic loans. Islamic loans are particularly dependent on the quality of institutions because their implementation involves more legal costs than those associated with conventional loans. As a consequence, the use of these loans should be favored by enhanced quality of institutions through better law enforcement or lower corruption that contributes to reduce legal costs. We find that loan and borrower characteristics do not appear to influence the choice of an Islamic loan. However, the share of the Muslim population in a country, the quality of institutions, and financial development play a role in this choice. This study hopefully offers insight into this interesting and evolving area of global finance. The results may even be of use to authorities seeking to understand some of the factors that might lead large firms to choose Islamic loans over conventional loans. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses Islamic syndicated finance. The section after that develops the tested determinants of the choice of an Islamic loan. The subsequent section describes the data. The empirical results are reported in the penultimate section. We provide our concluding remarks in the last section.",3

Because the United States struggled with similar problems in its founding era more than two centuries ago, many of the efforts involved comparisons and contrasts of the American and EUs, often with reference to how the Americans ‘got things right’ and suggestions from the American experience as to what Europe might do now to get things right. The focus of these comparative forays, at least as regards the American founding era, has been on the noted American statesman and financial genius, Alexander Hamilton (1757–1804), who served in President George Washington’s cabinet as the new US government’s first Secretary of the Treasury.Footnote 1 While Treasury Secretary from 1789 to 1795, Hamilton deftly executed a complex program of fiscal re-organization and financial reform that transformed a weak confederation of individual US states into a strong American Union and nation state. Hamilton also designed his program to launch modern economic growth – increases of real GDP per capita of roughly 1% or more per annum – in the United States, and that was a happy result of it. What Hamilton and his allies in the first US Congress (1789–1791) and federal administration (1789–1793) under the Constitution accomplished is of obvious interest to a EU marked by indecision, seemingly incapable of taking bold actions, and with parts of it mired in economic recession. There is, however, another and earlier story of the American founding era that is seldom mentioned in the modern comparative accounts but might prove of equal interest to Europeans. A decade before Hamilton worked his magic, another American leader, Robert Morris (1734–1806), was called in 1781 by the Confederation Congress, the national government of the United States until 1789, to become the nation’s Superintendent of Finance and asked to carry out much the same agenda that was given to Hamilton in 1789. For the most part, despite heroic efforts, Morris failed. As a consequence, he is little remembered by the world, including even Americans. Morris’s failure to achieve most of his goals resulted from the fact that the American Union then, like the EU now, was racked by indecision, seemingly incapable of taking bold actions, and mired in economic recession. In this essay I will compare and contrast Morris and Hamilton as finance ministers, delving into some reasons why the former failed and the latter succeeded. There is no doubt that the American Union more than two centuries ago was very different from the EU now. But the American story of Morris’s failures and Hamilton’s successes might give us some grounds for considering where Europe is now and where it might possibly be headed if it is to put its current problems behind it.",5

(New) OCA Theory versus Empirical Evidence from European Integration,June 2014,Helmut Wagner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"What can a new entrant into the EU/European Monetary Union (EMU) expect, convergence or divergence? This has always been a decisive question for new (or potential) entrants, a question that is grounded in the original goals of European integration. A major goal of the European integration process from the beginning was to achieve convergence in institutions/structures and in per capita output level among member countries. This was formulated in the preamble of the EC Treaty of 1957, namely to ‘strengthen the unity of [the] economies [of the member states] and to ensure their harmonious development by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured’ as well as, later on, in the preamble of the EU Treaty of 1992, namely to ‘achieve the strengthening and the convergence of their economies’. Thus, convergence (in institutions/structures and in GDP per capita level) was often expected in accession countries.Footnote 1 What makes the analysis of convergence so important is the fact that the non-attainment of this original goal, or even a divergent development within the union, would lead to disappointment within those countries that were falling behind, and could hurt the European integration process as a whole. Furthermore, it may produce the continuing need for bailing out (providing financial aid to) these countries (so creating a so-called ‘transfer union’).Footnote 2 This would lead to an increasing resistance and unwillingness in the financing member countries to stabilize the union in this way. In the end, this could lead to a destabilization, and in the worst case, to dissolution of the European Union. This danger manifests itself in the current so-called ‘Euro Crisis’. Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008, increasingly divergent developments and an increase in macroeconomic imbalances have appeared in the European Union. In particular, in the so-called GIPS countries (Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) severe contractions have led to an increasing variance (across Eurozone member countries) not only of unemployment, economic growth, current account imbalances, government debt and, especially, interest rates but also in measures of institutional and governance quality (see Wagner, 2013, Estrada et al., 2013, and Schönfelder and Wagner, 2014). This has created political and social tensions within the EMU. The question arises as to whether this endangers the survival of the European Union, or, at least, of the EMU. In fact, it has nourished doubts in the public about the stability of the Eurozone or its ability to survive. These doubts are not new and are grounded in the so-called Optimal Currency Area (OCA) literature. The paper argues that the OCA theory led to the establishment of the euro, or the specific kind and timing of the European monetary integration process. Between the Maastricht Treaty and the introduction of the euro in 1999, it was clear that not all OCA conditions would be met. However, a new OCA theory was developed (inside and outside the EU-Commission) as an explanation or rationalization why the euro was a good idea anyway. But the developments expected by the new OCA theory have not come about, witness the sovereign crisis. Therefore one may argue that the early introduction of the euro in many countries was a bad or too ambitious an idea. The paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the OCA Theory and asks why its lessons have been disregarded or downplayed in the European integration process. A main role in this downplaying has been played by the so-called ‘New OCA Theory’, particularly its endogeneity hypothesis. The following section critically analyzes this endogeneity hypothesis. The subsequent section looks at the lessons from the history of European integration and examines the facts with respect to convergence and divergence in the EU/EMU. The penultimate section highlights some politico-economic interpretations and draws some implications. The last section concludes.",7

Exchange rate movements, in turn, influence the value of foreign currency-denominated reserves and often provide the impetus for capital control measures. This paper examines the relationship between exchange rates, capital controls and foreign reserves, focusing on changes in each of these measures in the non-Eurozone (non-EZ) European countries during the global financial crisis and recovery. There were significant exchange rate realignments among non-EZ European countries during the global financial crisis. Most of these countries experienced unusually large changes in the relative value of their currency against the US dollar as well as the Euro. While some of these same countries introduced capital controls and depleted reserves, other countries continued to maintain reserve levels while allowing the exchange rate to fully absorb the global shock. One explanation for why reserves did not always co-move with exchange rates during the crisis is that large pre-crisis reserve accumulations in some countries seem to have provided protection against the market forces that battered currency values in countries with less substantial accumulations. The causes and consequences of exchange rate movements are not well understood. Even when governments apparently successfully intervene to change the international value of their domestic currency, as Japan recently seems to have done, or succeed at stabilizing the value of the domestic currency, as Switzerland continues to do, the implications of these exchange rate policies for broader macroeconomic stabilization and economic growth remain contentious. Less controversial is the view that exchange rate crises have significant negative effects on growth. Thus while the literature continues to debate the relative benefits of fixed versus flexible exchange rate regimes, with recent empirical studies concluding that the choice of exchange rate regime makes little difference (Rose, 2011), studies focused on unusually large and rapid exchange rate movements provide an unequivocal policy directive: countries should avoid situations that evolve into currency crises.Footnote 1 Governments have a number of policy tools that, at least in theory, can be used to manage exchange rates and counteract undesirable capital flows. If market pressure is toward an undesired rise in the relative value of the domestic currency, authorities can: (1) accumulate foreign reserves, (2) lower interest rates to discourage capital inflows, or (3) impose capital inflow controls. The tools available to countries facing undesired downward pressure on the relative value of the domestic currency are mirror images, though sales of foreign reserves are importantly constrained by the size of the country’s accumulated stock, and evidence suggests controls on capital outflows are more difficult to maintain than those on inflows (Dell’Ariccia et al., 1999). The currency crisis-prevention toolkit is importantly constrained by the international finance trilemma. Policy makers would like to use monetary policy to control interest rates and help stabilize the economy, allow free mobility of capital inflows and outflows, and at the same time maintain a stable exchange rate. The crux of the trilemma is that countries cannot simultaneously achieve all three of these goals. If countries allow capital mobility, they must choose between monetary policy independence and exchange rate stability. Likewise, if exchange rate stability is considered paramount, countries must give up monetary policy unless they are willing to impose capital controls. The role of reserves in the trilemma has generally been assumed to be minor.Footnote 2 Reserves are essential as part of the mechanics of stabilizing exchange rates, but their potential ability to deter currency market speculation, and in so doing mitigate trilemma trade-offs, has not been emphasized. The non-EZ European countries provide an interesting set of case studies showing the important role that reserves can play for countries where a priori preferences for exchange rate stability are high. Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia and Lithuania are all examples of countries that had high foreign reserve accumulations (as a share of GDP) prior to the financial crisis, and as a result were able to maintain relatively stable exchange rates, especially against the euro. Non-EZ European countries with relatively low pre-crisis accumulations of reserves, including Iceland, Poland, Sweden and Turkey, experienced much larger exchange rate movements during the financial crisis. This paper will document the relationship between pre-crisis reserve accumulations and exchange rate movements among the non-EZ European countries, and will show that reserves seem to provide protection for currencies only if countries are willing to deplete reserves in times of crisis. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania all had relatively high pre-crisis reserve accumulations, but these countries did not deplete reserves during the crisis and they each experienced large currency depreciations. Overall, the results in this paper indicate that countries with higher pre-crisis reserve accumulations (as a share of GDP) were better able to stabilize their exchange rates, as long as they were willing to also deplete reserves. This paper will begin with an examination of the de facto exchange rate regime classifications of the non-EZ European countries in order to understand the a priori preferences of these countries for exchange rate stability. The section ‘Reserves and exchange rate regimes’ will discuss the motives for reserve accumulation and how these motives relate to exchange rate regimes. It will also include an empirical examination of the conditions under which higher pre-crisis reserve accumulations protected non-EZ European countries from exchange rate instability during the crisis. The section ‘Capital controls and exchange rates’ will discuss the potential role for capital controls in exchange rate stabilization, and will examine the evidence for capital restrictions in the countries in our sample before and during the financial crisis. The section ‘Exchange rates and economic growth’ examines whether the non-EZ European countries that managed to maintain stable exchange rates during the financial crisis fared better (or worse), in terms of economic growth, than those countries that allowed their exchange rate to adjust. The final section of the paper provides conclusions.",4

The international model employs funds raised in one country to lend in another, often relying on wholesale funds or foreign exchange swap markets. In its pure form, the multinational model matches assets and liabilities in each country, with liabilities consisting largely of deposits. Quite apart from the multinational model’s surviving the global financial crisis better, regulatory and supervisory developments could give a further boost to this multinational model. This article reviews how the application in some jurisdictions of the newly agreed international bank liquidity standards and policies favoring subsidiaries over branches (‘subsidiarization’) could de-internationalize global banking in the sense of inducing banks to match assets and liabilities jurisdiction by jurisdiction. Such a development could pose risks, both to macroeconomic growth and to financial stability. First, if banks cease to perform any role in cross-border capital flows, then all the potential growth benefits of gross and net capital flows must be achieved only through portfolio and direct investment flows, which have their own limitations. Second, authorities may ex ante overstate the efficacy of purely national regulations and, ex post, find themselves relaxing the rules to allow banks to provide support to affiliates in the event of crisis. An alternative approach is international cooperation to ensure the strengthening of banks on a consolidated basis. If the stronger capital and liquidity standards as agreed in Basel III at the consolidated level were thoroughly implemented, they could temper the very understandable regulatory and supervisory impulse to require stand-alone subsidiaries. If feasible, this approach would be first-best. This article is structured as follows. The next section draws on and updates McCauley et al. (2012) to sketch long-standing trends in global banking and the effect of the global financial crisis. The following section provides a selective analysis of how policy initiatives may tend to fragmentFootnote 1 international banking. The final section concludes.",1

This question is not only of academic interest but also pertinent to policy discussions in the wide range of countries that have opened up their banking sectors to foreign investors over the past three decades. The process of financial globalisation during this period has resulted in high levels of foreign ownership of banks across the world. To name but a few examples, Spanish and Portuguese banks developed a presence in Latin America on the back of the strong cultural and trade links between this region and the Iberian Peninsula. Nigerian and South African banks created pan-African networks, while many of New Zealand’s banking assets are currently owned by Australian financial institutions. Yet banking integration has perhaps advanced the most between Western and Eastern Europe. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Western European banks bought former state banks and opened new affiliates, both branches and subsidiaries, across emerging Europe. Figure 1 shows that in many emerging European countries between 67% and 100% of all banking assets are nowadays in foreign hands. Banks with saturated home markets were particularly attracted to the region due to its scope for further financial deepening at high margins. Global banking across the globe Note: Foreign bank assets as a percentage of total banking assetsSource: Claessens and Van Horen (2014) and EBRD (2009) A rich literature has developed over the last two decades that evaluates the economic upsides and downsides of banking integration for countries, in particular emerging markets, that play host to multinational banks. This paper attempts to revise this literature in two steps. First, I briefly review the academic evidence on foreign bank entry in emerging markets as it stood at the time of the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008–2009. While numerous contributions focused on the positive impact of foreign bank entry on banking efficiency, I argue that many of the negative ‘surprises’ of the crisis – such as global banks’ role as conduits for cross-border shock transmission – were already well known before the crisis. Second, I discuss new empirical evidence that emerged in the wake of the crisis. Here I will highlight in particular the role of bank funding structure, over and above ownership structure, as a determinant of lending stability. Throughout the paper my emphasis will be on emerging Europe, as in this region the impact of multinational banking has been most pronounced.",9

A Practitioner’s View,June 2014,Freddy Van Den Spiegel,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the start of the banking crisis in October 2008, the debate about the advantages and risks of the globalization of the financial markets and the banking system has become increasingly critical. Financial integration is now considered to be one of the main transmission channels that transformed the problems in the US subprime mortgage market into a worldwide financial, economic and even political crisis. While for decades politicians, academics and bankers had been striving for free and integrated financial markets as a powerful contributor to stability and optimal capital allocation, the experience of the crisis has shifted toward issues such as the need for capital controls (Ostry et al., 2011), the advantages of a financial transaction tax (Persaud, 2012), and the need to ring fence financial markets and domestic savings (Blundell-Wignall et al., 2009). Given the significant cost of the crisis for society, this shift is not surprising, and a thorough review of the organization and functioning of the financial system is more than welcome. It is not a surprise that international banks, as major operators on the global financial markets, are also considered to be a potential threat to society. Their roles and responsibilities have to be clarified, and regulatory reform has to reduce the frequency and impact of future crises. The regulatory debate is, however, confusing because the international banks are both international in scope and large in size because operating with a global reach requires size. As a consequence, the debate about systemic banks and the ‘too big to fail’ problem, which in essence is not linked to their international profile, focuses on the international banks. Furthermore, these international banks are often also universal banks or even financial conglomerates. The discussion about the need to split the retail banking activities from the wholesale market operations is not restricted to international banks, but they are the focus of attention. As essentially the same group of banks is simultaneously international, big and universal, the political and regulatory discussion about their future should take into account all these characteristics in a coherent way. Unfortunately, each of these aspects is discussed separately, which leads to confusion, overlaps and inconsistencies in the debate. In the first part of this paper, the need for international banks in a globalized world is addressed. The second part gives an overview of the specific risks that these banks pose to society. Given that these banks have potentially a positive and a negative impact on stability, the need for a balanced regulatory approach is the subject of the third part.",

The core shock, as seen from a Western European perspective, was the creation of a series of contagion loops between the real economy, national fiscal positions and the banking sector. This was caused by the linkages of the funding and asset streams, and the creation of systems of sovereign guarantees and supports that have emerged since 2008. We examine the Irish banking crisis as a clinical study on how the existing banking system failed and on how government policy reactions set in motion events resulting in the Troika bailout of the country, and suggest that a change in the structure of the banking system might mitigate the effects of similar crises in the future. In particular, smaller, more competitive and contestable retail banks are suggested; they would have greater reliance on deposits-based funding to reduce the risk of funding crises and contagion, and more locally anchored lending, to reduce information asymmetries inherent in remote lending.",2

This so-called ‘forward guidance’ provides an outlook on monetary policy for the upcoming years. The ECB projections show that this low-interest-rate environment in the euro area, almost hitting the zero lower bound, is in line with the ECB’s medium-term inflation target of below but close to 2% HICP inflation. Inflation pressures in the euro zone remain subdued owing to severe weaknesses in the real economy. Similar and even more rapid interest rate decisions have been taken by other leading central banks all around the globe – which in turn poses severe challenges for global financial stability in the post-crisis environment. The impact of global banking on financial stability and the post-crisis challenges connected with the former have been under-researched before the crisis. In our contribution, we decided to interpret ‘global banking’ as ‘global central banking’ and thus complement the other contributions to this special issue from a macro-prudential perspective which are rather focusing on ‘global commercial banking’ from a macro-prudential perspective. Our core messages are important for the conference theme as, for instance, sustained monetary accommodation through international monetary policies and global liquidity hampers comprehensive bank balance sheet repair. As recent experiences in the euro area show this might have an impact on the degree of cross-border banking as well. These few examples show that ‘global banking’ and ‘global central banking’ are clear counterparts. In this contribution, we thus focus on the role of international monetary policies and global liquidity for financial stability and thoroughly assess several main challenges emerging in this context. We show that it is crucial to cope with the challenges identified by us in order to return to and ensure global financial stability in the future. This paper assesses and comments on several aspects of the implied low-interest-rate environment, focusing in particular on spillover effects. We also look at the post-crisis challenges lying ahead for central banks. In the next few years, ultra-expansionary monetary policy has to be driven back, which might give rise to repercussions within the global macroeconomy if the policy exit is conducted without coordination among the major central banks. For example, unilateral exits on one side of the Atlantic might intensify the discussion and threats of currency wars, since a trigger of capital flows would be followed by a corresponding revaluation of exchange rates – which we actually saw when the Fed began its tapering. Of course, this will be a balancing act between tightening too early and exiting too late. Accordingly, policymakers have to monitor carefully whether the huge increase in central bank money feeds through into a boost in money and credit growth. Thus, considerable challenges for policymakers in assuring financial stability will remain in the future. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. The next section begins with some general considerations of the current low-interest-rate environment as it approaches the zero bound in advanced economies, involving also negative real interest rates. The subsequent section deals with potential and already manifest conflicts between monetary policy and financial stability in a low-interest-rate environment. We introduce and elucidate the monetary policy dilemma stemming from the co-existence of low interest rates in major advanced economies and huge capital inflows into emerging markets. We argue that sustained monetary accommodation hampers comprehensive balance sheet repair. Moreover, we infer that global monetary liquidity and its spillovers represent important risks for global price and financial stability. Subsequently, we assess whether and how central banks committed to safeguarding the low-interest-rate environment may be risking their independence – operationally and financially. Finally, we provide an outlook on the inevitable monetary policy exit and its economic and political implications. The final section concludes.",18

The aim of this work is not to assess the optimality of their EA membership, ex post or ex ante, as that would require a much broader discussion, but merely to evaluate the level of financial integration and its causes. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the conclusion that there are significant net positive gains from EU membership – and for all EU members states – has a long and robust body of literature behind it (see, for instance, Cecchini et al., 1988, European Commission, 1996 and 2007; and BIS, 2011). Those estimated gains from integration are particularly strong for countries like Portugal and Spain, which are economically smaller and poorer than the EU average. We start by describing the evolution and structure of Portugal and Spain’s financial systems, first from the period before their EU accessions and then during their EU and EA membership. Next, we quantitatively evaluate the changes in financial integration during these periods, initially by means of a price-based measure of convergence (so-called sigma-convergence), and then by quantitative-based measures of convergence that demonstrate the significant fall in financial integration with the crisis. Finally, using these convergence measures, we conclude that the disintegration was largely a non-fundamentals-driven, self-reinforcing process (ie, not reflecting their underlying economic cycle positions), and perhaps partially associated with the banking sector market structure of these two Iberian economies.",1

Mispricing of risk and the implications of Wall Street behavior for Main Street economic outcomes led to a belief that a new financial architecture was needed for the intermediation of savings to investment and consumption activities. The policy focus in the United States in the early years of the crisis was on avoiding an economic depression while ensuring that the banking system remained functional. The goal in Europe was the same – avoiding a sharp economic contraction. However, as far as the financial sector was concerned, the newspaper headlines in much of Europe in 2009 and even in 2010 were either about the existence (or not) of US toxic assets in the balance sheet of Western European banks or the high credit growth observed in emerging Europe before the crisis.Footnote 1 Few foresaw then that the crisis in Europe would turn out to be of a more traditional nature. Indeed, the pre-crisis private excesses in the euro area periphery itself, coupled with a sharp slowdown in activity, as well as in Greece’s case outright public imbalances over a protracted period of time, would in time overshadow the concerns about exposure to US toxic assets and emerging Europe’s credit excesses. While the United States acted promptly to shore up its banks, Europe faced its traditional source of vulnerability – the linkages between banks and sovereigns – with hesitation. Clearly, Europe’s cross-border financial integration brought its own set of challenges. In particular, coordination across numerous sovereign jurisdictions proved to be difficult; these cross-border linkages would eventually challenge even the political dimensions of the European project. Against a rapidly deteriorating economic environment and weak policy coordination, some policy decisions would also prove controversial; for instance, the treatment given to senior bondholders when Anglo Irish Bank went bust.Footnote 2 And yet, as already noted, Europe’s failings reflect excesses that had little to do with sophisticated financial instruments and more to do with traditional banking activity and the design features of a common currency. These features had proved to be barely adequate for normal times. They turned out to be inadequate in dealing with an economic crisis. This paper is motivated by the current financial concerns in Europe, especially in euro area countries, and to investigate whether or not what we have observed over the last few years has dealt a permanent blow to financial integration in Europe. What we find is that markets, at least so far, seem to distinguish between the euro center and the euro periphery countries.Footnote 3 This finding is our first contribution to the existing literature and is supported by two empirical exercises in this paper – benchmarking analysis and cross-country variance test. We provide evidence that the most pressing problems related to financial integration in the euro area are associated with countries in the euro area periphery, not those in the euro center. Second, related to our first contribution, we apply a cross-country variance test in examining financial integration in the euro area. The test was originally used in Dell’Ariccia et al. (2002) to study bond spreads in emerging markets, and we utilize the methodological framework to analyze developments in the determinants of the euro area’s financial integration. We examine the period-specific cross-country variances of integration measures across different groups of euro area member countries before and after the onset of financial crisis. Third, we measure the degree of financial integration with quantity-based indicators, given the limitation of price-based measures on which many studies have relied, as we discuss in the literature review section below. We use three different indicators and find that the results are not affected by the choice of integration measure used. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews the existing literature related to our study, specifically the ones on financial integration and on the impact of financial crisis in the euro area countries. This is followed by benchmarking exercises to discuss differences in public bond market behaviors between the euro center and euro periphery countries. We then move to cross-country variance tests using quarterly data of quantity-based integration measures and their likely determinants. We first present the background information of the tests and then the results from the main analysis. In the following section, we try two alternative integration measures and carry out robustness checks. A short discussion concludes the paper.",4

A long tradition in economic and political history has characterized war and inter-group competition as preconditions for state formation and nation building, particularly in Western Europe (Tilly and Ardant, 1975; Tilly, 1985). Standing in sharp contrast with this ‘state-building’ view, others have emphasized the political and social disintegration that often follows conflict, particularly in the developing world. The proponents of this second, ‘conflict trap’ view argue that conflict leads to development in reverse, weak states and further risks of political violence down the line (Collier et al., 2003; Collier and Hoeffler, 2004). The contrast between external conflict, supposed to foster state capacity, and internal conflict, which may lead to opposite effects, has been illustrated more recently in the theoretical literature (Besley and Persson, 2009, 2010). However, the lack of systematic data across different countries and different types of conflict as well as the difficulty of drawing causal inference from cross-country macro-level variation have limited empirical contributions to this debate. The social and institutional legacies of conflict, despite being ‘arguably the most important’, remain the ‘least understood of all war impacts’ (Blattman and Miguel, 2010, p. 42). This paper uses new micro-level evidence from a nationally representative survey in 35 countries, the Life in Transition Survey (hereafter LITS), to shed light on how the experience of conflict has shaped political and social preferences. Thirty-nine thousand and five hundred individuals were surveyed in 35 countries of Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia in the summer of 2010 and were asked similar questions on personal and family (parents and grandparents) war exposure, political attitudes and socio-economic background. The investigation covers World War II (WWII) and civil wars in the former Yugoslavia, Central Asia and in the North Caucasus. LITS is the first large-scale multi-country nationally representative survey that documents conflict victimization in a homogeneous manner. This uniquely rich data makes it possible to shed light on the short- and long-term effects of different types of conflict on individual political and social preferences. Of particular interest is the legacy of conflict on political and social norms that matter most for economic and political post-war recovery. Chief among these are the perceived legitimacy and effectiveness of institutions, as well as social capital. Institutions legitimacy is measured in this paper by respondents’ declared trust in central institutions. Perceived effectiveness is measured by respondents’ assessment of the quality of institutions. The perceived legitimacy and effectiveness of institutions are important determinants of growth (Acemoglu, 2003, 2005; Acemoglu et al. 2011; Besley and Persson, 2009, 2010), market development (Greif, 2012), economic liberalization (Grosjean and Senik, 2011) and post-conflict political recovery (Bigombe et al., 2000). In addition to the role played by formal institutions, an ever-growing literature stresses the importance of culture and the positive role that social capital plays in growth (Knack and Keefer, 1997), the functioning of markets (Fafchamps, 2006) and institutional quality (Tabellini, 2008, 2010). Generalized norms of morality have received particular attention (Guiso et al., 2010) and will provide the first measure of social capital. An additional measure of social capital, in the tradition of Putnam (1995), consists of group membership and civic participation. A large literature on the social legacy of conflict has relied on such a measure of social capital (see namely Bellows and Miguel, 2009). Drawing inference from cross-country results is jeopardized by the presence of endogeneity and simultaneity bias between conflict and social and political preferences at the national level. Therefore, this paper focuses on within-country analysis and only compares individuals who live in the same country, and even in the same village. This keeps constant the quality of formal institutions and enables the identification of the legacy of conflict on social norms. There are three main findings in this paper, and each constitutes a contribution to a separate strand of the literature. First, the within-country evidence on the legacy of victimization argues overwhelmingly toward the conflict trap model. Any type of victimization is associated with lower perceived legitimacy and effectiveness of national institutions. Conflict spurs collective action, but of a kind that is further associated with the erosion of social and political trust. This last result is a second contribution of the paper, which is to the emerging micro empirical literature on conflict and collective action. While the paper confirms prior results that conflict stimulates collective action (Bellows and Miguel, 2009; Voors et al., 2012), it sheds light on its complex – and dark – nature. Victimization in a civil war leads to collective action that is associated with further erosion of political trust. This result is consistent with Cassar et al.’s (2013a, 2013b) evidence on the effect of conflict experience on fostering bonding rather than bridging social capital. It also resonates with recent findings by Satyanath et al. (2013), which illustrate that a dense network of civic associations was instrumental in the downfall of democracy in interwar Germany. Last but not least, the findings on the enduring legacy of WWII on individuals’ political and social preferences echo an emerging literature that highlights the resilience of social norms over time and the long-term influence of violent events. Nunn and Wantchekon (2011) show that the slave trade in Africa has had a lasting influence on political and interpersonal trust in Africa. Grosjean (Forthcoming) investigates the persistence of norms of interpersonal violence. The findings in this paper also contribute to understanding why levels of institutional trust and social trust in Central and Eastern Europe are so persistently low (Rose, 2004). An early hypothesis was that this was due to the legacy of repressive Communist regimes. Although supported by some empirical evidence (Alesina and Fuchs-Schündeln, 2007), recent findings have undermined the importance of this factor (Roland 2004; Grosjean, Forthcoming). This paper suggests the legacy of violent conflict as a noteworthy explanatory factor. The approach and results of this paper are subjects to two main caveats. The first deals with the reliability of survey responses related to war exposure. To address this, survey statistics are compared to existing secondary data sources on war victims. The correlation is more than 0.9. The second deals with the econometric identification of the causal effect of war. To address concerns about selection into victimization, I employ several strategies. First, the results are robust to controlling for a large number of characteristics, including determinants of victimization, such as communist party membership, religion or income. Second, the results are robust to village fixed effects, which isolate the variation in violence experienced across neighbors within the same village. Third, I restrict the attention to the subsample of people who have never moved, in order to rule out that our results are due to selective migration. Moreover, the results related to WWII can hardly be due directly to reverse causality, since it is not the respondents themselves who were targeted, but their parents or grandparents.",75

Indeed the two oil price dips of the 1990s coincide with the two financial crises in Russia: the Black Tuesday of 1994 and the Default of 1998. While it has become a commonplace to link Russia’s economic performance to oil – and some even go far back to explain the collapse of the Soviet Union (Gaidar, 2007) – oil does not explain everything that happens in Russia. Three-fourths of Russian regions recorded positive growth in 1999 compared to three-fourths of regions showing negative growth a year before. At the same time only one-third of regions produced any oil and the oil price increased only modestly from US$12/barrel in 1998 to US$17/barrel in 1999. Oil price and Russia’s economic performance. Notes: Prepared by authors using data from Goskomstat (2008) and Energy Information Administration (2009). There is now wide consensus among observers of the Russian economy that the long-term viability of Russia’s economic growth hinges on the improvement of productivity in the non-resource-based sectors of the economy. Besides removing barriers for market competition, the most effective government contribution to the productivity growth would be through improving economic infrastructure, especially roads. According to a recent World Bank study, the impact on productivity from bringing the level of infrastructure to the OECD average would be higher than the combined impact of closing the gap in terms of financial development, quality of institutions, and education – in that order of magnitude (World Bank, 2007). It has to be noted that in Russia, sub-national governments are responsible for a considerable part of that infrastructure. Thus, Russia’s economic recovery and long-term growth prospects are more complex than can be suggested by a simple macroeconomic story, such as oil price boost. What interests us in this paper is that the dynamics of economic recovery have been very uneven across Russian regions. Therefore, the determinants of long-term growth need also be sought at the sub-national level. Among those potential determinants we are particularly interested in this paper in the potential role played by fiscal equalization among municipalities within Russian regions. Martinez-Vazquez and Timofeev (2008) find that the vast majority of Russia’s regions achieve a larger reduction of within-region fiscal disparities than is the case for between-region disparities being addressed by federal grants. In this paper we are interested in understanding what may be the economic consequences of different degrees of equalization being pursued in Russia’s regions. Fiscal equalization theory predicts economic inefficiency to arise from disparities in local government revenues from source-based taxes and local rents (Albouy, 2012). Therefore, fiscal equalization has the potential to mitigate those disparities and prevent fiscally induced misallocation of mobile economic resources. However, according to the same theoretical models, disparities in residence-based taxes should be equalized only in that part arising from differences in the skill composition of local residents in terms of their income-earning abilities, but not based on their actual income, as for example determined by local income-generating opportunities. However, just like in tax policy, governments might be willing to sacrifice some economic efficiency and growth for more equity by equalizing actual revenues due to inability to observe potential income. As we explain in this paper, during the period covered by our data, most of Russia’s regions were equalizing actual revenues of constituent local governments. Not surprisingly we find a negative relationship between intra-regional equalization and regional economic growth. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, we survey theoretical links between equalization and economic outcomes conjectured in the traditional fiscal federalism literature. Next we review those past studies that link intergovernmental relations to economic outcomes in Russia. Then we present empirical evidence on the extent of fiscal inequality and equalization between and within Russian regions. Finally, we examine the empirical relationship between the extent of intra-regional equalization and economic growth in Russian regions. In the final section we conclude.",3

56,4,Comparative Economic Studies,16 October 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2014.31,"Impact and Implementation Challenges of the Basel Framework for Emerging, Developing and Small Economies",December 2014,Jan Frait,VladimÍr TomŠÍk,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In response to the global financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) introduced two sets of reforms to the international capital framework for banks. The ‘Basel 2.5’ package of reforms (BCBS, 2009) included measures to strengthen the trading book capital requirements under Basel II and enhance the three pillars of the Basel II framework. Basel III (BCBS, 2010b) introduced two additional capital buffers: a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% that should be applied across the board, and a countercyclical buffer, which should be applied during periods of high credit growth. In addition to the level of capital, Basel III addresses the issue of its quality through its focus on common equity. Capital loss absorption is dealt with by the point of non-viability clause that provides relevant authorities with discretion for a write-off or conversion to common shares if the bank is judged to be non-viable. The capital framework was also supplemented by a non-risk-based leverage ratio. There is also substantial strengthening of the counterparty credit risk framework. Most of Basel III relates to Pillar 1 measures (minimum capital requirements), but there are also implications for Pillar 2 (further requirements by supervisor related to risks not covered by Pillar 1) and Pillar 3 (set of disclosure requirements). Basel III also introduced two required liquidity ratios: the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The Basel III as well as Basel II standards are designed primarily for large internationally operating banking institutions with a focus on their activities in BCBS member states. They set minimum regulatory standards and respect the need to set the overall standards in various jurisdictions according to local conditions. Nevertheless, the Basel standards are to a large extent reflected in the regulations in BCBS non-member countries too. The prime focus of this paper is the impact of Basel III changes to the capital and liquidity frameworks on emerging market and developing economies, and specifically also on small economies. For simplicity, we label this group as emerging market and smaller economies (EMSEs). The EMSEs are a rather heterogeneous group. Some of the countries have their own currencies, some are members of currency unions, while others utilize the currencies of other economies. Some are members of the European Union (EU), which imposes extensive regulatory requirements designed outside the scope of EMSEs. Furthermore, it is obvious that jurisdictions within this group differ substantially and will continue to do so. Despite all these differences, the EMSEs also have some common features. Their financial markets are typically more volatile than those of large advanced economies, as is their GDP growth, which is meanwhile higher on average than that of advanced economies. They also typically experience stronger credit growth because their financial sectors are in the process of financial deepening. They usually have lower credit ratings and shallower government bond markets, which in some cases implies a lack of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), a lack of adequate collateral and so on. And they face a whole range of home–host issues, as many globally significant financial institutions operate branches or subsidiaries in EMSEs. The presence of branches and subsidiaries of multinational banks is the most important feature of EMSEs’ banking sectors. Whether multinational banks operate in a particular jurisdiction as a branch or subsidiary creates striking differences. Nevertheless, as Mayes and Granlund (2008) explain, both ways will inevitably pose problems for the regulatory and supervisory authorities in both home and host countries.Footnote 1 As to the choice of a multinational bank regarding preferred organizational form, Cerutti et al. (2007) find that banks are more likely to operate as branches in countries that have higher taxes and lower regulatory restrictions on bank entry and on foreign branches. Subsidiary operations are preferred by banks seeking to penetrate host markets by establishing large retail operations. These findings are to a large extent confirmed by Fiechter et al. (2011). They conclude that banks with significant wholesale operations tend to prefer a more centralized branch model that provides them the flexibility to manage liquidity and credit risks globally and to serve the needs of large clients. The funding costs for the wholesale group are likely to be lower under the branch structure, given the flexibility to move funds to where they are most needed. A subsidiary structure, in contrast, constrains the banking group’s ability to transfer funds across borders and hence may be less suitable for wholesale activities. However, they also find that, given the diversity of business lines and the varying objectives and stages of financial development of different countries, there is no one obvious structure that is best suited to all cases for cross-border expansion. EMSEs are impacted by the Basel III framework in three ways. First, there is an indirect impact of the implementation of the framework at the consolidated level by jurisdictions that are home to international banks. This involves increased cross-border cooperation challenges, and it is all the more important for countries who are hosts to branches or subsidiaries that may represent a small fraction of the consolidated group but are locally systemic. Second, there is the indirect impact of the reactions of international banks to implementation. In this case, there is the concern that as international banks change their business and deleverage, their exposures to EMSEs might be unduly reduced. Finally, there is the direct impact on EMSEs of implementing the Basel III framework in their own jurisdictions. There are many papers and studies looking at the economic effects and impacts of the Basel III framework in advanced economies using macroeconomic models (see the section ‘Basel III, regulatory capital and its quality’). The implied changes in volumes and prices of credit constitute the driving forces in these approaches. In contrast, studies focusing on more detailed effects stemming from changes in individual regulatory parameters often specific to emerging and small economies are scarce. This paper intends to provide a contribution in this direction. The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section surveys the analyses on the economic effects of the Basel III framework and the potential consequences of new capital regulations in EMSEs. The section after that considers the issues associated with the introduction of macroprudential capital buffers. The following section discusses the implications of new regulation of banks’ trading exposures for affiliates of multinational banks. The subsequent section turns attention to the sensitive issue of regulatory treatment of sovereign exposure from both the micro- and the macroprudential perspective. The next section explains potential risks associated with the accelerated move of the EMSEs’ banks to advanced approaches to modelling financial risks. The penultimate section describes impacts of the new liquidity framework while the final section concludes. Before proceeding to these topics, let us note that we agree on the importance and adequacy of most of the changes that are contained in Basel III. However, we deliberately focus mainly on challenges and risks, especially on the identification of possible unintended consequences of the new rules. This is not to say that the unintended consequences prevail over the intended ones. Furthermore, not all the issues discussed here are related directly to Basel III, and not all the unintended consequences are specific exclusively to the EMSE countries. Many of the proposed rules were discussed long before the establishment of the new regulatory framework. However, the creation of the new framework gives new relevance to these issues and consequences.",5
56,4,Comparative Economic Studies,02 October 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2014.28,The Effect of Oil on Regional Growth in Russia and the United States: A Comparative Analysis,December 2014,Michael Alexeev,Andrey Chernyavskiy,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The effect of oil abundance on economic growth has received considerable attention in the economics and political science literature over the last 20 years.Footnote 1 This effect is often referred to as the ‘oil curse’ hypothesis – the claim that oil wealth reduces long-run economic growth, at least in the developing world. Most of the literature examining the effect of oil on growth is based on country-level comparisons, presumably because of better data availability and because some of the transmission mechanisms such as the Dutch Disease or the effect of oil on institutional quality can be most readily analyzed at the country level. Country-level analysis might be problematic, however, because of significant differences across countries along many dimensions such as history, culture, geography, institutional quality, and macroeconomic policies, and some of those dimensions are likely to be endogenous to growth rates. This is a particularly serious problem in cross-sectional analysis. Panel-data analysis can take account of the time-invariant differences among countries, but time-varying hard-to-measure or endogenous factors such as macroeconomic policies may still render country-level analysis problematic. In order to alleviate these problems, a few recent papers have tested the oil curse hypothesis using regional-level data.Footnote 2 Regional-level analysis offers some advantages because, even in large countries, differences among regions in history, culture, and institutions, not to mention the effects of macroeconomic policies, are usually not nearly as great as differences among countries. However, regional analysis of the oil curse hypothesis also presents significant pitfalls. Because factors are typically much more mobile across regions than across country borders, regions are likely to experience economic and institutional convergence, putting downward pressure on both positive and negative effects of oil abundance. Moreover, we will argue that, at least in some countries, another potentially important source of downward bias of the estimates of these effects based on regional data is the extraction of regional resource rents by the national government and mining companies. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate the latter argument using comparative regional-level analysis of the effects of oil wealth in Russia and in the United States. More specifically, we use comparable measures for 2002–2011 to examine the effect of oil abundance on the economic growth of Russia’s regions and American states. We demonstrate that despite the apparently large positive impact of oil wealth on Russia’s growth during the 2000s,Footnote 3 its oil-rich regions did not grow faster than other regions. In fact, there is some evidence that Russia’s oil-producing regions grew slightly slower than did the rest of the country. By contrast, the US oil producers grew slightly faster than the other states. We argue that one plausible source of these differences is very different systems of taxation of oil extraction in Russia and in the United States. We also find that, unlike in the United States, Russia’s oil-rich regions have significantly higher per capita gross regional products (GRP) and higher wages. This evidence is consistent with lower factor mobility in Russia as well as with the view that, although the federal center taxed away (or oil/gas firms channeled away) the incremental rents in 2000s, the pre-2000 rents have so far remained in the regions. Finally, we show that, although oil rents play a role in attracting labor to oil-producing regions both in Russia and in the United States, only in the United States is oil rent growth associated with higher investment growth in oil-producing states than in non-oil-producing regions. This is again consistent with the thesis that, during 2000s, the overwhelming share of Russia’s oil rents went to the federal government. Moreover, this evidence argues against the possibility that oil rents were shifted away from the regions by the oil companies, because if oil corporations were getting a large share of the oil rents in 2000s, they would have had strong incentives to invest more as oil prices increased. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt in the literature to conduct a comparative study of the effects of natural resource wealth on economic growth at the regional level. Our other contributions include the use of more recent data than all but one other regionally focused papers for either Russia or the United States, and the use of panel-data analysis that was absent in the US-oriented papers and was rarely used in the studies of the resource curse for Russia. In addition, we present a discussion of some important measurement and specification issues that we hope will be helpful to other researchers working in this field. Most of the work on the natural resource impact on Russia’s regions uses the data for 1990s or the early 2000s. The only exception is Alexeev and Chernyavskiy (2014) who use the data for the same period of time as the present study. However, Alexeev and Chernyavskiy focus exclusively on Russia and rely on resource wealth measures (mineral tax collections in regions) that cannot be used for comparative purposes. Libman (2013) uses the 2000–2006 data, but he also studies only Russia’s regions. Moreover, the use of 2000–2006 period is problematic, because of a substantial change in Russia’s system of oil taxation effective in 2002. In fact, our choice of the time period is motivated mainly by the relatively stable institutional environment, particularly the tax system, in Russia.Footnote 4
 Most of regionally focused papers use cross-sectional estimation approach, either exclusively or predominantly, instead of panel regression analysis.Footnote 5 Although cross-sectional analysis has its place, the ability of panel regressions to account for time-invariant effects and, in the case of system-GMM, to incorporate dynamic effects and alleviate potential endogeneity problems make them an important tool in the analysis of economic growth. In the next section, we briefly review the royalty and taxation systems for oil producers in Russia and in the United States. The subsequent section discusses some important specification and data issues. Estimation results are presented and interpreted in the penultimate section. Brief concluding remarks are made in the final section.",6

In the world, total unemployment is expected to remain at elevated levels for many years to come. Moreover, young people have been particularly affected by the crisis and by the weak and uneven recovery that followed (ILO, 2014). In many European countries, the situation is particularly serious. Almost everywhere, youth unemployment is much higher, often two or three times as high as the adult unemployment rate. The main reason for this is that young people, despite possessing, on average, higher educational levels, are endowed with fewer skills and are less experienced than their older peers. Another worrying feature is that about one-third of youth unemployment is long term. All this has implications for wages, career opportunities and unemployment incidence in later life, the so-called ‘scarring effect’ of youth unemployment. In this introduction to the symposium on Young People and the Labor Market we briefly review the key theories and determinants of youth unemployment in the section ‘Young people and the labor market: theories and determinants’. Here a cautionary note is proper. Although the symposium is on Young People and the Labor Market, we focus on youth unemployment because two papers deal explicitly with this subject. A third paper analyses the behavior of an indicator, NEET (not in employment, education or training), that is strictly related to youth unemployment. The last paper refers to the transitions from unemployment to employment. Thus, in the review section we will not consider other issues concerning young workers and the labor market.Footnote 1 Then, in the section ‘Young people and the labor market: New empirical evidence’, we present some recent empirical evidence on youth unemployment and NEET, also providing a brief summary of the empirical investigations carried out in the four papers of the symposium. The section ‘Conclusions and policy implications’ concludes with the policy implications that can be drawn from the empirical studies.",18

This negative development was further accelerated by the crises in Europe. Southern European countries have experienced record high levels of youth unemployment (Hutengs and Stadtmann, 2013). Similarly, youth unemployment problems have been identified in Central and Eastern European economies, such as Poland or Hungary (Hutengs and Stadtmann, 2014). Scandinavian countries have strong economic links to other European economies; therefore, the recent low-growth period in Europe also affected the Scandinavian economies as well as their labor markets. This paper investigates Scandinavian countries and their male and female unemployment rates. An EU15 aggregate of countries is used for comparison.Footnote 1 Okun’s (1962) law is used to estimate age cohort and gender-specific Okun coefficients to provide evidence on the business-cycle dependence of young people across Scandinavian countries. We show that young people are predominantly and significantly more exposed to business-cycle fluctuations than are older ones. This especially holds true for the male population. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section briefly reviews the literature. The section after that provides a general description of the dataset and the descriptive statistics regarding youth and total unemployment rates. We also highlight differences in male and female unemployment. The penultimate section discusses the regression approach and results. The final section concludes.",21

Some key factors driving it that have been identified include the relatively low human capital of young people (see OECD, 2005), the ‘youth experience gap’ (see Caroleo and Pastore, 2007) and the mismatch between the skills acquired through education and those required by employers (see, eg, Quintini et al., 2007). Policy recommendations have been put forward both in the academic literature (see, eg, Brunello et al., 2007) and by the European Commission (2008). This paper investigates the main statistical features and the macroeconomic determinants of youth unemployment in a number of European countries. It is well-known that an important feature of unemployment in Europe is its relatively high degree of persistence, which suggests that a hysteresis model (Blanchard and Summers, 1986; Gordon, 1988) might be appropriate. In fact, many empirical papers have found evidence consistent with this hypothesis, including Alogoskoufis and Manning (1988), Graafland (1991), Lopez et al. (1996), Wilkinson (1997) and so on using standard unit root methods, and Caporale and Gil-Alana (2008) and Cuestas et al. (2011) and others applying fractional integration methods. High persistence appears to be a feature also of European youth unemployment (see, eg, Heckman and Borjas, 1980; Ryan, 2001; Caporale and Gil-Alana, 2013). Therefore, first of all we examine the degree of persistence of the series, which sheds light on whether appropriate policy actions are required in case of high persistence, by estimating both autoregressive AR(1) processes and long memory (fractional integration) models. Second, we investigate the main macroeconomic determinants of youth unemployment in Europe by means of a fractional cointegration model that includes variables such as GDP and inflation as explanatory variables. The organization of the paper is as follows. The next section outlines the econometric framework. The penultimate section presents the data and the empirical results. The final section offers some concluding remarks.",21

Specifically, we provide an analysis of the EU regions over the 2000–2010 period and focus on changes in both indices from 2000–2008 to 2009–2010. Economic activity is measured by GDP growth. Consideration of the regional level (we use the NUTS-1 level of Eurostat) allows for highly detailed cross-sectional variation relative to the national level. In many countries, especially the larger ones, labor market performance varies widely between regions, and the impact of the crisis, similarly, has differed from one region to another. In addition, it is of interest to assess the importance of various spatial effects, as we do at the end of the empirical section. An original contribution of this paper is that the analysis is based not only on traditional indicators, youth unemployment rates (YUR) compared with adult or total UR, but also on the more innovative NEET indicator, as we explain in the next section. The econometric setup is designed to take full advantage of the panel structure of our data: (1) all models incorporate dynamic feedback to identify the degree of persistence in the dependent variables; (2) we accommodate latent heterogeneity at different levels of regional aggregation; (3) we allow the crisis years to exert separate effects on the dependent variable of interest, both through the inclusion of time indicators and in interactions with GDP growth rates. To this end, estimation is primarily based on Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and bias-corrected fixed effect dynamic panel data estimators. We also implement a simplified version of the GMM estimator suggested by Baltagi et al. (2014) to accommodate spatial interactions across regions. The structure of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we briefly review the literature on NEET and youth unemployment by focusing on the impact of the recent global crisis and on differing responses of different European countries and regions. The section after that presents our econometric analysis, including our data and methodology. The econometric results are presented and discussed in the subsequent section. The last section concludes and discusses some policy implications.",48

Ireland was severely hit, as illustrated by the contraction of Gross National Product (GNP) by almost 10% in 2009 (Duffy et al., 2011). The economy temporarily resumed modest growth in 2010, before experiencing another contraction in 2011 (Duffy and Timoney, 2013). This collapse in economic activity resulted in the country’s unemployment rate increasing from 4.4% in 2006 to 14.7% in 2012 (Central Statistics Office, 2012a, 2013a), while the youth unemployment rate increased from 8.7% in 2006 to 30.6% in 2012.Footnote 1 Two developments raise particular concerns in relation to young unemployed people: the growth in the numbers with no formal education, which rose from 17.4% of unemployed people aged 15–24 in 2007 to 48.9% in 2011;Footnote 2 and the percentage who are in long-term unemployment, which increased from 20.3% in 2007 to 45.8% in 2011.Footnote 3 Another worry is the rise in young people not in employment, education or training (NEET), which has grown from 11.8% in 2006 to 24% in 2011.Footnote 4 While policymakers are aware of the unemployment rate of young people, little is known about this group’s profile or the extent to which it has changed since the beginning of the recession. Gaps in knowledge also exist in relation to their labour market transitions (ie, movement from unemployment to employment or inactivity, or remaining unemployed), both pre and post the Great Recession. Given this, and particularly its importance in the design of effective activation measures to assist young unemployed people, this paper addresses the following questions:
 Has the profile of unemployed youths changed during the course of the recession? What are the labour market transition patterns of young unemployed individuals’ pre and post the economic crisis? To what extent do changes in the composition of the youth unemployment stock explain changes in youth labour market transition rates over time? To what extent do changes in the labour market value of various characteristics explain changes in youth labour market transition rates over time? The paper uses newly available longitudinal data from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS), Ireland’s Labour Force Survey, to address these questions. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section presents a brief overview of the Irish labour market. The literature on young unemployed individuals is discussed in the section after that, while the data and methodologies that are employed in the paper are described in the following section. Finally, the results from the analyses and the central conclusions are presented in the penultimate and ultimate sections.",12

International investors worry about country-default risk as a country’s potential inability or unwillingness to repay affects its expected profit. Borrower countries worry about this risk as it influences their ability to borrow internationally. An adequate evaluation of country-default risk is therefore crucial for efficiency in international lending. Identifying the determinants of sovereign risk is useful to investors when evaluating the risks of a debt crisis in a particular economy in which they are interested in investing and may also be useful for governments when making decisions on implementing adjustment programs focusing on lowering their costs of borrowing abroad. Analyzing the basic determinants of sovereign default risk is especially important for emerging market economies for which information is more opaque and lending is subject to a greater lack of information. As Krozner (2000) points out, in emerging market economies factors such as the weak enforcement of property rights and limited information disclosure, as well as a history of defaults during episodes of debt crises, may imply significant risks for investors when taking investment decisions in these countries. Therefore, a thorough evaluation of the determinants of the risks of default is most important for both creditors and borrowers. The determinants of country-default risk have been widely studied in the literature (see, for instance, Arora and Cerisola, 2001; Sy, 2002; Rowland and Torres, 2004; Dalaimi et al., 2005; Baldacci et al., 2008; Longstaff et al., 2005; Thuraisamy et al., 2008; Hilscher and Nosbusch, 2010; Comelli, 2012). Some of these studies focus on emerging market economies. We expand the literature on sovereign default risk in emerging market economies by studying the term structure of government-bond yield spreads in Colombia. Particularly relevant, we consider default risk corresponding to different time spans in order to identify and distinguish between the determinants of short-run (liquidity) and long-run (solvency) risk. In order to do so, we chose a set of variables that has been extensively used in the recent literature as determinants of government default risk for emerging markets. We follow especially the determinants proposed by Hilscher and Nosbusch (2010), Gumus (2011) and Longstaff et al. (2011). A few recent papers have studied the term structure of sovereign default risk. Eichler and Maltritz (2013) use a set of determinants in order to study this structure in European Monetary Union member countries. Their results show that while some default-risk determinants are more important to explain long-run risk than short-run risk, namely, trade balance and interest-rate costs, debt indicators are found to explain short-run risk only. From a theoretical standpoint, whereas long-run interest rates are strongly related to market expectations about the future solvency and financing needs of the government, short-run interest rates reflect more closely liquidity concerns and expectations about short-run performance of the government (see, for example, Freixas and Rochet, 2008, p. 282). Hence, it is to expect that the determinants of short- and long-run yield spreads might be different. In addition, as shown by Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012), the composition of long- and short-term debt is fundamental in emerging market economies. While long-term debt provides a hedge against future fluctuations in interest-rate spreads, short-term debt is more effective at providing incentives to repay. Augustin (2012) studies the relation between the slope of the spread curve and the economic determinants for 44 countries. This author finds that downward-sloping spread curves occur when domestic factors are more important than global factors in explaining default risk. Our indicator of country-default risk is the spread of Colombia’s government bonds with respect to United States government bonds for different maturities. These yield spreads are observed on secondary capital markets and reflect the risk perceptions of market participants. As both Colombian and United States bonds are traded with price discounts, these spreads reflect the compensation that investors in bond markets require for bearing the extra default risk in the absence of exchange rate risk. The case of Colombia is a very interesting one, because, unlike many other emerging market economies, Colombia has seldom defaulted on its debt obligations. During the 1980s, Colombia was the only Latin American country that completely avoided the debt crisis that crippled most of Latin America (Avella, 2006). Relative to other countries in the region, the size of the state has been kept small and the government has never borrowed in unsustainable ways. In addition, it is part of a group of economies (CIVETS) that are potentially successful second-generation emerging markets due to their geostrategic location, good macroeconomic policies and developed financial system.Footnote 1 This is the first study of its kind for an emerging market economy. Our results show that, although spreads are correlated across maturities,Footnote 2 their relative behavior and determinants are not uniform. In fact, our results show that short-run risk is driven mostly by investment, asset prices and international trade indicators. In contrast, long-run default risk is driven additionally by government indebtedness, terms of trade and international reserves. Therefore, fiscal stance indicators are not very important in order to explain default risk at short-run horizons. Thus, domestic factors are relatively more important than global factors in order to explain sovereign risk in Colombia. The next section presents the variables used in our empirical analysis and the hypotheses on the relation existing between each explanatory variable and the risk spread. The section after that presents the empirical analysis and discusses the results. The penultimate section studies the determinants of the slope of the sovereign spread curve. The final section concludes.",5
56,4,Comparative Economic Studies,02 October 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2014.24,"The Yugoslav Firm versus a Wardian LMF, a Socialist Firm and a LMF in a Capitalist Market",December 2014,Michael Keren,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Ward’s model of the Illyrian firm (Ward, 1958), the labor-managed firm (LMF), was inspired by the Yugoslav response to the divorce from the Soviet Bloc of the 1950s, by which central direction was to be replaced by self-management. For a long time there have been grounds for believing that, either from its very inception or since the wave of changes that started in the 1970s, the system did not differ from that of the other socialist countries as much as was trumpeted. Estrin and Uvalić reviewed the extant empirical knowledge on the Yugoslav economic system, and we can now be sure that this was indeed the case.Footnote 1 Ward’s LMF model was, however, found to be of relevance in the analysis of unconventional firms and organizations in western markets: it was used inter alia to analyze the Israeli kibbutz and cooperative firms in market economies (as a recent survey by Pencavel (2012) shows). The first aim of this note is to outline the differences that did exist between the environment of the firm in the Soviet Bloc and Yugoslavia – the term Yugoslavia refers throughout this note to the entity that existed between the mid-1950s and the start of transition in the 1990s – and in other socialist economies. The second – to use the LMF model to analyze the difference in the behavior of the labor market in a labor-managed economy and in a market economy. The Yugoslav economic model has fascinated me ever since I encountered Ward’s model. Many others, I suspect, have likewise been affected. It seemed to offer the possibility of implementing market socialism, of creating a socialist market that may embody the best of all possible worlds: a world that has done away with the excessive centralization of Stalinist socialism as well as the extreme income disparities of capitalism. It may have been this promise that led to the burgeoning elaborations on the Wardian model. Yet it has also puzzled the profession for many years because there were fundamental problems with the model that served to attract a multitude of contributions, this time theoretical ones. Many dealt with the behavior of the labor market. One of its lessons was that demand for labor under a LMF regime might have the wrong slope, a theoretical property that threatened the stability of the labor market yet did not find any empirical support. Another implication was that the labor market may not clear, that it does not tend toward full-employment equilibrium and may therefore lead to enduring unemployment. The latter seemed to find a better fit with the facts, since Yugoslavia was an exporter of labor and unemployment there, unlike in other socialist countries, was widespread. Did this literature have anything to do with Yugoslav reality? Was the Yugoslav economy really a market that coordinated the actions of socially owned, that is, non-private, competing enterprises? To understand how an economy really functions is never an easy task because the researcher is rarely privy to the deliberations of the actual decision makers. Often they make their decisions in their own minds, and even if they sit in committee and their words are recorded, one can never be sure that the pronounced arguments are what drives their deeds. Yet in the Yugoslav case, a legislated blueprint of the organization of the market lay before us. The attractions of this blueprint made many wish to believe that it described a real Illyrian landscape. But there were problems with the legislated model, and the introduction of the Basic Organizations of Associated Labor, the BOALs, in the 1970s, was the most serious one. The BOALs system seemed to split up all social organizations, even the labor force of an enterprise, into countervailing monopolies that had to arrive at social agreements for the united implementation of a production and distribution plan (see Prasnikar and Svejnar, 1988). This arrangement, which ostensibly enabled each part of an economic unit to hold it up, seemed, from its inception, not to be feasible and thus strengthened the question mark hanging over our understanding of how the system functioned in reality.Footnote 2 The reasons we need to understand how the Yugoslav system worked extend far beyond the confines of the country that was Yugoslavia. They touch upon the wider question of the nature and viability of a socialist market. If Yugoslavia was indeed a socialist market, then the question of viability is solved, though not of its efficiency. If it was not, then the doubts regarding the feasibility of such a market (eg, Keren, 1993) deepen, although a single instance of a system not working does not prove that it cannot function. Well, was the Yugoslav economy a socialist market? And did the LMF model apply there? Many authors supplied partial answers to this riddle, among them Uvalić (particularly 1992) and Estrin (1983 [2010]). Estrin and Uvalić’s review (2008), which covers the extant literature, indicates that the labor-managed economy was really a very thin veneer that was hiding real economic relations that did in fact not differ much from those of the other socialist countries. The system was not managed by its decentralized labor units but was largely managed by outside authorities, with the lower rungs of the hierarchical party, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, serving as the guiding organ.Footnote 3 This explains the conundrum of the BOALs, the fact that a system that purportedly delegates coordination to a myriad of countervailing monopolies, does nevertheless manage to function. It was not decisions by these monopolists, the individual labor councils or BOALs, that determined the policies of the Yugoslav firm (YF) and coordinated flows in the economy, but decisions made by the republic party organs. As in traditional socialist economies, allocation and resource use decisions were guided by political organs. This was their main finding. Not enough is known about the exact administrative structure of the allocation mechanism (but see Prasnikar and Svejnar, 1988). The type of detailed information that the post-War Harvard Project provided (Berliner, 1957, 1959; Granick, 1972; Levine, 1959, 1961) does, to the best of my knowledge, not exist for Yugoslavia. A point that needs stressing is that it was the state or republic level League of Communists that made economic decisions and that local administrative bodies, too, were deeply involved.Footnote 4 Yugoslavia, especially in its last decades, was a real federal state, and the League of Communists of each of the republics rather than the federal party ran the economic show in its own manner (Prasnikar and Svejnar, 1988). Thus party bodies inside, say, Serbia, Slovenia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina ran the resource allocation organs of their respective states, but interstate economic flows were often arranged by market forces. This also meant that YFs had market experience that was lacking in the orthodox socialist economies, though not in reforming countries such as Hungary. Price-taking competition between LMFs did not exist, yet workers’ incomes were affected by their enterprise’s profits, in spite of wide-scale redistribution of profits, because incomes in different enterprises varied widely. And employment decisions must have been influenced by these workers’ interests. Furthermore, the political and economic systems of Yugoslavia were endowed with more popularity than their equivalents in other communist countries. This goes back to manner in which the regime was imposed after WW2 – by local forces rather than through an external power – and to the manner in which the break with the Cominform was effected, both of which inspired pride in the regime. The labor management model itself, with the sense of worker control that it imparted, had more appeal than the socialist system in other communist countries. This meant that YFs were more difficult to change and privatize from above than state-owned firms of the other socialist states. This must have affected the path of transition (Uvalić, 2010). Why come back and reexamine a system that has passed away over two decades ago? What can this paper add to its story? The answer to the first question can be found in the opening paragraph of this paper. Since the socialist market is for many a very attractive solution to many of society’s ills, especially at a time when trust in capitalism is being eroded by the ‘worst recession since the depression’, it is important to establish whether it is at all feasible and how it may function. Furthermore, the question per se is of interest. And the labor management model has relevance for cooperatives in western markets, as evidenced in Pencavel’s enlightening recent survey (2012).Footnote 5 The aim of this note is to extract the principal characteristics, stylized facts, of the YF that may help amend the LMF model. These cannot always be true to all finer details, which, as Prasnikar and Svejnar (1988) recount, were not uniform throughout the country. It focuses on the institutional and behavioral aspects of the environment that distinguish the YF and Yugoslav market from the traditional socialist enterprise on the one hand (‘The Yugoslav and the socialist economies – A brief comparison’) and from the cooperative in a market economy on the other. Unlike the accepted treatments of the system, it stresses the fact that labor cannot be considered a variable factor, neither in the YF nor in a cooperative. It also uses a graphical analysis that is novel. It then restates the traditional LMF model in the section ‘The traditional model’ with slight modifications, and shows in the section ‘The model versus the YF: BOALs and centralization, administrative allocation and wage determination’ why the outcome of the ostensibly decentralizing BOAL reform was centralization. In the subsection ‘The real LMF: No firing’ it concludes that labor is in effect a fixed factor. In the next section it compares the functioning of the LMF in a capitalist and a Yugoslav-type labor-managed market, explaining why, unlike in the latter, in the former the market is equilibrating. The final section concludes.",

Why do income levels differ among countries? Why do growth rates differ? Why does per capita income increase over time? These questions and some related ones are among the most important in economics. In the last decade, these intellectually stimulating questions have become subjects of the public and policy-related discussions in Turkey, since the country has shown high growth rates. Turkey is an upper-middle-income country with a population of around 75 million and a GDP of US$0.82 trillion, making it the 17th largest economy as of 2013.Footnote 1 A comparison within the OECD group reveals that Turkey had the second highest average annual growth rate of GDP (measured in constant local currency) and the fifth highest average annual growth rate of purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted per capita GDP among all the OECD countries during 2004–2012 (Üngör and Kalafatcılar, 2014). In fact, Turkey’s GDP growth rate in 2010 averaged about 9%, ranking it in first place in Europe and it accelerated to 11% in the first quarter of 2011, outpacing China’s growth rate (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-30/turkish-economic-growth-accelerated-to-11-in-first-quarter-1-.html). This study aims to bring about a better understanding of the convergence experience of Turkey. We do not analyze Turkey’s case in isolation but place it in the general context of economic growth and development and the experiences of other economies. We provide some insights, based on international comparisons, to contribute to the understanding of the Turkish growth experience using a relatively theory-free approach. We are aware of that an argument that is not disciplined by a clear theoretical framework would be less illuminating. Bearing this in mind, we present some facts regarding the growth experience of Turkey. Our work relies on descriptive macro-level statistics and employs a growth-accounting framework to decompose growth rates into different factors. This approach, we believe, is still informative and may offer insights for future theoretical as well as empirical work. First, we delve into the convergence experience of Turkey presenting some international comparisons. We use PPP-adjusted per capita GDP as a measure of economic development and, based on this indicator, compare the performances of different countries with that of the United States. Specifically, we examine different countries and country groups to infer which of them have similar relative per capita income levels/growth rates throughout the period. Our investigation provides motivation for rendering possible comparisons of the similarities between Turkey and Latin America. Specifically, we observe that per capita income levels and growth rates are very similar for Turkey and Brazil. Second, we examine the sources of growth in Turkey and decompose changes in output per worker into different components. Turkey lost ground in the last few decades of the twentieth century. After the lost decades (1977–2001), Turkey had high growth rates during 2002–2007, with an average annual rate of nearly 7%. We study the growth performance of Turkey in the lost decades (1977–2001) and in the high-growth era (2002–2007), within a growth-accounting framework, calculating the contributions of capital, labor, education, and total factor productivity (TFP) to growth. According to our findings, TFP actually deteriorated between 1977 and 2001. We find that output per worker grew by more than 5% per year during 2002–2007 and TFP growth accounted for around half of this growth on the back of the reforms and structural transformation policies implemented in the post-2001 period. In addition, we report some data for Turkey and Brazil, in comparison with Korea, to see whether these two countries have similarities in their convergence experiences. Our paper is most closely related to the literature that investigates the growth experience of Turkey in detail in order to enhance our understanding of important factors that affect economic growth. Accordingly, our study complements recent studies by, among some others, Altuğ et al. (2008), Adamopoulos and Akyol (2009), Çiçek and Elgin (2011), Atiyas and Bakis (2014), İmrohoroğlu et al. (2014), and Üngör and Kalafatcılar (2014). Turkey had high growth rates during 2002–2007 with sound economic governance and institutional reforms increasing aggregate productivity. Central Bank independence that was granted by Law in 2000, the introduction of the free-floating exchange rate regime in 2001, and inflation-targeting regime in 2002 were key steps (Yılmaz, 2008). The reforms also included attaining fiscal discipline, strengthening the banking system, improving the investment climate, and speeding up privatization (OECD, 2006, 2012; Gürsel, 2011; Aysan et al., 2013). This does not mean that growth in the short run guarantees sustainability in the long run. The initial reforms of the 2002–2007 period should be deepened over time with productivity-enhancing policies. This argument is in line with Rodrik (2005), who states that sustaining growth requires more extensive institutional reform and that the key to longer-term convergence is to develop institutions that maintain productivity growth. The findings suggest that policies should be targeted to increase overall productivity growth. In addition, uncovering the determinants of TFP growth may shed light on government policies, since some of these policies may affect the economy by influencing TFP growth. Our results are consistent with those of Hall and Jones (1999), Parente and Prescott (2002), Caselli (2005), Hsieh and Klenow (2010), and Jones and Romer (2010), who argue that most of the differences in international incomes are the result of differences in TFP. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section explores the convergence experience of Turkey and presents international comparisons. The following section studies the economic performance of Turkey using a growth-accounting framework that provides a breakdown of growth into components associated with changes in factor inputs and a residual that reflects technological progress and other elements. We also take a close look at the development experiences of Brazil and Turkey in comparison with Korea. Concluding remarks are presented in the final section.",1
57,1,Comparative Economic Studies,27 February 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2014.44,Informal Employment in Transition Countries: Empirical Evidence and Research Challenges,March 2015,Hartmut Lehmann,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many workers in all parts of the world are faced with informal employment relationships in their daily lives. The jobs of these workers in general do not provide any employment security or any protection in case of sickness and old age. Often informal jobs are also extremely hazardous to the health of workers. Informal employment thus poses major challenges to policy makers. These challenges can only be understood if we have a clear idea of what we mean by informal employment. It is undisputed in the literature that development and informal employment are inversely related (see, eg, La Porta and Shleifer, 2008); thus the bulk of informal jobs is found in developing and transition countries. The size of the informal sector is large in all areas of the transition region. The estimates of Schneider et al. (2010), however, show that its size increases as we go farther east: the lowest numbers are found in Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic States, with an average size of 24.3% of GDP in 2007, while the highest estimates are in the European CIS and the Caucasus, amounting to an average size of 47.6% of GDP in 2007.Footnote 1 The paper focuses predominantly on Russia and Ukraine, because we have excellent data sets at our disposal that allow us to discuss some of the thus far unresolved issues in the literature in a refined manner. The discussed issues are twofold. First, how should we define (or measure) informal employment? The incidence in a labor market depends on the definition used as we shall demonstrate in exemplary fashion with very detailed data taken from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS). Furthermore, the empirical distributions of informal employment across, for example, industries and its determinants depend on the used definition. In other words, when providing a descriptive analysis of this phenomenon in the labor market and when estimating its size we need to be aware of how strongly the empirical estimates depend on the employed definitions. The first part of the paper will make this point by providing a more precise picture of informal employment in the Russian labor market over the last decade using a variety of definitions. Second, even though researchers have analyzed informal employment in developing countries for decades, a generally accepted conceptual framework of how this type of employment and the labor market are intertwined does not exist. We can find at least three paradigms in the literature. The traditional dualistic view, going back to Harris and Todaro (1970), sees the informal segment as the inferior sector, the option of last resort. Due to barriers to entry, minimum wages, unions or other sources of segmentation, formal jobs are rationed. Workers in the informal sector are crowded out from the formal sector involuntarily, their wage being less than that in the formal sector.Footnote 2 For example, an increase in the statutory wage in the formal sector will reduce formal employment but lead to a lower informal wage and higher informal employment. During a recession, informal employment and unregistered output expands because formal employment is reduced, while the informal labor market clears. In this view, labor market segmentation between formality and informality is the defining feature of the labor market. In contrast, in a competitive labor market one would expect workers to be able to move freely between occupations, and for wages (broadly interpreted) to equalize accordingly. In this view, the informal and informal labor markets are not segmented, but integrated. Voluntary choice regarding jobs and particular attributes of these jobs, such as flexible hours, working as a self-employed and being one’s own boss as a micro-entrepreneur, and putting a small value on social security benefits, can be the reasons for remaining in or moving to the informal sector (Maloney, 1999, 2004; Cunningham and Maloney, 2001). Here, contrary to the segmentation case, formal and informal employment are not necessarily negatively correlated over the business cycle. Segmentation and integration of the formal and informal labor markets are two very polar views regarding the interaction of formality and informality. However, as suggested by Tokman (1986) and Fields (1990), it is possible, given the heterogeneity of the informal labor market, that these features co-exist in the same labor market. Tokman and Fields subdivide the informal labor market into two categories: an ‘easy-entry’ informal sector, which constitutes the involuntary segment, and an ‘upper-tier’ informal sector, where barriers of entry persist and in which participation is voluntary. Hence, the labor market is divided into the formal sector, a ‘disadvantaged’ subsistence-level informal sector and the ‘small firm’ and micro-entrepreneur informal sector.Footnote 3 How policy makers respond to growing informal employment in their economies will crucially depend on the paradigm they find most reasonable. To test for labor market segmentation along the formal–informal divide, researchers have employed two main tools: wage gap regressions and the estimation of transition probabilities between labor market states. We present the evidence on wage gaps citing the most credible studies on wage determination in transition countries that confront endogeneity and self-selection problems. A formal–informal wage gap at the mean of the wage distribution, with controls of observed and hopefully of unobserved characteristics, is often taken as evidence of labor market segmentation. From our own work, we also report estimates of the wage gap across the entire wage distribution in the Russian labor market. These estimates can also provide a tentative answer to the question whether the informal sector is segmented into a lower involuntary and upper voluntary tier. Turning to transition probability estimates, we then discuss some evidence on the flows between labor market states that distinguishes between formal and informal employment. Larger flows from the informal to the formal sector, having taken account of the different size of these sectors, or low mobility between states, both are thought to imply labor market segmentation. A third and novel method to test for segmentation is to link risk attitudes and labor market states. The RLMS and the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS) are two data sets that contain direct measures of risk attitudes and information on the voluntary/involuntary nature of informal employment. If persons who are willing to take more risks have a higher probability to engage in informal employment, then we would discard the traditional paradigm of pure labor market segregation. If, on the other hand, there is no impact of risk attitudes on the likelihood of working informally, we can take this as evidence albeit tenuous that workers are rationed out of the formal labor market and do not choose informal jobs. Since we have information on the voluntary/involuntary nature of informal employment, we refine this analysis by linking risk attitudes with involuntary and voluntary informal employment, respectively. Working in the informal sector constitutes a risk for the individual since there is no security of employment, income smoothing might be absent and there is the probability of detection and punishment by the authorities. We can moot that more risk-loving persons will have a higher propensity to be engaged in informal employment. Having direct measures of risk preferences we can, therefore, also explore the fundamental question whether these preferences are an important predictor of employment status choice, and thus add to the evidence that establishes risk attitudes as an important predictor of microeconomic behavior, for example, regarding occupational choice (Dohmen et al., 2012), migration behavior (Jaeger et al., 2010) and selection into self-employment (Caliendo et al., 2014).",21

But also, it appears that it is not sufficient to ensure that banks’ decisions, in terms of risk and capital, are consistent with the aims of regulation. Regulation acts as an external force in the capital optimization process as banks set simultaneously the level of capital and the amount of risky assets to hold in order to comply with the minimum capital ratio. However, given the moral hazard and asymmetries of information characterizing the banking activity, banks might have perverse incentives that induce them to raise risk when called to respond to stricter capital requirements, in order to keep their desired leverage. Understanding the relationship between capital and risk decisions is therefore fundamental in banking, and the underlying mechanisms should be investigated to adjust regulation and correct any hazardous behavior. Additionally, as regulation evolves, incentives might change and banks might modify their decisions. For these reasons, it is also important to understand how bank behavior has evolved since the introduction of the Basel framework that set the capital ratio at an international level, and how banks reacted to changes in prudential regulation. The aim of this paper is to provide a review of the main empirical research on the impact of regulation on capital and risk. The paper will also discuss how the recent evidence provided by these academic studies relates to the underlying theories highlighted within the literature to explain banks’ incentives, in relation to the aims of regulation. The paper contributes to the discussion on bank capital by surveying the most recent literature on the topic, providing an updated assessment on how our knowledge and understanding of the effects of capital regulation on banks’ behavior has evolved over the last decades, together with economic and market conditions. The main conclusion that emerges from the studies is that regulation has an important role in capital and risk decisions. But the effectiveness of bank regulation depends on other factors, such as the economic cycle, country, and the type of capital considered. The contrasting evidence provided by the empirical investigations also suggests the need for further advancements, both empirical and theoretical. The paper is organized as follows: the next section discusses how regulation enters the bank capital and risk decisions, surveying the main contributions on the evolution of regulation and its effects; the subsequent section discusses the empirical results on the role of capital regulation in the decisions of banks on capital and risk; the final section concludes.",29

57,1,Comparative Economic Studies,29 January 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2014.43,Do Indirect Questions Reduce Lying about Corruption? Evidence from a Quasi-Field Experiment,March 2015,George RG Clarke,Klaus S Friesenbichler,Michael Wong,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Managers who are concerned about being identified or looking bad have little reason to answer questions about corruption honestly. Managers who believe they might be identified if they admit to paying bribes could face legal problems, retaliation from the person they bribed, or might look bad to family, friends, and competitors. Even if managers think their responses will remain anonymous, they might not want to look bad to the interviewer. If they do not think the survey will change government behavior or they realize their individual responses are unlikely to affect average values in large surveys, they gain little from answering truthfully. It would, therefore, not be surprising if some managers lied about paying bribes. Survey respondents often underreport socially frowned on and illegal behaviors (Coutts and Jann, 2011; Fisher and Tellis, 1998; Lee, 1993). How much they do this depends on how sensitive the topic is, how interviewers ask questions, how data are collected, and characteristics of the respondent and the interviewer (Coutts and Jann, 2011). People with something to hide are especially likely to lie when asked sensitive questions (Tourangeau et al., 2000). Several recent papers have tried to estimate how much managers underreport bribes by identifying reticent respondents (Azfar and Murrell, 2009; Clausen et al., 2010; Jensen and Rahman, 2011). The interviewer asks the manager forced response questions (Warner, 1965) on sensitive topics unrelated to corruption. Researchers then use the managers’ answers to the forced response questions to identify reticent managers. We describe this approach in detail in the paper’s next section. Underreporting is estimated by comparing reticent managers’ answers to questions about corruption with less reticent managers’ answers to the same questions. Azfar and Murrell (2009) found reticent managers in Romania were less likely to report paying bribes when registering their firm and during health inspections than were other respondents. They interpret this as suggesting that reticent managers answer questions on bribes strategically and, therefore, underreport corruption. Based on conservative estimates of reticence and underreporting, Azfar and Murrell (2009) estimated that about a third more firms paid bribes in Romania than reported they did on the survey. This paper looks at the link between reticence and corruption using data from firm surveys in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. As in the papers discussed above, we find reticent managers are less likely to report problems caused by corruption than are less reticent managers. This underreporting could lead us to underestimate how common bribes are in these countries. In the sample, for example, only about 2% of managers whose firms had not been inspected said tax inspectors typically requested or expected bribes. If no managers were reticent, however, we estimate at least 14% of managers would answer the question in this way. Similarly, only about 11% of managers whose firms had been inspected said tax inspectors expected or asked for bribes during the inspection. If no managers were reticent, we estimate at least 22% of managers would answer the question in this way. The results confirm, using data from a different survey given in a different environment, that reticent managers answer questions about corruption differently than do other managers. Questions to identify reticent respondents would, therefore, be useful in many countries and surveys. This paper also adds to the literature on reticence and corruption in several other ways. First, in contrast to previous studies (Azfar and Murrell, 2009; Jensen and Rahman, 2011), we find reticent managers are less, not more, likely to refuse to answer questions about corruption than are non-reticent managers. We estimate non-response rates would rise by between 2 and 8 percentage points on the four questions on corruption if managers were not reticent. A reticent manager might refuse to answer questions because he or she believes people will interpret the manager’s refusals as a tacit admission of guilt. This belief would not be unreasonable; when the World Bank uses the Enterprise Survey data to calculate the percent of firms that pay bribes in a country, they treat firms that refuse to answer as if they paid bribes (World Bank, 2012a). Reticent managers might, therefore, prefer to answer ‘no’ rather than refuse to respond to the question. It is not clear why our results on refusals are different from the results in previous studies. Although it is possible the differences are cultural, it is also possible that differences in the questionnaires cause the differences in results. In contrast to the survey in Azfar and Murrell (2009), our survey does not focus on corruption; it contains only a few questions on corruption at the end of the survey. Understanding why our results are different might be important for future work. Second, we find reticence affects answers to both direct and indirect questions. Firm surveys often include indirect questions that ask the manager whether other firms pay bribes rather than asking direct questions about the manager’s experiences. Indirect questions allow managers to answer without directly implicating themselves (Treisman, 2007, p. 214). It is hoped that managers will be more forthcoming when answering indirect questions. The results from this study suggest indirect questions are, at best, only partly successful. For two of the three indirect questions, reticent managers were less likely to report problems associated with corruption. If, as previous studies have suggested, reticent managers are less likely to report corruption because they answer strategically, this suggests indirect questions do not always encourage reticent managers to be candid. Third, we control for the possibility that reticence is endogenous. We do this for two reasons. First, managers who face demands for bribes might become reticent, leading to reverse causation. Second, if a manager evades taxes or abuses his or her position, this will affect the paper’s measure of reticence.

For example, regional economic diversity within Mexico has led to the poorest regions having a disproportionate amount of migrants leaving the household (Arias et al., 2010). Despite the importance of regional differences, the explicit consideration of a spatial dimension to empirical analysis of the regional Mexican economy is rare (Torres-Preciado et al., 2014). Our inclusion of the spatial dimension is in the spirit of Ali et al. (2007), who explicitly recognize the importance of more assessment of spatial heterogeneity in the traditional growth empirical analysis. For the regional Mexican economy, the spatiality has recently been found to be an important component (Jordaan and Rodriquez-Oreggia, 2012). The convergence of Mexico’s regions has been examined in the literature for several decades with some studies focusing on industry only (eg, Bannister and Stolp, 1995; Chavez-Martin del Campo and Fonseca, 2013) and others suggesting centuries of extractive regimes leave a legacy that is difficult to overcome (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012, Chapter 1). Convergence was followed by divergence starting in the 1980s with the opening up of the Mexican economy (eg, Esquivel, 1999; Cermeño, 2001; Chiquiar, 2005; Carrion-i-Silvestre and German-Soto, 2007, 2009). Though convergence studies were sometimes motivated by trying to explain why growth slowed substantially in the open era (Torres-Preciado et al., 2014), regional analysis was often hampered by a lack of data for the open era and omission of a human capital input commonly used in growth studies of other countries. This study seeks to add to a very recent literature trying to fill this gap. For example, Chavez-Martin del Campo and Fonseca (2013) show that while the opening of the Mexican economy improved technical efficiency and reduced the labor productivity gap between the 32 states, a persistent lagging of southern regions continues. The lag is also found by Torres-Preciado et al. (2014) as innovation spillovers across regions impact the north and central regions more than other areas of Mexico. New northern agglomerations of economic activity discussed in Jordaan and Rodriquez-Oreggia (2012) also illustrate the north/south differences. These recent studies ignore the bias from using years of schooling to measure human capital discussed in the general regional literature (eg, Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin, 2000), although better measures are available for Mexico (German-Soto, 2007). In addition, they do not consider both long-run and spatial issues together. Using the improved human capital index recently applied to Mexican growth (Brock and German-Soto, 2013), we expand the convergence analysis to include regional heterogeneity, spatial autocorrelation and the weak instruments problem with a system-General Method of Moments (GMM) approach, in the spirit of similar work for the United States (Yamarik, 2006). Therefore, the resulting industrial convergence estimates come from a recently developed method that addresses many of the data/econometric concerns of prior work. In addition to regional diversity, Mexico over the last 50 years is a good example of an economy opening up to world trade and foreign investment. A closed economy with strong incentives for domestic industrial growth and very little connection to the rest of the world prevailed in Mexico in 1960. The policy objective was self-sufficiency. Policy measures included encouraging the consumption of internally manufactured products, reduced imports of final consumption goods, increased tariffs, infant industry protection and costly import quotas (Hanson, 1998; Esquivel and Rodríguez-López, 2003). Moreover, licenses were required to import almost any foreign product. In the 1960s and 1970s some positive economic outcomes occurred such as annual rates of growth between 6% and 9%, mild inflation, exchange rate stability and some reduction in income inequality. However, in the mid-1970s factor productivity growth stopped and by the early 1980s it was in decline (Arias et al., 2010). The 1980s became known as the ‘lost decade’ (Bergoeing et al., 2002), though Mexico did join General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1986. According to the literature, we characterize the 1960–1985 period as the ‘closed era’, followed by the 1986–2003 ‘open era’. The open era includes both an increased openness to trade with North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), in 1994, and the 1995 Peso crisis. Foreign direct investment (FDI) increased and technology improved, though Mexico had trouble allowing inefficient firms from the closed era to exit (Bergoeing et al., 2002) compared with other countries also opening at this time. Further, perhaps due to the drop in public spending, formal employment fell and income inequality increased (eg, Cragg and Epelbaum, 1996; Hanson and Harrison, 1999; Esquivel and Rodríguez-López, 2003). Reforms left many important sectors with closed-era monopolies and the economy overall with too many rigid local laws and social institutions (Arias et al., 2010). To study the entire era and the issue of regional inequality, we use the theory of convergence with the augmented-human-capital Solow model developed by Mankiw et al. (1992) for international convergence, with criticism found in Islam (1995), Caselli et al. (1996) and others. The system-GMM technique, developed by Blundell and Bond (1998), allows a good mix of instruments and reduces the problem of weak instruments obtained when only difference-GMM is used (Roodman, 2009). Also, we consider the filtering of spatial dependence of the data as suggested by Badinger et al. (2004). The DPD98 software, created by Arellano and Bond (1998) for equations where the lagged dependent variable is included as independent one, is applied. The software has advantages over other packages, mainly in the treatment of the serial correlation and the choice of instrumental variables within system-GMM regressions, by allowing flexibility to manipulate the general conditions of estimation. The rest of the work is as follows. The next section discusses the theory of convergence and motivates the system-GMM method. The subsequent section explains the data. The penultimate section analyzes the results and, the final section concludes.",7

Earlier concerns about the stability of the transition from national currencies to the euro as well as skepticism regarding the gains from forming the euro were deemed overblown by the mid-2000s. Issing’s optimistic 2006 speech reflects well the buoyant assessment of the first decade of the euro – an unprecedented formation of a new currency without a state. Observers viewed the rapid acceptance of the euro as a viable currency and the deeper financial integration of the Eurozone and the EU countries as stepping-stones toward a stable and prosperous Europe. The growing current account deficits of GIIPS (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) were caused by borrowing at low sovereign spreads. Intriguingly, GIIPS bonds’ interest rates dramatically converged during the 1990s to the German rate (see Figures 1 and 2). The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) World Economic Outlook (IMF, 2008) viewed emerging Europe’s large current account deficits as a validation of the gains associated with ‘capital flowing downhill’,Footnote 1 possibly dispelling concerns about the limited benefits of importing foreign savings as a means of financing domestic growth.Footnote 2 The celebratory assessment of the euro continued well into its tenth-year anniversary (Weber, 2008; Jonung and Drea, 2010), only to crash by the unfolding events of the Eurozone crisis.

The decision by the European Central Bank (ECB) in September 2014 to provide further support to stimulate lending in the Eurozone, following earlier such attempts by the ECB to ease the sovereign debt crisis, is further indication of the central bank’s concern that real economic activity remains weak. Although, the unemployment rate in the Eurozone is down slightly from its peak at 12% reached in September 2013, it remains, as this is written, well-above levels experienced since the euro was introduced. Germany, the economic powerhouse of the Eurozone economy in recent years, is forecast to slow down to 1.3% in 2015, according to the December 2014 Economist Poll of Forecasters down from earlier forecasts that were more optimistic. (http://www.economist.com/news/economic-and-financial-indicators/21635492-economist-poll-forecasters-december-averages) Real GDP growth in the other major Eurozone economies of France, Italy, and Spain is even lower with forecasts of below 1% through 2015. It is worth adding that real GDP growth forecasts in recent years have tended to be on the optimistic side. As growth forecasts are perilously close to negative territory, with little indication that policymakers will loosen fiscal policy in the foreseeable future, there is added burden on monetary policy to deliver the Eurozone from its low growth predicament. The ‘global financial crisis’ (GFC) of 2008–2009 has reminded the profession about the connection between credit conditions, financial stability, and economic performance that were previously forgotten but have now become an integral part of central bank thinking in the past few years. As a result, policymakers are now more aware than ever of the importance of understanding the links between credit market conditions and real economic activity. Until recently, the notion that there were frictions in the financial system that would hamper the monetary transmission mechanism was dismissed as unnecessary in empirical macromodels. Now, however, policymakers and academics are searching for ways to quantify the extent to which these frictions can impact aggregate economic outcomes. This has led to considerable research of late across the globe. One example the demonstrates the importance central banks attach to the role of the financial sectors in macroeconomic outcomes is ECB’s Macro-prudential Research Network (MaRs; https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/researcher_mars.en.html). The purpose of this paper is to describe a simple model to investigate the macroeconomic implications of financial frictions in the Eurozone. In particular, I argue that a survey of lending standards in the Eurozone countries is informative about aggregate economic activity in the single currency area. The difficulty, as will be explained below, is that the relevant data remain relatively scarce thereby rendering difficult the estimation of a more elaborate model specification incorporating credit frictions. Indeed, the availability of data is further limited since credit conditions for only a selection of Eurozone members are published.Footnote 1 There exists, however, an interim proxy to overcome the problem, at least until more ample data become available. Nevertheless, the proxy is no substitute for more credit standards data. I am especially interested in the empirical significance and magnitude of two channels through which lending standards are linked to the real side of the economy and monetary policy. These are defined as the real and financial channels of monetary policy. Next, I ask whether policy rate shocks influence lending standards, and whether these standards also have an effect on monetary policy? If statistically significant macroeconomic effects are found, and are robust, then macro-models need to be augmented with an indicator to proxy financial frictions. The paper begins with the observation that a crucial element at stake in the storm brewing in Europe since 2010 is the connection between credit availability and real economic conditions. The essence of the framework is the recognition that ‘sentiment’, as represented by how loan officers view the ease or tightness of overall credit conditions, represents a potentially important element in the transmission of shocks from the financial sector, notably the crucial bank lending channel, to the real economy.Footnote 2 The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. First, I provide a brief literature review. I then go on to provide a description of the framework used to think about how the real and financial sectors of economies might be linked to each other and how lending standards data can be potentially informative. The framework recognizes a determinant of macroeconomic conditions, long known to economists, that credit availability and monetary policy are intertwined and that both can have significant effects on the real economy. Crucially, however, it is the views of lenders that determines how smoothly financial markets function and their views about whether lending standards are tighter or looser that have the potential to produce real economic effects. Next, some suggestive evidence is presented. Briefly, the paper finds that inclusion of indicators of financial frictions in standard macromodels is essential. Some of the results also suggest that in 2011–2012, the ECB made financial conditions worse by not only raising the policy rate but by implementing a very gradual reduction in monetary conditions over the next 2 years. The paper concludes with a summary and possible policy implications.",4
57,2,Comparative Economic Studies,15 January 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2014.36,Fiscal and Monetary Policies During the Great Recession: A Critical Evaluation,June 2015,Vito Tanzi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper discusses the fiscal and monetary policies that the industrial countries have been following since the beginning of the financial crisis, in 2007–2008, and comments on the debate among economists that has accompanied these policies. That debate has concerned: (a) the presumed ‘austerity’ that several countries’ governments have been criticized for pursuing with their fiscal policies; (b) the economic benefits that highly expansionary monetary policies may or may not have generated; and (c) the effects that these policies have had on uncertainty and on the economic decisions of private agents. The paper concludes with a defense of traditional and more orthodox policies. To some extent the consequences of the recession that accompanied the financial crisis are still being felt, especially in some advanced countries: the unemployment rates remain high, although they have been falling even rapidly in several countries; the growth rates are lower than considered desirable; fiscal imbalances are still high, although not as high as in the earlier years; and, according to the latest statistics, available from Eurostat and the IMF, the shares of public debts in GDPs are still rising. For the world as a whole, that share in 2014 reached a historical record. These developments have continued to generate heated debates among economists and policymakers, on the kind of policies that the countries’ governments should be promoting, now and in the next few years. As is often the case in debates in economics, the differences in views are wide and remind one of those that took place in the 1930s (see Wapshott, 2011). Just how wide the differences are, can be appreciated by citing a blog by Paul Krugman, from 16 November 2013. Strongly endorsing views that had been expressed a few days earlier by Larry Summers, at a research seminar held at the IMF, he wrote that we are in a ‘liquidity trap’ in which the ‘natural’ rate of interest, the rate that, in his view, would equate saving and investment, presumably for the United States, has become ‘negative’ and where ‘the normal rules of economic policy don’t apply’, because ‘the [US] economy remains deeply depressed’. Owing to this depressed state of the economy, ‘more spending of any kind [productive or unproductive] is good for the economy’ (italics added). He added that: ‘the panic over public debt looks … foolish … [because] servicing the debt … has no cost [in the United States] in fact [it has a] negative cost’. This might be true for borrowing at the federal fund rate, that is at very short maturity. His message for governments was to spend more, the more the better. Some other commentators endorsed the Krugman’s view. The above statements must be related to the US fiscal situation. In 2013, the latest year for which data for the general (not the federal) government were available, the US general government balance (the fiscal deficit) was 5.8% of GDP; the gross debt had reached 104.2% of GDP (it had been 64% in 2007), well over that for the European Monetary Union, which was 95.2% of its GDP. For the US federal (not the general) government the share of public debt to GDP had increased from 35% in 2007 to a projected level of 74% for 2014. In 2013 the fiscal deficit had been coming down from the extraordinary level of 13.5% of GDP, reached in 2009. The reduction in the deficit after 2009 had been in part due to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, in part to the ‘sequestration’ of some public spending, in 2013, that was not likely to be politically sustainable, and in part to the economic recovery underway. However, in 2014 the public debt of the general government of the United States was still rising and the fiscal deficit was still expected to be close to 6% of GDP. In the euro area, in 2014, these variables were expected to be 96.4% and 2.9% of GDP, respectively, according to the October 2014 Fiscal Monitor of the IMF. The policymakers of various countries and many fiscal experts have continued to worry about the fiscal developments in the United States and in some European countries (and in Japan), and about the medium- and long-run impact on the economies of the current fiscal and monetary policies. It is, thus, natural to ask what fiscal and monetary policies would be prudent for the countries to follow, now and over the medium run, to improve the economic and fiscal situations of the countries in order to allow them to exit completely from the crisis. Should they persist with (and even intensify) the current policies, associated with still large fiscal deficits, growing public debts and exceedingly low interest rates and even intensify those policies, as Krugman, Summers and some other economists seem to believe they should, given the ‘depressed state of the [US and European] economies’? Or should the US and the other countries go back to more traditional and more orthodox policies? At times, the terms used by some of the participants in this debate, to define the policies or the situations, are a bit unorthodox, to say the least. For example, the ‘deeply depressed’ US economy had been growing at better than 2% per year, and is forecast to grow at a higher rate in 2015, and the unemployment rate has been falling rapidly, while the so-called ‘austerity’ policies, presumably followed by the US and by several other countries, had little resemblance to how a dictionary would define that term. With few exceptions, in 2013, the governments of most countries were spending more and in some cases much more (as shares of their GDPs, or even in absolute amounts) than they were in 2007, the last year before the financial crisis started. See Table 1 for the shares of public spending into GDPs in several countries and in selected recent years and Table 2 for the absolute amounts. It should be noted that in 2007, the last year of a long and significant bubble, both public and private spending had been inflated by the bubble, fed by expansionary monetary policy and, especially in the USA, had been aided by the large acquisition of sovereign bonds by China and some other countries. These developments had inflated both the growth rates and the tax revenue of the US and of several other countries. Therefore, when judging the developments over the years, both the countries’ income levels and their fiscal accounts should be adjusted, to correct them for the positive impact that the bubble had had on those variables, in the years before the crisis. This correction would allow meaningful comparisons to be made with later years. In some countries (Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Iceland and, to some extent, the US and the UK) the needed corrections could be significant. For some elaboration of this point and some rough estimates, see Tanzi (2012). Table 2 reports indices of real public spending (2007=100), deflated by the GDP deflator and by the Consumer Price Index respectively. The table shows that, with very few exceptions, between 2007 and 2013 real public spending had increased, in some countries considerably: in spite of the presumed ‘austerity’ policies imposed by governments; in spite of the falls in GDPs; and in spite of the bubble-inflated levels of spending in 2007. A major exception was Greece that before the crisis had launched a major program of public spending in part because of the Olympics.",10

Such dilemmas have been made harder by many years of very expansionary monetary policy in the advanced economies. Once their policy rates had been cut to almost zero, the major central banks in the advanced economies bought long-term assets (or extended longer-term loans) in order to reduce interest rates at longer maturities. This has come on top of a more durable and puzzling trend: the secular decline in real long-term rates that began in 2000, years ahead of Quantitative Easing (QE) by the Federal Reserve. Because globalization has linked EM financial markets more closely to long-term interest rates in the major centers, monetary and other policy choices in the EMs have faced new constraints. The first section of this paper shows how long-term rates in the EMs have become more sensitive to yields in the major bond markets. Perhaps because of capital inflows into local EM bond markets, even short-term rates in EMs now seem to respond to changes in the term premium in US dollar markets. A new development of major importance is increased borrowing in international bond markets by EM non-financial companies. The financial system effects of this go deep because such borrowing has enabled increased wholesale bank deposits by non-financial companies. This has contributed to an expansion in the balance sheets of EM banks, which had already been inflated by large-scale forex intervention. These linkages are key because many have pointed to the rapid rise in bank credit/GDP ratios as a source of vulnerability in many EMs (as discussed in the section ‘Expanding Bank Balance Sheets in EMs’). The natural place to start an analysis of dilemmas facing EM central banks is therefore dollar bond markets. Aggregate borrowing in US dollar bond markets by non-banks outside the United States now exceeds $4 trillion – a four-fold rise since the start of 2000 (McCauley et al., 2015). Deeper integration into such debt markets has transformed how emerging economies are affected by changes in the stance of monetary policy in advanced economies and by non-monetary forces acting on long-term dollar interest rates. In the days when international bank lending dominated financial flows to the EMs, movements in short-term dollar interest rates (notably 3-month Libor) – under the close control of the Federal Reserve – shaped financial conditions. As debt markets have grown and become more integrated globally, however, a market-determined ‘world’ real long-term interest rate has assumed greater importance. The yield of 10-year US Treasuries is the global benchmark. But this dollar benchmark is driven by developments worldwide, not only by US growth or monetary policy. The huge volume of transactions between non-US residents in dollar bond markets – that is, not borrowing from US residents and so often not closely linked with US economic developments – have made dollar bond markets global. By way of illustration, Figure 1 shows the origin of dollar-denominated credit to non-bank borrowers outside the United States. $1.3 trillion comes from bond investors in the United States, but $2.7 trillion comes from bond investors not based in the United States. Many such investors come from the EMs – which have built up large asset portfolios of foreign bonds. US dollar-denominated credit to borrowers outside US in trillions of dollars. Source: McCauley et al. (2015); data as of December 2013 There is of course no unique way of measuring the ‘world’ interest rate. But the estimate prepared by Mervyn King and David Low (based on advanced economy bond market data) is a good starting point (Figure 2). Movements in the yield on 10-year US Treasuries – shown as a dashed line in the top graph – dominate this ‘world’ interest rate. The world real long-term interest rate has been falling for more than a decade and is now close to zero. The lower graph, based on calculations from Hördahl and Tristani (2014), shows that this has been largely driven by a compression of the term premium – the reward for holding long-dated rather than short-dated bonds. The long-term interest rate, therefore, has moved for other reasons than changes in expected future short rates. This paper pays particular attention to the role of massive central bank purchases of bonds in driving long-term rates down.Footnote 1 But monetary policy alone can explain a persistent trend in real long-term rates. The section ‘What is the ‘Normal’ Long-term Interest Rate?’ therefore briefly reviews the non-monetary factors that may have driven down the new ‘normal’ level of the long-term rate.

Sources: King and Low (©February 2014); Bloomberg; national data; BIS calculations As a direct response to the crisis, both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England bought bonds on an exceptional scale with the explicit aim of lowering long-term rates in their currencies (QE). When these central banks normalize monetary policy, both by raising policy rates and by reducing their balance sheets, long-term rates in their currencies would be expected to rise. The fourth section ‘Central Bank Balance Sheets and the Long-term Rate’ explains that it is difficult to foresee how central banks will adjust their balance sheets in the years ahead, adding to uncertainty about the future long-term interest rate. In any event, US dollar long-term rates are susceptible to global shocks – including those of a non-monetary nature. Long-term interest rates in EM currencies are likely to move in the same direction. An EM central bank could of course try to counter this by raising its short-term rate. But exchange rate considerations that are discussed in the ‘The Exchange Rate and Dollar Debt’ section have probably become more constraining in the setting of short-term rates in EMs during the recent period of near-zero policy rates in the advanced economies. The prospect at the time of writing is that US monetary policy will become less accommodating while the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank will become more expansionary. The prospect of such policy divergence – to be sustained on present plans at least to late 2016 – seems to have fuelled a strong rise in the dollar. This is significant because the dollar remains the currency of denomination of most EM international debt. The Bank of Japan’s massive purchase of longer-term Japanese government bonds began under a new governor in 2013, and is continuing. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced in January 2015 its plans to buy securities on a large scale until at least September 2016.",2

The commodity booms that the global economy recently experienced have brought in large revenues, creating important economic opportunities for growth and development. This trend has encouraged many developing countries to intensify their natural resource exploration and to increase commodity production and exports. Export shares of primary commodities, LDCs, SIDS and HIPCs, 1995–2013 Source: UNCTAD, UNCTADStat database (accessed 31 October 2014) This paper is motivated by two observations. First, natural resource management (NRM) has become a top national priority for many resource-rich commodity-exporting developing (RRCED) countries wishing to ride the latest commodity booms to promote economic growth and human development. But natural resource windfalls are not necessarily a blessing. In fact, many RRCED economies have not been able to translate their resource wealth into economic or human development gains and have therefore for a long time been associated with negative economic terms such as resource curse, Dutch disease, sovereign default and economic crisis. Second, price volatility is a critical feature of commodity markets, and commodity prices have experienced a rollercoaster ride over the last decade. Increasing commodity price volatility (CPV)Footnote 1 creates challenges for the macroeconomic management of RRCED economies and exposes commodity-dependent developing countries to greater macroeconomic volatility. Greater macroeconomic volatility, in turn, tends to lower long-run growth prospects for RRCED economies, with bigger and long-lasting negative impacts felt in poorer countries and among poorer populations.Footnote 2 Developing mechanisms and capacity to cope with increasing CPV is indispensable for RRCED countries to protect their economies from the boom and bust cycles of commodity prices and to secure the greatest social and economic benefits of their natural resources. However, relying exclusively on ex post coping mechanisms to address the consequences of CPV may lead to costly adjustments and threaten macroeconomic stability and progress made on economic, social and human development. Instead, governments can put in place meaningful tools and mechanisms at various stages of the NRM process ex ante, in anticipation of another boom or bust in prices. This paper contributes to the literature by examining sustainable NRM and increasing CPV together, by first exploring the complications that increasing CPV creates at each stage of the NRM chain; and by second, discussing ex ante policy mechanisms and tools that have been adopted by individual countries to resolve the complications created by increasing CPV. Based on a framework adapted from Collier (2010), we identify challenges and possible solutions of NRM in the context of increasing CPV along a NRM chain that consists of three stages. First, the exploration and exploitation stage; second, the revenue collection stage and third, the revenue spending, investment and savings stage. At each of the three stages, we identify key challenges created by increasing CPV and then the corresponding ex ante policy mechanisms and tools that RRCED countries can use to cope with increasing CPV. Our analysis yields three important lessons for RRCED economies. First, a well-designed fiscal system structured to respond to CPV can help governments to collect resource revenues more effectively. Second, a sound general fiscal framework, in particular a prudent set-up of a fiscal rule, presents a more permanent constraint binding present and future governments and helping countries overcome cyclical fiscal spending because of commodity booms and busts. Third, earmarking commodity revenues for public spending like investments for more productive and healthy societies and the diversification of economies will contribute to counter RRCED countries’ vulnerability to fluctuations in commodity prices. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sections ‘Increasing CPV and Natural Resource Exploration and Exploitation’, ‘Increasing CPV and Natural Resource Revenue Collection’ and Increasing CPV and ‘Natural Resource Revenue Spending, Investment and Savings’ analyze complexities and challenges created by increasing CPV at different stages of the NRM chain. Surveying individual country experiences to identify best practices and failed attempts, these sections subsequently discuss policy options adopted by individual countries.Footnote 3 The last section concludes with policy recommendations for RRCED countries to better manage their natural resources in an increasingly volatile global market.",3

57,3,Comparative Economic Studies,26 March 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2015.3,Macroeconomic Policy in Argentina During 2002–2013,September 2015,Mario Damill,Roberto Frenkel,Martín Rapetti,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper analyzes macroeconomic policy and performance in Argentina between 2002 and 2013. This is a very interesting case study. The period began with a severe financial and debt crisis. In December 2001, the government announced the largest default on public debt in global financial history. By mid-2002, GDP was 21% lower than its previous peak of mid-1998, unemployment rate reached almost 22% and half of the population became poor. Rather unexpectedly for most observers, the economy began a rapid and strong recovery, which then turned into rapid and strong economic growth. During this process employment grew very fast, many tradable services, manufactures and agricultural activities boomed and non-traditional exports expanded at a rapid pace. The impact of the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 was short-lived and not as severe as in other emerging markets. However, by late 2011, despite the very favorable external context of low interest rates and high terms of trade, the economy started to be constrained by the lack of foreign exchange. In early 2014, it finally faced a balance of payments crisis that forced the central bank to devalue the peso by 25% in a few days. As a result inflation accelerated and output and employment contracted. On top of this mounted the judicial decision by a New York Court in mid-2014 to make Argentina pay in full creditors who had not entered the debt restructurings of 2005 and 2010. The government’s decision not to comply with the Court’s order made Argentina fall in a new default of its debt, which created additional financial difficulties and uncertainties to an already stagnant economy. The full resolution and consequences of this complex scenario are – at the time we write these lines – still to be seen. How was it possible for Argentina to recover so quickly and strongly from such a severe economic (ie, currency, debt and financial), social and political crisis in the early 2000s? How did it happen that the economy fell in a stagflationary trap in late 2011 after having grown so fast and without experiencing any negative external or domestic shock? In our view, the answers to these questions are critically related to the way macroeconomic policy was conducted during this period. The strong economic recovery largely responded to the positive environment created by the macroeconomic policy regime that emerged in the immediate post-crisis. This macro-policy orientation was supported on three key pillars: (1) a stable and competitive real exchange rate (SCRER),Footnote 1 (2) twin surpluses of the current account and the fiscal balance, and (3) a large and increasing stock of international reserves at the central bank. These elements were instrumental to create a sound macroeconomic configuration and social environment that made possible a rapid recovery and later on strong and sustained economic growth. It is during this period that real wages, employment and income distribution improved the most. Despite its success, this macro-policy orientation was gradually abandoned and replaced by a shortsighted strategy that sought to stimulate aggregate demand disregarding the impacts on the macrobalances (eg, inflation, the balance of payments and the fiscal deficit). The new orientation favored the expansion of wages and public consumption to stimulate employment and output growth, in an economy that already had signs of excess demand – GDP growing around 8% and the inflation rate around 25%. This strategy was jointly implemented with a monetary policy that implied highly negative real interest rates and used the exchange rate and public utility rates as the main nominal anchors. This cocktail resulted in a growing misalignment of key relative prices, especially a real exchange rate (RER) overvaluation and excessively low subsidized public utilities rates such as residential energy and urban transportation, which ended up affecting both the fiscal and external balances. We devote the rest of the article to develop our argument. In the section ‘Macroeconomic performance’, we present a concise narrative of events and analyze the macroeconomic performance between 2002 and 2013. In the section ‘Macroeconomic policy’, we discuss macroeconomic policy in greater detail. We describe the main measures and policy changes during the period. We end in the section ‘Closing remarks’ with a few remarks.",18

This regime followed a brief period of fixed exchange rates, in 1994–98, when the Brazilian government used a currency peg to reduce and stabilize inflation. The so-called ‘Real Plan’ was successful in controlling inflation, but it also increased the financial fragility of the economy through high domestic real interest rates, a rising ratio of public debt to GDP and large current account deficits. When the global situation changed, in the wake of the East Asian and Russian crises of 1997–98, the Brazilian government abandoned the currency peg and moved to another macroeconomic policy regime, which persists to date. The endurance of the current macroeconomic framework does not mean that the Brazilian economy has experienced smooth sailing since 1999. Quite to the contrary, a series of exogenous shocks have hit the economy in the past 15 years, coming from the world economy and the climate, which had a substantial impact on Brazil’s exchange rate and power prices, respectively.Footnote 1 Moreover, Brazil also experienced significant domestic and government-induced structural changes, especially the expansion of the government’s social safety net, which resulted in lower poverty, lower income inequality, credit expansion and financial deepening. Brazilian monetary policy managed to keep inflation under control and maintain financial stability even in the face of the exogenous shocks and structural changes mentioned above. More specifically, in 9 of the 15 years since the adoption of inflation targeting, the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) has managed to keep inflation within the bounds defined by the government. Even though inflation stayed above the government’s central target during most of this period, it did not get out of control either. The average annual rate of consumer inflation was 7.1% in 1999–13, with a maximum of 12.5% in 2002 and a minimum of 3.1% in 2006.Footnote 2 The current central target is 4.5%, with an interval of tolerance of plus or minus 2 percentage points, but the BCB has been having difficulty meeting the target.Footnote 3 The recent difficulty in controlling inflation comes mostly from the depreciation of the Brazilian real (BRL). In fact, the Brazilian average real exchange rate rose 20% in 2012–13, which in turn created a temporary inflationary and recessive shock.Footnote 4 In fact, despite Brazil’s move to floating exchange rates in 1999, Brazilian prices remain very sensitive to the exchange rate. Whenever there is a sharp depreciation of the BRL, the BCB has difficulty meeting the inflation target. Whenever the opposite happens, the target is met with relative ease. This paper analyzes Brazilian monetary policy since 1999 and its relationship with inflation and economic growth. It will be argued that, despite its limitations and problems, the current ‘macroeconomic tripod’ composed of floating exchange rates, fiscal rules and inflation targeting continues to be the best framework to manage the Brazilian economy. Borrowing Churchill’s famous line, the current tripod of Brazilian macroeconomic policy is the worst form of macroeconomic policy, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time in Brazil. On a more technical level, it will be argued that inflation targeting emerged as the best macroeconomic policy in Brazil because it stabilizes both the real exchange rate and GDP growth, although not necessarily at an optimal level. The paper has six sections. The section ‘The macroeconomic “tripod” describes the institutional structure of Brazilian macroeconomic policy. The section ‘Macroeconomic policy since the late 1990s’gives a brief macroeconomic history of Brazil since 1999. The section ‘Monetary policy and exchange-rate policy’ presents the evolution of the main instruments of monetary and exchange-rate policy since 1999. The section ‘Exchange rate and inflation in the short run’ estimates the short-run impact of the exchange rate on inflation and the section ‘Exchange rate, inflation and growth in the long run’ does the same for the long run, including GDP growth in the analysis. The section ‘Monetary policy and structural change’ concludes with some comments on the role of monetary demand management and structural reforms in Brazil’s economic policy.",5

This approach was highly successful, delivering a 7.1% average GDP growth in 1990–1998, with a sharp reduction in poverty, higher employment and some improvement in income distribution. That outcome was in marked contrast to the 2.9% average GDP growth and rise in poverty and inequality seen during the previous 16 years under the Pinochet dictatorship.Footnote 2 A key feature of the neo-liberal experiment of those years was high stability of consumer prices (CPI, a positive outcome ceteris paribus). However, during most of the period, this was accompanied by great real economic disequilibria, severe unemployment, external imbalances and unstable aggregate demand. In this context, depressed capital formation was the main variable determining the meagre 2.9% GDP growth achieved in 1974–1989.Footnote 3 The successful record of the 1990–1998 period was broken by contagion from the Asian crisis. In the 15 years from 1999 to 2013, average growth declined from the previous 7.1% to 3.9%. Although above the 3.2% average for Latin America,Footnote 4 this implied a sharp drop with respect to Chile’s track record in the 1990s. In this chapter, I seek to explain this significant reversal. Given that there were not important backwards steps as regards microeconomic policies, it focuses on macroeconomic policies stressing the quite significant changes between the two periods. We show that the adoption of inflation targeting combined with full opening of the capital account and full liberalisation of the exchange rate was successful in keeping inflation low and avoiding balance of payments crises, but implied that the real economy – the production and use of GDP – usually operated below potential output and the exchange rate became extremely unstable, both of which depressed the sources of economic growth.Footnote 5 The causes of the significant change in policy approach are explored. Four macroeconomic policies are analysed: the monetary, exchange rate and capital-account policies of the Central Bank and the fiscal policy of the Finance Ministry as well as the degree of coordination between both institutions. After a brief description of the macroeconomic framework (Section 1), two cycles are distinguished in the evolution of policies and outcomes: (i) 1999–2007, from the peak of economic activity before contagion from the Asian crisis through the 5-year recession that followed and the subsequent recovery, led by rising commodity prices, up to a peak in 2007 before the start of contagion from the global crisis (Section 2); and (ii) 2008–2013, from contagion by the global crisis through the 2010–2013 recovery process (Section 3). Section 4 concludes with some policy lessons for speeding development convergence.",2
57,3,Comparative Economic Studies,21 May 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2015.11,Colombian Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Over the Past Decade,September 2015,José Antonio Ocampo,Jonathan Malagón,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The standard analysis of the complex macroeconomic policy choices that central banks face in open economies is Mundell’s (1963) ‘trilemma’. According to this framework, central banks cannot control both exchange and interest rates if the capital account is open, and so have to give up policy objectives in one of these two areas; they can alternatively close the capital account to regain simultaneous control of both monetary and exchange rate policies. The trilemma does not exhaust, of course, the list of possible central bank objectives or instruments. In terms of objectives, the US Federal Reserve charter includes, alongside stable prices, two other objectives: maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates; the latter may be understood as a growth objective. These two additional goals also prominently figure out in the agenda of economists of a Keynesian tradition. A growth objective is also behind the call of several development economists for central banks to guarantee a competitive and relatively stable exchange rate, which they view as essential for economic diversification and long-term development (see, among many others, Rodrik, 2008, and Frenkel and Rapetti, 2010). The recent North-AtlanticFootnote 1 financial crisis added still another objective, financial stability, and popularized ‘macro-prudential regulations’ as a set of additional policy instruments. The idea that prudential regulations could be used as a macroeconomic policy instrument was already on the agenda of some analysts before the crisis but had been generally ignored. The spread of inflation targeting as the framework for central bank policy management was an interesting attempt to mix inflation control and employment as objectives of monetary policy. The central idea is that if the price level is determined by domestic demand, targeting inflation is consistent with a counter-cyclical monetary policy that also aims at guaranteeing an unemployment level that fluctuates around its ‘natural’ rate. This view was termed the ‘divine coincidence’, but the North-Atlantic crisis showed that it does not hold as a rule even in advanced economies (Blanchard et al., 2010). A variety of ‘flexible’ inflation targeting, which does not entirely eliminate other policy objectives, was the choice of five of the seven largest Latin American economies in the late 1990s/early 2000s (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Mexico). This was mixed with the prior choice for more open capital accounts, which had been adopted as part of the market liberalization policies that started in a few countries in the mid-1970s and spread throughout Latin America since the mid-1980s. As in many other emerging countries’ central banks, inflation targeting was mixed in these Latin American countries with greater exchange rate flexibility. However, the major problem in this regard is that most emerging economies are characterized by ‘balance of payments dominance’: a macroeconomic condition in which the short-term macroeconomic dynamics is mainly determined by the external shocks, both positive and negative, that periodically hit these economies, particularly pro-cyclical capital flows, terms of trade shocks and associated real exchange rate fluctuations (Ocampo, 2015b). One of the major complications is that these shocks tend to induce a pro-cyclical response from macroeconomic authorities, or at least reduces the space for counter-cyclical policies. Indeed, capital account booms directly generate expansionary pressures, which are enhanced by the equally expansionary effects of exchange-rate appreciation (associated with increased real wages and improved balance sheets if domestic agents have net liabilities in foreign currency). At the same time, however, the direct supply effects of appreciation helps reduce inflation, thus leading to a situation in which, in contrast with the basic assumption of the inflation targeting regime, the link between inflation and domestic demand is affected by the effects of the exchange rate on domestic prices. In turn, depreciation during crises may have contractionary effects but feed directly into the inflation dynamics. Under these conditions, focusing on the links between domestic demand and inflation may lead to an inadequate counter-cyclical macroeconomic policy design. Furthermore, the deterioration of the current account of the balance of payments that exchange rate appreciation induces during booms may help cool down the expansionary effects on domestic demand but at the risk of generating a balance of payments crisis if the boom is followed by a bust/sudden stop in external financing (see, among many others, Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999, and Ocampo et al., 2008). It also generates, as previously indicated, serious competitiveness problems that may have long-term effects. For all these reasons, emerging countries’ central banks have generally refused to allow a freely floating exchange rate, and have increasingly opted for some form of managed floating, in which interventions in foreign exchange markets are frequent and sometimes accompanied by capital account management (Gosh et al., 2014). This indicates that economies that face balance of payments dominance require a wider array of policy instruments to cope with the cyclical shocks they face. Colombia certainly fits into the characterization of an economy under balance of payments dominance that has moved into flexible inflation targeting-cum-managed floating. The 1991 Constitution gave the central bank (Banco de la República – hereafter referred to also as the Bank or the central bank) more policy autonomy and placed inflation control at the core of its mandate, though in coordination with the general economic policy. Traditional exchange controls were dismantled in 1993 and an exchange rate band was put in place in January 1994 to give that variable more flexibility. A floating exchange rate regime was adopted in 1999 and inflation targeting in 2001. However, central bank interventions in foreign exchange markets have been frequent – though, as we will see, less so than in other Latin American countries – and several regulations of capital flows remain in place or have been reintroduced during capital account booms. In the 1990s, the Bank was only very partially successful in avoiding a credit boom and was also unable to avoid a recession in 1999, the first one in Colombia since the early 1930s. After the reforms introduced during the late-twentieth century crisis, monetary policy management facilitated the transition to a relatively low inflation rate with high levels of investment and fairly dynamic growth, supported by very favorable external conditions. The major criticisms of central bank policy over the past decade have thus been that it has allowed strong exchange rate overvaluation during capital account booms, notably during the boom that took off in late 2009 and started to weaken with the announcements of US Fed monetary policy tapering in May 2013. This paper analyzes the performance of Colombia’s monetary and exchange rate policies over the past decade.Footnote 2 It is divided in five sections, the first of which is this introduction. The second looks at the institutional framework under which Banco de la República operates. The third and fourth analyze monetary and exchange rate policies, respectively. The fifth presents some brief conclusions. Owing to space constraints, we leave aside the issue of domestic financial stability. This is an area where results were mixed in the 1990s, as the country was unable to avoid a domestic financial crisis – though a relatively modest one by international standards. This was followed by major advance in financial stability after the crisis.",4

A central argument is that in pursuing low inflation as its single and exclusive goal, and given the characteristics of the Mexican economy – a large degree of trade openness, a relatively high pass through of exchange rate movements into prices, and a low direct sensitivity of aggregate demand to interest rates, monetary policy has generated a recurrent tendency toward real exchange rate appreciation with very adverse effects on economic growth. These effects are amply documented. The paper also examines the central bank’s intervention in the foreign exchange market and the effectiveness of sterilized intervention in influencing the real exchange rate and potentially overcoming the tendency to real appreciation. The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the mandate of the central bank, an autonomous bank since 1993 with a very clear constitutional mandate of price stability. The section after that reviews the instruments of monetary policy and the effectiveness of these instruments in achieving inflation targets. The following section analyses the origins of real exchange appreciation in the relative efficiency of different instruments and in particular the effects of the exchange rate on inflation. The penultimate section examines foreign exchange intervention and the final section concludes by discussing policy implications of the analysis.",5

Inflation was at its lowest in decades (see Figure 1); GDP growth was at its highest in decades (see Figure 2); and there was no banking crisis. Inflation and supply shocks. Source: BCRP. Total GDP and non-primary sector GDP. (Percentage change). Source: BCRP. However, attributing this good macroeconomic performance to the role played by monetary policy is not a simple operation, as the external context was exceptionally favorable over 2002–2013 (see Mendoza, 2013). A favorable external context stimulates GDP growth and enables a low rate of inflation because the local currency appreciates. For an economy such as Peru’s, higher commodity export prices lead to good times, while lower commodity export prices lead to bad times; these external prices directly influence private investment, public spending, and the exchange rate. The other key piece of the external context is capital flows, which also influences aggregate demand and the balance of payments. Since the financial liberalization of the 1990s, capital flows have been procyclical: inflows are associated with booms, and outflows are associated with recessions. The external context has largely been favorable, but for a couple of periods. The first exception is the period of global financial crisis of 2008–2009, and the second exception is the open period in mid-2013, marked by the adjustment of the US monetary policy and a worldwide fall in the price of metals. The two most recent recessions (1998–2000 and 2008–2009) coincided with a sharp worldwide downturn in the prices of the metals that the Peruvian economy exports, and a steep drop in the credit provided by the local banking system in foreign currency to firms and to families. This credit crunch is linked in both cases to the fact that the external financing sources of local banking suddenly dried up. The price index of Peruvian exports was 3.2 times greater in 2008 than in 2002; went down between July and December of 2008; doubled from the start of 2009 to its August 2011 peak; and then fell again, by 16%, until May 2014. By the end of this period, this index was 3.4 times its initial value. With respect to capital inflow or outflow, the best indicator is the 12-month growth rate of bank credit to the private sector in foreign currency. These loans established a direct link between internal demand and international financial conditions. In a first stage, from 2002–2006, credit growth in dollars was negative or small due to the combined effect of new central banking regulations – which is explained herein – and the consequences of the banking crisis of 1998–2000. In a second stage, from 2007–2014, two large credit expansions took place (January 2007–September 2008 and January 2010–November 2012), as well as two sharp contractions (October 2008–November 2009, December 2012–March 2014), both determined by changes in international financial conditions (the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 and the adjustment of the US monetary policy at the start of 2013). For the end of this period, foreign currency credit in the private banking sector accounted for 13.7% of GDP; that is, 3 percentage points higher than at the start of 2007. In this favorable external environment, the BCRP took a second decision as important as setting the inflation targeting system. The central bank decided to accumulate large foreign exchange reserves on a scale that was without precedent in Peruvian economic history. Between January 2002 and April 2013, the BCRP’s foreign exchange reserves, measured by the foreign exchange position,Footnote 1 grew 17 times, accounting for 24% of GDP at the end of this period. This decision changed the limits of what is possible in terms of monetary policy and macroeconomic stability. The BCRP was able to tackle the impact on the exchange rate of adverse external shocks and/or the speculative attacks that habitually accompany them, without applying a restrictive monetary policy. It did this during the 2006 presidential election campaign, during the 2008–2009 global financial crisis, and, finally, during the tapering announced by Bernanke at the start of 2013. In reality, the specific role played by monetary policy during this period can only be assessed if one questions why there was no great recession or banking crisis in 2008–2009 like that of 1998–2000. Moreover, one might also ask why inflation was not derailed during the negative supply shocks (petroleum price rise) of 2004 and 2008, which occurred when the economy was growing at a good pace.Footnote 2 But in truth, this is a secondary concern. Addressing the first question requires the comparison of two episodes with similar adverse external shocks and the same economic structure, and where the only relevant difference lies in the monetary (and fiscal) policies employed to tackle the adverse external shock. This paper describes how the main instruments of the Peruvian monetary policy were used over the period 2002–2013. It focuses on two of the channels through which monetary policy influences economic activity and the price level: the credit channel and the exchange rate channel, which appear to be the most important in the Peruvian economy. In the context of an economic system dominated by the banks, the use and impact of the main monetary policy instruments is discussed, namely, the short term interest rate set by the central bank or reference interest rate, the reserve requirement ratio in local and foreign currencies, and, finally, sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market. The process of bank credit (de)dollarization is also reviewed. To round off this introduction, a quote from Tobin (1990, p. 6) about modern monetary policy: The interest rate on overnight loans of federal funds is (…) the Fed’s instrument of policy. It is a market rate, which the Fed controls buying and selling Treasury bills (…) at its intervention rates, nowadays publicly announced. At scheduled meetings eight times a year (… the Fed …) reconsiders and sometimes change the intervention rate, generally by 25 or 50 basis points (…) The tail wags the dog. By gently touching a tiny tail, Alan Greenspan wags the mammoth dog, the great American economy. Isn´t that remarkable? The federal funds rate is the shortest of all interest rates, remote from the rates on assets and debts by which businesses and households finance investment (…) and consumption (…). Why does monetary policy work? How? It´s a mystery (…) There are two lines of explanations: substitutions chains and policy expectations. Expectations are very powerful, but they cannot work unless chains of assets substitution do really occur (…) We think we know from experience (…) that the Fed can if it wants take really big actions with immense consequences (…)",6

All this happens in an environment in which the petroleum sector provides the lion’s share of total export proceeds of the country while the international oil price jumped from US$16.0 per barrel in 1999 to $88.4 in 2014. Venezuela’s exports of oil, at a time of increasing oil prices, enabled the country to post-systematic trade and current account surpluses. However, with improved terms of trade, and substantial and persistent current account surpluses, the country suffered from unprecedented net transfers of financial resources abroad, was unable to avoid recurrent external crisis and, despite the oil windfall, did not accumulate a strong level of international reserves. Moreover, inflation has been rampant and output growth has been very volatile and, on average, poor. Though during the administration of President Chavez and his successor Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela registered some celebrated and encouraging socio-economic achievements, in the macroeconomic realm the country has underperformed when compared with countries of a similar size and level of economic development in Latin America without the oil bonus. This study provides a descriptive account and analysis of Venezuela’s macroeconomic performance and policy experience during the so-called Bolivarian Revolution, the period since President Hugo Chavez took office in 1999. During this time a nationalist revolution, bolstered by the soaring price of oil, redirected and enhanced the presence of the State in the economy as well as the role of public policies. In general the study suggests that macroeconomic mismanagement and a failed institutional structure of governance are essential to understand some key imbalances. It may be the case that the root cause of this macroeconomic mismanagement and poor governance of Venezuela lies in prevailing political and economic incentives. In particular, we evaluate Venezuela’s monetary and exchange rate policy and the key commitments of the Central Bank and show that a changing macroeconomic and institutional framework created a number of specific pressures and constraint on the Central Bank. The study proceeds as follows. In the section ‘A brief tour of Venezuela’s macroeconomic performance’ we present an interpretive set of economic regularities to show that the economic behavior and performance of Venezuela has differed from its peers in Latin America. We then present an account of the economic evolution and performance of the economy and review the role that politics and institutional design played in shaping macro policy. Broadly we divide the examination into four short periods or phases conditioned on the behavior of oil prices, the policy choices and some key institutional arrangements. The four periods consist of: (a) a phase of intense political turmoil, (b) a period of collapse and relatively long recovery leveraged by increasing oil prices and the control of the oil rent, (c)the aftermath of the global crisis, and lastly (d) a short-lived recovery phase followed by severe macroeconomic instability and troubling governance. The section ‘The challenges for the central bank: monetary and exchange rate policy’ looks at the role that macro-policy mismanagement has played in explaining Venezuela’s mediocre macroeconomic performance. We highlight the political and economic constraints and incentives under which both monetary and exchange rate policies have taken place. The section ‘The seeds of bad oil resources governance’ focuses on the effects that a very the poor structure of oil governance has produced on the management of oil proceeds and stocks.",21

We adopt a logistic regression approach and model the probability of conflict recurrence with the latest available information in each period, while controlling for unobserved fixed effects in a non-linear probability model for the first time in the conflict literature. Civil conflicts across the world, 1960–2010 
Source: UCDP/PRIO According to the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset covering 146 episodes of civil conflict in 94 countries over the period 1960–2010, real GDP per capita growth accelerated after the end of a conflict, with an average of 1.5% a year over the subsequent 5 years, and shows significant cross-country variation, ranging from − 10% in Liberia to 20% in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our empirical model explains these variations in post-conflict growth through a broad set of explanatory variables including the estimated risk of conflict recurrence, duration and intensity of the conflict, demographic characteristics, measures of human capital, geographic variables and natural resource endowments, macroeconomic conditions, external factors, and measures of political regime and governance quality. The key empirical finding presented in this paper is that the estimated risk of conflict recurrence has a statistically significant and economically large effect on post-conflict growth dynamics. A 1% increase in the probability of conflict recurrence in the subsequent period is associated with lower real GDP per capita growth by 10%. The other main findings are broadly in line with the literature. Human capital and institutions have positive and statistically significant effects on post-conflict growth, while natural resource dependence appears to cause a double curse of higher risk of conflict recurrence and lower growth, compared with other countries with a more diversified economic structure. Ethnic fractionalization is another significant factor with negative influence on the strength of post-conflict growth. Global economic conditions matter for post-conflict recovery, especially for countries that are more open and integrated with the rest of the world. Finally, contrary to popular expectations, we do not find UN peacekeeping operations, foreign aid and IMF-supported economic programs to have significant effect on post-conflict growth. Altogether, the empirical results presented in this paper call for a framework centered on three main pillars, implementing growth-enhancing policies, reforming dysfunctional institutions, and addressing urgent needs, to reduce the risk of conflict recurrence and pave the way to broad-based, sustainable economic growth after the end of a conflict.",2

For instance, the financial system provides risk diversification services that can alter resource allocation and the saving rate (Obstfeld, 1994). Furthermore, the financial system augments the liquidity of long-term investments for high-return projects that are necessary for long-term growth (Bencivenga and Smith, 1991; Bencivenga et al., 1995). In addition, financial arrangements lower transaction costs and facilitate greater specialization and, thus, improve efficiency (Greenwood and Smith, 1997). Accordingly, financial development leading to a well-functioning financial system should lead to higher rates of economic growth. In this regard, most of the Middle East and North African (MENA) countries have implemented economic reforms and structural adjustment programs in recent decades. The purpose of such programs is to reform and develop the financial sector, and their implementation enabled most of the MENA countries to establish stock markets and implement financial regulation to advance their financial institutions. According to Ben Naceur et al. (2008) the MENA countries have also experienced a wave of liberalization in the financial sector. The objectives of financial liberalization are to reduce government intervention in the banking system, to liberalize the interest rate and to promote market allocation of financial resources. This would enhance financial development and, in turn, promote economic growth (McKinnon, 1973; Shaw, 1973). Despite the above-mentioned reforms, MENA countries have not yet emerged as economic powers, and research on the effect of financial development on economic growth in this region is still limited. In fact, it is unclear whether economic growth in the MENA region responds similarly to financial development as it does in other emerging and developed markets. Hence, the objective of this paper is to examine the effect of stock market and bank development on economic growth in a panel of 13 MENA countries over the period 1988–2009.Footnote 1 To address this objective, we incorporate both stock markets and banks to measure the impact of financial development on economic growth in the MENA region. We control for periods of instability in each country because, during such periods, information asymmetry increases, and, as a result, adverse selection and moral hazard problems intensify causing an increase in uncertainty. Increased uncertainty, in turn, leads to a decline in lending, investment and aggregate economic activity (Mishkin, 2010). We use 5-year moving average data instead of annual data to eliminate business cycle influences. To control for endogeneity, we apply the dynamic panel GMM estimator using the Windmeijer (2005) modification that limits the over-fitting problem and thereby reduces potential biases associated with the two-step estimator noted by Arellano and Bond (1991) and Blundell and Bond (1998). Although several papers on the MENA countries found that stock markets and banks have either negative or no impact on economic growth (Ben Naceur et al., 2008; Barajas et al., 2011), this paper finds that both stock markets and banks have a positive impact on economic growth after controlling for periods of instability. These findings are strongly consistent with models predicting that a well-functioning financial system lowers transaction costs, improves resource allocation and leads to economic growth. The paper is organized as follows: The next section gives an overview of the financial market in the MENA countries, the subsequent section discusses the literature review, section after that introduces the data and the econometric methodology, the following section presents some descriptive statistics, the penultimate section discusses the main results and the final section concludes.",11

Differences in Fiscal Consolidation Strategies between Hungary and Iceland,December 2015,Bruno Martorano,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"At the end of the first decade of the 2000 s the advanced economies were hard hit by the Great Recession, which was considered the most important economic shock since the Second World War. Governments reacted to the crisis by implementing different stimulus measures. However, the persistence of the economic recession and the growing pressure from international markets raised concerns about fiscal sustainability in many countries. Consequently, governments started to implement consolidation plans through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts aimed at reducing the debt level and at improving fiscal conditions. While the goals of these plans were clear, their economic and social implications are still widely debated. Especially in the context of an open economy, there is no consensus about the size and/or the sign of fiscal multipliers (Baldacci et al., 2012). A number of studies even report evidence of the existence of an expansionary adjustment (see Giavazzi and Pagano, 1990, Alesina and Perotti, 1995, Alesina and Ardagna, 2010). For example, cuts in public spending could generate positive effects in relation to private consumption and private investment (Agnello and Sousa, 2011). The main condition for this to occur would be that they need to be credible, thus leading to a stabilization of the debt/GDP ratio (Ardagna, 2004) and tax reductions in the future (Afonso, 2006). On the other hand, some scholars argue that restrictive fiscal policy reduces economic growth in the short run (Krugman, 2013). According to this argument, fiscal adjustment processes tend to hurt aggregate demand because of the presence of positive fiscal multipliers and this provokes negative consequences in terms of economic activities. In addition, one of the most significant risks is the production of an ‘illusory adjustment’ in which a continuous deterioration of economic conditions leads to a fall in tax revenue and a subsequent increase in deficits and debt (Easterly, 1999). Indeed, using recent data, Canale et al. (2014) show that restrictive fiscal policy may generate not only negative effects on growth but also have consequences for the consolidation process, which has a high probability of failing in times of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. In addition to the above considerations, the success of a fiscal consolidation process is also related to its capacity to reduce costs for the most vulnerable groups. In many cases in the past distributional consequences had been accepted as a collateral effect of such processes (Mulas-Granados, 2005). Indeed, Cornia and Stewart (1990) highlight that the poor tend to suffer more than other groups during a phase of adjustment. Ford (1998) and Smeeding (1997) show that fiscal consolidation contributes to increasing poverty as well as inequality. More recently, Ahrend et al. (2011) find that strong fiscal consolidations negatively affect the poorest by decreasing their income share. Agnello and Sousa (2011) show that fiscal consolidation pushes up income inequality. In OECD countries, Rawdanowicz et al. (2013) report that austerity led to worse income distribution during the recent economic recession. In European countries, Martorano (2014) finds that government actions have increased inequality since 2010. Yet, there have been a few cases that show that it is possible to minimize the negative consequences associated with a fiscal consolidation process (OECD, 2008). In particular, these instances show that adjustment composition is important not only in order to achieve consolidation but also in relation to distribution (Bastagli et al., 2012). Indeed, Ball et al. (2013) illustrate that fiscal consolidation driven by spending cuts is detrimental to equity. In particular, reduced spending on education and health especially affect those households in the lower part of the distribution range. Moreover, cuts in social transfers have an adverse impact on income distribution since they represent an important financial resource for the poorest people. In contrast, fiscal adjustment based mainly on taxes has mixed results (Woo et al., 2013). While indirect taxes are regressive, direct taxes are usually progressive in that they increase the participation of the richest deciles in tax payments (Azevedo et al., 2014). This article, based on the factors just outlined, responds to the increased interest in defining a successful adjustment strategy. In particular, the aim of this paper is to investigate if it is possible to adjust while still reducing as much as possible the negative distributional consequences. For this purpose, the article compares selected outcomes resulting from the adjustment strategies of Hungary and Iceland, which followed opposite paths. First, it compares the performance of fiscal and economic indicators at a macro-level in these two distinct settings; second, it presents an evaluation of their distributional consequences with a particular focus on households with children. Hungary and Iceland were considered to be two excellent models of development. Following the precepts of the neoliberal theory, both countries promoted economic liberalization and privatization, which involved reducing the role of the state in the economy. Nonetheless, changes were noticed during the recent Great Recession. Hungary and Iceland were among the countries affected earliest and deepest by the recent macroeconomic shock: they suffered a similar drop in GDP (Carey, 2009; IMF, 2012a) and presented debt sustainability problems to a higher degree than other countries (IMF, 2009). While the majority of advanced economies introduced a stimulus package at an early stage in the crisis (EC-ILO, 2011; IMF, 2013c; Martorano et al., 2012), Hungary and Iceland quickly adopted a fiscal adjustment process. Nonetheless, they followed two different strategies. Each country cut public spending according to different priorities. However, the most important differences between them are related to the revenue side. While the Hungarian government implemented a flat tax reform in order to stimulate economic activity, the Icelandic government replaced its flat tax system with a progressive system by increasing the participation of high income groups in the adjustment process. As a result, Iceland fully met the objectives of the IMF program and improved its fiscal indicators, while the worsening of economic conditions forced Hungary to ask for additional external help. In terms of distribution, it was the social transfers that contributed to a reduction of inequality in Iceland but not in Hungary. Meanwhile their different tax strategies operated in opposite directions. This paper contributes to the existing literature in different ways. First, it provides evidence concerning the effects of two distinctive adjustment strategies, which operated in contrary directions. Second, this is one of the few papers that concentrates on the distributional consequences of government reactions to the recent economic crisis. Admittedly, this comparison of Hungary and Iceland has some limits due to the dissimilarities in their initial conditions and the nature of the shock. However, these differences are not sufficient to prevent us from reaching some conclusions about the two opposite adjustment strategies followed by these countries and, in particular, the effects arising from their tax policies. The paper is organized in the following way: the next section discusses initial conditions in Hungary and Iceland and the impact of the crisis in both countries; the subsequent section examines the policy responses; illustrations relating to data and empirical strategies are provided after that; the penultimate section reports on the results of the fiscal consolidation strategies in both countries; the last section draws out some concluding remarks.",2

Student test scores from a battery of international tests are the cornerstone of their analysis of student achievement that aim to assess the efficiency of schooling systems and to generate recommendations for policymaking in order to improve the quality of education. These assessment surveys of educational achievement raise a large number of conceptual, methodological and practical issues that have been widely documented in the literature (Greany and Kellaghan, 2008; Winter, 1998). One aspect to which users of international assessment studies probably do not pay quite enough attention is the quality of the testing instruments, and their ability to adequately measure students’ performance. While education economists who study student performance have paid attention to the quantification of inputs and, more recently, to the specification of their empirical models, they have placed little emphasis on the quality of the achievement test scores they use to evaluate the outcomes. Obviously, addressing these quality concerns is vitally crucial for those who want to properly inform decision making in education and to address policy issues. This paper questions the ability of these instruments to measure student performance accurately. A review of the main assessment studies conducted in the context of low-income countries indicates that no technical documentation is provided that demonstrates that the contents of the tests match the curricula. For this reason, it is generally extremely difficult to judge the quality of the assessment data. Taking advantage of data of uncommon richness, this paper evaluates, by way of example, the content validity of the Programme d’Analyse des Systèmes Educatif de la Confemen (PASEC) conducted in Madagascar. The results are based on a cohort of around 15,000 grade-three and grade-four students who were enrolled in a total of about 1,000 public primary schools and who were tested on the same grade-four teaching program, whatever grade they were enrolled in. By comparing the scores achieved by students in grades three and four on the same grade-four test, the available data make it possible to measure ex post the sensitivity of the test instruments and to offer useful lessons on the way some international achievement tests are calibrated. The paper uses propensity score matching to control for student and teacher characteristics. In the absence of being able to carefully compare the test items with the curriculum content in Madagascar, the results show that the PASEC instruments for this country are probably poorly calibrated and do not properly allow meaningful analysis of the performance of the education sector. Although the findings relate to a particular country, they raise important questions about the reliability of the available battery of tests for use in developing countries, and the accuracy of the policy recommendations that can be derived from this kind of assessment data. The results may be suggestive for education economists who use them for their analyses and may be useful for education specialists who design these instruments. The paper adds to the empirical literature on the curricular coverage of international testing efforts. While test-curriculum matching analysis has been conducted to investigate the appropriateness of some ‘gold standard’ tests like the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS; see, eg, Beaton and Gonzalez, 1997), this paper reports on the first known attempt to assess ex post the accuracy of a battery of tests designed for use in the context of developing countries. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section briefly reviews the main international assessment surveys that are conducted in developing countries. The section after that describes the data; the following section explains the estimation strategy and presents the results; and the final section concludes.",
57,4,Comparative Economic Studies,01 December 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2015.8,The Military Origins of Soviet Industrialization,December 2015,Vladimir Kontorovich,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Forced industrialization launched under the first Five Year Plan (1928–1932) was a formative event that set the course of the Soviet economy. Priority of heavy industry, a defining feature of industrialization, became a permanent characteristic of the Soviet growth strategy.Footnote 1 After 1945, this strategy was implemented, at least for a while, in the other Communist countries (Kornai, 1992, Chapter 9). It also strongly influenced the first generation of development economists, as well as the developing countries’ policymakers in the 1950s (World Bank, 1991, p. 34; Easterly, 2001, pp. 30–32). Accounts of industrialization and the growth pattern it established feature prominently in economic histories of the USSR, textbooks on the Soviet economy, and even in some cursory treatments of the Soviet experience by non-specialists (eg, North, 2005, pp. 148–149). This literature commonly asserts that a strategy of industrialization was developed over the course of economic debates of the mid-1920s by E. Preobrazhenskii and/or G. Feldman. Its goal was rapid economic growth, and concentrating investment on heavy industry was the means to achieve that goal.Footnote 2 This is the standard version of industrialization, drawing on half a century’s worth of economists’ writings on the subject. The standard treatment starts with recounting the course of the ‘Great Debate’ (Nove, 1992, p. 115) between the adherents of rapid industrialization, from the Left (Trotsky) current in the party, and gradualists from the Right (Bukharin) (Campbell, 1966, pp. 12–21; Spulber, 1969, pp. 219–223; Nove, 1969, 1992; Millar, 1981, pp. 11–16; Munting, 1982; Gregory and Stuart, 1986, Chapter 4, 2001, pp. 59–61; Ofer, 2003, pp. 422–423; Allen, 2003, pp. 51–64). E. Preobrazhenskii was a prominent contributor to the debate from the Left. He is best known for his ideas about primitive socialist accumulation, the need to extract resources for industrialization from the peasants (Ellman, 1990a). This article takes no position on whether these ideas served as an inspiration for the policy of collectivization. It focuses exclusively on Preobrazhenskii’s views on the rate of industrialization and the role of heavy industry in it. He argued that the production of means of production has to grow faster than the aggregate output to effect the desired acceleration of growth (Erlich, 1950, p. 66). In the standard version, ‘The final outcome of the debate was the formidable program of Five Year Plans’ (Erlich, 1950, p. 57; also Spulber, 1964, p. 62; Boettke, 1990, pp. 148–149; Barnett, 2004, p. 91; Ofer, 2008, p. 722). In Dobb’s (1967, pp. 137–138) words, it has been a widely held view in the West that while Preobrazhenskii’s position in the debate was officially repudiated, industrialization followed the path he outlined.Footnote 3
 Since industrialization has been thought to follow Preobrazhenskii’s blueprint, ‘his proposals regarding the relative growth rates of heavy industry versus consumer goods industries are likely to have played a similar role in the formulation of Soviet policy’ (Moravcik, 1965, p. 246). ‘It is not difficult in this context to understand why Stalin laid such stress on heavy industry. High rates of growth of national income were viewed partly as an end in themselves, partly – certainly by Preobrazhenskii – as a means of ensuring a rapid increase in employment’ (Dyker, 1985, p. 3). ‘The most remarkable feature of the 1930s was the extent to which the pro-heavy-industry bias asserted itself (as Preobrazhensky said it should)’ (Gregory and Stuart, 1986, p. 93).Footnote 4
 G. Feldman, a Gosplan employee, shares the honor of being considered the author of the Soviet growth strategy (Erlich, 1978, p. 203; Allen, 2003, p. 63; Gregory, 2004, p. 83; Ofer, 2008, p. 722). He published a mathematical model of economic growth, according to which, the greater the proportion of new investment in the producer goods sector, the higher the rate of growth (Ellman, 1990b). Explanations of the observed concentration of investment in heavy industry by the requirements of ‘Marxist and Soviet growth models’ (Ofer, 1987, p. 1807) refer to Feldman. According to the standard version, the objective of industrialization was the acceleration of economic growth (Spulber, 1964, p. 54, (1969, Chapter 12); Campbell, 1966, pp. 25–26; Dyker, 1985, pp. 2–3; Hunter and Szyrmer, 1992, p. 24; Davies, 1994, pp. 137–138; Gregory, 2004, p. 76). The same point is also made indirectly when a prominent feature of industrialization – the priority of heavy industry – is interpreted as a policy aimed at growth acceleration, as quoted above. This article shows that the standard version of the objective of industrialization and the reasons for boosting heavy industry contrast sharply with the Soviet official proclamations at the time. There is no direct evidence of the authorship of Preobrazhenskii and Feldman, and the indirect evidence is contradictory. Policies similar to the Soviet industrialization were undertaken both earlier and later without the help of sophisticated economic analysis. The final section suggests an explanation for how the standard version emerged and became dominant.",6

A number of recent writers (Kirdina, 2000; Parshev, 2001; Hill and Gaddy, 2003; Lynch, 2005; Kontorovich, 2006) have devoted attention to geographical and location-policy factors in explaining the development of the Russian economy and the Russian economic system. The cold and inclement climate over much of the country, the resulting high building and heating costs and short growing seasons, the distance of much of the country from the sea and thus the world market, the low population density with its resulting high transport costs and the loss of agglomeration effects, the long and numerous borders with potential enemies, and the legacy resulting from the way Soviet policies made the situation worse, rightly stressed in recent work (Gaddy and Ickes, 2013, Chapter 3), are familiar themes in writing about Russia and its economic system.Footnote 1 They remain relevant today. They reduce the international competitiveness of the economy, which in turn reduces the possibility of market forces modernizing the economy at an acceptable sociopolitical cost.",1
57,4,Comparative Economic Studies,01 December 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2015.10,Innovations in Mortgage Finance and the Onset of the Great Recession in a Small Open Economy with a Euro Peg,December 2015,Thomas Barnebeck Andersen,Nikolaj Malchow-Møller,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008 hit Denmark particularly hard. In this paper we argue that a combination of innovation in mortgage finance, specifically the introduction of adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), and the need to defend the euro peg was partly responsible. Denmark introduced adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) in 1996; a loan type which soon became very popular (Realkreditrådet, 2012). The main advantage of ARMs is that the interest rate will usually be lower than the interest rate on a fixed-rate loan; the main disadvantage is that borrowers do not know future interest rates with certainty, as these will change throughout the duration of the loan. Specifically, interest rates on ARMs are commonly determined at end-of-year auctions with a frequency of 1, 3, or 5 years. The upshot of this is that the Danish economy has become increasingly sensitive to changes in the short end of the yield curve (Danmarks Nationalbank, 2009; Johansen and Trier, 2013). The proliferation of ARMs is problematic because Denmark operates a conventional currency peg.Footnote 1 The peg entails that monetary policy is directed exclusively at keeping the krone stable vis-à-vis the euro, whereas other considerations, such as business-cycle developments, are not taken into account (Danmarks Nationalbank, 2009). In times of depreciation pressure on the krone, the central bank may increase short-term interest rates nontrivially, as it sees fit, and this may spill over into interest rates on ARMs. When the GFC hit in earnest in the autumn of 2008, increased uncertainty prompted foreign exchange to flow out of smaller capital areas and into larger ones; and despite its credibility, the Danish peg came under sustained pressure. This led the Danish central bank to increase monetary policy rates at a time when other central banks were lowering policy rates in order to support their respective domestic financial sectors. In late October 2008, the policy-interest-rate spread between Denmark and the Eurozone reached a staggering 175 basis points (up from 25 basis points in 2007Q1). This was enough to once again make market participants turn toward Danish kroner. The policy-interest-rate spread was normalized by 2009Q3, whereas the spread between Danish and German short-term (3m) money-market interest rates was normalized by 2010Q3. There can be no doubt that raising interest rates in the midst of the most virulent global financial crisis in more than 75 years impaired the overall health of the economy.Footnote 2 Yet beyond traditional Keynesian effects of monetary tightening on aggregate demand, tightening also hurt aggregate demand via its impact on homeowners with ARMs. Specifically, in December 2008 some 200,000 Danish households (7.7% of all households) needed to refinance their ARMs, and monetary tightening worsened the economic outlook for these families. In this sense, the Danish economy had to defend the euro peg at the worst time imaginable, that is, not just during a massive global downturn but also just before a major ARM auction. Consequently, the main argument of the present paper is that the combination of innovation in mortgage finance and the need to defend the euro peg was an important contributing factor to the unexpected depth and duration of the recession as well as the prolonged recovery in Denmark. At the time of writing, Denmark’s economy still has not made up for lost ground since 2008. Indeed, according to OECD data (Economic Outlook No. 95, May 2014, OLIS version), the Danish economy (as measured by real GDP) grew at an average annual rate of −0.67% between 2008 and 2013. Furthermore, according to the OECD’s May 2014 economic projection, Denmark will not have managed to surpass its 2008 real GDP level by 2015. Danish central bankers have arguably learned the hard way that the cost of raising the monetary policy rate in order to defend the euro peg has increased significantly as a result of financial innovation. This will make it harder to defend the peg in the future, which raises the question of whether the proliferation of ARMs is at all consistent with a fixed-exchange-rate policy in the long run. We approach this difficult question in the penultimate section of the paper, where we also discuss some of the new and challenging trade-offs that Danish policymakers face with respect to maintaining the euro peg in the post-GFC environment. On a general level, we believe that there are a number of reasons as to why monetary policy should receive careful attention in any serious discussion of the weak Danish growth performance since 2008. A leading explanation for the weak performance appears to be a combination of a housing bubble and economic overheating (Sørensen, 2010, 2012; Kraka, 2014). While these are surely important contribution factors, they are unlikely to be the full story. First, in 2008 there were 12 OECD countries with a higher output gap (ie, more overheated) than Denmark (in 2007 the corresponding number was 10), which suggest that comparatively speaking overheating was not a major problem. Moreover, the three countries just behind Denmark (Mexico, Belgium, and Switzerland) and the three countries just ahead of Denmark (Norway, Austria, and Luxembourg) in terms of economic overheating (as measured by the 2008 output gap) all saw positive average annual post-GFC economic growth. Add to this that monetary easing is better than the output gap at predicting cross-country post-GFC growth in the non-Eurozone OECD countries (Andersen and Malchow-Møller, 2014). Second, while the unwinding of the housing bubble unquestionably contributed to the downturn, we will argue below that timing issues in the fall of house prices suggest that household consolidation because of excessive loan-to-value ratios does not explain the disproportionate plunge in consumption in 2008Q4. Monetary policy, on the other hand, can explain it. Add to this that Denmark implemented a large discretionary fiscal stimulus in 2009 and, at the same time, the Danish economy has the largest automatic stabilizers in the OECD area (OECD, 2009). Consequently, an inadequate fiscal stimulus is unlikely to explain the protracted Danish recovery compared with other OECD countries. The OECD (2009) also pointed out that Denmark has a strong, credible and forward-looking fiscal framework. Hence, fiscal policy is likely to be quite effective in Denmark. For these reasons, monetary policy must be a prime suspect. The remaining discussion is structured as follows: The next section provides some macroeconomic background, while the subsequent section discusses how interest rates affect aggregate demand in the Danish economy. The section after that uses simple econometrics to gauge the effect of monetary policy on consumption growth, while the following section examines whether a distinct uncertainty effect was at work in 2008Q4. The penultimate section turns to a discussion of some of the new and difficult challenges Danish policymakers face in light of the recent experience of managing the euro peg. Lastly, the final section concludes.",2
58,1,Comparative Economic Studies,08 October 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2015.29,Knowledge Spillover Effects: A Patent Inventor Approach,March 2016,Luigi Aldieri,Concetto Paolo Vinci,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The idea of knowledge spillover has been accepted in the theoretical and empirical literature on firm competitiveness and economic growth for the last 10 years. Knowledge spillovers exist if the social benefit from ideas is greater than the private returns to their inventors. Researchers have always considered the transmission of ideas, depending on space proximity and technological specialization. More precisely, they think that existing ideas generate new ones and only a proportion of the latter are codified in new patents. The non-codified share, embodied in the experience of inventors, may be available only through direct interaction, while the codified share operates as a public good as it is perfectly accessible to anybody who reads the patent. The non-codified share of technological knowledge tends to assume a complex form transferable only through direct interaction (Feldman and Audretsch, 1999). The spatial proximity of inventors is helpful when direct interaction and knowledge flows between them; in turn direct interactions improve the stock of knowledge in the area where inventors are located. In other words, if knowledge is not simply available anywhere in space, as it is embodied in the inventors, both the location of the inventors and the characteristics of knowledge diffusion become crucial in order to comprehend the development of regions where inventors are located. This clarifies why the levels to which knowledge flows are restricted within geographic limits, and have received such particular consideration in the literature (Padmore and Gibson, 1998). This idea has inspired researchers to extend the innovation system framework to the regional dimension by studying knowledge flows directly within countries or specific sub-regions (Acs et al., 2002; Braczyk et al., 1998). Departing from the assumption that direct interactions spur the inventors of a region to habitually cite ideas from their neighbors (Jaffe et al., 1993), these studies evidence the local nature of innovative activity (eg Silicon Valley) (Audretsch and Feldman, 1996). For example, Jaffe et al. (1993) have used this approach as a starting point for their empirical analysis of the geographic concentration of patent citations. According to the authors, citations are taken as paper trails of knowledge spillovers from the cited inventor to the citing inventor. Further studies of local systems of innovation (Audretsch and Feldman, 1996) confirm that citations are stronger at the local level. On the other side, the codified share of technological knowledge is perfectly accessible everywhere; patents are used to generate new ideas and patent them. The patents ascribed to a firm denote the knowledge that a firm is recognized as having created by using knowledge generated elsewhere (Jaffe et al., 1993). In most cases a new patent from a firm includes a list of inventors from various counties, and thus the patent of a firm located in a country can be traced back to innovators located abroad. The geographic distance of inventors means the patent does not assume the construction company’s nationality but has a cross-national dimension. This geographic distance may improve new patents from the knowledge and expertise of inventors coming from abroad and characterized by different cultures and technological orientations (Vagnani, 2015). Other issues affecting knowledge spillovers involve technological specialization. Some researchers support the hypothesis that new ideas may be generated using existing ideas. The similarity of new ideas to previous ideas makes them easier to realize. Inventors are able to most simply recognize and engage external knowledge close to their existing knowledge base (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Even when they seek to embody new external knowledge in their new ideas-creation process, the resulting search procedures confine the external knowledge used to familiar and neighboring regions. Inventors are therefore expected to create ideas closely aligned with their knowledge (Aldieri, 2013). Conversely, differences between the preceding ideas and the new ones generate the potential for non-overlapping knowledge bases. New knowledge comes from the combination of new components or new combinations of the existing components. As a consequence, it has been demonstrated that combining knowledge from different technological contexts increases the opportunity set of new components that can be utilized. Thus, inventors may use the same knowledge components in new ways or create breakthrough innovations by embodying knowledge very different from their own in realizing a new patent (Caiazza and Audretsch, 2013). Considering the effects of both geographical and technological variables on firm innovation, the framework of our study may be summarized in Figure 1. Knowledge spillovers",3

These countries have been part of the former Soviet Union and are characterized by lower development levels and significant institutional and structural differences. At the same time, in the Southern and the Eastern rim of the Mediterranean Sea, the EU is faced with countries that are linked to individual EU countries through their colonial past. Both bordering areas, in the EU East and the EU South, have been gaining significance as they include emerging economies, energy suppliers, or, simply, a large neighboring market, which is crucial for the EU economy (Petrakos et al., 2014). Thus, the EU launched, in 2004, the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP), a unified policy framework towards its neighboring countries, the ENPCs, located on the EU periphery, aiming at strengthening prosperity, stability and security, creating a ring of friends around its geo-political borders (European Commission, 2004; Wesselink and Boschma, 2012). Currently, the ENP framework applies to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine (the ENPCs East) and to Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Occupied Palestinian Territory (Palestine), Syria and Tunisia, the ENPCs South. The ENP is an EU external relations and trade policy tool offering, to the ENPCs, conditional preferential politico-economic relations – but not full membership – on the basis of harmonizing with acquis communautaire (ie, the corpus of the EU laws and policies related to investment protection, public procurement and competition policy) and promoting EU values such as the consolidation of democracy, the promotion of human rights, the preservation of peace, the eradication of poverty, and the enhancement of market economy (Koopmann and Wilhelm, 2010; Woolcock, 2010). Typically, the EU concludes for this purpose the so-called Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements (DCFTAs) bilaterally with each of the ENPCs. In essence, DCFTAs are FTAs with one-way conditionalities, demonstrating that the general principles enshrined in the EU Treaties and particularly in the Treaty of Lisbon launched in 2009 underlie the cornerstone for the ENP undertaking. Thus, even though the proper membership anchor is missing (Emerson, 2004; Havlik et al., 2012), the partnerships established under the ENP framework engender an almost continuous deepening of economic relations between the EU and the ENPCs (Monastiriotis and Borrell, 2012; Monastiriotis et al., 2014). The research questions posed in this paper are related to the integration experience of the ENPCs located in the EU periphery. Expanding trade relations is one of the fundamental drivers of growth and prosperity in the classical (Smith, 1776) and the neoclassical (Ricardo, 1817) setting of international economics. This near-axiomatic statement has been the foundation of modern economic thinking and the solid ground for free-trade policies and the creation of economic unions. Its universality, however, has been challenged by the new trade theory (Krugman, 1979) and the new economic geography (Krugman, 1991) schools of thought. Trade may still be an engine for growth and prosperity and, most important, a guarantor of peace and security, but trade conditions and qualifications have been receiving increasing attention. Questions about the allocation of the benefits and costs of strategic trade or of trade among unequal or distant partners are, more and more, discussed in the literature while issues related to trade balance, structure and specialization receive increasing attention. To put it simply, although there is a strong consensus that the market-based process of economic integration is a positive-sum game, the distribution of overall welfare gains is a subject of debate as higher levels of imperfect competition are deemed to result in an uneven distribution of the benefits of economic integration (Ottaviano and Puga, 1998; Martin and Ottaviano, 2001; Ciccone, 2002). Indeed, the experience of the continuous rounds of EU integration, mainly through the expansion of trade relations first to the European South in the 1980s and then to the European East in the 2000s, shows a variety of performances, structures and impacts on growth and development. In particular, the accumulated EU integration experience indicates that countries in the EU South and East have been engaged in an unbalanced and asymmetric pattern of trade with the EU core countries (Petrakos and Pitelis, 2001; Kallioras and Petrakos, 2010; Petrakos et al., 2011; 2012). Yet, at the same time, regional trade among peripheral EU and non-EU countries of similar production and consumption patterns seems to partially offset the adverse effects (Petrakos, 1997; Monastiriotis and Petrakos, 2010). This paper investigates the impact of trade relations among the EU and the ENPCs on the economic performance of the latter. The analysis utilizes recently developed panel cointegration techniques, which are used to estimate the long-run equilibrium relationship between real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and trade integration for 14 ENPCs over the period 2000–2011. The period of analysis has been selected so as to gauge the latest shifts in trade structures as a result of the recent economic and political reforms that took place in the EU and the ENPCs. Data are obtained from the UN COMTRADE Database. The paper is structured as follows: the next section reviews, briefly, the theoretical literature regarding the relation of economic integration and growth performance. The third section presents the Granger causality methodology, with particular emphasis on contributions dealing with non-stationary and cointegrated panel data sets. The fourth section describes the data and discusses the empirical results. The last section offers conclusions and the policy implications of the paper.",7

For this reason, it is vital to study how exchange rate movements differ across countries and what this implies. This study examines the non-linearity of the exchange rate volatility of dollarized and non-dollarized economies. It seeks to discover whether there is an abrupt or smooth transition in the two sets of economies as a result of global financial stress. To this end, we employ smooth transition regressions using the exchange rate volatility and six indicators of global financial stress, following the study by Coudert et al. (2011). Our study differs from that of Coudert et al. (2011) in two key aspects. First, while their study specifically examines the impact of global financial stress on the exchange rate volatility of emerging markets, we extend their study by examining the cases of dollarized and non-dollarized economies. Second, while their study focuses on showing an increase in volatility and spillovers as a result of the global financial crisis, this study examines the nature of the transitions in the exchange rate volatility of dollarized and non-dollarized economies. Daily data from 16 countries over the period 1994–2013 are selected, for which GARCH (1, 1) is used to capture the exchange rate volatility and the volatility of global financial stress indicators. Before employing smooth transition regression analysis, a linearity test is carried out to identify whether or not the exchange rate volatility exhibit non-linearity. The results show the existence of non-linearity in each series with higher exchange rate volatility in the non-linear regime of the non-dollarized economies as a result of an increase in the global financial stress. Furthermore, the results suggest that, on average, there are abrupt transitions in the exchange rate volatility of dollarized economies relative to non-dollarized economies. This implies that anchoring a currency to the US dollars results in the need for rapid policy reactions, particularly at times of US financial crisis. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the next section discusses the literature review followed by the methodology used in the study; the following section explains the data type and sources; the penultimate section reports the results, and the final section gives the conclusion.",
58,1,Comparative Economic Studies,30 June 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2015.24,Two Forms of Trade Credit Finance in China,March 2016,Go Yano,Maho Shiraishi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"According to Allen et al. (2005), the case of China may be a noteworthy counterpoint to the focus of the law and finance literature on formal systems. For, although China does not have a well-developed financial or legal system, it has one of the world’s fastest growing economies. They suggest that channels of finance other than formal external finance sources support the fastest growing Chinese firms, which are private firms. Consequently, several studies have investigated whether alternative financing channels do in fact act as a substitute for formal external finance to support the growth of firms and the economy in China (Cheng and Degryse, 2007; Ge and Qiu, 2007; Cull et al., 2009; Ayyagari et al., 2010). One alternative financing channel is trade credit. Cull et al. (2009), Ge and Qiu (2007), and Yano and Shiraishi (2012) sought to clarify what role trade credit plays in China’s economy using econometric analysis based on firm-level microdata.Footnote 1 Cull et al. (2009) used mostly bank loans and accounts receivable data, particular data used for granting trade credit. These findings suggest that trade credit substitutes for bank loans for private firms’ customers shut out of this type of formal credit. Ge and Qiu (2007), considering accounts receivable and accounts payable data – trade credit data from both the granting and receiving sides – and bank loan data, find that non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs) use trade credit more than SOEs. They further show that this greater usage is primarily for financing rather than for transaction purposes. Using 1999–2006 firm-level microdata for rural firms in China, Yano and Shiraishi (2012) investigate the efficiency of financial intermediation through trade credit.Footnote 2 The statistical evidence reported by Yano and Shiraishi (2012) suggests that financial intermediation through trade credit is more efficient than bank finance and that trade credit can be viewed as encouraging the survival and growth of prospective small and young rural firms from a financial point of view. These results suggest that the NSO sector actively exploits trade credit as a non-standard financing channel to finance growth in China, where the formal financial sector is poorly developed. Several other studies refer to the role played by trade credit in China’s economy. Although Brandt and Li (2003) suggest that trade credit is not a perfect substitute for bank loans because of the higher interest rates and shorter lending periods, they find that private and privatized firms discriminated against in access to bank loans tended to depend on financing via this channel. Garnaut et al. (2001), using descriptive statistics and qualitative information for private firms in China in the 1990s, also find that firms used trade credit to overcome their liquidity problems. Moreover, trade credit has been found to play a significant role as an alternative financing channel in other developing or transition economies.Footnote 3
 In summary, the previous literature suggests that trade credit provides an important source of financing for NSOEs with less privileged access to formal credit in the form of bank loans. No previous literature has investigated whether investment, namely, long-term funding, is partly financed by trade credit originally provided to finance short-term working funds. This paper is the first to our knowledge that investigates trade credit as an alternative financing channel for investment in developing economies. The present paper investigates which trade credit forms finance which types of corporate activities in China. Different forms of trade credit are relevant as they have different natures and few studies have paid attention to this issue in the context of Chinese economy. We use large firm-level micro panel data of Chinese NSOEs for the 1998–2007 period. To provide further detail regarding investment, we also estimate which funding sources finance firms’ day-to-day operations. We classify trade credit received into two distinct components, notes and accounts payable and deposits received. In most previous papers, trade credit received (granted) includes only notes and accounts payable (accounts receivable): delayed payment from customer to supplier.Footnote 4 Burkart and Ellingsen (2004) describe the nature of notes and accounts payable as lending and borrowing in kind between supplier and customer. Another strand of research indicates that the granting of notes and accounts payable requires robust trust between firms (‘interfirm trust’ hereafter) (Johnson et al., 2002; Fafchamps, 2004; Fisman and Raturi, 2004) based on the assumption that interfirm trust creates confidence that payment will be made after delivery of the goods or services. Only a few recent studies have investigated advance payments, namely the deposits received that are reflected in balance sheets.Footnote 5 Daripa and Nilsen (2011) demonstrate theoretically that financially -stronger firms may optimally decide to advance cash to their upstream suppliers when the latter would otherwise delay production. Several studies investigate the role of deposits received in advance in the context of international transactions. Antras and Foley (2015) explain theoretically and empirically that advance payments are preferred to trade credit when contractual enforcement is weak in the importer’s country. Using US exporters for their research, Antras and Foley (2015) also show that, as the relationship and trust between exporters and their importers develop, transactions are more likely to be settled on post-shipment terms rather than by advance payments. Along similar lines, Eck et al. (2015) argue that advance payments serve as a signal of importer quality that helps to reduce the high uncertainty inherent in international transactions. Using data from a large survey of firms across 26 transition economies, Raiser et al. (2008) measure the extent of trust in business relationships in terms of the level of prepayment. They interpret the level of prepayment demanded by suppliers as a measure of distrust. Synthesizing analytical frameworks and the factor of bargaining power, Mateut (2014) provides a detailed empirical study on the use of advance payments by firms. She empirically finds that the financial strength of suppliers who seek transaction warranty because of distrust of their customers, as well as their stronger bargaining power relative to their customers, induces suppliers to demand advance payments. For our research on the use and development of the two types of trade credit, notes and accounts payable as well as deposits received, we pay attention to interfirm (dis)trust and the bargaining power of suppliers. More robust interfirm trust and a weaker level of bargaining power of suppliers are likely to cause notes and accounts payable to develop and have a more significant role and to cause deposits received to decline and become less significant and vice versa. Our specific findings are as follows. A comparison of the less developed interior areas with the more developed coastal areas of China shows that the dominant form of trade credit changes from deposits received in the interior areas to notes and accounts payable in the coastal areas. The difference between the areas in terms of the form of trade credit decreases as time passes. This change has most likely been driven by the development of interfirm trust and the increasing competitiveness of the market; in other words, the decreasing monopolistic or oligopolistic position of sellers in the market. The next section of this paper explains the basic framework such as natures of funding sources and hypotheses used. The subsequent section specifies the empirical models used and identification strategy for them. The section after that presents several important observations from macro statistics, for example, strong positive correlation between developments of notes and accounts payable at the provincial level, and the provincial economy. The following section explains the micro data used for our econometric analysis. The penultimate section considers the results of the estimations, stated as econometric analysis, where our focus is on evolution of trade credit form from deposits received to notes and accounts payable. Conclusions and implication for further research are presented in the final section.",4

Like the two Koreas, the previously two Germanies were reasonably similar in terms of cultural, geographical, and demographic backgrounds. While North Korea, officially the Democratic Peoples’ Republic of Korea (DPRK), grew more rapidly in the decade following the end of the Korean War in 1953 when both were in deep poverty, since the early 1960s South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), has grown more rapidly, with the ROK now far ahead of the DPRK. North Korea is mired in deep stagnation with chronic food shortages, including a full famine in the 1990s, and a real per capita income less than a tenth of the latter, whose real per capita income had by 2014 matched that of their former ruler and longtime rival, Japan. It is a communist dictatorship run by a family dynasty that increasingly emphasizes nationalism and markets rather than Marxist–Leninist ideology and it is still strongly Stalinist command socialist model,Footnote 1 while South Korea has become a reasonably functioning democracy, having reduced substantially the relatively high amount of state direction and influence on its economy it had until the 1990s when it joined the OECD. Clearly the differing nature of their economic and political systems has been fundamental in explaining their differing economic performances in recent decades. Considering their common cultural heritage, while other religions have been influential in both Koreas, many observers consider Confucianism to be the most important cultural influence in Korea during the last several centuries. We shall briefly review the fundamental ideas and basic history of Confucianism and then present the idea of the new traditional economy and place the discussion of the role of Confucianism within Korea into that context. This will be followed by discussions of how this influence developed in the past when Korea was unified and then how it has since the division of Korea in 1945 in each of the two Koreas, noting particularly how this has related to economic developments in both Koreas. The paradox of the new traditional Confucian economy in the two Koreas is that while both of them are officially anti-Confucian, they are both deeply influenced by Confucian ideas, practices, and institutions. New traditional economies seek to be technologically advanced high-income societies while having important elements of their economies embedded in a broader socio-cultural context, usually that of a religion (Rosser and Rosser, 1996). However, in most such economies this search involves a political movement actively seeking to bring about or increase this embedding, with examples such as Iran and Islamic economics being prominent. Within East Asian nations, most that are somewhat new traditional Confucian in their orientation, such as Japan, Taiwan, or Singapore, have leaderships that are sympathetic to their Confucian heritage, if not necessarily actively pushing it (Rosser and Rosser, 1998). This contrasts with both of the Koreas, where there is official opposition to Confucianism as a doctrine to influence society in both nations, even though it has long been argued that Korea is the most Confucian of all countries.Footnote 2
 This paper extends the discussion in Rosser and Rosser (2011), where it was argued that South Korean Confucianism represented a successful fusion of new institutional and new traditional forms in a competitive economics as civilization (Kuran, 2009),Footnote 3 even as North Korea failed to achieve such a successful competitive fusion at least partly due to emphasizing anti-mercantile elements of Confucianism. Here we shall link the differences between the Confucian influences in the two Koreas with deeper conflicts within the historical Confucian tradition within Korea, while bringing out more clearly the extent of the anti-Confucian official positions in both nations, the central part of the paradox. Ironically, it may be that North Korea is more strongly Confucian than South Korea overall, even as it more completely suppresses Confucianism officially and arguably violates many Confucian ethical teachings.",1

The discussion on current account imbalances intensified also in Europe (Knedlik and von Schweinitz, 2012). The question of what determines the current account positions and current account imbalances in Europe has started to attract attention in the economic literature only in the recent years. Different studies have brought to light specific evidence on the European – and more precisely on the euro area – economy (Rahman, 2008; Jaumotte and Sodsriwiboon, 2010; Belke and Dreger, 2013; Ca’ Zorzi and Rubaszek, 2012; Gehringer, 2015). Whereas the contributions concerning the euro area are not lacking, only limited effort has been made to examine the European Union (EU) in a unified framework, while at the same time accounting for the heterogeneity across the EU (Gehringer, 2015). The present paper extends the evidence concerning the EU. In this framework, a central contribution of the paper concerns the current account determinants themselves. Although, for completeness, the standard determinants of the current account identified in the past investigations – as for instance Chinn and Prasad (2003) – are included, the main focus of the empirical investigation is on the new determinants that refer to the relevance of sector-level activities in the creation of the economy-wide value added. A distinction is made in the first place between the aggregate manufacturing sector, business services and non-business services. In the second place, a more detailed sectoral perspective is adopted in order to understand the influence exercised especially by the construction sector and renting activities – representing, respectively, the least and the most productive non-manufacturing sectors. In this way, the relative intensity and economic importance of different sectors is better understood, and the direction and magnitude of their impact on the current account positions can be assessed. From the theoretical perspective, Giavazzi and Spaventa (2010) argue that if the impact on the current account, even if transiently negative, comes from tradable sectors or sectors with high productivity, there is not much reason to be worried about the intertemporal budget constraint. Indeed, the accumulated external debts could be repaid with the future gains from trade. More precisely, in modeling the intertemporal budget constraint, Giavazzi and Spaventa (2010) distinguish between tradable and non-tradable goods, and observe that low productivity in both sectors implies a more stringent intertemporal budget constraint. Especially critical is seen investment in non-tradables, as it can be treated analogously to current consumption. Financing of such investment through the accumulation of external debt might imply problems with the debt service in the future. In the current analysis, both tradability and productivity issues are accounted for. Accordingly, whether a sector has a truly negative impact on the current account should be considered together with its economic potential in terms of productivity. In this sense, the most serious concerns arise over the construction sector. Indeed, it is not only non-tradable, but also low-productive. Given that the activity in the sector was booming alongside the deterioration in the current account positions in the EU, its negative role should not be undermined. The results, indeed, confirm the negative association between the construction sector and the current account balance. On the contrary, business services – that are among the most productive service activities – exercised a positive impact on current account positions. This could have occurred both directly, as these sectors are among tradables, and indirectly, by sustaining the activity in other tradable sectors. This is the first contribution investigating the sectoral impact on current accounts in such a broad sense. In the past literature, separate studies dedicated some attention to housing market influence on current account (Aizenman and Jinjarak, 2009; Gete, 2009; Punzi, 2007; Punzi, 2013). Generally, these studies confirm that a construction investment boom enhances current account deterioration. Apart from this specific evidence, the related literature says nothing about the contribution of other sectors to the explanation of the current account. The present paper fills this gap. The paper is structured as follows. The next section recalls the literature on the standard as well as the new set of sectoral determinants of the current account. The section ‘Data issues and descriptive statistics’ opens the empirical investigation with the description of the facts and developments in the sectoral structures of the European economy, followed by the discussion of the estimation strategy in the section ‘Estimation strategy’. Subsequently, estimation results are presented (section ‘Results from OLS panel estimations’) and strengthened by two important sensitivity checks (see section ‘Sensitivity analysis’). Finally, the last section summarizes the paper.",
58,2,Comparative Economic Studies,25 February 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ces.2016.4,Does Bank Performance Contribute to Economic Growth in the European Union?,June 2016,Cândida Ferreira,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The recent protracted financial crisis has raised attention to the importance of bank performance for economic growth all over the world and very particularly in the European Union (EU). In the context of the EU, the relevance of banking institutions in the process of financing economic growth is generally accepted, although their specific roles are controversial, as has been clearly recognised among others by Goddard et al. (2007) and Molyneux (2009). Banks and other financial institutions are usually supposed to guarantee the financing of productive investments and activities as they mobilise and allocate financial resources, and also by means of their specific money-creation processes through bank credit. Moreover, there is a general consensus that well-functioning markets and financial institutions may decrease transaction costs and asymmetric information problems. The analysis of the importance of bank performance for economic growth has been the object of discussion for decades and intensified after the renowned contribution of King and Levine (1993). During the last two decades there has been an increase in empirical studies at the aggregate level, which explain output variables with financial ratios and variables such as liquid liabilities, bank loans to the private sector, and stock market capitalisation, which may be representative of the development of financial systems and institutions. Khan and Senhadji (2000), analysing the literature concerning the empirical evidence of the relationship between financial development and economic growth, concluded that the results of these studies indicate that while the general effects of financial development on the outputs are positive, the size of these effects varies with the different variables considered, with the indicators of financial development and with the estimation method, data frequency, or the defined functional form of the relationship. At the same time, authors such as Rajan and Zingales (1998) have argued that there is no clear causality between financial development and economic growth. Rather than adhering to the traditional explanation of economic growth by the proxy of financial development, these authors test the hypothesis that financial markets and banking institutions not only reduce the cost of financing, but also help to combat the problems provoked by asymmetrical information, concluding with their test that the sectors most dependent on external financing will be the ones that grow faster and in line with the development of the financial markets and institutions to which these sectors have access. More recently, Hassan et al. (2011) provided evidence from panel data estimations and concluded that there is a general positive relationship between financial development and economic growth in low- and middle-income countries classified by economic region, although it seems that well-functioning financial systems may be necessary for mostly developing countries, but not a sufficient condition to reach steady and sustainable economic growth. Other authors analyse the importance of financial markets’ performance for real economic growth, but put particular emphasis on the relations between business and financial cycles. For example, Borio (2012) considers that it is not possible to understand macroeconomics, business fluctuations, and policy challenges in recent decades without understanding financial cycles. At the same time, Claessens et al. (2012) empirically test the interactions between business and financial cycles with monthly data for 44 countries, covering the time period 1960–2010, and mostly conclude that recessions associated with financial disruptions tend to be longer and deeper, emphasising the importance of financial market developments for the real economy. Another strand of literature takes into account the development of the global trend of bank consolidation, and increases the theoretical debates and empirical tests analysing the particular relationship between bank market concentration and bank performance. Until the 1990s, there was a general belief that mergers did not clearly contribute to bank performance improvements and several empirical findings were consistent with the traditional structure–conduct–performance statements, in particular with the ‘quiet life hypothesis’ (among others, Hannan and Berger, 1991; Houston and Ryngaert, 1994; Pilloff, 1996). But from the year 2000, this general consensus was broken and particular attention was paid to specific characteristics of the banking markets such as the presence of asymmetric information, contagion phenomena, and imperfect competition, or the specific impacts of bank concentration, competition, and regulation on bank performance (eg De Bandt and Davis, 2000; Bikker and Haaf, 2002; Berger et al., 2004; Hasan et al., 2009; Schaeck et al., 2009). However, it is generally recognised that not many works have addressed the possible relationship between economic growth and banking market structure, and also between economic growth and bank performance, namely measuring this bank performance through bank efficiency. One of the few examples of these works can be found in Maudos and Fernandez de Guevara (2009), who used different measures of bank market competition for a sample of 21 countries and 53 economic sectors during the time period 1993–2003, concluding not only that there is a positive effect of financial development on economic growth, but also that the exercise of bank market power promotes economic growth. Different conclusions were obtained by Claessens and Laeven (2005), who used industry-specific and country-specific data for 16 countries for the time periods 1980–1990 and 1980–1997 to estimate a measure of banking competition based on industrial organisation theory and then related this competition measure to the growth of industries. Their findings point to the evidence that greater competition in countries’ banking systems will contribute to the faster growth of financially dependent industries, and so there is no support for the hypothesis that market power is good for access to financing and promoting economic growth. Carbó Valverde et al. (2003) analyse the relationship between financial market competition and economic growth in five large regions in Spain and conclude that the differences in competition are not associated with improved regional growth. Regarding the measurement of the quality of the financial development and its possible influence on economic growth, Hasan et al. (2009) use a sample of 147 regions in 11 European countries between 1996 and 2004, and conclude that regional economic growth benefits significantly from more efficient banks. This paper contributes to the literature with the analysis of the possible contribution of bank market structure and the performance of the banking institutions to economic growth, here represented by per capita gross national income. To our knowledge, not many authors have addressed these issues in the particular context of all EU member states during the last decade, taking into account the influence of the international financial crisis, and considering the specific influence of bank market structure and of bank performance on economic growth. To represent bank market structure here, we use a bank market concentration measure and bank performance is proxied both by the capital ratio of bank equity to bank total assets and also a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) bank cost-efficiency measure. The main empirical results confirm the controversial influence of bank market structure on economic growth. However, they clearly reveal that the equity to total assets ratio had a significant negative influence on economic growth before and after the beginning of the recent financial crisis. Simultaneously, and in line with the findings of Hasan et al. (2009), we conclude that DEA bank efficiency positively contributes to economic growth, although not as statistically significantly for the years after the beginning of the crisis. The paper is organised as follows: The section ‘Data and methodology’ presents the data used and the methodological framework; The section ‘Results obtained with the generalised method of moments (GMM) estimates’ reports the results of the dynamic panel estimations; and the section ‘Concluding remarks’ concludes.",5

Indeed, despite the implementation of unconventional monetary policies by the European Central Bank (ECB), the financial conditions in the Eurozone remain heterogeneous, with a still sizeable gap between the peripheral and core countries. This financial fragmentation naturally raises the question of the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission in the Eurozone, especially in the periphery, where bank retail rates have increased relative to the ECB’s policy rates and to the core. As a consequence, the periphery has suffered from high interest rates for households and firms, thus limiting investment and potential growth, whereas the core has enjoyed remarkably low interest rates, which could distort asset prices and impact financial stability in the mid-term. According to the ECB (2012) and Draghi (2014), these marked and persistent differences in bank interest rates today constitute one of the major challenges that the common monetary policy faces, particularly because the banking sector is the main channel through which monetary policy impulses affect the economy and ultimately prices in the Euro area. One could argue that this financial fragmentation phase is undoubtedly temporary and will be reversed when peripheral economies return to the path of growth and sovereign risk decreases. However, if we refer to the literature on bank interest-rate pass-through, we note that the question of the heterogeneity of pass-through among Euro area countries is not new. Since the introduction of the single currency in 1999, this issue has lain the heart of the debate among academics and policymakers. The majority of empirical studies devoted to this question have concluded that the interest-rate pass-through in the Euro area has been both imperfect (sluggish in the short term and incomplete in the long term) and highly heterogeneous across countries, among interest-rate categories and over time (Mojon, 2000; Toolsema et al., 2002; Donnay and Degryse, 2001; Sander and Kleimeier, 2004a; Kleimeier and Sander, 2006; De Bondt, 2005; De Bondt et al., 2005; Banerjee et al., 2010; Van Leuvensteijn et al., 2013; Bernhofer and van Treeck, 2013). Consequently, some papers have attempted to investigate empirically the factors driving retail banks’ price setting and the determinants of interest-rate pass-through heterogeneity, both at the micro (see, eg, De Graeve et al., 2004; Mueller-Spahn, 2008; Schlüter et al., 2012; Horváth and Podpiera, 2012; Kitamura et al., 2015) and macro levels (Gigineishvili, 2011; Ozdemir and Altinoz, 2012; Saborowski and Weber, 2013).Footnote 1 However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have examined this issue in the case of the Euro area. Knowing the drivers of monetary transmission and the reasons underlying the cross-country heterogeneity in the interest-rate pass-through has valuable policy implications for strengthening monetary policy efficiency. In particular, as argued by Gigineishvili (2011), this knowledge could provide important indications for the choice of a monetary policy framework, including intermediate targets and policy instruments. Nonetheless, despite the relevance of the studies of Gigineishvili (2011) and Saborowski and Weber (2013), we believe that this question of monetary policy transmission and pass-through heterogeneity is even more important in the case of a single-currency area. Indeed, in contrast to countries with monetary sovereignty, one can barely imagine a common central bank conducting a more aggressive monetary policy (in terms of policy rates) to compensate for an incomplete and sluggish interest-rate pass-through in some countries of the monetary union because such a policy would induce high economic costs in other member countries. Therefore, identifying the factors that constitute obstacles to the pass-through could help promote a more homogeneous transmission of monetary policy across the monetary union and decrease the trade-off faced by the central bank. In the case of the European Monetary Union (EMU), several measures and reforms have been introduced to increase financial integration (such as the Financial Services Action Plan, and more recently the European Banking Union) and to alleviate financial tensions following the economic and debt crises. However, as shown by Bernhofer and van Treeck (2013) and as the ECB (2013) itself recognized, these measures did not have the expected effects, with bank lending conditions remaining heterogeneous and policy interest rates passing through with difficulty to bank rates in several member countries. Against this background, our paper attempts to fill this gap in the literature by investigating the roles of several cyclical and structural variables in determining the strength of bank interest-rate pass-through in the Euro area. As stated above, our first objective in this paper is to identify the factors that could explain the cross-country heterogeneity in the ECB’s monetary transmission. For this purpose, our empirical analysis, which covers the period from January 2003 to December 2013, proceeds in two steps. The first step consists of assessing the degree of heterogeneity in the ECB’s monetary policy transmission mechanism and of whether and to what extent this heterogeneity has changed since the financial crisis. By considering an ARDL–ECM model, we find that the pass-through of monetary policy to rates on bank loans to households and non-financial firms has been impaired in the aftermath of the Great Recession, in agreement with the findings of recent papers (see, eg, Aristei and Gallo, 2014; Al-Eyd and Berkmen, 2013; Blot and Labondance, 2013; Karagiannis et al., 2010). More importantly, our results also reveal a substantial structural heterogeneity in the interest-rate pass-through across Euro area countries. This last result confirms therefore that the recent crisis, and more largely the economic and financial climate, is not the only factor that can explain the heterogeneity in the ECB’s monetary policy transmission. A number of structural factors also likely explain this heterogeneity in the pass-through from money market rates to bank retail rates. Consequently, in the second step, we examine this issue by considering a large number of potential cyclical and structural determinants of interest-rate pass-through. More precisely, we group the cyclical and structural variables that we consider into four categories: (i) the macroeconomic environment (industrial production, inflation rate, business confidence); (ii) the macro-financial environment (stock price index, money market rate volatility, country risk premium, non-financial firms’ probability of default); (iii) the financial structure (Lerner index, Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI), market capitalization); and (iv) bank risks (non-performing loan (NPL) ratio, financial firm probability of default). Formally, in this regard, we reparametrize our baseline pass-through model by interacting each potential determinant that we consider with the money market rate, and we estimate it using the pooled mean group estimator (PMGE) developed by Pesaran et al. (1999). Except for the HHI and money market rate volatility for firms, our results indicate a significant effect of each variable considered individually on the interest -rate pass-through in the Eurozone. For instance, we find that the lack of banking competition and of well-developed financial markets impairs the monetary policy transmission mechanism, constituting an important source of pass-through heterogeneity across Euro area countries. Above all, these findings support that the recent financial crisis and the resulting context of financial fragmentation tell only part of the story. Structural factors and financial market structures also seem to play roles. Finally, we choose to extend our previous empirical analysis by considering a multivariate vector autoregressive (VAR) approach. Beyond testing the robustness of our results, two main reasons motivated this choice. First, in contrast with an univariate approach, such a framework allows for endogeneity of the money market rate. Indeed, as argued by Rocha (2012), even if the interbank rate is closely controlled by the monetary authority, one would also imagine that it is endogenous to bank lending rates because the central bank is expected to respond to the market, and thus perhaps reacting to banks’ actions.Footnote 2 Second, by considering a trivariate VAR framework, including bank rate, money market rate and the industrial production, we control for asymmetric shocks in the business cycle. Therefore, such an approach allows us to provide a more accurate representation of the heterogeneity of the euro-area members, in particular in times of financial crisis. Formally, to assess to the extent to which the structural and cyclical factors that we consider in our study affect the response of bank lending rates to a monetary policy shock in a multivariate context, we rely on the Interactive Panel Vector Autogressive framework recently developed by Towbin and Weber (2013). As emphasized by Saborowski and Weber (2013), such a framework can be viewed as a generalized panel VAR regression in which two-way interactions between the policy rate and the bank interest rate can vary deterministically with country characteristics. Overall, the results that we obtain corroborate previous findings. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section is devoted to the analysis of interest-rate pass-through heterogeneity in the Eurozone. The subsequent section describes the data and methodology used to identify the structural and cyclical drivers of ECB’s monetary policy transmission. The penultimate section discusses in detail our empirical findings. The final section summarizes the main conclusions.",12

At the same time, most advanced OECD economies also have experienced a sharp increase in their financial activities over the last three decades: financial markets, financial institutions and financial innovations have been rapidly grown across countries since the early 1980s. A large literature has explored the potential impact of the international economic integration on the increased uncertainty faced by workers (Rodrik, 1997; Buch and Schlotter, 2011). For instance, Rodrik (1997) shows that the international economic integration has contributed to the increase in the elasticity in labor demand, especially for low-skilled workers, making wages and the number of hours worked more volatile. The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship between financial development and labor-market volatility in the OECD countries. Some recent contributions have investigated the role of increasing financialization in higher labor-market volatility. Pagano and Pica (2012) have analyzed the impact of financial development on labor reallocation across industries. More specifically, Buch and Pierdzioch (2014) have investigated on the role of financial globalization in labor-market volatility. This paper focuses on the relationship between domestic financial development (and its impact of corporate strategies) and labor-market volatility. To analyze the impact of financial development on labor-market volatility, I argue that higher financial development should affect corporate strategies and be positively correlated to labor-market volatility. Thesmar and Thoenig (2004) argue that financial development has directly affected corporate strategies. For instance, shareholder-oriented firms are likely to become more sensitive to the financial market fluctuations. Increasing financial development has reinforced investors’ bargaining power at the global and domestic levels, pushing for pro-minority shareholder corporate governance reforms in most OECD countries (Darcillon, 2015). As a consequence, recent changes in corporate governance thus have contributed to the shift of risk from shareholders to wage earners. This will then affect how firms will determine wages and the number of hours worked. However, there are large cross-country differences in labor-market volatility, whereas all OECD countries have experienced a large increase in their financial activities. As the result, the increase in labor-market volatility has been more modest in countries that have maintained strong labor-market regulation. In this regard, it has been well recognized in the literature that specific labor-market regulations (such unemployment benefits or job-protection laws) are designed to reduce temporary fluctuations of income (Jetter et al., 2013; Bertola and Lo Prete, 2015). Individuals’ preferences on stable wages and employment are closely related to risk aversion. I will test the argument that financial development should be positively correlated to higher labor-market volatility in countries with weaker labor-market regulation. In this paper, labor-market regulation refers to two dimensions: first, the level of government in the labor market; second, the degree of generosity of social and welfare policies. Using panel data on 15 OECD countries from 1974 to 2007, I first run fixed-effects regressions to analyze the effect of higher financial development on labor-market volatility. Then, I estimate a threshold regression model in panel data using a reduced sample of countries from 1986 to 2005, proposed by Hansen (1999), to test whether this effect depends on labor-market regulation. I measure labor-market instability using indices of volatility. I calculate how much wages and the number of hours worked change over a 5-year window. The greater the variance of short-term wages and employment changes, the more volatility there is. I use two measures of financial development: the stock market capitalization ratio (as a percentage of GDP) and the employment share in the financial sector. I find evidence that higher employment in finance is positively correlated to increased labor-market volatility, whereas stock market development has no significant impact. Results do not, however, show any significant differences across skill levels. Then, results from threshold regressions indicate that this positive effect is larger particularly in countries with weaker labor-market regulation (which includes less generous social and welfare policies). This second result is particularly more robust when explaining employment volatility of low-skilled workers and when explaining wage volatility for all categories of workers. The next section of the paper presents my conceptual framework. In the subsequent section, I present data on recent trends in labor-market volatility and detail my measures of financial development and the indicators for labor-market regulation. Then, I explain my empirical strategy in the section after that. Estimation results and some robustness checks are reported in the penultimate section. The final section provides some concluding remarks and policy implications.",4

According to the narrative, developing countries face serious constraints in savings and ‘export earnings’ that are not conducive for the growth of investment. In spite of severe criticisms since its inception, this model has provided a background for early aid policies (Easterly, 1999) and empirical specifications in many studies (Masud and Yontcheva, 2005). Accordingly, both the Harrod-Domar and Solow growth models that constitute the principal theoretical underpinnings in the foreign aid literature are based on the need for substantial aid-driven investment, with the purpose of reducing the poverty gap between developed and poor countries. The effect of development assistance on private sector investment has long been an important issue of debate. Many economists have adopted the position that aid stimulates private investment in least developed countries (LDCs) by improving macroeconomic savings, while others have contended that aid has a negative effect on private investment because, inter alia, it: is often wasted or counterproductive; generates the Dutch-disease and enables the central government to drain resources from the private sector (Snyder, 1996).Footnote 1 However, recent empirical evidence suggests that donors are concerned about how their aid is used, especially how it affects the fiscal behavior of recipient governments (Morrissey, 2012). Morrissey has reviewed the effects of aid and concluded that aid significantly affects government spending and tax effort in LDCs. Our main contribution to the literature is twofold. On the one hand, we propose an endogenous theory of aid and on the other hand provide empirical validity for the proposed theory. The model we propose postulates that the positive effect of aid reduces that burden of the taxation system on the private sector, which ultimately leads to economic growth in poor countries, especially when the amount of aid is high and the public sector is less effective. In essence, the goal of the study is to examine how aid affects private investment through fiscal policy channels. We postulate that the effects of aid on tax effort and government spending as suggested by Morrissey (2012) could provide incentives for private investments and fixed capital formation, which are essential for economic prosperity. In addition to the above contributions, the paper has policy implications in a number of areas. First, the global economic downturn has resurfaced issues about donors’: continued willingness ‘to give’ and commitment to development assistance (Ahmed et al., 2011). Therefore, investigating the effect of aid on investment could provide additional insights into the ongoing debate.Footnote 2 Second, a corollary of the first contribution is the shifting of policy-space to foreign aid alternatives from East Asia. Accordingly, the ability to learn from the East Asian success stories has been substantially hampered by an asymmetric bargaining power between Africa and her Western development partners.Footnote 3 Third, there have been considerable shifts in the objectives announced by the donor community, which have evolved from intensive industrialization programs advocated in the 1950s to more recent poverty-reduction objectives such the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Fourth, by using comparatively more recent data (1996–2010) from 53 countries, we provide an updated account of the nexuses. Moreover, the richness of our dataset also avails room for more policy implications. Accordingly, in order to add subtlety to the analysis, we disaggregate the dataset into fundamental characteristics of investment (legal origins, petroleum-exporting quality, political instability/conflicts, regional proximity, income-levels, religious-domination and openness to sea). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents controversial views in the literature before proposing the endogenous theory. The data and methodology are discussed in after that. The empirical analysis is covered by the subsequent section. The last section concludes.",17

Evidence from the Croatian Bank Lending Survey,September 2016,Martin Pintaric,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper analyzes the effect of credit standards and credit demand on bank lending in Croatia using the Croatian Bank Lending Survey (BLS).Footnote 1 Although the time series is short, the qualitative nature of the information contained in the survey enables us to associate the individual responses of banks with developments in general economic activity. Despite the accommodative monetary policy stance of the CNB and consequent high primary liquidity in the monetary system, in 2015 loans to the non-financial private sector recorded the biggest fall since the onset of the crisis. In this paper, we analyze the determinants of credit growth in order to understand the importance of credit standards and credit demand, particularly in the present conditions of weak lending activity in Croatia.Footnote 2
 The results of our panel data analysis indicate that there is a statistically significant relationship between the growth of loans to enterprises, consumer’s, and other lending on one hand and credit standards and credit demand on the other hand with changes in credit demand having a greater impact on credit growth than changes in credit standards. The results indicate that the responses of the banks in the Croatian survey help explain credit activity, although there is no statistically significant information regarding mortgage loans. The next section of the paper gives an overview of the relevant literature; the third section describes the main macroeconomic developments and monetary policy in Croatia, while the fourth presents the results of the Survey conducted by CNB. In the fifth section, a microeconometric assessment of the influence of credit standards and demand on credit growth is given; monetary policy implications are discussed in the sixth section, while the conclusion is presented in the last section.",2

It is now in the process of also becoming a ‘banking union’ (BU). The leaders of the European Union (EU) have argued that even this step is not enough. In September 2012, close to the peak of the euro crisis, a joint report by the four Presidents of the EU (the Presidents of the European Commission, the European Council, the Euro Group and the European Central Bank), entitled ‘Genuine Economic and Monetary Union’, argued that much more was needed (Belke, 2013, and Begg, 2014). The four Presidents argued in essence that the establishment of a BU should also be seen as a first step towards further integration. According to their report a fiscal union would be the next logical step. Moreover, a fiscal union was held to imply the need for a political union. There is surprisingly little analytical support, however, for the claim that a BU needs to lead to a fiscal union (Belke, 2013, 2013a). The key argument most often heard is simply the observation that the euro area has only a very limited central budget (at least compared with other monetary unions), and that therefore there are almost no fiscal transfers to smooth asymmetric shocks. By contrast, the United States, which is of a similar size as the euro area, does have a substantial federal fiscal budget. The US experience is thus usually taken as a model of what is needed for a sustainable monetary union. This study contributes to this debate by illustrating how the ‘banking union’ of the United States provides a very tangible insurance against local financial shocks without a major involvement of the ‘fiscal union’, which undoubtedly also exists in the United States. The trans-Atlantic financial crisis that started in 2007–2008 and led to the Great Recession provides a key episode in assessing the importance of mechanisms to absorb regional shocks. The financial shocks became quickly regional in the euro area after 2009–2010 when the financial systems of some countries almost collapsed, and their sovereigns lost market access (eg, Ireland, Portugal and Greece). It is often overlooked that the origins of the crisis in the United States were also rather concentrated at the regional level. The housing boom was very concentrated in the United States. The increase in housing prices varied enormously from state to state and only a few states (Arizona, Nevada, Florida and California) accounted for most of the sub-prime lending, overbuilding and thus the subsequent economic distress and losses from delinquent mortgages. However, the United States experienced ‘only’ a system-wide crisis in 2007–2009. There was no specific crisis involving only those states where the real estate excesses had been most marked (Nevada, Florida and California). The main thrust of this study is that the United States was better equipped to deal with these regional shocks because it is a fully fledged BU. The euro area officially has a banking union, but most observers would agree that it is incomplete if one starts with the three ‘canonical’ elements of a BU (IMF, 2013a, 2013b):
 Common supervision. This has been achieved, since the ECB, under the heading of the SSM (Single Supervisory Mechanism), has become the ultimate supervisor for all banks in the euro area, and the direct supervisor of about 130 of the largest banks accounting for about 2/3rd of banking assets. A common mechanism to resolve banks. This has also been achieved with creation of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), which will be able to rely on a common fund (the Single Resolution Fund) after a transition period. The SRM will cover all banks in the euro area (and in those other EU countries wishing to join the SSM). Common deposit insurance. No agreement has been reached on this point. It remains to be seen how important this lacuna will become. By contrast, the United States has had all three elements in place at least since 1933.Footnote 1 The United States thus has been a banking union for 80 years. But one should also not forget that the US monetary union survived almost a century and a half without being a BU. The central theme of this study is that the consequences of the US BU could be seen during the financial crisis. A simple comparison of the fate of two different members of a large monetary union, after they were hit by a financial crisis, offers a powerful illustration of the importance of an integrated banking system. Ireland and Nevada, in fact, provide an almost ideal test case. These two entities share several important characteristics. For example, they both have similar populations as well as GDP, and they both experienced an exceptionally strong housing boom. But when the boom turned to bust, the US states did not experience any local financial crisis (nor did any state government have to be bailed out). This contribution finds that the key difference between Nevada and Ireland is that banking problems are taken care of in the United States at the federal level (effectively a banking union), whereas in the euro area, responsibility for banking losses remains national. The paper is organised as follows. The next section presents some case studies of the stabilisation properties of a banking union. The section after that then analyses the role of ‘foreign-owned banks’ as a sort of ‘private banking union’. The following section analyses the institutions that paid for the shock absorption provided by the official US federal banking-related institutions: the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). The penultimate section contains some general considerations with respect to a fiscal union and financial shock absorbers. The final section concludes.",12

Theoretical models exploring capitalist diversity (such as the varieties-of-capitalism approach (VoC)) have been applied to explain the causes of the current persistent crisis in several EU and Eurozone member states (see, e.g., Hall, 2012; Hancké, 2013; and Johnston et al., 2014). These approaches and the related literature, however, have focused on the explanation of differences between traditional OECD countries. Central and Eastern European CountriesFootnote 1 (CEECs) have not played a prominent role in the (empirical) analysis of economic systems, although their convergence or nonconvergence toward western prototypes is a highly interesting question; this is more so as all these countries are EU and (prospective) Eurozone members and thus are vulnerable to the same problems plaguing the current European crisis countries. Moreover, contrary to other countries, after the collapse of socialism, CEECs had a chance to develop a new set of market institutions or could choose from the existing institutional prototypes. Clearly, the envisaged process of institutional and economic convergence of CEECs has been guided by the priority of EU accession and the corresponding Copenhagen Criteria. However, the actual variety of economic systems within EU-15 suggests that these criteria and especially the acquis communautaire have been less relevant when it comes to the core set of institutions characterizing economic systems (see, e.g., Foders et al., 2002). Hence, it is still unclear how the institutional convergence processes in CEECs had developed. Hypotheses range from national economic systems, which are similar to the existing prototypes (Bohle and Greskovits, 2012) to idiosyncratic systems with no role model (Nölke and Vliegenthart, 2009). Only a few empirical studies have investigated this topic. This paper seeks to close this gap. Our goal is to empirically identify the type(s) of economic system(s) that the CEECs have established in order to detect possible convergence or nonconvergence toward the existing prototypes. In order to establish a benchmark of prototype economic systems, we deviate from previous studies, since we do not limit our analysis to one aspect of the economic system, as, e.g., done by authors focusing either on the production or on the welfare system. Instead, we relate our study to the literature on the joint VoC and Worlds of Welfare States (WWS) approaches (e.g., Amable, 2003; and Schröder, 2013). Based on this literature, we suggest four basic prototypes of economic systems. Three of which possess distinct but inherently consistent institutional configurations, reaping benefits from institutional complementarities: A Liberal prototype based on a Liberal Market Economy (LME, Anglo-Saxon countries) at one end of the spectrum, as well as Nordic and Continental welfare state varieties based on a Coordinated Market Economy (CME) at the other end. As first described by Hall and Soskice (2001), these countries possess institutions in all spheres of their economy, which are complementary to each other, leading to superior economic performance due to matching incentive structures. In contrast, Mediterranean countries established mixed market economies (MME), characterized by a lack of institutional complementarity and the resulting performance problems. Furthermore, we follow Iversen and Wren (1998) and Kitschelt (2006) and consider differences in performance patterns. Those authors argue that sustained employment growth and innovation can only be achieved via wage decreases (and subsequently rising inequality) or high public sector spending (with subsequent fiscal imbalances). According to underlying societal preferences, different prototype economic systems will react differently to this tradeoff: Liberal countries will focus on innovation/growth and budgetary restraint, while CMEs are expected to favor income equality combined with a focus on budgetary restraint (Continental) or growth/innovation (Nordics). The Cluster and Principal Component Analysis in this paper addresses primarily the question of whether the economic systems of CEECs have converged toward (1) a consistent LME or CME model with the corresponding performance pattern; toward (2) an inconsistent, crisis-prone Mediterranean type of model; or if they have (3) established a distinct new prototype. To answer this question, the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the prototype economic systems among traditional OECD countries and discusses the related cluster analyses on CEEC convergence available so far. This overview shows that a comprehensive analysis integrating CEECs into an OECD sample is still lacking in the literature. Section 3 describes our macro cluster approach, and Sect. 4 gives the main results. Our conclusions in Sect. 5 demonstrate that CEECs have still not completely converged toward OECD prototypes, but complement these by independent Liberal (Baltic States, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia) and Coordinated (Visegrad countries, Croatia, and Slovenia) varieties, which show few signs of convergence toward the inconsistent and underperforming economic systems of the Mediterranean countries.",9

These transfers result from vertical fiscal imbalances that determine the degree of fiscal decentralization of a federation and create fiscal incentives that can be important for the behavior of both central and subnational governments. A substantial literature has developed measuring fiscal incentives in different federations, but more or less detailed econometric studies of fiscal incentives have typically focused on a single country, usually Russia or China.Footnote 1 Some of these single-country studies occasionally refer to the work done for other countries, but such comparisons have been difficult because of the lack of comparability in data and methodology. There are two main empirical approaches to gauging the strength of fiscal incentives of subnational governments.Footnote 2 Under one approach developed by Zhuravskaya (2000), the idea is to estimate how transfers from the center (or any other upper level of government) react to changes in local budget “own” revenues. If transfers decline one-for-one in response to an increase in local revenues, then incentives are weak. If transfers do not respond significantly to changes in local revenues, then incentives are strong. The second approach due to Plekhanov (2004) measures changes in local expenditures in response to changes in local output. If expenditure elasticity with respect to local output is close to one, then local governments are able to benefit fully, at least at the margin, from local economic growth and suffer full consequences of local economic decline. This results in strong fiscal incentives to develop local economy. Otherwise, the incentives are relatively weak. Although this second approach is easier to implement if the data on local gross product are available, it is valid only under the assumption of balanced budget that precludes expenditure smoothing using rainy day funds at the local level. The main goal of this paper is to compare the conventional measures of fiscal decentralization and fiscal incentives in two large federations, Russia and the US, using uniform methodology and the most recent data available. We show that although in some respects Russia is clearly more centralized fiscally than the US, the conventional measures of fiscal incentives of subnational levels of government are not significantly different between the two countries. This does not necessarily imply that actual fiscal incentives of Russia’s regions and municipalities are indeed similar to those of their American counterparts. Instead, it is possible that the conventional measures of these incentives developed in the literature might not be very informative without deeper understanding of the institutional context of intergovernmental relations. Such understanding would require a more detailed study of the workings of subnational governments in each country, which is beyond the scope of this paper. I note, however, that despite a common perception of a lack of both political and fiscal independence of Russia’s regional governments, their fiscal incentives matter a great deal, because in a country of this size central authorities have little control over the bulk of economic activities within regions. This is true even with respect to economic activities that are regulated in some detail by federal laws, because implementation of these laws is largely up to the regional authorities. In addition to providing the US–Russia comparisons of the measures of fiscal incentives, this paper contributes to the literature on fiscal decentralization using more recent data than in other studies and by examining both Center–regions and intraregional fiscal incentives. The use of recent data is particularly important for Russia where fiscal relations between different government levels have changed significantly since the early 2000s and even more so since the 1990s, while most of the empirical work on fiscal federalism incentives in Russia has been done based on the pre-2005 data. In large part, the use of the more recent data explains our finding that fiscal incentives of Russia’s regions during 2005–2014 have become stronger than those estimated by Plekhanov (2004) for the 1994–2000 data. Somewhat surprisingly, I also find much stronger fiscal incentives of Russia’s regions than those obtained by Alexeev and Weber (2013) based on 2001–2009 data. The difference might be due to the smaller sample of regions used by Alexeev and Weber and to the inclusion of 2001–2004 period in their work. The latter factor could be particularly important, because of the changing nature of intergovernmental fiscal relations in Russia since 2005 mentioned above. Also, my results for fiscal incentives of municipalities are contrary to Zhuravskaya’s (2000) findings who used the data on a sample of large Russian cities in the first half of the 1990s to show that their municipal governments had very weak fiscal incentives.Footnote 3 In addition, I am not aware of any comparable work on fiscal incentives of the states and municipalities in the US. The next section summarizes the main advantages and disadvantages of providing local governments with strong fiscal incentives. “A Brief Overview of Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations in Russia and the US” section provides a brief description of the federal structure of Russia and the US, concentrating on the former. The data, empirical methodology, and the underlying theory are discussed in “Data and Estimation Approach” section. The estimation results are presented in “Regression Results” section. “Concluding Remarks” section concludes.",5

Those studying reciprocal payment mechanisms refer to it as a “social,” “community,” or “complementary” currency – terms that are broadly equivalent. The WIR is really a centralized credit system for multilateral exchange, not a physical currency per se. Despite its origins in the ideas of Silvio Gesell – a monetary economist praised by Keynes (1936) – the WIR has attracted little attention from economists. Studer (1998) and Stodder (2009) provide the only formal empirical studies. Studer (1998) shows that WIR credits are positively correlated with the growth of the Swiss money supply. Stodder (2009) shows that WIR bank transactions are also highly countercyclical – more so than the official Swiss money supply itself. If a secondary currency provides added financial stability, then standard monetary policy may not be optimal. The idea that community currency expenditures will be countercyclical has a long currency. It is accepted by Yale’s Irving Fisher in his Stamp Scrip (1933), a short book that documents the flourishing of such currencies in the US of the Great Depression. Building on Stodder’s (2009) empirical demonstration of countercyclical WIR spending, our present paper explains the different commercial motivations for large and small firms – the latter with more restricted credit access – in their use of WIR. We can thus show how these differing motivations create a credit interaction that makes WIR Turnover (or total expenditure) highly countercyclical. Stodder’s earlier (2009) paper considers the countercyclical pattern of WIR Turnover (Turnover = WIR Balances times Velocity), but lacks data to distinguish Balances from Velocity. With a new disaggregated dataset, we can now show that WIR Balances and Velocity are both countercyclical drivers, but for different types of businesses. Larger Non-Registered (NR) (i.e., nonmember) firms – free to accept as much or as little WIR-currency as they wish – accept more WIR when other forms of money are in short supply, in a recession. For such NR firms, WIR-Balances are the countercyclical term. Smaller Registered (R) firms, by contrast, will be shown to have countercyclical WIR-Velocities. Thus, both R and NR firms show a countercyclical Turnover, but dominated by different terms. This pattern for WIR between large and small firms is argued to be highly analogous to Trade Credits, a major form of non-bank credit in developed economies, also countercyclical (Nilsen, 2002). There are hundreds of community currency systems in existence today, described in a descriptive literature, largely by noneconomists (Williams, 1996; Greco, 2001; Gomez, 2008). The Swiss WIR-Bank is the largest such system, with over 70,000 customers throughout the country. Formal membership and registration is restricted to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) (Studer, 1998). The Swiss WIR-Bank, is the largest and oldest surviving ‘club’ form of money of which we know. The finding by Stodder (2009) that WIR activity is countercyclical is based on data from 1948 to 2003. Our present study with more recent data (i) strengthens that conclusion, (ii) performs further tests for structural breaks, and (iii) shows how large and small firms interact to structure this countercyclical resilience. The paper is organized in sections as follows. The section “WIR’s Countercyclical Record: Time-Series Regressions” tests the countercyclical record on a long time-series of WIR data. “WIR Trade Credits: Registered and Non-Registered Members” examines WIR’s structure of smaller and larger clients. “Theory: Money in the Production Function” presents some basic theory on how firms will use secondary or ‘residual’ currency. “Panel Econometric Tests” runs panel regressions to test this theory. (‘Bootstrap’ simulations are first required to build up a large sample for cointegration testing.) “Estimates within Industrial Sectors” breaks our panel into sectors and uses Chi-Squared tests to summarize 192 separate regressions. “Conclusions” summarizes our results and considers the implications.",12
58,4,Comparative Economic Studies,30 November 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-016-0007-z,Peoples of the Enemy? Ukrainians and Russians 1995–2011,December 2016,Louise Grogan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"This paper examines whether or not a socioeconomic and political divide between Russian and Ukrainian-speaking regions of Ukraine emerged between 1995 and 2011, causing residents of Russian-speaking regions to increasingly support a change to government by Russia. Although Russia appears to have had a some role in the initiation of hostilities in 2014, these actions may well have been induced by long-term changes in circumstances and views in Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine. Military action may have been partially precipitated by a perception amongst Russian-speaking residents of Eastern Ukraine that their living standards would improve under Russian rule. Detailed information about the views and socioeconomic situations of Ukrainians and Russians was collected in the World Values Surveys (WVS) of 1995–2011. These data permit testing of three hypotheses: first, that the economic situation of young men in Eastern Ukraine worsened relative to that of young men in Russia; second, that the political views of respondents in Eastern Ukraine became more like those in bordering Russian regions and third, that people in Eastern Ukraine became relatively more disillusioned over time with the quality of national institutions in Ukraine. The results provide little support for any of these hypotheses. The results are more consistent with the findings of the Pew Research Centre (2014) that Ukrainians in all regions overwhelmingly wish to remain one nation. Civil war is often preceded or accompanied by efforts to cleave differences between population groups where few naturally existed. This was true in Rwanda in 1994 and in the early 1990s in the former Yugoslavia. In Ukraine, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 resulted in concentrated populations of native Russian speakers on both sides of the new international border. Most of this border had last been redrawn by Joseph Stalin during a reign which saw millions of peasants in Ukraine eliminated as “Enemies of the People”, and thousands more deported as forced labourers to Siberia. In the 1920s, Ukrainian was the official language of schools and administration but Russification began in the early 1930s, concurrently with the disastrous collectivisation of agriculture. This attempt at radical, instantaneous changes in production modes for wheat and other grains led to The Great Famine of 1932–1933. About 4–5 million of the 6–8 million people who perished in this period were residents of Ukraine. Farmers had their wheat and other food confiscated by authorities with the result that millions starved. The harvest had not been unusually low, so these deaths are generally acknowledged to be the direct result of Stalinist policies for the “elimination of the Kulak class” (Subtelny, 2000; Yekelchyk, 2007; Snyder, 2003; Magocsi, 1996), and of the “unreliable elements”. During World War II, mass starvation and death occurred principally at the hands of Nazi rulers (Berkhoff, 2004). After the defeat of the Nazi occupation, the capital city of the Ukrainian SSR, Kiev, became majority Russian-speaking despite being located in Western Ukraine (Bilinsky, 1964; Blaj, 2013). In 1991, 97% of higher education students of in the Ukrainian SSR studied in Russian, and less than half completed Ukrainian-language high school (Ivanyshyn and Radevych-Vynnyts’kyi, 1994). Open conflict in Ukraine began with the declared transfer of the Crimea region from Ukraine to Russia. On March 16, 2014, residents of the Russian-speaking Crimea held a referendum in which they overwhelmingly voted to join Russia rather than become a highly autonomous region of Ukraine. Crimea had previously been transferred from Russia to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic by Kruschev in 1954. Importantly, however, the 12% Tatar-speaking minority of Ukraine generally voted against joining Russia in 2014. This is consistent with a hypothesis that economic incentives played in a role in the desire to leave Ukraine and become part of the Russian Federation. The rights of Tatars as a minority were expected by this subpopulation to be better protected by Ukraine than by Russia (BBC News, 2014). Similarly worded subsequent votes in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions were not internationally recognised by states other than Russia and were held after the beginning of armed struggle between the Ukrainian army and armed anti-government militias in these regions. However, the secession votes that took place in 2014 could arguably be a result of long-term political and economic trends in Russia and Ukraine. Evidence from Eastern European countries that were devastated by World War II suggests that the long-run consequences of the Ukraine conflict for political trust will be large (Grosjean, 2014). The Russian economy suffered a larger initial output fall than did the Ukrainian due to the breakup of the Soviet Union, but Ukraine subsequently proved the less able to transform. Neighbouring Poland had a similar output to Ukraine at the fall of communism, but its output was more than twice as high in 2014. By 2013, Russia had a GDP per capita of 24,298 USD, whereas Ukraine, with a similarly educated population and greater geographical proximity to European markets, had a GDP per capita at PPP of only 8,651 (International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook, 2014). The 2008 financial crisis hit Ukraine relatively hard and, unlike Russia, the country also received few benefits from high oil and commodities prices. As well, political instability, the accession of neighbouring countries to the European Union and a consistently poor business climate did not attract foreign direct investment to employ the highly educated population. In 2014, the World Bank Doing Business Surveys (2014) ranked Ukraine 112th out of 189 countries for ease of doing business and Russia 92nd. In Russia, but not in Ukraine, a large expansion of consumer credit before the collapse of oil prices in 2014 led to increases in purchases of consumer durables. To date, social scientists have not attempted to identify precursors of civil conflict using microeconomic data. The existing literature on civil conflict debates whether economic problems or perceived injustices inflicted on excludable groups are the true causes. This “greed versus grievance” hypothesis largely emanates from the pioneering work of Collier and Hoeffler (2002). Collier and Hoeffler examine the duration until civil conflict and find a strongly positive and statistically significant conditional correlation across countries between the implicit opportunity cost of rebellion, as proxied by a country’s initial income and an indicator of the value of known natural resources. In a horse race between these factors and proxy measures of grievance, an index of ethnolinguistic fractionalisation and initial population size, the greed proxies are found to be more statistically significant. Keen (2000) describes how economic motives can exacerbate perceived injustices between identifiable groups, so that greed endogenously generates grievances and rebellion. When the state is weakened and the perceived opportunity cost of engaging in violence falls, further greed-motivated actions can be expected. Because the available microdata do not easily permit distinguishing greed versus grievance motives for the Ukraine conflict, this paper focuses on three specific hypotheses relating to changes in relative socioeconomic and political circumstances of regions within Ukraine and Russia. The first hypothesis to be examined is that young Ukrainian men in Russian-speaking regions may have perceived their economic situation to have deteriorated relative to their former compatriots after the Soviet collapse. If these young men observed relatively large improvements in wellbeing in neighbouring Russian border regions compared to home, they may have become increasingly interested in residing in a Russian-governed province. The WVS data contain a wealth of subjective wellbeing and political information. The evolution of the views of young men in Eastern and Western Ukraine can be compared over time and related to trends in the same outcomes for young men in Russia. The second hypothesis to be examined is that, as well as causing a divergence in socioeconomic outcomes amongst those on either side of the Ukrainian-Russian border, the collapse of the Soviet Union might have resulted in a divergence in political beliefs between Russia and Ukrainian-speaking regions. Alesina and Fuchs-Schündeln (2007) observed that the unification of Germany left former East Germans relatively leftwing, but found a gradual convergence of these Essies from more communist towards more Western and liberal political beliefs. A large literature suggests the important role of historical events in current preferences and beliefs (see, for example Easterly and Levine, 1997; Persson and Tabellini, 2003; Giuliano and Spilimbergo, 2013; Tabellini, 2010; Nunn, 2012; Ananyev and Guriev, 2013). Sociological evidence from the urbanisation and Russification of the Ukrainian SSR from the 1970s does not generally associate these developments with a lessened sense of Ukrainian identity (Krawchenko, 1980; Magocsi, 1996). Nevertheless, Ukrainian independence may have gradually opened an ethnolinguistic and political divide as Russification was gradually undone. The third hypothesis to be examined is that Eastern Ukrainians increasingly despaired of poor institutions and perceived that joining Russia would bring better governance. The International Crisis Group (2014) report, a first by impartial international observers, is suggestive of greed and grievance and institutional motives in the Ukraine conflict. Amongst Ukrainians, perceptions of corruption of the post-Yanukovych administration of Poroshenko and the poor prior records of many high-ranking officials have led to a perception of institutional weakness. The Russian administration made use of this perception of a government unable to make clear plans for minority language rights and for the devolution of some government powers to regional administrations. The ICG (2014) report suggests that Russia began destabilising activities in Eastern Ukraine in early 2014, at a time when the Ukrainian government still had some control over existing far-right military anti-democratic groups including Freedom and the Right Sector. In this view, long-standing population grievances about corruption and poor economic performance were exploited both by Ukrainian nationalists and also by the Russian administration. From the ICG perspective, the Ukrainian government’s 2014 loss of the monopoly on the use of violence in Eastern provinces is ultimately attributable to institutional weakness. The paper proceeds as follows. The “Data and Summary Statistics” section presents the summary statistics comparing subjective responses of adults in border regions of Ukraine to those in Russia and in non-border regions of Ukraine in 1995 and 2011 using WVS data for Ukraine. In the “Estimation” section, multivariate estimation tests the three hypotheses of interest. To summarise, little support is found for any of these hypotheses. Neither trends in the relative wellbeing of young fighting-age men, nor trends in political and institutional perceptions appear to provide a reason why Eastern Ukrainians might increasingly see their interests aligned with those of Russia. The “Conclusions” section offers concluding remarks. Recent economic history of Ukraine is discussed in more detail in Appendix A.",1
58,4,Comparative Economic Studies,28 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-016-0008-y,A Brief Future of Time in the Monopoly of Scientific Knowledge,December 2016,Simplice A. Asongu,Jacinta C. Nwachukwu,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Catch-up is the process through which backward countries successfully narrow the gap in productivity and income with frontier countries. Accordingly, the process has been historically associated with the adoption and transfer of existing techniques from mature industries in leading countries to backward ones. As a complex process, catch-up entails many different aspects, actors and dimensions of an economic system; among them, universities and public research centres have been regarded as central players in recent and past experiences in the catch-up processes (Mazzoleni, 2008). These institutions make up the supporting infrastructure for the acquisition and building of scientific and technological capabilities; provide general and specialized training, equipment and instrumentation, and scientific and technological information; and also contribute to the design of new products and processes (Morrison et al., 2009). Since the 1990s, there has been growing emphasis on the relevance of scientific publications in a knowledge economy (KE), a phenomenon that has been central in the reports of most influential organizations as the engine for long-term economic prosperity (World Bank, 2007; Weber, 2011; Tchamyou, 2015). Europe and North America that have mastered the dynamics of scientific publications have been steering development in the global arena. Other regions like East Asia and Latin America have been responding in calculated steps that underscore the relevance of scientific know-how in their current pursuits of national, regional and local initiatives (Asongu, 2013a). The pattern of Japan has set the course for governments of the Newly Industrialized Asian economies (China, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan) that have begun marching towards knowledge-based economies from product-based economies (Chandra and Yokoyama, 2011). In Africa and the Middle East, KE items have recently been occupying a substantial portion of the agenda on development discussions (Asongu, 2013b). Consistent with Wantchékon (2013), of the 258 impact evaluation studies in 2004, only 11 % included African authors. He has also stressed that, since the year 2002, only 7 % of the 401 African-related publications in the Journal of Development Economics were co-authored by Africans. Accordingly, it is still widely disputed whether universities and public research organizations in developing countries should be encouraged to undertake frontier research (Mazzoleni, 2008). There is, however, a consensus that local-focused research is necessary to support indigenous capabilities and to build national absorptive capacity. The role of universities and public research organizations in catch-up is straight forward. They contribute to development in various ways. First and foremost, their key mission is education and training as shown by the early experiences of Germany in the 19th century and the late experience of Asian countries (Japan, South Korea and Taiwan). The availability of skilled workers and teachers, the migration of technicians from leading countries and the training of students abroad are relevant to enabling conditions for building indigenous technological capabilities (Kim and Nelson, 2000; Mowery and Sampat, 2005; Morrison et al., 2009). Moreover, beside education, universities and public research organizations contribute to a country’s development by undertaking basic and applied research. Consistent with Morrison et al. (2009), what matters today in the catch-up process is that basic and applied research represent, along with other ingredients, a key determinant for building scientific capabilities which are inputs for innovation and growth (Balconi et al., 2010). This assertion is more than ever true today in the context of developing countries. In line with Mazzoleni and Nelson (2007), two reasons have been advanced to substantiate this claim: (i) the changing nature of technology and science and (ii) the impact of globalization on the diffusion of knowledge and the relative importance of scientific actors. With respect to the changing nature of technology and science, in line with Morrison et al. (2009), knowledge as well as products and technologies have a shorter life cycle than that in the past. The distinction between what is a scientific input and technology in several scientific domains is not clear-cut one, which means that scientific discoveries are often intertwined with technological development in a manner that the lag between discoveries and the product development is of quite short span. In addition, new industrial sectors and technologies have stronger scientific underpinnings for the most part. Hence, the two communities are increasingly interacting as is substantially documented in the literature (D’Este and Patel, 2007; Tchamyou, 2015). These studies are consistent with the position that catching-up (or peripheral) countries, along with firms and universities, need to be well equipped to rapidly adapt to changing and evolving external environmental conditions. In order to realize this objective, they have to set-up a scientific infrastructure which would enable them to renew their repertories (or competence), knowledge as well as timely identification of the relevant sources of knowledge. Hence, all these efforts are needed for the nurturing and development of indigenous scientific capabilities, in terms of research activity, training and skills acquisition. On the premise of similar arguments, several approaches have claimed that a third mission of universities is to directly contribute to industrial research (Morrison et al., 2009). In a nutshell, Albuquerque (2000) has articulated four roles of science in the catch-up process. Most notable sources are (i) technological opportunities, (ii) trained researchers, (iii) development and improved research techniques and (iv) tacit and public knowledge. With respect to the other dimensions, forces of globalization have imposed on peripheral countries a new regulatory framework in which they have to operate. Accordingly, access to knowledge is today more restricted due to tight intellectual property rights (IPRs) which further constrain the ability of backward countries to catch-up with the technological and scientific frontiers. Hence, consistent with Mazzoleni and Nelson (2007), within this more stringent regulatory framework, the adoption of external technology has become more difficult and costly. Moreover, similar policies aimed at supporting national industries must comply with more stringent competition rules that prohibit the standardization of industries. In this context, the support for science training, education and infrastructure has become a viable alternative for the promotion of indigenous technological capabilities. In essence, globalization is an indication that the worldwide scientific community is more interconnected that ever. Hence, scientists in less developed countries have more opportunities to interact with their peers in frontier countries; a networking approach which contributes to providing them with access to relevant scientific sources. In the light of the above, there has been little scholarly research on differences in the productivity of universities in terms of contributions to knowledge by means of research publications. Accordingly, we know very little about whether cross-country gaps in scientific productivity are narrowing or expanding. This paper intends to contribute to this latter stream of the literature by providing empirical evidence on catch-up processes in knowledge contribution by means of scientific and technical journal articles (STJA). In addition, the purpose of this inquiry is to assess whether the impressive growth experienced by latecomers has been accompanied by a similar catch-up process in scientific capabilities. There is currently no empirical study that has analysed or modelled global trends in scientific and technical publications. In this paper, three main issues are investigated: the presence or not of catch-up processes, the speeds of the catch-up processes and the time needed for full (100 %) catch-up. The empirical evidence is based on 41 panels which together consist of 99 countries. As has been said, the large dataset allows us to disaggregate countries into fundamental characteristics based on income levels (high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income), legal-origins (English common-law, French civil-law, German civil-law and, Scandinavian civil-law) and regional proximity (South Asia, Europe and Central Asia; East Asia and the Pacific; Middle East and North Africa; and Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. “Intuition and Theoretical Underpinnings” section provides the intuition for the catch-up framework. The data and empirical methodology are discussed in “Data and Methodology” section. “Empirical Analysis” section covers the empirical analysis, and we conclude with “Conclusion and Future Directions” section.",21
59,1,Comparative Economic Studies,03 January 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-016-0017-x,Trust in Government and Willingness to Pay Taxes in Transition Countries,March 2017,John E. Anderson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper addresses the research question of how citizens’ trust in their government institutions affects their willingness to pay (WTP) taxes for public services in the context of transition economies. This issue is particularly relevant for citizens in countries where government institutions have a legacy reflecting a former regime of a planned economy and authoritarianism with strong central government control and limited political and economic freedoms. A taxpaying culture did not exist in the former regimes because the government owned all of the means of production, including enterprises, and extracted resources directly rather than relying directly on taxation. As transition countries have moved to more liberal economic regimes and political freedoms, it is important to consider how citizens’ attitudes and trust in institutions have changed. The evidence provided here on how trust in government institutions affects citizen WTP for public goods and services contributes to advancing the literature on tax morale. Empirical models are estimated in this paper explaining WTP by survey respondents in transition countries for a variety of public goods/services including public education, public health services, combatting climate change, and helping the needy. The empirical models estimated here test the fundamental hypothesis from the literature that higher levels of citizen trust in government institutions is associated with greater WTP for public goods and services. Two-step probit models are estimated which endogenize the trust in government measures and explain WTP additional taxes for various public services. In the first step, probit models are estimated explaining survey respondent’s expressed trust in government institutions as a function of respondent characteristics and country fixed effects. Binary variables indicating trust, or lack thereof, are regressed on individual characteristics and country fixed effects. The estimated likelihood of trust in government institutions from the first-step probit models is then used as explanatory variables in second-step probit models explaining WTP additional taxes for public services. The specific public services modeled include public education, public health services, combatting climate change, and help for the needy. This modeling approach has not yet been used in the tax morale literature. Data used in this study are from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Life in Transition Survey (LITS II) for the year 2010. The LITS II survey provides a cross-sectional data set on a wide range of variables covering 29 countries plus Kosovo and 5 Western European comparator countries. The survey includes a number of specific questions on citizen attitudes and values (Section 3 of the survey), including WTP for a variety of enhanced public services. In addition, there are a number of questions regarding governance (Section 6). These data are used to examine citizens’ trust in government and their expressed WTP taxes for improvements in public services. The paper proceeds as follows. The next sub-section provides an overview of related literature culminating in the testable hypothesis that increased trust is associated with greater WTP for public goods and services. “Life in Transition Survey Data” section describes the LITS II data that is used in the empirical analysis. “Empirical Models of Willingness to Pay Taxes” section reports estimation results for trust in government and WTP for public services. “Summary and Conclusions” section concludes with a summary and policy discussion. This paper is intended to make a contribution to the growing literature on tax morale, with a specific focus on morale in transition countries. In recent years, a number of researchers have examined conditions of tax morale in various country contexts. For example, Lago-Peñas and Lago-Peñas (2010) examined tax morale in Europe, Alm and Torgler (2006) compared tax morale in the USA and Europe, Frey and Torgler (2007) examined morale in Western and Eastern European countries, and Torgler (2005) analyzed morale specifically in Switzerland. Each of these studies contributes to our knowledge of tax morale in the specific countries analyzed, but as yet Torgler (2003) is the only study with an exclusive focus on transition countries. The present paper is intended to fill this gap in the literature. This paper models citizen trust in government and their WTP for a variety of public goods and services. In order to do that, essential aspects of the linkage between trust and WTP are explored based on the existing results in the literature. An essential aspect of a country’s tax morale, and the WTP of citizens for public goods and services, is the underlying trust that citizens have in their government. The issue of trust in government is important because authors such as Fukuyama (1995) and Zak and Knack (2001) have suggested that there is a link between trust and economic growth. Greater trust in society is associated with stronger economic growth. Of course, there are measurement difficulties to be sure, as noted in Glaeser et al. (2000), complex underpinnings as delineated in Uslaner (2002), and institutional/organizational contexts that are important to understand as indicated in LaPorta et al. (1997). Nevertheless, a growing literature has developed with a wide variety of approaches used to analyze the determinants and consequences of trust because trust ultimately affects growth. Not only is growth affected by trust, but there is evidence that trust can smooth over economic fluctuations. Bursian et al. (2012) find that better-governed countries with higher levels of trust and credibility have less severe business cycles. They attribute this finding to the fact that high trust governments are able to defer fiscal consolidation to years when there is higher growth, thus dampening cycles. In a public choice model of trust in government, Clark and Lee (2001) show that up to some level increased trust improves government performance, but beyond that level added trust gives too much latitude to interest groups and negatively affects government performance. Their model is solved for an optimal level of trust, taking advantage of the initial beneficial effect of increasing trust, but avoiding the negative effects of excessive trust. But the ways in which trust enhances economic performance are, as yet, little studied. One exception is the work of Dawid and Deissenberg (2005) who develop a dynamic model in which some private agents believe the policy announcements of government officials. Other agents follow an optimizing strategy that includes the possibility that the announcements may be false. The fraction of agents that believe the announcements is modeled as following a word-of-mouth learning process. They show that, in such a model, the initial number of agents that believe the government announcement and the speed of the learning process are critical in the efficiency outcomes generated. Both country and individual citizen characteristics can affect citizen trust and thereby influence their WTP for public services. Musgrave (1999a, b) and Steurele (1999) provide a set of observations on trust in government from an economic point of view that makes distinctions between individual and collective aspects of trust. Musgrave (1999b) makes a fundamental distinction between micro-level trust between agents in the private sector and macro-level trust in government. He argues that abuse of trust in the private sector is countered in a unilateral way by the victim, with trust supported by a legal framework of guarantees. In the public sector, however, trust involves communal action which makes its development much more difficult. He argues that trust in government is a form of social capital necessary to democracy. In addition to trust being a form of general social capital associated with a society, there are a number of specific country characteristics have an influence on trust. Those characteristics include: overall macroeconomic conditions, government time consistency, the size of government, the extent of government decentralization, and corruption. Musgrave (1999a) connects public opinion on trust in government with general economic conditions, arguing that when a country’s economy is strong, its citizens generally express more trust in their government. Steurele links the likelihood of government reneging on promises with citizen trust, indicating that reputation matters. Phelan (2006) provides a sophisticated model of government reputation in which the type of government (trustworthy or betraying) is not permanent, but follows an exogenous Markov process. His model captures three salient aspects of reputation: (1) governments that betray public trust do so erratically, (2) public trust in government can only be regained after a betrayal, and (3) governments with recent betrayals have a higher probability of betraying than do other governments. Yamamura (2012) examines the relationship between the size of government and citizens’ trust. He finds that larger government negatively affects generalized trust among workers, but has no effect among non-workers in Japan. Ligthart and van Oudheusden (2015) examine the relationship between fiscal decentralization and trust in government. They use repeated cross-country survey data over the period 1994–2007, estimated ordered response models of government trust and decentralization. Their findings indicate that fiscal decentralization increases trust in government. Sollé-Ollé and Sorribas-Navarro (2014) investigate whether corruption erodes trust in government using data on local scandals in Spain. They use survey data collected in 2009 and matching methods to identify the effect of corruption scandals on trust. Their results indicate that corruption has a significant negative effect on trust in local government politicians in Spain. Finally, Torgler (2003) reports that using the World Values Survey data, he finds evidence that tax morale in Central and Eastern European countries is stronger than in former Soviet Union countries. Besides country characteristics that affect trust, there are individual characteristics that affect citizen trust in institutions. Price (2012) provides evidence that both race and employment status of individuals may have impacts on their trust in government. He models the decision to be self-employed finding that among black Americans the decision to be self-employed and the returns from that decision are sensitive to trust in the federal government. Measures of trust in the federal government increase both the likelihood of self-employment and the return to self-employment. Hence, employment status is linked to trust in institutions. Oh and Hong (2012) summarize that the existing literature has found that WTP may be a function of gender, income, education, parental status, and risk perception. In the estimations that follow, a number of these factors will be used, as suggested in the literature. In order to develop a model of trust and WTP, the approach taken here is to use the model of trust in government and citizen WTP that has been developed by Oh and Hong (2012) and use a number of explanatory variables capturing both country and individual characteristics as suggested in the literature review above. The Oh and Hong model incorporates a trust parameter for citizen i, denoted δ
i
 ∈ [0, 1], where a value of the parameter closer to one indicates greater trust. Their concept of δ

i
 is that trust is stochastic, reflecting citizen expectations. That is, δ

i
 captures the subjective probability that a citizen attaches to the government’s announced intention of improving the quantity or quality of a public good or service. If δ

i
 is near zero, the citizen’s stated WTP is lower than the desired WTP to support the government’s announced project. The citizen is being rational with this stated WTP because in the citizen’s experience, the expected change in the quantity of the public good is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of income required to pay for the improvement. Oh and Hong derive an expression for citizen WTP for an (ex post) improvement in the public good (self-assessed) using a conventional expenditure function approach and show that for greater values of the trust parameter, WTP is higher. Hence, the fundamental testable hypothesis flowing out of that model is that greater trust in institutions increases WTP. The size of the citizen’s WTP is determined by preference parameters of the individual in that model. For example, the smaller the person’s elasticity of substitution between private goods and the public good, the less likely the person will be to support paying additional taxes for an enhanced level of the public good. Of course, survey information does not provide estimates of the elasticity of substitution, but it does provide a number of personal characteristics that may affect WTP, as indicated in the literature review. In what follows, models of WTP are estimated using both individual characteristics contributing to trust and country characteristics that have been shown to be relevant in the literature cited above.",18

The boom phase before the 2007 global financial crisis was followed by a deep recession and, afterwards, by a sluggish resumption of economic growth, the 2011 euro area sovereign debt crisis further contributing to a slight slowdown. In addition, the large capital inflows in the region in the period preceding the 2007 crisis clearly unwound after the 2007 global financial crisis and the 2011 euro area sovereign debt crisis. Our paper adds to the debate on the role played by FDI in the economic growth process. On one hand, FDI inflows (referring here to long-term capital investment such as the purchase or construction of machinery, buildings, or whole manufacturing plantsFootnote 3), have been considered a somewhat natural factor of the catching-up process of CEECs with the old EU Member States.Footnote 4 Developments in growth theory have confirmed the beneficial impact of FDI inflows, improvements in technology, productivity and efficiency being found to be crucial for growth (Lim, 2001). Additionally, it has been shown that FDI contributed to technical progress in host countries through efficiency “spillovers” (for instance, via the linkages between multinational corporation affiliates and their local suppliers and customers) (Lall, 1980). On the other hand, there is the belief that prior to the 2007 global financial crisis, the growth pattern in the region was excessively dependent on capital inflows that have led to the built up of unsustainable macroeconomic and financial imbalances and of large vulnerabilities (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2007). In this line, a pattern of growth excessively dependent on capital inflows has been judged to be undesirable (EBRD, 2009). These considerations raise several questions that we seek to answer through our analysis. What are the drivers of FDI inflows in CEECs? How important is FDI for economic growth in the region? Has the economic growth – FDI link been impacted by the 2007 and 2011 crises? Through a general-to-specific approach, we show that FDI inflows in CEECs are explained by a large variety of domestic and external factors. Among the domestic drivers, past FDI, human capital, market size, infrastructure, competitiveness, the corporate tax system, risk premium, trade openness, geographical proximity to Western Europe, the EU accession, and progress in the implementation of structural reforms are key. On the side of external drivers, macroeconomic and financial developments in the euro area, the global risk environment and global macroeconomic prospects are crucial; the “sensitivity” of FDI inflows to developments in the euro area is largely justified by the high exposure, through trade and financial channels, of CEECs to the euro area. Our results are in line with those of the existing empirical literature. The originality of our analysis consists in the use of panel data general-to-specific modelling that allows us to avoid ad-hoc decisions, the final model being selected from a large set of variables. Moreover, our paper adds to the existing literature illustrating a positive impact of FDI on economic growth. The growth potential of recipient countries is crucial for attracting FDI, but, at the same time, FDI contributes further to enhancing economic growth in recipient economies. The span of time of our analysis incorporates the 2007 global financial crisis and the 2011 euro area sovereign debt crisis, events that could have disturbed the existing relationship between FDI inflows and economic growth. We apply a dynamic panel data technique and show that, during the 2007 crisis, FDI inflows not only continue to have a positive impact on economic growth but this positive impact becomes even larger; however, this no longer holds for the 2011 crisis period during which the impact of FDI inflows on economic growth becomes non-significant. Based on our findings, we consider that, in the current context of relatively low levels of FDI in CEECs and of a sluggish recovery in the euro area, host countries in the region could further encourage, to a certain extent, the entry of FDI flows so as to foster economic growth. The remainder of our paper is organised as follows. “FDI and Growth in Emerging Europe Before, During and After the Onset of the 2007 Crisis” section presents some stylised facts, whilst an overview of the literature is presented in “Overview of Literature” section. In “Econometric Strategy and Data” section there is a description of the econometric model and the data, as well as of the empirical results. The last section summarises the main conclusions.",17
59,1,Comparative Economic Studies,09 January 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-016-0015-z,Labour and Financial Crises: Is Labour Paying the Price of the Crisis?,March 2017,Remi Bazillier,Boris Najman,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the context of the financial crisis, one of the questions often asked not only by academics and policy makers, but also by the man on the street is the following: are the workers going to be the ones who are hit the hardest by the crisis? In other words, is labour going to pay the price for the crisis? There are several reasons to believe that labour may be mainly targeted by a financial crisis. In a crisis, the workers’ bargaining power becomes weaker (Harrison, 2002), due not only to the fast increase in unemployment (ILO and IMF, 2010), but also to entrepreneurs’ expectations. The crisis creates a “labour run”, where layoffs are widely expected. Another explanation may be that labour is less mobile than capital, so that while capital can be easily reallocated to other sectors, regions or countries, labour cannot. Social protection plays a key role smoothing the adverse consequences of financial crises on inequality and poverty (Jenkins et al., 2012). In most countries, social protection is financed through labour income taxes or social contributions mainly (Barriento, 2008). If financial crises alter the labour share, it may also have adverse consequences on the capacity of States to finance social protection and therefore to deal with the distributional impact of financial crises. It is therefore crucial to have a closer look at the financial crises’ impact on the labour share, beyond its impact on income distribution. This paper addresses the influence of banking and currency crises on the labour share empirically. This research was largely motivated by the empirical work of Isaak Diwan (2001). Using a database of the labour share from 1972 to 2000, Diwan shows that before an exchange rate crisis, the labour share increased, and after the crisis it dropped dramatically, without ever reaching its pre-crisis level again. Maarek et al. (2013) recently show that currency crises lower the aggregate manufacturing labour share by 2 points on average, using manufacturing sectoral panel data for 20 countries which have experienced currency crises. They highlight two types of effects: within-sector changes induced by modifications in the relative bargaining power of workers, and composition effects induced by structural change and show that the effects are driven by within-sector changes. We propose to extend the analysis by showing the impact of both currency and banking crises. In the light of the current financial crisis, it is important to provide empirical evidence based on previous experiences of banking crises also. These crises are more severe in terms of magnitude and length (Kaminsky et al., 1999). The impact on GDP is always negative, contrary to currency crises which may have positive effects, at least in the medium run. Banking crises are also more often systemic and it is much more difficult to protect from them. However, it should be noted that banking crises and currency crises often occur simultaneously. There is an emerging literature studying the relation between financial crises and income inequality (see Bazillier and Hericourt (2016) for a review). Rajan (2010) argues that rising inequality in the past three decades explain the increased pressure for affordable housing finance which led to the lending boom observed prior to the crisis. Kumhof et al. (2015) show theoretically how increased inequality may explain a rapid increase in leverage which possibly leads to crises. However, Bordo et al. (2012) show empirically that rising income concentration plays no significant role in explaining credit growth. Their estimations cover 14 countries for the 1920–2008 period. These papers mainly focus on the causes of financial crises and not their consequences, which is the purpose of this paper. Concerning these consequences, there is a large literature explaining the determinants of the heterogeneous impact of financial crises on output (see for instance Berkmen et al. (2009), or Rose et al. (2011) for the current crisis, or Mishra et al. (2003) and Eichengreen and Rose (1998) on banking crises). Artha et al. (2011) show that the impact on output largely depends on labour market flexibility. However, these papers mainly focus on the consequences in terms of output. Surprisingly, there are few papers on the distributional impact of financial crises. Baldacci et al. (2002) identify four channels through which financial crises affect poverty and income distribution: the output effect which may have indirect effects on income distribution, relative price changes, fiscal retrenchment and changes in assets. We show that banking and currency crises have very different impacts on the labour share. We find that currency crises affect the labour share negatively, while banking crises primarily affect capital income, at least during the year of the crisis. In the three years following a currency crisis, the labour share tends to be reduced by around 2% per year on average. We propose two sets of estimations: the first one includes both developing and developed countries and the second one focuses on OECD countries. For OECD countries, the effect of systemic banking crises appears to be greater than in non-OECD. We find a positive effect during the year of the crisis, followed by a negative effect in the following years. This may be explained by the larger share of the banking and financial sector in developed countries, which makes the banking crises more severe. The paper is organised as follows. In the following section, we identify the transmission channels of banking and currency crises on the labour share, focusing on their influence on the bargaining power of workers. In the Empirical analysis section, we present the database and the empirical strategy followed by the Empirical results section and the last section concludes the article.",8
59,1,Comparative Economic Studies,03 January 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-016-0016-y,Delving into the Secular Stagnation Hypothesis: A Firm-Level Analysis of the Private Sector’s Excess Savings in Advanced Economies,March 2017,Rodrigo Pérez Artica,Leandro Brufman,Lisana Belén Martinez,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The pace of the global economic recovery in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 triggered debate over the current stage the role macroeconomic policy should play in order to ignite economic growth. One of the most conspicuous hypotheses in that discussion claims that the developed economies have entered an era of “secular stagnation,” a central feature of this being a persistent excess of aggregate savings over investment. According to Summers (2014), advanced economies experienced various structural changes over the last decades which led to both a substantial increase in the tendency to save and a reduction in the tendency to invest. The equilibrium real interest rate has fallen consistently even into negative levels, preventing the effective real interest rate from reaching its equilibrium level. Given this impossibility to equate savings and investment by using the price channel, the savings–investment equilibrium tends to be the consequence of reducing the output level. As a matter of fact, national accounts statistics reveal that an excess of gross savings over capital formation has shown up over the last decades in many developed economies, not only at the aggregate level, but within the non-financial corporate sector as well. As a number of recent studies claim (IMF, 2006, 2015; OECD, 2007, 2015), this spurt of corporate excess savings may result from several factors having a positive impact on earnings and a negative effect over investment. Besides, the lower propensity to pay dividends (Fama and French, 2001) also pushes in the same direction. This research also suggests that non-financial corporations used the excess savings (ES) mainly in three ways: financial deleveraging, cash accumulation, and mergers and acquisitions. Adding to the significance of this ES, the increase in corporate liquidity stemming from it played a key role in the buildup of the financial instability which led to the banking disruption in 2007. Pozsar (2011) claims that such liquidity held by non-financial firms, and managed ultimately by institutional cash pools, provided a substantial source of demand for the assets created by the deregulated financial system. This demand was driven by two factors: on the one hand, the priority given by investment mandates for safety and liquidity of capital; on the other, the relative shortage of safe assets meeting such mandates, namely guaranteed bank deposits and US Treasuries (Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2010). The need for a better understanding of corporate ES is all the more relevant given its tight connection to the sluggish economic growth in the advanced economies. On the one hand, the growing trend of corporate ES seems to have accelerated since 2008. Although housing investment fell particularly abruptly, business capital formation accounted for most of the decline immediately after 2008, having recovered only mildly ever since. The fragile corporate investment resumption after the crisis contrasts with increasing profits in most advanced economies, and buoyant equity markets in some of them. This apparent paradox is referred to as an “investment puzzle” by some observers (Furman, 2015), and it is often mentioned as the main cause of the slow recovery in economic activity, employment, and even productivity.Footnote 1
 In spite of its growing relevance, there is no research directly exploring the longer-term pattern of corporate capital formation and excess savings at the firm level over the last few decades. This paper aims to fill that gap and contribute to the literature by analyzing the corporate ES using firm-level financial data for a sample of non-financial firms from 20 advanced economies over the period 1990–2014. We consider its long-term trajectory over the last decades to determine whether an upward trend can be found before and after the Great Recession and discuss what firm characteristics explain the ES observed in aggregate-level studies. Using firm-level data becomes a valuable approach in order to determine whether this savings and investment pattern is widespread enough, or whether it is driven by a rather small number of large firms. It also helps identifying different patterns of savings and investment for firms in diverse industries, segments of size, profitability, etc. And finally, it allows investigating which firm-level factors (varying across firms) correlate with and thus help explain the increase in the ES. We provide evidence for a broad-based, long-term trend of corporate ES growth, which lays the underpinnings for a further development of the secular stagnation hypothesis. Moreover, we show that this trend goes along with a protracted decline of capital expenditures and that both trends were present even before the Great Recession. First, we show and formally test for the existence of a trend in the ES and its components (gross savings and capital formation), and consider how three applications of the ES (debt reduction, acquisitions, and liquidity accumulation) evolved over time. Second, we propose an explanation based on three factors. In particular, we seek to examine the role played by credit constraints, volatility in the business environment, and firm growth prospects in shaping the observed aggregate trend. The analysis of firm-level data confirms the existence of an increasing trend of the ES for the total sample and for 9 of the 10 size deciles. This trend was accompanied by a decline in capital formation, a decrease in debt, and increases in both the share of non-operating and liquid assets. The econometric results show that: (i) the ES is connected to financial constraints since financially constrained firms showed significantly higher ES than other firms; (ii) the ES was significantly higher for companies operating in a more volatile environment; (iii) the ES was higher for firms with the weakest growth prospects; and (iv) the increase in ES and the fall of gross capital formation is robust to alternative specifications. Notwithstanding the lack of specific research dealing with the corporate ES, it is worth acknowledging a number of studies which aim to explain the investment slump immediately after the financial breakdown of 2007/2008, and the capital formation drought since the end of the financial crisis in 2009. As we discuss more extensively in our theoretical section, the impact of the credit collapse over firm investment has been addressed in several studies in the years following the banking crisis of 2007–2008. For instance, Campello et al. (2011b) survey over 1000 chief financial officers in order to assess the impact of the crisis for financially constrained firms on their corporate spending plans. They find that constrained firms planned sharper reductions in tech and capital expenditures, and employment. Moreover, Campello et al. (2011a) consider the influence of drawing on credit lines over firm investment during the financial crisis. They do not find a significant relation on average but a positive impact of credit lines surfaces for firms with high internal funding. On the other hand, some authors claim that the economic significance of this causal link between impaired access to financing and corporate investment remains negligible, while other channels drove most of the investment plunge during the year immediately following the crisis. Kahle and Stulz (2013), in effect, reveal how the demand and uncertainty shocks, which led to a contraction of credit demand during 2009, turned out to be more important sources of the investment shrinkage. Regarding the factors that hold back capital expenditures since 2009, the IMF (2015) and OECD (2015) agree that capital formation deviated only slightly from what could be expected given the observed weakness of overall economic activity. As a consequence, the primary cause of the investment underperformance since 2009 boils down to demand shortage. In addition, evidence shows that financial constraints and policy uncertainty played a relevant role in hindering investment in some countries. Sectors relying more on external funding and those whose equity prices respond more to aggregate uncertainty have cut back further on investment. Similar conclusions are drawn in studies addressing the investment drought in specific European countries (IMF, 2014a, b, c). Thus far, the literature has focused on the investment decline during and after the crisis, and turned to financial constraints, and demand and policy uncertainty shocks looking for the causes of this decline. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the longer-term, firm-level trajectory of the investment decline counterpart: the excess of corporate savings over capital formation. Additionally, we intend to investigate which factors have contributed to its growing trend. While doing this, we concentrate on the causal effect of other long-standing and broadly extended changes in the economic performance of mature economies over the last decades: the rise of firm-level volatility and the weakening of business growth prospects. The structure of the paper is as follows. “Data and Construction of Variables” section describes the database, defines the main variables of interest, and shows some basic descriptive statistics. In “Excess Savings and Its Applications Over the Last Two Decades” section, we statistically test for the existence of a trend in the ES and describe the time evolution of the ES, its components (gross savings and capital formation), and its main applications. “Existing Literature and Hypotheses Building” section provides a brief literature review that allows framing the analysis and identifying three main testable hypotheses regarding the factors which drive the growth of the ES. “Methodology” section gives a detailed description of the methodology by which these hypotheses are tested. The results are presented in “Results” section, and its implications are discussed in “Conclusions” section.",1
59,1,Comparative Economic Studies,09 February 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-017-0022-8,The Impact of Regime Type on Food Consumption in Low Income Countries,March 2017,Kolleen J. Rask,Norman Rask,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Political regimes wield considerable influence over the welfare of the poor. Evaluating this influence requires us to consider both the differential political incentive structures across regimes and the actual methods of welfare measurement. We begin with a brief discussion of food consumption as a measure of welfare, then consider two competing theories of the impact of political regime on food consumption by the poor. Theoretical and data availability problems have been identified with the use of various welfare measures, including Gini coefficients, income quintiles, and health-related statistics such as infant mortality. Recognizing these limitations, Blaydes and Kayser (2011) focus their work on analyzing caloric consumption, using the widely available measure of average per capita daily food consumption as a proxy for evaluating the welfare of the poor and positing that increases in average caloric consumption cannot be centered on the rich, who have already approached their biological limits. Turning to the question of regime type, they find that democracies and hybrid regimes outperform autocracies in using economic growth to improve average caloric consumption, which is interpreted as helping the poor. Democracies can therefore gain popularity by redistributing the benefits of that growth to the poor without being seen as obviously taking from the rich, whereas autocracies have less need to curry favor. The authors then subdivide food consumption calories into those derived from animal sources (“higher quality calories”) and other calories. They conclude that “democracies outperform both hybrid regimes and autocracies… in converting growth into higher quality calories from animal sources” (abstract). Other authors, including Thompson (2010), Bellemare (2011), Lagi et al. (2011), and Capeau and Verwimp (2011), for example, show that the manipulation of food prices constitutes an important component of authoritarian control, while Gutner (2002) examines the role of food subsidies in offsetting the political ramifications of curtailing political liberties. Ballard-Rosa (2016) explicitly considers welfare of the poor in terms of food consumption. In this analysis, the author suggests that democracies must cater to rural voters, which requires higher prices for food producers, while autocrats’ fear of urban unrest promotes policies of lower food prices, which they will maintain even in the face of international default. In this case, poor urban consumers enjoy better diets under autocracies. Bowman (2002), using two 15-year timespans, considers the impact of democracy on food consumption and concludes that, while long-term democracies improve caloric consumption, shorter terms of democratic regimes lower consumption. The resulting U-curve describing the relationship between food consumption and years of democratic rule is explained by both the turmoil surrounding the transition to a newly democratic regime (hurting initial consumption levels) and the fact that “autocratic regimes are often quite capable of delivering material benefits to the masses” (p. 750). While this analysis provides some evidence for autocracies providing sustenance to the poor, it does not explicitly consider income as a variable. We approach our test of these competing theories by incorporating and extending the previous work in the following ways. First, we begin with the Blaydes and Kayser (2011) analysis in which food consumption calories are explicitly divided into two categories: those derived from animal products and all others. We further subdivide the animal product category using a wide range of disaggregated values reflecting the actual diversity of food as measured by the resources imbedded in the food itself. This detailed, continuous, and nuanced measure of the quality of food consumption is known as cereal equivalent (CE) values. We adopt the same polity measure used by Blaydes and Kayser (2011) and ask: do democracies outperform autocracies in terms of providing basic needs to the poor, as measured by their diets in terms of cereal equivalents? Next we explore the prevalence of administrative food pricing (and subsidy) as suggested by Ballard-Rosa (2016) and others. We extend the analysis by using farm gate pricing applied to the same disaggregated animal product categories identified by cereal equivalent values to test the effect of product prices on food consumption. In the following two sections we describe this CE measure and discuss the underlying data. In “Analysis of Diet Changes” we examine the relationship between CE food consumption and per capita income, and then test the relative diets of people in poor countries based on the type of political regime, holding income levels constant. Finally, we offer concluding remarks.",

In this note I review elements of these recent experiences, focusing in particular on the Swiss case. I do this in search of a preliminary answer to the question: do these developments represent the premise of a full emancipation from the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)? Central banks’ motivations for going below zero have been diverse. The clearest cases are probably those of Denmark and Switzerland. In these two countries, the unambiguous goal was to protect an exchange rate parity. The Danisk Krone has been linked with the Euro (and before that with the Mark) for decades. When the credibility of this link came into question in January 2015, the Central Bank of Denmark (DNB) decided to impose a negative rate on commercial banks deposits with the stated objective of discouraging speculation by decreasing the expected return on capital flowing into Denmark. With four successive cuts over a 2.5 week period, the interest on bank deposits reached −75 bp by mid-February 2015. The pressure on the kronor diminished thereafter permitting the beginning of a reversal – a move up to −65 bp – in early 2016. The Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) decision at the end of December 2014 was of the same nature. A negative interest rate on bank deposits of −25 bp was announced on December 18 (but the decision was to be effective only 1 month later) with the goal of alleviating the pressure building up on the exchange rate floor relative to the Euro that had been in effect since September 2011. A further decrease of the rate on bank reserves to −75 bp was announced on January 15, 2015, together with the abolition of the floor. Here, the objective was to reinstate an interest rate differential with respect to the eurozone, in particular, to limit the appreciation of the CHF that was viewed as the inevitable result of abandoning the floor. The constraint of the ZLB is particularly acute for a small open economy with a safe haven currency such as Switzerland. The ability of the SNB to maintain a negative interest differential, notably relative to rates on Euro denominated assets, is critical to deliver an appropriate exchange rate. Historically, this interest rate “bonus,” which is the premium on the insurance against tail events that is bundled with a CHF investment, was of an average of 170 bp for the 3 month Libor before the crisis (Figure 1). By compressing short maturity rates toward zero, the ZLB makes it impossible to maintain the interest rate differential at the required level, a condition that amplifies the appreciation pressures accompanying the occurrence of a crisis (which exacerbates the demand for the safe haven). The ZLB thus represents a particularly severe constraint on Swiss monetary policy and the stakes of removing or alleviating this constraint are correspondingly elevated. As a complement to this assessment, let us note that the domestic economy at the beginning of 2015 was healthy with expected growth above potential and a booming residential housing sector. That is, the state of the Swiss domestic economy did not justify lower interest rates; the motivation for the push below zero was not the search for a monetary stimulus to aggregate demand. The Swiss negative interest differential (interest rates in percent) Exchange rate considerations were less dominant, although also present, in the three other cases of negative policy rates. In the EMU, Japan and Sweden the stated intention was to fight an undershooting of the inflation target (the exchange rate was one of the channels through which the policy move was expected to develop its effect). The ECB moved its deposit rate into negative territory in mid-2014 already to “underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflationary expectations” (Draghi – 2014). The ECB further lowered its deposit rate to −20 bp in September 2014 and −30 bp in December 2015. The Riksbank (−10 bp in February 2015 followed by further cuts to −25 bp in March 2015, −35 bp in July 2015 and −50 bp in February 2016) and the BOJ (−10 bp in January 2016) used similar wording. In the case of the Riksbank, negative rates were announced simultaneously with the introduction of Quantitative Easing (QE). The aim was “safeguarding the role of the inflation target as a nominal anchor for price setting and wage formation.” After several years of QE, the BOJ imposed negative rates with the goal of strengthening aggregate demand and promoting an inflation rate closer to the stated quantitative target of 2%. The goal of delivering a “traditional” monetary stimulus with the hope of reviving aggregate demand and reaching an inflation target distinguishes these three cases from those of the Danish and Swiss central banks. A distinctive characteristic of the experience of the five countries with negative rates is that they have had no impact on the remuneration on retail bank deposits. This appears to be the result of the reluctance of commercial banks to adversely affect their retail customers for fear of severing client relationships. It is also partly a result of the policy design by the corresponding central banks. The precise design of the negative rate policy is country specific depending on the peculiarities of each central bank’s monetary operations. But it is also a function of the impact the adopted measure is likely to have on the profitability and, potentially, on the fragility of the banking system. Alleviating the burden imposed by negative rates on banks is likely necessary for jurisdictions where the imposition of negative rates has been preceded by a significant injection of liquidity (see Cecchetti and Schoenholtz, 2016). Whether it is possible to alleviate the burden on the banking sector without at the same time weakening or negating the potential impact of negative rates on the economy depends on the intentions of the corresponding central bank. The Swiss case is again the clearest in this respect. The injection of liquidity preceding the imposition of negative rates has been the largest as a share of GDP with the SNB balance sheet approaching 100% of GDP. Since the transmission of the negative rates to bank credits was not essential given the exclusive exchange rate focus of the measure, under the fulfilled condition that marginal interest rates were guided to the desired level, exempting banks from the interest charge was relatively innocuous. This resulted in the SNB imposing a low rate of −75 bp on banks’ deposits at the central bank with a large exemption threshold of twenty times required reserves.Footnote 1 It effectively meant that banks collectively were subject to negative rates for only a fraction of their deposits at the SNB; in February 2016, on reserves of CHF 170 bil. for total deposits amounting CHF 473 bil. Without this exemption, the interest payment from the banking sector to the SNB would have amounted to a substantial fraction of normal banking sector profits. For the ECB and Japan who had previously engaged in significant QE operations but whose goal for the negative rates was broader, the trade-off is more delicate and it is not clear that the objectives of maximizing the policy impact are compatible with the perceived need to limit the interest burden imposed on banks by negative rates on reserve balances. It is worth saying a few words on the public reaction to this novel policy measure. Negative nominal interest rates are counterintuitive even when negative real rates have been historically frequent. The decision of the SNB to go negative has generated a large amount of mostly acrimonious discussion. The general public has difficulties understanding the logic of negative interest rates. They are viewed as “unnatural” and a measure of financial repression. How can it be that a saver is not rewarded for postponing consumption? Indeed, the world must be upside down when the lender must remunerate the borrower! The advent of negative rates has exacerbated the complaints of savers who see themselves as being shortchanged in the era of ultra-low rates. The pension fund lobby has been particularly vocal. By imposing negative rates, it is said that the National Bank makes it impossible for pension funds to reach their return objectives. The public interest would require exempting pension funds, in particular the public social security fund, from the interest charge. Another dimension of the public discussion has revolved around the exemption policy. The private bank (wealth managers) lobby has been the loudest. The increase in liquidity since the crisis has been differentially distributed among the three groups of banks represented in Figure 2 with the “other banks,” dominated by the private wealth managers, outpacing both the cantonal banks and the big banks. This can be seen as the advent of “cash in CHF at the SNB” as a new “ultra-safe” asset class in the context of the crisis, particularly popular among the wealthy and conservative investor-clients of these banks. As a result of this development, the definition of the exemption threshold as a multiple of required reserves did not relieve the private wealth managers as much as their competitors, and they are bearing the largest share of the burden of the policy. Given their reluctance to transmit the interest charge to their clients in a context of heightened competition, the burden potentially amounted to a significant fraction of their normal profits. Of course this is not in contradiction with the intentions of the policy with these banks being thus led to propose investment alternatives to their clients (notably in other currencies) and to incentivize them to choose these alternatives by passing on, or threatening to pass on, the negative rates. But the situation has occasionally been exploited by competitors with free margins to attract new accounts leading to cries of unfairness and an intense debate and lobbying effort. Given the technical nature of the issue and the general attitude toward negative rates, the claims of unfairness have attracted a certain degree of sympathy. All this is relevant because, in a direct democracy, even legitimate economic ideas have little future beyond a certain level of unpopularity. Commercial banks differentially impacted. MRR minimum reserve requirement In this note, I address the question whether these developments portend the beginning of the end of the ZLB. There are two related elements of the response to this question. First, one must address the issue of how low one can go? The end of the ZLB is in sight only if one can go substantially lower than the currently observed lower bound. After all, if the latter, −75 bp, turns out to be the limit, the margin of maneuvering for central banks exposed to permanently low rates is unlikely to be sufficient. This is notably the case in Switzerland where restoring the normal interest rate differential when the major central banks have their policy rates at zero would require a larger move below zero by the SNB. But this is also true more generally because the more important impact on long rates is bound to be only a fraction of the cut in the policy rate. The second issue to be addressed is whether the transmission mechanism remains intact under zero. Again, the demise of the ZLB would appear to be near only if the transmission mechanism works symmetrically above and below zero, or at least if it is not significantly weakened when going negative. I look at these two questions in turn.",2

His Conservative Party’s outright and largely unexpected victory in the May 2015 general election meant that one key manifesto pledge would have to be implemented. The UK would embark on a renegotiation of the terms of its EU membership and these new terms would then be submitted to a popular vote, a “remain or leave” referendum. He also promised that voting would take place before the end of 2017 (Copsey and Haughton, 2014). This renegotiation concluded in February 2016 with an agreed “new settlement”, and the referendum was set for June 23, 2016. The Leave campaign won with about 52% of the votes. A new Prime Minister, Theresa May, took office twenty days later, pledging to make the UK the first country ever to leave the EU. Why should economists pay attention to the British exit from the EU (“Brexit”)? Brexit is one of the multiple crises currently affecting the largest experiment of voluntary economic integration in human history. The European integration project faces a financial crisis, a debt crisis, an economic crisis, a Greek crisis, a populism crisis, a productivity crisis, a terrorism crisis, a refugee crisis and a democratic deficit crisis, to name a few. But the Brexit crisis is an intrinsically different type of crisis. Brexit raises fundamental questions about the existence of the integration project. This was a one-way process towards a well-defined goal, but that “new settlement” had already changed the notion of ever closer union. Brexit is different because it asks questions about the value of being in the union, about the value of membership, about the value of being integrated and interconnected in the world, about the dynamics and distribution of the benefits and costs of trying to do so and about the type of integration that can sustain (and hopefully increase) the substantial benefits we have seen since the start of the project in the 1950s (Eichengreen, 2008). These are existential questions, and they must be answered if the EU is to be after this crisis. In this paper, we try to answer two main questions: did EU membership significantly affect UK economic performance? And if so, how? We believe these are important questions. If EU membership turns out to have no discernible economic effect, the case for membership would be weaker. However, because of the chequered history of the UK–EU relation, if one can show that European integration played a role there, it is likely it played a substantial role everywhere else. We first briefly discuss the historical context in which the European economic integration project took-off to assess to what extent one can claim that delayed membership was relatively costly to the UK and whether the UK joining the EU was ultimately beneficial. We argue that a fundamental yet relatively unappreciated feature of the relationship between Britain and the European Union is a turning point. The ratio of UK’s per capita GDP to the EU founding members’ declines steadily from 1945 until around 1970 but has been relatively stable since. Such prominent structural break (which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously detected and analysed) suggests substantial benefits from EU membership especially considering that, by sponsoring an overpowered integration model, Britain joined too late, at a bad moment in time and at an avoidably larger cost. The conventional wisdom is that this turning point occurs in the mid-1980s when Mrs Thatcher implements her package of far-reaching structural reforms (Walters, 1986; Minford, 2015). This view retains currency despite economists’ detailed scrutiny (Bean and Symons, 1989; Broadberry and Wagner, 1996; Layard and Nickell, 1989).Footnote 1 In this paper, we ask whether econometric evidence is supportive of such view. We find it is not. We examine an alternative hypothesis: the turning point occurs when the UK joined the European Union. Structural break tests provide substantial econometric support for this alternative view. If EU membership has made a difference, the next question is how? To address this issue, we discuss the key potential mechanisms through which benefits from membership took root (chiefly finance, foreign direct investment and trade). The chosen mode of integration (deep instead of shallow) played a key role. While international trade may have been the most important driver until the Single Market in the early 1990s, foreign investment may well have taken its place since. Is it possible to reconcile or relate Mrs Thatcher’s reforms and EU membership in terms of understanding the great British reversal? We believe these are somewhat complementary explanations. The intuition we provide is that EU accession signals the prominence of business groups that wanted to compete at the high-tech end of the common European market against those business groups that preferred the comparative advantage-driven mostly former colonies (Commonwealth) markets. These pro-Europe business groups later become the constituency that supported Mrs Thatcher’s reforms. Without such support, we argue those reforms would not have been nearly as effective. This paper is organized as follows. Section “Why Did Britain Join the EU?” discusses the British relative economic decline and investigates what may have been the main causes of its reversal. It presents structural breaks econometric evidence that favours EU membership instead of the Mrs Thatcher’s structural reforms explanation. In Section “How and Why Did Britain Benefit from EU Integration?”, we examine various channels through which EU membership may have benefitted the UK economy (chiefly finance, FDI and trade). Section “A Political Economy Explanation” presents a political economy story that links the UK’s EU membership to the design, implementation and (more importantly) effectiveness of Mrs. Thatcher’s reforms. Section “Conclusions” concludes.",4
59,2,Comparative Economic Studies,15 February 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-017-0020-x,Currency Unions and Regional Trade Agreements: EMU and EU Effects on Trade,June 2017,Reuven Glick,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There has been considerable disagreement concerning the magnitude of the trade-stimulating effect of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in Europe, or indeed of any currency union in which member countries use the same currency. In earlier work, Glick and Rose (2002) estimated how the amount of trade between two countries was affected by whether they were in a currency union. Using a gravity model specification, they explained bilateral trade as a function of the GDP income of the two countries in each pair, the distance between them, and a host of other variables that may facilitate trade, such as sharing a border, a common language, membership in a common regional trade agreement, or a similar colonial history. To this specification, they added a measure of whether or not two countries share a common currency or have a stable one-for-one interchange of their currencies. Using a panel of 200 countries from 1948 to 1997, before the establishment of the EMU, they found that bilateral trade approximately doubled after a pair of countries formed a currency union and halved when a currency union dissolved. The relevance of this estimate for the EMU was questioned on the grounds that it largely reflects the experiences of less developing countries in multilateral currency unions or in “hub and spoke” relations with a large anchor country. In fact, influential papers, such as Micco et al. (2003), Bun and Klaassen (2007), Baldwin and Taglioni (2007), Baldwin et al. (2008), and Berger and Nitsch (2008), have estimated that EMU improved trade on the order of 15% or less, much smaller than the estimates in Glick and Rose (2002) suggest. Glick and Rose (2016) extended their earlier analysis to include the effect of currency unions on international trade through 2013, a period which includes the introduction of the EMU, which began with 11 member countries in 1999 and has since expanded to 19 members. To account for the possibility that trade effects for EMU countries may differ from that for other currency unions, which typically involve a developing country, they distinguished between the trade effects of EMU and non-EMU currency union pairs. They also made use of advances in econometric methodology.Footnote 1 Their preferred methodology – a panel approach with both dyadic and time-varying exporter and importer fixed effects on a long broad data set – led them to conclude that the effect of EMU on intra-European trade was still substantive, on the order of 50%.Footnote 2
 Of course, European trade has been affected by other efforts to foster regional economic integration, notably the elimination of tariffs and quotas and implementation of free trade arrangements through membership in the European Union (EU), which preceded establishment of the EMU. Since EU membership is a prerequisite for joining EMU, it is reasonable to make efforts to disentangle the effects of integration through adoption of a common currency and through regional trade arrangements. In their earlier work, Glick and Rose (2002, 2016) controlled for membership in regional trade arrangements by inclusion of an aggregated measure that captures the average effect of all regional trade agreements (RTAs). However, by aggregating all such arrangements together they do not allow for possible heterogeneity in the effects of different arrangements, such as the EU. This paper specifically distinguishes between the separate effects of EU and other RTAs so as to explicitly analyze how membership in EU affects the trade effects of EMU. The paper also assesses the extent to which the effects of EMU and EU on trade flows differ between older and newer members. As shown in Table 1, the present-day EU is the result of increasing trade and other economic integration through successive enlargements since the 1950s. The original six members – Belgium, France, (West) Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands – created the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1958.Footnote 3 The first enlargement occurred in 1973 when the UK, Ireland, and Denmark joined. Greece followed in 1981, and Portugal and Spain in 1986. Austria, Finland, and Sweden became members in 1995 of the renamed European Community (EC), later branded as the European Union (EU). By far the biggest enlargement took place in May 2004 when 10 more countries – Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia – all became members. Bulgaria and Romania followed in 2007, and the newest member, Croatia, joined in 2013.Footnote 4
 Thirteen, roughly half, of the current membership of the EU joined after 2003. Thus far, seven of these thirteen countries have also joined EMU. As most of these newer members are transition economies that differed significantly from the original members in terms of their economic structure and development, there is reason to believe that the impact of EU and EMU entry might differ as well. Moreover, of those who subsequently joined the EMU, beginning with Slovenia in 2007, the experience with the euro is still relatively short. How much the timing of entry affects trade is also investigated.Footnote 5
 To preview the conclusions: (1) EMU and EU each have strong positive effects in stimulating trade for the original (i.e., pre-2004) members, and (2) the magnitude of these effects depends both on the estimation methodology and on the separation of the effects for old and new members. With the preferred methodology – a panel approach with both dyadic and time-varying exporter and importer fixed effects on a long, broad data set – EMU expands European trade by 40% for the original members, while the EU increased trade by almost 70%. Newer members have experienced even higher trade as a result of joining the EU, but more time is necessary to see the effects of their joining EMU. The paper is organized as follows. Section “Methodology and data set” describes the estimation methodology and data set construction. Section “Estimation results” reports results for the effect of EMU and other currency unions on trade. For comparison with the gravity model literature, the analysis reports results using several different specifications that exclude country-pair and/or country-year fixed effects, but “builds to the climax” using the preferred methodology with both country-pair and country-year fixed effects. As in the earlier work of Glick and Rose (2002, 2016), the analysis starts with a single aggregate indicator dummy that captures the average effect of RTAs on trade flows. Thereafter, the effects of the regional trade agreement variable are disaggregated, so as to separate out the effects of EU membership from those of other trade arrangements. The trade effects of old versus new members of EMU and EU are also separately estimated. Section “Summary and conclusion” concludes.",12
59,2,Comparative Economic Studies,12 April 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-017-0024-6,Are Sovereign Credit Ratings Overrated?,June 2017,Davor Kunovac,Rafael Ravnik,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Frequent sovereign rating downgrades received a huge amount of public attention during the recent European sovereign debt crisis. The news media as well as policymakers have routinely suggested that credit rating announcements strongly affect the borrowing cost of a country. This is mainly based on the assumption that credit rating agencies may reveal to financial markets important information about creditworthiness of a debt issuer, beside that already contained in macroeconomic fundamentals. In this paper we challenge that presumption and examine the relevance of changes in sovereign credit rating for the borrowing cost of European Union (EU) countries. In other words, we examine whether announcements of rating agencies may affect the price of external borrowing of European countries. We also analyze whether financial markets ground their decisions on the same information set as rating agencies, implying that their announcements have only limited importance for financial markets. The answers to the questions asked may help to inform the discussion on the importance of sovereign credit ratings for the borrowing cost of EU countries. The analysis conducted in this paper works out the thesis that it is a priori unclear whether the improvement of the credit rating automatically causes a decline in government bond yields of a country. Usually we expect that financial markets and rating agencies largely base their decision on the same set of publicly available macroeconomic and fiscal indicators, such as public debt and deficit or GDP growth. In such a case a change in the credit rating does not provide any new information to financial markets, pointing to the absence of asymmetric information between the state as the debt issuer and investors. Moreover, in case the information set on which the agencies base their decision is exactly equal to that of market participants, rating changes would not affect government bond yields at all because efficient markets would have already absorbed (priced in) such information in the price of the debt. The credit rating per se in such a case does not have a dominant influence on the borrowing cost – it is the underlying economic fundamentals that determine the borrowing cost in the long run. Therefore, given the sentiment in financial markets, the government’s borrowing cost can only be reduced by improving macroeconomic and fiscal fundamentals. Any increase in the credit rating may then follow only as a natural consequence of these improvements. However, if, on the other hand, information sets of rating agencies and market participants differ significantly, changes of credit ratings may surprise the financial markets and in this way directly affect the government bond yields. In such a case credit ratings are truly informative and rating announcements now reveal new information to financial markets, in addition to that already contained in economic fundamentals. Only for such a case of the presence of substantial asymmetric information it makes sense to consider the increase in the credit rating as a precondition for lower government bond yields. In order to gain a better insight into the mechanism according to which the main rating agencies can affect the borrowing cost of European countries, we conduct an analysis based on the four steps we summarize below. In the first step we estimate the direct impact of sovereign credit rating changes on the borrowing cost of European countries. For this purpose we conduct an event study analysis in order to estimate the reaction of EU members credit default swap (CDS) spreads to changes in credit ratings. Our focus is on the announcements of the big three rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. The analysis suggests that the reaction of CDS spreads on rating downgrades is statistically significant but rather mild (around 10 basis points over the first 2 days), while the reaction to rating upgrades is not significant at all. Moreover, the total new information is completely absorbed in the price within the first 2 days following the rating announcement. However, it turned out that the reaction largely depends on the current level of the respective country’s rating at the day of the rating announcement. The reaction is the strongest following downgrades that lead to an asset class shift from the investment into the junk category (around 29 basis points). In addition, the market reaction is somewhat stronger for the first downgrade into the junk category (approximately 36 basis points). The stronger reaction of sovereign spreads to the downgrade into the junk category may, at least partially, be explained by administrative and regulatory restrictions. For instance, institutional investors that are prevented by regulatory constraints from investing into securities of certain rating categories only may rebalance their portfolio and thereby decrease demand for junk-rated government bonds and can thus directly affect their yield. However, one has to be cautious when using these results in order to draw conclusions about the importance of the estimated impact of a downgrade for individual countries. An increase by 10 basis points would clearly be visible for German or Finish spreads whose variability is very low. On the other hand, given the average variability of spreads in the entire sample, a 10-basis-point change may be considered unimportant. The results of the first part of the analysis may lead to a preliminary conclusion that rating agencies do not reveal important new information on the credibility of the debt issuer to the market participants, where the only exception is downgrading a country into the junk category. These results suggest that agencies base their decisions, to a large extent, on the information that is already absorbed in the borrowing cost. In order to carry out a formal verification of this preliminary conclusion, further analysis was conducted in order to examine the difference between the information set of rating agencies and bond market participants. The second step of this paper thus studies how the three leading rating agencies determine the credit ratings of EU member states. In other words, here we try to approximate the information set used by credit rating agencies when deciding on the credit rating of a country. For this purpose we project credit ratings onto the usual set of publicly available macroeconomic and fiscal indicators. In this step we are using low-frequency quarterly data for the period 2007Q1–2015Q3. Based on the estimated relationships we decompose the credit ratings into two parts: (a) a systematic part labeled as credit rating implied by fundamentals (i.e., the estimated regression fit) and (b) a part that is unexplained by fundamentals (residual of the estimated regression). The unexplained part approximates discretionary actions of rating agencies – specific information on the rating of a country that does not follow the dynamics of fundamentals in a systematic way. The main findings of this step of the analysis suggest that the estimated systematic part is able to capture the dynamics of the true credit rating very well. Around 90% of ratings implied by fundamentals were equal or one notch different from the actual ratings. In the third step we analyze whether rating agencies reveal any new information to financial markets that has not yet been absorbed (priced in) in the borrowing cost of a country. In other words, our objective here is to isolate the informational contribution of the credit ratings to CDS market in addition to that already contained in the economic fundamentals. For that purpose we decompose the CDS spreads into three components: (a) the contribution of economic fundamentals captured by the previously estimated systematic part of the credit rating, (b) contribution of rating agency actions (contribution of the residual) and (c) contribution of global risk aversion. The mentioned decomposition allows us to assess the relative importance of discretionary rating agency actions for the borrowing cost of the analyzed countries. Our results suggest that fundamentals, along with the global risk aversion, are the most important determinants of CDS spreads. On the other hand, discretionary credit rating actions explain only a small portion of the variation in CDS spreads. In the final step of our analysis we estimate so-called market implied ratings and compare them with the corresponding observed credit ratings for the period 2008m1–2015m9. For that purpose we expand our sample by 20 non-EU countries in order to have at least one country in each rating category at all times. It is important to note that the ranking of a set of countries by their credit rating is not necessary in line with their ranking by CDS spreads. One explanation of this inconsistency could be attributed to the fact that rating agencies are prudent in their approach to rating revisions which means that they neglect short-term fluctuations in economic fundamentals. On the other hand, market participants tend to react immediately to changes in the underlying economic fundamentals. The described difference in behavior between the rating agencies and the market participants is noticeably confirmed by our results. More precisely, the estimated market implied ratings are able to anticipate almost all important rating changes well in advance. In other words, rating changes are significantly lagging behind CDS spreads. For example, market participants placed Croatia, Hungary and Portugal into the junk category more than 2 years before rating agencies downgraded these countries into junk. The entire analysis clearly points to the conclusion that the autonomous impact of rating announcements on the borrowing cost for EU member states is significant in the statistical sense. However, the economic importance of this impact is rather limited. On the other hand, our results, in line with the related literature, suggest that macroeconomic fundamentals, in addition to global risk aversion, are the dominant determinants of the borrowing cost of European countries. The analysis thus leads to the conclusion that the importance of rating agencies for the borrowing cost is probably overrated by the general public and that, under given financial market conditions, only an improvement in the underlying macroeconomic fundamentals can substantially lower the borrowing cost of a country. Our results are robust and consistent across all methodological approaches used in this paper. Although the existing empirical literature on the importance of sovereign credit ratings is extensive, the relationship between ratings and government’s borrowing costs still remains ambiguous. Much of the literature relies on event studies and uses daily frequency data in order to examine the importance of rating agencies. For example, see Cantor and Packer (1996), Afonso et al. (2012), Aizenman et al. (2013), Rowland and Torres (2013), Özmen and Yaşar (2015), Jaramillo and Tejada (2011) and Kaminsky and Schmukler (2002). The results differ in terms of intensity and significance of the reaction, as well as in terms of the time of absorption. However, most papers found that rating downgrades are on average followed by stronger market reactions in comparison to rating upgrades. This paper is also closely related to the literature on determinants of credit ratings. Some of these papers include Cantor and Packer (1996), Ferri et al. (1999), Afonso (2003), Bissoondoyal-Bheenick (2004), Afonso et al. (2009) and Gärtner et al. (2011). These papers generally deal with the issue of finding appropriate rating determinants and the accuracy of rating forecasts, while the results are not put into the context of their impact on the borrowing cost. The only exception is Gärtner et al. (2011), where similarly as in our paper, a two-step decomposition of spreads into two basic factors was made: the part explained by fundamentals and the unexplained part which the authors interpret as discretionary actions of rating agencies. However, the authors include government bond yields in the rating regressions, and it is therefore impossible to disentangle what part of the information is common to the market and rating agencies and what part represents autonomous actions of the rating agencies. Moreover, the authors are only emphasizing the statistical significance of the estimated coefficients without discussing the relative economic importance of credit rating actions. Similar analyses are conducted in Eichengreen and Mody (1998) and Dell’Ariccia et al. (2006) where one could also argue that only the statistical significance was analyzed. Afonso et al. (2015) analyzed to what extent rating agencies explain spreads of selected European countries, in addition to information already contained in the fundamentals. They found a statistically significant relationship between the credit rating and spreads. However, the economic significance of the rating agencies is found to be negligible in comparison to macro-fundamentals. Cavallo et al. (2008) are analyzing the importance of credit ratings for a wide set of emerging market economies. Using high-frequency data they found credit ratings to be statistically significant in explaining financial market variables, even after controlling for sovereign bond spreads and economic fundamentals. The present paper builds on the existing literature on the importance of credit ratings in several ways. First it focuses on a wide set of EU countries during the sovereign debt crises which was characterized by a large number of sovereign rating downgrades along with significant increases in government bond yields. This is interesting from policymaker’s perspective since both fiscal and monetary policy actions during that period were motivated by mounting spreads in the financial markets. It is therefore of crucial importance to understand which role was played by the rating agencies in this borrowing cost increase. Second, we are moving the discussion from statistical significance toward economic significance by decomposing the spread into the contribution due to credit ratings and all other relevant factors. By doing so, we are able to make a clear distinction between the contribution of fundamentals, global factors and the credit rating itself. Third, this paper is to our knowledge the first attempt to estimate market implied ratings for sovereign, rather than corporate, spreads.",5

During these years, China has experienced an extraordinary reversal of fortune. The first three decades of communist rule saw China embark on a remarkable set of economic and social experiments. Change comes with the death of Mao Zedong. Over the next decade, China opened its economy and relaxed state controls. The resulting growth lifted hundreds of millions from poverty setting China on course towards becoming the world’s largest economy.Footnote 1
 China’s return to the world stage is one of the most important events in recent history. Understanding the Chinese boom and its effects on the outside world will occupy scholars for decades to come.Footnote 2 Yet China did not begin with a blank slate in 1978. To explain the boom, we must look at policies and outcomes in earlier decades and especially during the Mao Zedong era. Our work contributes to this scholarly enterprise by providing new evidence on how Chinese living standards, as measured by household consumption, changed during planned industrialization before 1978. Our paper aims to fill some gaps in the literature. First, most research on China before 1978 concentrates on GDP rather than on consumption.Footnote 3 The distinction matters as consumption is usually seen as a better measure of living standards. As we shall see, GDP and consumption behave differently after 1949 because the authorities focused on heavy industry at the expense of housing and food. Second, the literature for planned economies, most notably the Soviet Union, has long emphasized the importance of taking into account changes in relative prices that occur during central planning – often called the index number problem.Footnote 4 The Chinese national account measures of consumption are largely silent on the effects of changes in relative prices thereby obscuring an important part of the Chinese record. To remedy the deficiencies in the record, we construct a new household consumption index for China covering personal consumption and government provided healthcare and education. Our estimates are from 1952 to 1978. In contrast to previous work, the index is a valid welfare-based measure. To capture the effects of changes in relative prices during growth, we measure consumption with 1952 and 1979 prices.Footnote 5
 Our consumption index revises key aspects of the Chinese record. In particular, it suggests slower consumption growth before 1978 as compared to the national accounts. By 1978, personal consumption had increased by 40% relative to the early 1930’s while household consumption rose by 50% reflecting the increased public provision of education and healthcare. A second key finding is that consumption did not increase relative to 1933 until the late 1960’s.Footnote 6
 What explains the rise in household consumption after the late 1960’s? We show that it reflects increases in clothing, household goods and factory products generally and the increased provision of education and health services. In contrast, food consumption stagnated and housing declined. In sum, while overall consumption increased after the late 1960’s, the basic needs of the Chinese populace for food and housing were unmet until the great reforms. How did China do in a comparative sense? We discuss this question in final section of the paper where we place China in a broader comparative perspective using long run data on GDP and consumption from Barro and Ursua (2008). In contrast to much of the recent literature, we find that China did well in terms of GDP growth per capita before 1978. Indeed, it is among the fastest growing economies from 1952 to 1978. For consumption, however, the Chinese performance is dismal. China lagged East Asia. It lagged the Soviet Union and other economies, developed and developing. To summarize, China produced impressive growth rates for GDP per capita before 1978. As a result, the Chinese people were better clothed; more urbanized and had more household goods. They were better schooled and they had improved health outcomes.Footnote 7 Moreover, the wellbeing of those in the lowest tail of the income distribution may well have improved, at least outside of the Great Leap Forward. On the other hand, the Chinese as a nation were not better fed nor housed and household consumption lagged GDP during the first two decades of planned industrialization. The phrase “Iron Rice Bowl” is used to describe Chinese life after the 1949 revolution. We find iron but little rice for the Chinese masses before the reforms. To conclude, we argue that the stagnation in food and housing is a neglected but crucial element leading to later reforms. We proceed as follows. First, we outline the main features of growth in income and consumption after 1952 as revealed by the Chinese national accounts. The remaining sections provide our consumption estimates.",2

In this paper, we investigate this relationship using industry-level data for value added and tariffs for the transition economies of Central Eastern Europe and Baltics (CEEB), Southeast Europe (SEE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the economies of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, over the period 1991–2010. Over these two decades, the mentioned groups of countries faced different patterns and speeds of (de)industrialization. Mishandled privatization, insufficient structural reforms and the incapability of attracting FDI made the economies of SEE and CIS deindustrialize faster than CEEB, whose industrialization patterns were mainly shaped by a relatively fast transition process and better geographical positioning. On the other hand, MENA countries failed to raise their low industrial level. However, many of them committed to trade liberalization, mainly motivated by their desire to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). If tariffs somehow affect industrialization patterns, their timely reduction may have brought benefits for industries, while premature liberalization may have had detrimental effects. In this paper, we use the widespread definition of (de)industrialization as a process of economic and social change resulting from the increase/reduction in the industrial capacity of a country. Industrial capacity is measured through either manufacturing employment or manufacturing value added. We opt for the second measure and mainly rely on it in absolute terms. The paper faces two main challenges. The first is the comprehension of the channels through which tariffs potentially affect industrialization. Tariffs increase the cost of imports and may, through this, affect industry value added. Tariffs also reduce the relative price of exports to imports, which may affect exports and industry value added in turn. Through their effect on imports and exports, tariffs also affect the revealed comparative advantage of a country, i.e. the share in world export of a particular good relative to the overall share in total world export. This reflects productivity, which may also affect industry value added. Hence, we test three potential channels – imports, exports and revealed comparative advantage. The second challenge is the accounting for endogeneity of tariffs. Tariffs are determined by many factors, including lobbying by powerful industries, desire to protect infant industries and economy-wide industrial policy, all three of which are related to industry value added. Hence, endogeneity may be present due to both reverse causality and omitted variables. The panel data that we use allow for reducing the endogeneity bias by including various fixed effects. Still, fixed effects would not account for the entire endogeneity, and for this reason we use instrumental variable estimation. Specifically, we instrument tariffs by the bound tariff rates, which are prescribed by the WTO and should be exogenous, and by the lagged tariffs, which are predetermined and should be uncorrelated with current shocks in industry value added. The results robustly support trade liberalization, but only for mature industries. We find that lower tariffs have likely resulted in higher value added, overall, and that this has been achieved mainly through higher imports and likely not through productivity; exports also materialized as a significant channel, but with a small magnitude. We find evidence that lower tariffs resulted in higher value added in the CEEB and CIS countries but played no role for industrialization in MENA and SEE, which could be explained by the possibly premature trade liberalization in these countries. The theoretical background of the paper is discussed in “Theoretical Background and Relevant Literature” section. “Some Stylized Facts” section offers some stylized facts. “Methodology and Data” section describes the methodology and the data used, with special reference to the endogeneity of the tariffs. “Results and Discussion” section presents the baseline results, including a battery of robustness checks, while “Comparative Analysis” section offers a comparative analysis between the four regions involved and between mature versus young industries. The last section concludes.",2

Croatia’s merchandise trade accounts for around 55% of GDP. However, its exports of services exceed merchandise exports due to the strong tourism sector, so when taking into account both trade in goods and services, the indicator of trade openness rises to approximately 85% of GDP. Still, Croatia is among the least open Central and Eastern European (CEE)Footnote 1 countries and the improvement in this indicator is important for stronger economic development. Although merchandise exports had never been sufficient to cover imports in any single year after 1995, since the outbreak of the global economic and financial crisis the trade deficit has declined sharply, mainly through weak demand and import adjustment. In addition, the structure of Croatian trade changed after accession to the European Union (EU) in July 2013. This paper uses the gravity model of international trade to analyse the impact of EU accession, CEFTA membership and different preceding free trade agreements (FTAs) on Croatian merchandise trade. This model, based on Newton’s law of gravity, explains bilateral trade flows as proportional to the economic size of trading partners and inversely proportional to their distance, i.e. larger and closer economies trade more with each other. Trade flows are defined not only by size and geographical distance but also by trade agreements and other historical and cultural connections that make trading easier. Croatia was laggard in entering different FTAs compared to CEE countries, and hence, the motivation behind this paper is to explore whether membership in CEFTA and later in the EU brought benefits to Croatian trade. While testing the robustness of the results, we also analyse whether the recent financial crisis affected exports and imports in the same way and whether the main findings apply in the case of trade in goods and services. This paper contributes to the existing literature on Croatian trade by being among the first to analyse the impact of EU membership. Previous analyses of Croatian trade were mainly conducted using cross-sectional gravity models, while this paper uses a variety of different panel estimation techniques to capture both spatial and temporal data variations and also to better account for unobserved, country-pair-specific, time-invariant determinants of trade. The model is estimated using ordinary least squares, fixed and random effects, Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood and the Arellano–Bover/Blundell–Bond estimators. The paper is organised as follows: the second section describes the characteristics of Croatian merchandise trade and its geographical structure. The third section reviews the main empirical findings of previous studies that used a gravity model with Croatia included in their sample. The fourth section explains basic concepts of the gravity model and the methods applied in the paper and describes the data used. The results of econometric analysis and various robustness checks are described in the fifth section. The last section concludes.",8

Frech III,Peter Zweifel,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The socialist calculation debate began almost 100 years ago when Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek argued that a socialist state could not determine marginal cost prices and therefore could not allocate resources efficiently. Oscar Lange and Abba Lerner responded with the market socialist model. In this model, a socialist planner in a decentralized government-ownership economy adjusts prices in response to excess demand and thereby achieves marginal cost pricing and allocative efficiency. There are mixed views on whether market socialism would work well for an entire economy. For example, Phelps (2013) is negative, while Roemer (1994) and Shleifer and Vishny (1994) are positive. In this paper, we briefly review the debate, especially the market socialist response, with a view to community rating in health insurance. Even among its supporters, market socialism is widely regarded as only an abstract idea. We disagree. We argue that market socialism exists and is growing in importance in major parts of modern economies – especially in health care and health insurance. In these sectors, prices are often set centrally, while ownership includes many state-owned, nonprofit, and mutual firms. We examine the case for applying market socialist principles to policy regarding health care and especially regarding health insurance. In particular, these principles are shown to imply that currently common practice of community rating of health insurance premiums is a source of major inefficiencies, harmful regulatory pressure, and unnecessary difficulties for the US Affordable Care Act (ACA) and also for decentralized social health insurance in countries such as Germany and the Netherlands. We suggest moving in the market socialist direction – toward marginal cost pricing combined with subsidization targeted to consumers who are both poor and high risk.",3

The ECSC was created in 1951 with six members (France, West Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy), following a proposal by the then French Foreign Minister, Robert Schumann. As the first European organisation based on principles of supra-nationalism, Schumann saw the ECSC as an institution that, by starting a process of regional integration across Europe, would make a major war in Europe increasingly unthinkable. It would also draw France and (Western) Germany closer together, both politically and economically. By 1968 the EU had become a functioning customs union, with internal tariffs and non-tariff barriers abolished, though the process of completing the ‘single internal market’ continued, culminating in the Single European Act of 1992 (which came into effect on 1 January 1993). Even so, wide-ranging regulatory and standards reforms are ongoing, still not completed. While the EU Customs Union only concerns the trade in goods, the Single Market initiative is far wider, involving much regulatory harmonisation across the EU to facilitate services trade, competition policy and the like. By 2017, the EU had both evolved a great deal in terms of its functions, and had expanded its membership – it now has 28 member states. It has also gradually expanded its range of activities and responsibilities, as we explain below. Despite this, its budget remains remarkably small, only around 1% of the EU’s total GDP. Moreover, the EU clearly has considerable attractions, both political and economic. For some countries, an important reason for adopting a new economic model – such as that embodied in the EU’s acquis – has been the firm desire to leave one set of alliances (e.g. Comecon and the Warsaw Pact) and join another (the EU, OECD, NATO, etc.) in order to provide longer-term security under more congenial conditions than existed before. For the countries of central and eastern Europe, this was a major rationale for their desire to join the EU and the ‘western system of alliances’, even at the cost of adopting an economic model that was arguably too complicated for them, and better suited to richer states with extensive welfare provisions. This is because new members have to adopt the model as a whole, all at once, while old members did so gradually, as the model itself evolved. There is also now a queue of states wanting to join the EU, some already formally accepted as candidate states and with accession negotiations under way, others still waiting to start the formal entry process. On the other hand, one of the major member states, the United KingdomFootnote 1 (UK), held a referendum on EU membership in June 2016, in response to widespread public dissatisfaction over some aspects of what membership meant for the UK, notably concerning immigration, free movement of people, and the role of the European Court of Justice, among other issues. The UK voted narrowly to leave the EU, quickly formed a new government to oversee the exit process, and in late March 2017 invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) (see PM, 2017); this initiates a 2-year process of negotiation to determine the exit settlement between the UK and the EU27 (i.e. the remaining member states). This should include agreeing on a new, post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU27, supporting trade in goods and services and other areas of economic cooperation. While the UK has published a review of the legislative implications of Brexit (see HC, 2017), and the EU has recently published negotiating guidelines for this process (see EC, 2017), it is premature to speculate further about Brexit in this paper. It is too early to know the likely shape of an exit deal for the UK, or indeed the impact of Brexit on the remaining 27 member states.Footnote 2
 For an important member state such as the UK to opt for departure from the EU, something that is not happening for frivolous reasons, one can only conclude that something has gone badly wrong with the EU. While in part there are internal UK issues to point to, there are growing concerns about the EU too. These are in areas such as the push for ‘ever closer union’, major worries about free movement and immigration, the poor functioning of the Eurozone since the economic crisis, with austerity and persistent high unemployment, limited democracy and an apparent inability to manage recent crises well. Accordingly, to show how the EU reached such a sorry state, in what follows we start in the ‘Stages of EU Enlargement’ section by sketching the various stages of enlargement through which the Union has evolved, including a short review of the impact of membership on growth and convergence. The section ‘The Institutional Framework of the EU: The EU Model’ then describes the institutional framework of the Union, beginning with the acquis and the budget that supports it, and including aspects of the EU’s engagement with the wider world in terms of trade policy, aid and foreign relations. The ‘EU Model’ and how far it might or might not be suitable for possible applicant countries, or countries in the EU neighbourhood, is critically reviewed next in ‘Does the EU Model Suit Countries Outside the EU?’ section. In ‘The EU Model: Has it Become Dysfunctional?’ section we are then ready to review the EU Model as a whole, and some of the stresses and strains it currently faces, including issues not currently being managed adequately. The section ‘Conclusions and Remaining Issues’ pulls the argument together and concludes about the need for new models, new modes of engagement, and a new political configuration for the Union. For clarity and simplicity, the term EU is used throughout this paper, even though it did not come into official use until the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 (the Treaty on European Union, or TEU).",3

This paper uses a two-regime model to understand more about crash risk by assessing uncovered interest parity (UIP) deviations in a range of CEE countries and by using a hidden Markov model (HMM) to divide the deviations into two categories: those where the high-yield currency appreciates against the lower interest rate unit (adding a capital gain to the funding premium) and those where the high-yield currency falls much more than would be anticipated by UIP. In the first case, the conditions are favourable for inflow of capital to the higher interest rate unit. It would be possible to make profitable carry-trades where funds are borrowed in the lower rate unit currency, transferred into the currency with the higher interest rate for the same period as the borrowing and then exchanged back and repaid at the end of the contract. These are times of relative calm in the foreign exchange market. In the second case, these carry-trades would lose money and the sharp depreciation of the high-yield currency would be associated with exchange rate crisis. The first regime might be called the period of ‘calm’ and is a much more common occurrence. The second period is rare and could be called ‘crisis’. A hidden Markov model uses the potential carry-trade profits to identify the most likely regime and the probability of switching from a calm regime to one of crisis for each exchange rate. The model can be extended to assess the way that these probabilities are affected by exogenous events such as international risk aversion and changes in US interest rates. These exogenous factors increase the risk of experiencing an exchange rate crisis and can be used to compare how vulnerable each country is to these type of external shocks. This paper adds to the evidence that the forward-discount puzzle is explained as a compensation for taking crash risk, builds on the use of nonlinear methods and greatly extends and expands on the use of HMM models for understanding the forward-discount puzzle. This paper also contributes to the literature on sudden stops as the probability of a foreign exchange crisis is calculated and the way that this probability is affected by international risk factors is also presented. The rest of this paper proceeds as follows: “Literature” section discusses the forward-discount puzzle, “The hidden Markov model” section presents the hidden Markov model, “Analysis of Results” section analyses the initial results, “Exogenous Influences on Regime Switching
Probabilities” section considers exogenous influences on the probability of switching from one regime to another, and “Conclusion” section concludes.",

An observer coming to Tallinn, Riga or Vilnius in the early transition phase might have wondered which direction the economic reforms would take and how the economies might end up being organised in the longer term. It would be natural to speculate that the Baltic states would seek inspiration from their former master Russia or from the Central European countries which started their reforms early or perhaps from the Nordic countries with which there are close economic and cultural ties. In the end, the Baltic states chose their own transition path and economic systems that in many ways are unique.Footnote 1
 This paper discusses the economic reforms and the resulting economic system of the Baltic states and seeks to explain the choices of the countries. The debate on the choice of economic systems in Central and Eastern Europe has been rekindled by the divergent performance of the countries during and after the global financial crisis (Atoyan, 2010; Becker et al., 2010; Farkas, 2016; Kornai, 2016). The post-communist transition has been labelled the dual transition as it implied fundamental reforms of both the economy and the political system. Along these lines, the transition in the Baltic states could be labelled the triple transition since it also implied the establishment of new national administrative and institutional structures. This is important because of the inherent paradox of the economic transition since the government is responsible for the transfer of economic decision-making from itself to the private sector (Islam, 1993; Kuzio, 2001). Analysis of the economic reform process is particularly pertinent in the case of the Baltic states. The Baltic states managed to leave the Soviet Union and join the European Union in little more than a decade. The admission to the EU bore witness to the countries managing to establish democratic rule, functioning market economies and administrative and institutional structures to satisfy the Acquis Communautaire. The economic reform process in the Baltic states has had implications for developments in other post-communist countries, as they have adopted reform elements that were initially unique to the Baltic states (Åslund, 2010). Many studies of the post-communist economic transition have focused on economic reforms, which are the means of attaining changes in the organisation of the economy, while the literature has dwelt less on the implicit choice of economic system and the institutional and structural goals. It has often been assumed that the objective of the transition would be a market-economic system, but the specifics of that system have received little attention. This approach overlooks the substantial differences to be found in the organisation and functioning of various market economies, differences that may be of great importance for the well-being of individuals and the performance of the economy in the short and long terms (Gregory and Stuart, 1995; Eichengreen, 2007). Bohle and Greskovits (2007) categorise the economic systems that resulted from 15 years of reform in Central and Eastern Europe. The reforms in the Baltic states led to a liberal economic system with little government intervention, while the reforms in Slovenia led to a system with many corporatist or cooperative hallmarks. The rest of the post-communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe are seen to have intermediate systems in which the government retains an active but not corporatist role in the economy. The contributions in Lane and Myant (2007) discuss the varieties of capitalism that emerged in a broadly defined set of post-communist countries. Buchen (2007) compares Estonia and Slovenia and reaches the conclusion that the role of the government differs markedly in the two countries. Only a few studies have detailed the reforms or the resulting economic system in the Baltic states. An early contribution is van Arkadie and Karlsson (1992), which provides a discussion of the challenges and early reforms in the three countries. OECD (2000) gives an account of the first decade of economic reforms and the economic results, but does not consider the specificities of the economic system that was established. Norkus (2011) combines a number of indices of institutional and organisational structures and concludes that there is a “neoliberal Baltic capitalism model” (p. 24) with Estonia standing out as the most clear-cut case. Hubner (2011) assesses the reforms and the economic performance in the Baltic states and argues that “unfettered liberalisation” led to an unwarranted dependence on capital inflows, with adverse consequences during the global financial crisis. This paper sets out to address two main issues. First, the paper examines the hypothesis that the Baltic states followed a distinct reform path that led to an economic system which differs markedly from those in the neighbouring countries. Both quantitative and qualitative information is used to analyse the reform path and the resulting economic system. Second, given that the first question is answered affirmatively, the paper asks why the Baltic states made choices that differed so markedly from those of its neighbours. It may indeed be seen as paradoxical that the Baltic states had extensive economic and political contacts with the Nordic countries but nevertheless chose reforms that led to very different economic systems. The paper finds that the economic reforms in the Baltic states broadly based and rapid and typically implied free markets, limited government intervention and high-powered incentives. Estonia was the most avid reformer followed by Latvia and Lithuania. The reforms led to what can be categorised as a liberal-market economic system, unlike the systems in most other post-communist countries. The choice may seem surprising given that the Baltic states had extensive political and personal contacts with the Nordic countries and Germany, all of which have a different economic system. The choice is partly related to the initial economic and structural features of the Baltic states, their democratic and political dynamics, and the preferences and values of the public. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The next section contains a brief discussion on the classification of economic systems. The following sections provides an analysis of economic transition indicators for the Baltic states and other post-communist countries, a discussion of some qualitative aspects of the reforms in the Baltic states and a synthesis linking the economic reforms with the resulting economic system. The second-last section contains a discussion of a number of key factors that can have affected the choice of economic reforms in the Baltic states. The last section summarises the paper.",4

Orlowski,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This study shows the relative importance of inflation and exchange rate stability as monetary policy objectives in Poland over the past two decades. For this purpose, a model of short-term interest rates as a function of inflation and nominal exchange rate is proposed and tested for possible structural breaks and regime switching. Specifically, sensitivity of short-term interest rates is examined as a function of changes in the CPI-based inflation and changes in nominal effective exchange rate during January 1994–December 2016 period. Responsiveness of short-term interest rates to inflation and to exchange rate fluctuations varied as the monetary policy evolved. We attempt to evaluate a consistency between the actual responses of short-term interest rates to changes in inflation and in exchange rate under the officially proclaimed policy targeting regimes. The policy roadmap of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) started with a strict, followed by a gradually more flexible, exchange rate targeting, and ultimately ended with the current framework of direct inflation targeting (DIT) (Fischer and Sahay, 2001; Jonas and Mishkin, 2005; Orlowski, 2008a). The exchange rate-based monetary policy was necessary at the early stage of economic transformation as financial markets and institutions were severely underdeveloped. Nominal indexation propelled inflation to chronic levels (Fischer and Sahay, 2001). This policy helped reduce nominal indexation and contain inflation to sustainable levels by mid-1990s. However, Poland’s inflation persisted in exceeding the inflation levels of leading industrial economies during that time and the resulting positive inflation gap led to real currency appreciation and to the deepening of current account deficit. It was therefore necessary to devise a sensible exit strategy from the currency peg toward a credible DIT (with a flexible exchange rate). The new strategy refocused on disinflation and de-emphasized exchange rate stability. As expected, it reinforced monetary autonomy and contributed to the development of a resilient financial system (Jonas and Mishkin, 2005; Orlowski, 2008a). In order to ascertain the relative importance of inflation and exchange rate stability as formal policy objectives, we conduct Bai–Perron multiple breakpoint (MBP) and Markov regime switching tests. Both tests evaluate changeable responses of short-term interest rates to (log) changes in CPI inflation and to (log) changes in the nominal effective exchange rate (EER). We expect that the results reflect changes in the monetary policy transition from the currency peg to DIT. More specifically, we expect interest rates to be susceptible to changes in the nominal exchange rate during the currency peg as well as during its gradual relaxation between 1994 and 2001. We expect interest rates to be increasingly responsive to inflation but not to variations in the exchange rate since the official inception of DIT in 1999. With respect to DIT, we introduce a distinction of de jure and de facto inflation targeting. By de jure DIT we understand an inflation targeting monetary policy that is officially enacted but not implemented with active responses of interest rates to inflation. De facto DIT is supported by such responses. The tested variables include monthly series of the one-day (1D) and the three-month (3M) Warsaw interbank offer rates, the CPI-based year-on-year inflation rates and the nominal effective exchange rate for the January 1994–December 2016 period (276 observations). Our underlying hypothesis is that DIT helped Poland achieve stability of inflation, exchange rates and interest rates, and in turn cushion the potential contagion effects of the 2008–2010 global financial crisis. Section two discusses central bank target and instrument rules in open economies, such as Poland. In Section three, we propose the underlying model of short-term interbank rates as a function of CPI inflation and the nominal effective exchange rate.

As a result, many products undergo several value-enhancing intermediate stages of transformation and combination with other inputs prior to becoming final. When these sequential stages are separated by national borders, production processes (value chains) acquire an international (regional or even global), trade-creating, dimension, often referred to as global value chains (GVC).Footnote 1 Borders may indeed be crossed multiple times during such a process and both the final and the intermediate goods and services can consequently be regarded as “bundles” of multiple national and sectorial origins.Footnote 2
 Likewise, the mapping between the geographical location of a firm and its ownership has become blurred as a result of cross-border capital flows and foreign direct investment. A firm’s decision to expand its activities abroad may reflect a variety of motives, including gaining access to new markets or taking advantage of differences in production costs (see, among others, Brainard, 1997; Helpman, 1984). The cross-border character of a production process thus provides a priori little indication as to the ownership of the different production units involved in it. Indeed, both the sourcing of inputs at arm’s length or from foreign affiliates would be trade creating. Whereas the former requires a contractual agreement with a foreign supplier, a vertical investment is a prerequisite for the latter (either a greenfield investment, or a merger or acquisition). This decision ultimately depends on various factors, including firm and sector characteristics, trade and monitoring costs and risks linked to incomplete contracts. In this article, we explore the link between foreign direct investment and countries’ participation in global value chains. Our empirical analysis is based on an augmented gravity model framework applied to a newly constructed dataset combining GVC-related metrics and bilateral FDI stock for 40 developed and emerging economies. We find a positive relationship between the bilateral FDI stock on the one hand, and bilateral trade in both final and intermediate products, and the bilateral import content of exports on the other. Bilateral FDI thus affects both the volume and composition of trade flows. While we cannot formally distinguish between arm’s length trade and affiliate sales, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a substantial share of trade occurs within multinational firms and is the direct result of international sourcing. Our results also support the hypothesis that foreign investors contribute to shaping host economies’ export structure and their participation in international production networks. Further, we show that traditional gravity variables play a significant role in explaining both the volume of GVC-related bilateral trade, as well as the bilateral import content of exports. We also present some evidence that cooperation costs – measured by linguistic and geographical proximity – are more relevant for trade that reflects production sharing. This article contributes to the literature on the interaction between FDI and trade associated with cross-border production sharing. The decision of a firm to set up foreign affiliates and locate certain stages of its production process abroad, and hence becoming a multinational enterprise (MNE), depends on a number of factors including firm and sector characteristics (Antràs and Helpman, 2004), production costs, trade and monitoring costs, risks linked to incomplete contracts (Markusen, 2002). FDI motives have traditionally been classified into two broad categories: horizontal or market-seeking FDI, which is primarily motivated by the possibility of supplying local markets (Markusen, 1984), and vertical FDI which exploits location advantages such as differences in production costs (Helpman, 1984). A concept that is closely related to the latter is “export platform” FDI, whereby foreign affiliates predominantly supply third markets, i.e. neither necessarily the home nor the host economy (Ekholm et al., 2007). FDI is thus prone to trade creation, both intra-firm and at arm’s length. The presence of foreign investment can affect host economies in multiple ways, possibly contributing to reshaping their economic and export structure. Amador and Cabral (2014) note that FDI is instrumental for the setting up of GVC run by multinational corporations. Nikolovova (2013), using data for EU27 countries, finds that an increase in FDI at sectoral level is associated with higher production and higher demand for intermediate goods, which suggest that FDI is primarily vertical and related to outsourcing activities. Alfaro and Charlton (2009) show that the share of vertical FDI is commonly underestimated and conclude that “intra-firm trade and foreign investment activity might be better explained by complex production processes involving several stages and decisions about not only where to source inputs, but also whether to source them from inside or outside the firm.” Other effects of FDI pertinent to international production sharing include vertical productivity spillovers. Javorcik (2004) finds that these spillovers take place through backward linkages, i.e. contact between foreign affiliates and local suppliers, and are associated with partially owned foreign projects. Havranek and Irsova (2011), examining available studies on vertical productivity spillovers through a meta-analysis, conclude that spillovers through backward linkages generally dominate and greater spillovers are received by countries that are open to international trade and have relatively underdeveloped financial systems. Many empirical papers focus on the Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC), which from a global perspective stand out both in terms of their degree of GVC participation and their high levels of inward FDI stock.Footnote 3 During their transition period towards becoming market economies, these countries received substantial FDI inflows and have established themselves as export platforms, notably vis-à-vis EU countries. The automotive industry constitutes the prime example of this (see IMF, 2013). As noted by Iossifov (2014), cross-border production sharing has recently intensified within the CEEC region, following the setting up and subsequent expansion of regional industrial clusters. Damijan et al. (2013) find that inward FDI in CEEC has altered their export composition and positively affected total factor productivity. They also fostered the development of production networks in CEEC leading to increased trade integration of the region (Kaminsky and Ng, 2005). Behar and Freund (2011) find that following the 2004 EU enlargement, intra-EU trade in intermediate goods has become more sophisticated, and the role of countries joining the EU as suppliers of intermediate goods for the incumbent countries has increased. While structural factors, such as proximity to consumer markets and natural resource endowments, play a role in the development of global value chains, Pathikonda and Farole (2016) argue that there is substantial scope for policies to contribute to this process. They distinguish between longer-term policies facilitating investment in capabilities (e.g. development of physical, human and institutional capital) and other structural policies (e.g. connectivity, market access, wage competitiveness), which help to shape the GVC participation over a shorter time horizon. Bajgar and Javorcik (2017), using data on Romanian manufacturing sector, provide evidence that the presence of MNEs has positive spillovers on the quality of exports by domestic firms. This occurs in particular via backward vertical spillovers, as MNEs demand inputs of higher quality from domestic firms. They conclude that policies promoting FDI would hence help stimulating product quality in host economies. This article also relates to a series of recent studies using international input–output tables. The latter investigate, among others, the following issues: the correction of multiple counting of intermediate products in trade flows (Koopman et al., 2010); the measurement of foreign demand and trade elasticities (Bussière et al., 2013); the reshuffling of the geographical and sectorial composition of the trade basket, affecting competitiveness indicators either based on gross trade weights, such as effective exchange rates (Bems and Johnson, 2012; Bayoumi et al., 2013), or on the export structure, such as the revealed comparative advantage (Koopman et al., 2010); the effect on bilateral trade balances (Nagengast and Stehrer, 2014); and spillover channels across countries and sectors (Acemoglu et al., 2015). The remainder of the article is structured as follows. “Cross-border production sharing – stylised facts” section briefly discusses stylized facts on cross-border production sharing worldwide. “Empirical strategy” section presents our data sources, GVC metrics and empirical strategy as well as empirical results from a gravity model augmented by FDI stock. “Robustness tests” section presents a robustness test and “Conclusions” section concludes.",21

Although some socio-economic studies have focused on the financialization and marketisation of our societies, mainstream economics attach little importance to these issues. Most of the papers praise the contribution of finance to growth, and very few appraise the level of financial activity that could be optimal. There is a broad consensus among economists that financial markets are important to achieving strong economic growth. However, in certain circumstances, it could be argued that financial deepening may hurt. This issue began to emerge following the financial crisis (Main Street versus Wall Street). In their provocatively article titled “Too much finance?”, Arcand et al. (2015) determine that an increase in credit above a certain threshold, estimated at around 100% of GDP, is damaging to the economy.Footnote 1 Taking a completely different approach, albeit with a fairly similar objective, Philippon (2010) shows that excessive growth in the financial sector can lead to poor allocation of talents. This article builds on these ideas by exploring the growth in trading activity and, more specifically, stock market transactions. The aim is to identify the potential problems the excessive growth in stock trading may bring and to survey the literature that has identified them. We begin by setting out some stylised facts. Since the liberalisation and the demutualization of the stock markets, it is difficult to quantify the total amount of stock trades. I have used several sources to build a global database covering all countries over a 40-year period (1975–2015), which includes trades performed on historical stock exchanges, but also certain alternative platforms. The value of stock traded provides a key indicator of the growing importance of finance and its influence. Even more than market capitalisation, it helps us to assess a fundamental feature of the financialization. In forty years, between 1975 and 2015, global stock market trades have risen from $300 billion to $115,000 billion.Footnote 2 This increase is equally staggering when calculated as a percentage of world income, rising from 5% of GDP in 1975 to nearly 150% today. At the same time, the average investment horizon has decreased eightfold from 4 years to 6 months, with a majority of investments which barely last few milliseconds… How has this explosion of activity benefited the economy? Although this question is tackled in many public debates, albeit coloured by implicit ideologies, it is surprisingly rarely addressed in the academic literature. We then review the various arguments and the way they are structured. Generally speaking, the increase in trading volumes is seen in a positive light: an improvement in liquidity helps to reduce the cost of capital and, as such, should have a positive impact on investment and growth. However, it is very likely that this relationship is nonlinear and that the marginal effect is decreasing. Furthermore, modern financial theory advocates reducing the number of trades due to the significant challenges involved in “beating the market”. Many theoretical and empirical studies have even suggested that above a certain threshold, the increase in trading volumes has a negative effect. The reasons for this are, firstly, that the shortening of investment horizons puts pressure on listed companies, whereas the involvement of long-term investors seems favourable. Secondly, research in behavioural finance has shown that investors are often over-confident and therefore perform too many trades. Finally, this upward trend in trading volumes has brought with it a lack of transparency and a growing distrust of the markets. To conclude, we set out some of the reforms that have been introduced to, if not reduce, then at least limit this growth. These measures have all had a very limited effect. Only comprehensive reforms of the way stock markets are organised could reverse this trend. Ultimately, these issues take us deeper than trading volume to question the very purpose of markets.",2

Some, such as Schumpeter, recognized the role of financial institutions in identifying innovative and productivity enhancing projects and channeling resources to them, while others as diverse as Joan Robinson and Robert Lucas demurred.Footnote 1 In any event, the role of finance in economic growth got scant attention in both discussions of economic development and of explanations of economic growth. Growth theory begins with the Harrod–Domar Keynesian approach in the early postwar period which is followed a decade later by the neoclassical Solow–Swan model; although very different, both approaches emphasize the role of capital accumulation. The early development literature emphasized planning mechanisms and financial repression and left no role for resource mobilization and allocation by market-oriented financial institutions. There were, of course, some exceptions including economic historians and some economists on the fringes who were interested in financial intermediation and aware of its importance. Among the historians, Goldsmith’s 1969 book Financial Structure and Development, for example, often receives only passing attention in reference lists of articles using modern data and techniques. It is deeply representative of the tradition that views a balanced combination of data and narrative as the path to better understanding of not just whether but how financial factors influence growth.Footnote 2 Among mainstream economists, pioneers such as Gurley and Shaw (1955) and later McKinnon (1973), coming from development economics, emphasized how institutional change can loosen bottlenecks that impede the smooth flow of credit that is so crucial for modernization. Goldsmith collected data on financial intermediary activity in 35 countries for long time periods and documented the relationships between the depth of financial intermediation and economic well-being in what might be called the first paper on the finance-growth nexus. Levine (2005) notes Goldsmith’s caution: he did not claim causality, he did not control for other determinants of growth, and he asked whether the depth of intermediation is an appropriate measure of financial sector activity. Data-driven studies of the determinants of economic growth around the world began to appear in the early 1990s as more data on growth and country characteristics became availableFootnote 3 (see importantly, Barro 1991; Levine and Renelt 1992). King and Levine (1993) added financial sector measures to the standard cross-section framework and concluded (p. 734) that “indicators of the level of financial development-the size of the formal financial intermediary sector relative to GDP, the importance of banks relative to the central bank, the percentage of credit allocate to private firms, and the ratio of credit issued to private firms to GDP-are strongly and robustly correlated with growth, the rate of physical capital accumulation, and improvements in the efficiency of capital allocation.” They addressed the issue of causality by regressing decade average growth rates on initial levels of the financial variables. Other papers introduced newly developed panel VAR estimation and instrumental variables techniques to deal with causality (Levine et al. 2000; Rousseau and Wachtel 2000). Although the finance-growth nexus driven by the evidence from cross-section and panel studies was widely accepted by the turn of the century, it was not without critics (see Trew 2006; Wachtel 2001). The major concern involved the fact that it is difficult to distinguish idiosyncratic differences among countries from the finance growth relationship. However, the criticism was muted by other studies which utilize historical data over long periods of time. Wachtel and Rousseau (1995) and Rousseau and Wachtel (1998) used long data series to establish the finance causes growth hypothesis in industrial countries. Rousseau and Wachtel (1998) use vector error correction models to establish the quantitative importance of long-run relationships among measures of financial depth, real per capita levels of output and the monetary base. Granger causality tests indicate a leading role for the financial depth variables in real sector activity. The combination of cross-section studies with post-1960 data and historical studies with data going back a century, both using modern econometric techniques, provided a firm empirical basis for the finance-growth nexus. By the early 2000s, the number of published papers reached into the hundreds (for surveys, see Levine 2005; Ang 2008; Panizza 2014). The success of this literature is undeniable, yet a less sanguine undercurrent continues to question whether the policy prescriptions informed by such studies are too simple and whether a “one-size-fits-all” approach to financial development can be as harmful to growth in some cases as it can be helpful in others. Rousseau and Wachtel (2002) show that the relationship is affected by a country’s experience with inflation. There is a threshold between annual inflation rates of 13 and 25% where the effect of financial deepening on growth disappears completely. Rioja and Valev (2004) showed how the size and strength of the nexus relationship varies with the level of economic development. It is strongest among middle-income countries and weakest among poor countries. Recent work by Arcand et al. (2015) and Law and Singh (2014) indicates that the nexus weakens when financial depth exceeds a threshold of about 100% of GDP. Finally, and importantly, Rousseau and Wachtel (2011) show that the nexus relationship weakened with the passage of time; the robust relationships seen in the initial panel studies that used data for the period 1960–1989 largely disappear with data for 1990–2004. There are several possible explanations for this which we will examine below when we turn to efforts to bridge the gap between the finance-growth nexus and the boom–crisis (or leverage fragility) nexus.",8
60,1,Comparative Economic Studies,12 December 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-017-0043-3,Nonlinearities in the Relationship Between Finance and Growth,March 2018,Ugo Panizza,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The idea that finance plays a key role in the process of economic development was central in the work of Bagehot (1873) and Schumpeter (1911). More recently, Levine (2005) described the four main mechanisms through which finance can promote economic development: pooling savings; facilitating exchange; improving capital allocation through the production of ex ante information about investment opportunities; and increasing investors’ willingness to finance new projects through ex post monitoring. However, Bagehot himself suggested that there can be decreasing returns to finance: “If such a man [a banker] is very busy, it is a sign of something wrong. Either he is working at detail, which subordinates would do better … or he is engaged in too many speculations” (Bagehot 1873, p. 214). The possible social costs of very large financial sectors have also been emphasized by Minsky (1974), Kindleberger (1978), and Tobin (1984). Minsky (1974) and Kindleberger (1978) suggested that the process of financial deepening may increase macroeconomic volatility. They wrote extensively about financial instability and financial manias. More recently, Rajan  (2005) suggested that financial markets can become victims of their own success. In an article that was controversial in 2005 (see the discussions by Kohn 2005 and Summers 2005) but looks almost prophetic after the global financial crisis, Rajan argued that the longer financial systems prove to be reliable, the more demands will be placed on their services. In this situation, the process of financial deepening may lead to a large and complicated financial system and to an accumulation of vulnerabilities that may then result into a “catastrophic meltdown.” Tobin (1984), instead, focused on the possibility that a large financial system may lead to a misallocation of human resources. Specifically, he worried about the fact that the financial sector could “steal” talents from the productive sectors of the economy. Like Minsky (1974) and Kindleberger (1978), he was also worried that possible benefits (in terms of liquidity and price discovery) of a large financial sector could be offset by the creation of useless or even harmful financial instruments. His solution to this problem was a transaction tax (which became to be known as the “Tobin Tax”) aimed at limiting the incentives to use financial instruments for pure speculative purposes. This paper starts with a quick review of the empirical literature on the positive link between finance and growth; it then describes the literature that has shown that the marginal contribution of financial depth to economic growth becomes negative when credit to the private sector exceeds about 100 per cent of GDP (the “too much finance” result) and assesses the robustness of this finding. The paper concludes by describing the possible channels through which a very large financial sector can slow down economic growth and by highlighting possible avenues for future research.",8

Demetriades,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"There is little doubt that well-functioning banking systems can help promote economic growth and can facilitate access to financial services for broad sections of the population. Sound financial intermediaries are trusted by small savers and can, therefore, mobilize savings; in so doing, they automatically widen access to financial services. In addition, they provide the financial infrastructure for the payments system upon which day to day economic activity relies. Resilient ATM networks, efficient mobile and online payment services, card services and clearing systems are all important ingredients in facilitating transactions that support economic exchange among households, firms and government in any economy. Moreover, well-functioning banks provide the infrastructure that is essential for firms engaging in international trade and facilitate the flow of capital across borders. Last but not least, they are able to effectively address asymmetric information problems inherent in credit markets and, by doing so, provide financing solutions to high-quality investment projects that contribute to inclusive economic growth. The ability of finance to underpin economic growth and to widen access to financial services is well known and relatively undisputed. Reality, however, paints a rather different picture. Although we have some examples where finance has worked well for some of the time, we also have numerous failures, culminating in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 from which many economies have yet to fully recover. By and large, financial sector policies, including those intended to promote the development of the financial system in LDCs and regulation in developed countries, have often failed to deliver stable banking systems. Even where full-blown financial crises have been avoided, financial fragility has led to economic stagnation and protracted balance sheet recessions. Specifically, finance has not made much of a difference to the poorest countries in the world, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). While in principle financial systems could have helped to lift millions of people out of poverty, SSA banking systems remain highly underdeveloped and unconnected to the process of economic growth.Footnote 1 In Asia, where financial deepening has been more evident in the last 30 years, liberalization was frequently followed by significant bouts of instability, including the East Asian financial crisis of the late 1980s. Even in countries that experienced high growth rates in the past, such as Japan in the post-WWII period and China more recently, banking sector weaknesses have been associated with the slowdown of economic growth. In the case of Japan, the economy stagnated for several decades as a result of banking sector fragility. In China, although not enough is known about the recent slowdown, our conjecture is that it is not unrelated to the large volumes of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking system and the over-indebtedness of the corporate sector, including in important industries such as steel. In Latin America, banking systems have remained relatively underdeveloped and captured by ruling elites (Calomiris and Haber 2015). In the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe, weak bank balance sheets, characterized by rising NPLs, are now a significant impediment to growth.Footnote 2
 Last but not least, the subprime crisis in the USA, which transformed itself into a global financial crisis resulting in record bank failures in the USA and much of Western Europe, including Iceland, has shown that even developed financial systems have failed to deliver on many counts. In the last two decades, developed financial systems have not only failed to promote sustainable growth but have had widespread deleterious socio-economic consequences with political ramifications. To start with, the large bailout bills to save banks in industrialized countries have been the main cause behind the deterioration of public finances and the increase in sovereign debt. This has, in turn, caused a fiscal squeeze often leading to austerity policies that have weighed heavily on aggregate demand and slowed down the recovery from the crisis, with many unintended social and political consequences. Moreover, the bursting of house price bubbles in the USA and many countries in Europe has caused balance sheet recessions from which many economies have yet to recover fully. Finally, the global financial crisis has exposed weaknesses in the euro’s architecture that have threatened and continue to threaten its survival, something that could have unimaginable political consequences. What, in effect, has happened over the last two decades is that banking systems in many regions of the world have become larger and at the same time more fragile and prone to crises.Footnote 3 As a result, financial development has, in effect, become almost synonymous with financial fragility—it is not an exaggeration to argue that recent experience shows that it is the other side of the same coin. The purpose of this paper is to put forward three plausible, albeit interrelated, hypotheses why and how banking sector development has gone wrong. While we do not ‘test’ these hypotheses empirically, we analyse an important case study of a recent banking crisis in the euro area that is consistent with these hypotheses. Beyond our case study, the three hypotheses could form the basis of a new research agenda that we believe would be very fruitful. The first hypothesis is akin to a Lucas critique. We believe that policies to promote financial sector development, including financial deregulation, backfired because the empirical relationships that may have existed in the data from the early 1960s to the mid-1980s were not structural ones; hence, when policymakers tried to use (or abuse them), they broke down. The second hypothesis is a political economy one. Ruling elites in many countries captured the process of financial development to further their own interests. In some cases, especially in some of the poorest countries in the world, this has meant financial underdevelopment but in many other cases this resulted in financial development of the ‘wrong kind’, e.g. regulatory capture and excess levels of household credit, reflecting over-indebtedness. The third and final hypothesis relates to institutional weaknesses. Many countries have failed to reach a minimal threshold level of institutional development, particularly in relation to the rule of law and the enforcement of contracts that are necessary to underpin healthy credit market development. While such weaknesses are almost self-evident in the poorest countries in the world, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, they are often present in much more developed economies. These hypotheses are put forward in “Three Hypotheses”. “Case Study: The Political Economy of the Cyprus Banking Crisis” provides our case study relating to the recent banking crisis in Cyprus, which demonstrates that the three hypotheses are indeed interrelated. Specifically, that experience shows that power elites can benefit from both rapid financial development and weaknesses in institutions such as prudential regulation and rule of law. Although such a set-up is prone to financial fragility and crisis, the ruling elite can maintain its grip on power, even if it has to adapt to new circumstances.",5
60,1,Comparative Economic Studies,15 December 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-017-0044-2,To What Extent Do Public Authorities Verify the Cost-Effectiveness of Guarantees for Credit to SMEs?,March 2018,Sebastian Schich,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"OECD economies are experiencing a trend decline in potential output growth with weak investment and total factor productivity. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are often considered as an important potential source for more dynamism, and thus, in the current juncture, heightened attention is being placed on the potential obstacles of such firms to invest and grow as well as to the policy instruments used to overcome such obstacles. Small firms are important potential drivers of real economic activity growth, not least because every company, large or small, started as a small company at one point. To be able to grow, however, a small company needs funding. But SMEs often face funding constraints. As a result of informational asymmetries and the high risk associated with SME funding, reflecting limited collateral and a high churn rate among such entities, as well as deficiencies in existing credit reporting systems, SMEs tend to lack access to finance. This situation has motivated policy intervention to facilitate SME access to finance, and such interventions were extended in many countries during the last decade in response to the global financial crisis. Policy support for SMEs takes different forms. It includes direct lending facilities, lending by state-owned financial institutions, and publicly supported credit guarantee schemes (CGS). The latter, especially if providing partial guarantees, are generally considered to lead to fewer market distortions compared to other types of policy interventions (Minelli and Modica 2009; Arping et al. 2010), as they typically involve more limited interference in credit allocation. In fact, private banks maintain a significant and originating role as part of the credit generation process (Kraemer-Eis et al. 2017). While CGS do not alleviate information asymmetries directly and do not address the root of the diagnosed market failure, they can nonetheless increase the incentives of lenders to supply credit to SMEs by providing a substitute for collateral, and if designed correctly, increase overall welfare (Chatzouz et al. 2017). Such arrangements have existed in several OECD economies for many decades and have been introduced in several emerging and transition economies during the 1990s. Where among the latter, such arrangements do not yet exist, policy advice routinely suggests establishing such an arrangement. To deliver their desired benefits, CGS need to be appropriately designed and implemented, however. To see how appropriate is the design, the performance of a CGS can be assessed against the objectives it is tasked to achieve. The benefits of CGS include in particular that SMEs with viable business opportunities receive the necessary funding that they otherwise would not have received. By contrast, costs arise to the extent that unviable SMEs obtain finance, which keeps them alive and prevents them from exiting the market, thus blocking the space for potentially better-performing firms. Thus, a key practical policy question is whether CGS are being successful in overcoming the financial constraints of a significant number of viable SMEs, while at the same time avoiding to keep alive unviable firms that would otherwise exit from the market (assuming that delaying such exit is not part of CGS objectives). To answer this question, the performance of CGS needs to be evaluated against their objectives to see to what extent some of their design elements may need to be changed so as to allow them to overcome the diagnosed market failure more effectively. A cost-effectiveness of CGS is required. Such an analysis is required for a number of reasons. First, regardless of the specific legal aspects surrounding the management of CGS and ownership, most if not all CGS can be considered to be “publicly supported” in the sense that they are seen as serving a valid public interest. As a result of this situation, they are supported by public authorities in a variety of ways, including through the granting of special regulatory treatment, direct regular financial contributions, the provision of counter-guarantees or financial contributions in exceptional circumstances. Second, CGS are considered as having become a structural feature of many financial systems (OECD 2013), and thus, the effects of the activities of such arrangements on SME access to guaranteed bank credit, other bank credits and other less traditional forms of funding need to be better understood. Third, CGS have also been relied upon counter-cyclical tools since the beginning of the financial crisis (Kraemer-Eis et al. 2015). Some countries have undertaken reviews of such use of CGS, and an OEC (2010) survey concludes that, given the severity of the economic downturn and the worsening of SME access to finance, the addition of additional emergency support programmes was an appropriate policy response. That said, the survey also acknowledges that there was some variation of opinion regarding the effectiveness of programmes to ensure SME access to finance and that “only a very few countries have made comprehensive reviews of their Assistance Programmes”. Notwithstanding the surveys’ overall positive assessment, it is useful to be aware of the suggestion that increased activities of CGS in the absence of regular cost-effectiveness evaluations can give rise to implicit fiscal liabilities, which might remain unnoticed for many years, but growing fast before ultimately becoming apparent. Against the background of these various considerations, and in an attempt to help reinvigorate the policy support provided for SMEs, the OECD Committee on Financial Markets (CMF) decided to examine the practices used by member countries’ public authorities to assess the cost-effectiveness of publicly supported credit guarantee programmes for SMEs. As additional background, the need to evaluate both the economic benefits and economic costs of SME support arrangements has been recognised as part of recent initiatives to strengthen the role and activities of SMEs by developing high-level principles on SME (G20/OECD 2015) and on credit guarantee arrangements (World Bank/FIRST Initiative 2015; Calice 2016). These initiatives notwithstanding, there exists no generally agreed method of evaluating CGS activities. To find out more about different national approaches in this regard, the CMF decided to review the different approaches taken by public authorities among OECD member and other countries to such cost–benefit evaluations and circulated a questionnaire developed in collaboration with the European Commission Joint Research Centre among OECD and EC members.Footnote 1 The aim was to allow participants to learn from others about what approaches are being used and what specific characteristics of such approaches are considered particularly helpful. The present article, drawing on a synthesis of the responses obtained from OECD and EC member country authorities to the survey (Schich et al. 2017), argues that there are areas for improvement in the performance evaluation of CGS in many cases.",1

As a reaction, new regulatory rules covering shadow banking as well as the implementation of macroprudential policies have emerged as remedies to such limitations. These innovations are important challenges from a policy perspective that require a sound theoretical understanding of the issues at stake. This paper argues that the emergence of bubbles plays a key part in the endogenous building of financial imbalances and should be part of the theoretical toolkit on which regulation is based. Consequently, the understanding of the link between bubbles and crises should shed light on the advantages and drawbacks of some of the newly proposed regulatory measures and particularly on macroprudential policy. Indeed, as emphasized by Benes et al. (2014, p. 4) “the critical macroprudential policy trade-off is between reducing the risks of very costly financial crises and minimizing the costs of macroprudential policies during normal times.” There is nowadays growing empirical evidence on the relationship between excessive credit growth and financial fragility, so that it is tempting to focus on credit and disregard bubbles in order to understand the endogenous building of systemic risk. This would be erroneous in so far as an increase in the volume of credit could be the result of an increase in the (solvent) demand for loans or in its supply, which results from changes in some exogenous variables. Per se, the evolution of credit tells us nothing about the driving forces behind it. The existence of bubbles, instead, offers a rationale for the demand of credit, and the bubble on the equilibrium price of the corresponding asset depends upon the supply of credit. This is the reason why the analysis of bubbles is particularly interesting. Indeed, it provides a framework where both the demand for credit and the supply for credit, often guaranteed by the price of the asset, increase as asset prices increase. From the policy perspective, “Research on asset prices, credit, and intermediation should help to identify risks and inform decisions about the costs and benefits from a possible regulatory or monetary policy decision attempting to deal with a potential asset price bubble” (Kohn 2009). Obviously, the existence of bubbles is not the only approach to explain credit cycles and systemic crises. Indeed, alternative approaches, such as the behavioral approach to loan screening (Berger and Udell 2004), business-cycle-related changes in credit standards (Lown and Morgan 2006; Maddaloni and Peydró 2011) and credit cycles (Kiyotaki and Moore 1997; Dell’Ariccia and Marquez 2006), provide justifications that are fully in line with the existing empirical evidence. There are many ways to model bubbles, some of which we briefly describe below. There is a divide in the literature between the rational and the behavioral approach to bubbles modeling. The empirical evidence is consistent with both, although experimental economics has shown the limits of rational behavior as bubbles could develop in experiments even with a finite number of trading periods (Smith et al. 1988). Nevertheless, when the ultimate objective is to try to draw some lessons regarding macroprudential policy, the behavioral approach has a number of limitations that makes it impracticable. First, although it is easy to reject rational behavior, it is more difficult to replace it with a specific pattern of limited rationality or irrational behavior. Second, even if a specific irrational behavior is identified as representative of consumers preferences, it is not clear how to construct a measure of welfare that takes into account the irrational behavior. Since, in order to build a strong foundation for macroprudential policy, it is essential to have a welfare function to compare the efficiency of the different policies, we will focus here exclusively on the theory of rational bubbles and its implications on macroprudential policy. The structure of the paper is the following: in “Credit Growth, Bubbles and Crises: Empirical Evidence” section, we examine the existing empirical literature that links financial crises to credit expansion, leverage and bubbles. In “Bubbles and Crises” section, we survey the main theoretical results on bubbles. “The Theory of Rational Bubbles” section is then devoted to the role bubbles may have in a market characterized by financial frictions. “Bubbles and Credit Rationing” section considers the impact of financial intermediation, and “Bubbles and Financial Intermediation” section the macroprudential implications of the existence of bubbles is explored. “Macroprudential Policy Implications: Through
the Bubble Lens” section concludes.",5

P2P lending platforms offer credit through Internet, relying on big data and algorithms to assess credit risk and to monitor borrowers. In doing so, they are a part of the wider Fintech movement, defined as the use of technology and of technology-facilitated new business models in the provision of financial services. As incumbent financial institutions suffer from inefficiencies, high leverage, too big to fail problems, opacity and rent-seeking, the entry of Fintech firms may be seen as an opportunity of making financial intermediation more transparent, efficient and stable. The objective of our paper is to explore the role of P2P lending platforms through the prism of the theory of financial intermediation. A financial intermediary is an economic agent that specializes in the activities of buying and selling financial claims. According to Greenbaum et al. (2015), financial intermediaries perform two functions in the financial system (i) a brokerage role and (ii) maturity and risk transformation. A financial intermediary performs the role of a broker when it matches agents with complementary financial needs. Essentially, a broker is a matchmaker that helps to resolve pre-contract and post-contract information asymmetries (i.e., adverse selection and moral hazard). It develops specific skills in interpreting signals on the quality of a financial asset and is able to avoid costly duplication of screening costs by reusing information (both across individuals and time). The brokerage activity includes: transaction services, financial advice, screening and certification of quality (i.e., rating), origination, issuance and funding. A financial intermediary performs also maturity and risk transformation, because it matches liabilities with assets of different duration, sizes, currencies and risks. Banks perform both types of activities (brokerage and asset transformation). P2P lending platforms represent a new mode of financial intermediation, raising several issues. Do P2P lending platforms perform both functions (brokerage and maturity and risk transformation) in their activity and what is their value added? Are they more efficient than banks in performing some of their traditional functions? Do they use a different matching technology? How do they manage risks and how do they price their services? Our paper is structured as follows. Section “The Business Model of the P2P Lending Platforms” defines the business model of P2P lending platforms. Sections “The Brokerage Role of P2P Lending Platforms” and “Toward maturity and risk transformation?” describe how P2P lending platforms perform two main functions of the financial intermediation activity: the brokerage role and maturity and risk transformation. Section “The Value Added of the P2P Lending Platforms” provides some preliminary thoughts about the value added of the P2P lending platforms. Section “Conclusions” concludes.",33
60,1,Comparative Economic Studies,20 February 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-018-0055-7,"Money, Finance and Climate: The Elusive Quest for a Truly Integrated Assessment Model",March 2018,Etienne Espagne,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The DICE (Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy) model developed by Nordhaus (1993) starting in the early 1990s will be our case study. It is the most widely used model in the academic world of climate economists, and the first model proposing a synthesis between neo-classical growth theory (Solow 1956) and the climate question. A very detailed critique of this model can be found in Pottier (2016). Without reproducing the entire structure of the model and its equations, we schematize its most salient features in Fig. 1. All the links between climate change and the economy in the model are concentrated in the damage function, which translates into monetary terms the effects of an increase in the average atmospheric and oceanic temperatures. The main modules of the DICE model: the economic module generates emissions which disturb the dynamics of the carbon cycle. Through a radiative forcing, the increase in the emissions in the carbon cycle generates a temperature increase. The cycle between temperature increase and the economy is closed through the damage function, which represents a monetary valuation of climate impacts Two aspects are crucial in the monetary evaluation of climate damages: first, the form of the damage function itself, which is based on uncertain empirical grounds; second, the way damages affect the economy (output, productivity, population growth, etc.) The damage function in the DICE model uses the most optimistic assumptions (Moyer et al. 2014): damages have a quadratic form, and simply affect the level of production in each period. With this structure, the losses linked to climate change only reach 10% of world GDP at the end of the century, while the growth in temperatures would reach 6 °C in the same period. The climate crisis is thus structurally of second order in comparison with the long-run growth of the economy. Less favorable assumptions lead to far more massive impacts on growth (Dietz and Stern 2015) and could even lead to a contraction of the world economy before the end of the century. These recent more pessimistic simulations are confirmed by new empirical assessments of the damages from climate change for the USA (Hsiang et al. 2017). Any variation on the form of the damage function, on the economic variables affected by these damages, or on its perception by economic agents (Stern 2007; Espagne et al. 2018), tends to increase the monetary impact of climate change on the economy, compared with the original DICE model. In particular, the notion of catastrophic damages, of very low probability of occurrence and huge impacts, leads to a totally different implications: ambitious climate policies are necessary as soon as possible (Weitzman 2009) because they act as an insurance mechanism against catastrophic outcomes. This contrasts with the initially modest and progressive efforts proposed by Nordhaus. These variations on the form of the damage function account for the diversity of monetary impacts that climate change can have on the economy. However, these different estimates do not provide a representation of the financial flows which would not be “aligned” with the 2 °C or even the 1.5 °C objective, as article 2 of the Paris Agreement officially states. Economic agents cannot have a biased understanding of damages or of climate policies because financial markets in these models give the best available information to all economic agents. Financial markets are considered by assumption as complete, or perfect, so that the modeler does not even feel the need to explicitly include them. To be fair, DICE and its numerous avatars include some sort of financial market. It is even possible to formalize this in an evolution of the preceding graph. Figure 2 shows the implicit hypothesis regarding a financial sector of the majority of IAMs in the DICE type. The financial sector only appears through the equality between savings and investment, so that in the original model, savings do not even appear. In these models the representative agent has full information which implies an investment trajectory which is also the savings trajectory. The DICE model relies on the idea of an efficient financial sector: efficient to the point of becoming invisible in the equations themselves. What type of crisis can appear in such a modeling environment? Which uncertainty regarding the scope of climate change can modify the dynamics of the economy through the expectations of the financial sector? Several recent papers have attempted to answer these questions without renouncing the simple reductionist financial framework of the DICE model. This recent works makes use of one of two equally unsatisfying modeling choices regarding the introduction of uncertainty. The implicit financial sector of the DICE model: savings being at each period equal to investment, the financial sector only has one asset. The representative agent, operating in perfect expectations, takes into account all the available information on future climate damages. This information is immediately reflected in the price of the unique financial asset On the one hand, you can consider that only probabilities can be explicitly represented. This amounts to a certainty equivalence version of DICE, where possible future outcomes are only weighted according to a predetermined distribution of outcomes. Efficient financial markets react to this “certain weighted” choice in an absolutely rational way according to their degree of risk aversion and time preference.Footnote 4 There is of course a form of portfolio optimization among the different possible future outcomes. But no systemic crisis can appear, which would imply the arrival of totally unanticipated information affecting all possible futures. This certainty equivalence approach is the (unsatisfying) way of representing uncertainty in most IAMs derived from the DICE model. Such a restricted framework has been used to evaluate the financial losses linked to some mitigation scenarios (Dietz et al. 2016). It is no surprise, based on their underlying assumptions, that these authors reach relatively optimistic conclusions regarding the potential financial losses linked to climate change scenarios (i.e., 1.77% of average present value of global financial assets at risk from climate change between 2015 and 2100 in a 2.5 °C scenario, 1.18% in a 2 °C scenario). Dietz et al. (2016) has the merit of being one of the first studies of the effect of climate risks for the financial system. However, the work has at least three important biases in my view: (1) a model derived from DICE in order to deduce growth trajectories (which minimizes a priori the impact of climate damages on growth); (2) the hypothesis (simple but wrong) that the present value of finance covers the entire present value of the real economy; and (3) an analysis of financial risk with a Value at Risk approach (that minimizes the possibility of extreme events). On the other hand, you can consider that new (and unexpected) information, on the real nature of climate damages for example, would perturbate the initially forecasted dynamics of the economy. In this case, we talk about stochastic shocks, which are really unanticipated, even if the distribution of possible values of the shock is, itself, well known to the modeler. All endogenous variables are, however, supposed to regain an optimal trajectory as soon as the shock dissipates. Models of the DSGE type, derived from DICE, allow for this kind of representation of extreme and unforecasted events. They have begun to be applied to environmental questions as well (Golosov et al. 2014). Although the DSGE literature has enormously expanded the representation of financial dynamics since the financial crisis (Iacoviello 2015), it remains mute when the interactions between finance and the environment are at stake. Results from these two modeling options can help justify proposed financial sector initiatives related to climate finance, such as favoring the transparency of carbon-related information in financial portfolios which offers financial actors the opportunity to respond rationally to incoming climate change information or policy changes. Such an approach is in article 173 of the energy transition law in France and is part of the recommendations of the Taskforce on climate-related financial disclosure of the Financial Stability Board. The explicit goal of such initiatives is to transform climate uncertainty into a simple financial risk, in other words, to re-establish the illusion of a perfect efficiency of finance (Christophers 2017).",10
60,1,Comparative Economic Studies,13 February 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-018-0053-9,Financial Literacy and Asset Behaviour: Poor Education and Zero for Conduct?,March 2018,Luc Arrondel,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Financial literacy is generally defined as a specific component of human capital whereby individuals are able to make use of relatively simple concepts to make suitable financial decisions (savings, investment and debt). This concept therefore covers various aspects: cognitive abilities, financial culture, and information collection and processing capacities. Although the economist’s modern concept of financial literacy seems to be relatively recent, the idea of familiarising individuals with savings, especially at a young age, is ancient. School savings banks were established in many countries back in the early twentieth century (Garon 2011). Closer to home in France, savings banks (Caisses d’Epargne et de Prévoyance) were handing out “savings picture books” to our little ones to develop “school savings” in the 1960s. Yet it was probably not until the early 2000s, in an “individual promotion” policy-friendly climate, that what we mean by “financial literacy” today really emerged, namely with the launch of the OECD Financial Literacy programme. This movement took shape in France with the creation of the Public Financial Literacy Institute (IEFP) in 2006, the Cité de l’Economie et de la Monnaie (economics museum) in 2011 and, more recently, the Banque de France My Money Questions website in early 2017. The OECD Council defines financial education as, “the process by which financial consumers/investors improve their understanding of financial products, concepts and risks and, through information, instruction and/or objective advice, develop the skills and confidence to become more aware of financial risks and opportunities, to make informed choices, to know where to go for help, and to take other effective actions to improve their financial well-being”. Financial literacy needs to be viewed in the light of “standard” saver theory to be able to situate its role in individuals’ financial decisions and ascertain its potential incompetence. This theory is based on dual rationality: rational decision-making based on the maximisation of a utility function and rational expectations where economic agents’ beliefs are supposed to correctly represent future uncertainties. Hence, the most widely accepted model in the profession, the life-cycle hypothesis, postulates that individuals adopt forward-looking, time-consistent behaviour and consume in accordance with their preferences and total resources over their entire lifetimes (Modigliani and Brumberg 1954). Individuals use assets, as a reserve of deferred consumption, to smooth their consumption over their life cycle in keeping with their income profile (permanent income). This model needs to be combined with Arrow’s theory of optimal portfolio choice (Merton 1969) to explain the composition of these assets over time. Different extensions (market imperfections, consideration of various risks and intergenerational transfers) have also enriched the basic model’s initial message: precautionary savings and portfolio (Kimball 1993), existence of bequests (see Arrondel and Masson 2006), liquidity constraints (Gollier 2001), etc. This standard theory therefore posits, at least implicitly, that individuals have knowledge of certain financial principles to be able to make their decisions, in particular to determine their constraints, such as discounting, inflation and calculation of interest, and that they have a certain amount of information on the financial and economic environment. Psychological economics research programmes on information, financial literacy and cognitive ability tend to show that this is not the case (Lusardi and Mitchell 2014). They find that savers are financially illiterate and have limited cognitive abilities (Lusardi 2009; Guiso and Sodini 2013). They do not have a command of the economic principles required (rational formation of expectations, discounting calculation, valuation of assets, etc.) or they suffer from inadequate knowledge of the financial products or the economic environment (interest rates, stock markets, pensions system, etc.). They make all kinds of “mistakes” of calculation and strategy, but also of expectations in information collection and processing and the formation of their beliefs: non-Bayesian revisions and overconfidence in their judgements. They fall prey to “emotions” against their own interests (impulsiveness, overconfidence, unjustified regret or disappointment, etc.) These different “biases” put forward by behavioural economics are supposed to explain, at least in part, certain empirical puzzles. With respect to saving (Guiso and Sodini 2013), standard theory fails to explain why certain households display an inadequacy of saving able to maintain their consumption level in retirement (approximately 20% in France) and little use of annuity (annuity puzzle). Similarly, in portfolio choice, standard theory finds it hard to justify the low level of asset diversification (limited asset market participation puzzle), especially in risky assets, as much in terms of amount (equity premium puzzle: Mehra and Prescott 1985; Kocherlakota 1996) as holdings (stock participation puzzle: Haliassos 2003). Lastly, in addition to saver theory, biases observed in household securities portfolio management also take issue with standard theory: “home” biases in favour of national shares, “naïve” (uniform) diversification, the “disposition” effect whereby investors part with winning assets too soon and losing assets too late, the status quo bias, inertia, excessive trading (Vissing-Jorgensen 2004), etc. Ignorance about assets and all kinds of information costs are evidently behind the observed incompleteness and diversity of portfolios. A large body of recent literature looks into factors related to this information that appear to play an important role in stock participation: cognitive abilities (Christelis et al. 2010; Grinblatt et al. 2011), trust (Guiso et al. 2008), financial “awareness” (Guiso and Jappelli 2005), time spent obtaining information (Guiso and Jappelli 2007), social interactions (Hong et al. 2004; Arrondel et al. 2017), optimism (Jouini et al. 2006) and financial literacy (van Rooij et al. 2011; Lusardi and Mitchell 2014). However, the precise mechanism by which these factors influence households’ financial choices (via the pool of information or expectations, etc.) remains to be largely formalised (Grinblatt et al. 2011). Behavioural economics criticises savers’ omniscience not only on the basis of the rationality of their behaviour, but also on the rationality of their expectations. The hypothesis of rational expectations, especially the homogeneity of beliefs, has been in question for the last 30 years. Behavioural finance cites different cognitive biases in the formation of expectations. Gollier (2013) states that, “It allows people to dream of impossible returns, to refuse [relevant] information that they do not like, or agree to disagree among themselves”. These psychological biases could therefore help explain “the bubbles, cycles and crashes”, especially if they are reinforced by media coverage that is biased itself. The field is also concerned about the “extreme pessimism of economic agents during phases of [acute] crisis”, produced by strong aversion to ambiguity combined with increasingly gloomy expectations of stock prices.",1

Our review of recent literature on the relationship between finance and growth indicates that this literature has actually undergone a paradigm shift in the aftermath of the financial crisis that started in 2007. There was a “pre-crisis consensus” (Beck 2014a) on the finance growth “nexus” that started with work at the World Bank by Thorsten Beck and Ross Levine, on the basis of the work of Schumpeter among others. According to the IDEAS bibliographic database, Beck and Levine have published at least 45 articles dealing with the relationship between finance and growth over the period 1991–2016. The notion of “nexus” captures the idea that finance and growth were linked by a node of simple, first-order, and inextricable relationships that were robustly established in the literature. It was alleged that finance and growth were knotted by a strictly positive and linear correlation, such that one of the main research question remaining was to robustly determine the direction of causality between the two variables (Demetriades and Andrianova 2004, p. 42). In the aftermath of the crisis, a growing body of the empirical literature instead highlighted that the relationship between finance and growth could be a complex Gordian knot: the relationship is often variable, nonlinear, or nonsignificant. This complexity in the nexus was not absent from the pre-crisis consensus, but was underestimated. On the contrary, following Rousseau and Wachtel (2011, 2017), Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2012) and Arcand et al. (2015) and available in an IMF working paper since 2012), the recent literature indicates that the relationship between finance and growth is not systematically positive. Rousseau and Wachtel (2011) show that a “rapid and excessive deepening” of the financial sector may weaken the nexus. Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2012), Law and Singh (2014) and Arcand et al. (2015) put forward the idea of “too much finance.” Their investigations indicate that there is a nonlinear finance–growth relationship suggesting that financial development would be good only up to a point beyond which finance harms economic growth. As Beck (2014a) puts it, “too much of a good thing?” This “too much finance” result is currently becoming the new consensus in the literature. That is there is a bell-shaped or inverted U-shaped relationship implying that beyond a certain threshold, the relationship between growth and finance becomes negative. This new consensus is not entirely new; however, it represents a deepening of the analysis of the relationship between finance and growth. We evolved from a simple nexus to a richer, more complex and more nuanced nexus than before the crisis. Our economic understanding of the finance and growth relationship seems to have developed in the aftermath of the crisis. The “too much finance” result motivates the following questions: What is the threshold from which we derive “too much finance,” in the sense that finance begins to impact growth negatively? What is the optimal level of financial development? Following the crisis, the main issue in the literature is the determination of the threshold of nonlinearity, and less the determination of causality. Beyond the question of the precise threshold figure, exploring the reasons for this potentially nonlinear relationship is currently at the top of the research agenda of those interested in the finance–growth nexus. As the review of the origins of finance and growth literature has already been undertaken (King and Levine 1993; Stolbov 2013; Arcand et al. 2015), we will not discuss this point further. For the same reason, we will also not include the finance and growth literature on the eve of the 2007 financial crisis, which has also been intensively surveyed (Levine 2005; Aghion 2007; Ang 2008; Jacquet and Pollin 2012). The developments in finance and growth literature in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, between 2008 and 2014, have also been the subject of numerous overviews (Boucher et al. 2012; Panizza 2012, 2014; Beck 2013; Pasali 2013). Hence, we will only briefly summarize the major trends for the period 2008–2014. The main goal of this article is to survey the very recent literature, notably since Arcand et al. (2015), and show how it sheds light on a more complex view of the relationship between finance and growth. Our article provides a survey of the core research questions of this very recent state-of-the-art research on the finance growth nexus: How has the Beck–Levine–Schumpeter pre-crisis consensus been refined since the financial crisis? What are the recent developments in the critical issue of how to measure finance? What is the state-of-the-art econometric methodology in the finance and growth literature? What are the techniques employed to test the hypothesis of nonlinearity in the finance and growth relationship? Finally, looking to the future, we present the main directions for future research pointed out in this recent literature; in particular, how to explain nonlinearity in the relationship, how to incorporate regime shifts brought about by the crisis, how to deal with the challenge for finance represented by the ecological transition? The rest of the article is organized as follows. The section “An overview of the impact of the crisis on the finance and growth literature, 2008–2014” briefly synthesizes the advancements of the finance growth nexus literature in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. The section “A new literature?” surveys this literature for the period 2015–2017, following the eminent article Arcand et al. (2015). The section “Unresolved issues and directions for future research” concludes by identifying the current limitations and potential future progress in finance and growth literature.",9

The recent granting of the Nobel Prize to Richard Thaler testifies that there is a change of mind within the economics profession on the need to allow for departures from the paradigm of the “homo economicus”. That is much less the case in mainstream macroeconomics, however. The “homo economicus” continues to reign supreme in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. In these models individual agents maximize an infinite horizon utility function using rational forecasts based on all available information including the information embedded in the model. Nothing really can go wrong in models populated by supreme agents peacefully optimizing and endowed with great cognitive abilities that allow them to understand the complexities of the world. Only exogenous disturbances can get these agents off the rail forcing them to re-optimize. These models then lead to the view that business cycle fluctuations occur as a result of exogenous events (shocks) that force individuals to reconsider their optimal plans. Nothing in the model creates endogenous business cycle movements. Booms and busts are all the result of exogenous disturbances (Smets and Wouters 2007; Galí 2008). We have to do better than that. That’s what we have been trying to do in a series of publications (De Grauwe 2012; De Grauwe and Macchiarelli 2015; De Grauwe and Ji 2017, 2018). We are, of course, not alone in exploring different tracks of macroeconomic modelling. There is a growing number of researchers developing “agent-based” models and “behavioural” macroeconomic models (Alfarano et al. 2005; Tesfatsion and Judd 2006; Colander et al. 2008; Farmer 2008; Farmer and Foley 2009; Gatti et al. 2005; Gabaix 2014; Westerhoff and Franke 2012; Hommes 2016; Hommes and Lustenhouwer 2016; Muellbauer 2016) to name just a few. See also the recent criticism of Blanchard (2017) and the chapters in Gürkaynak and Tille (2017). There are many ways in which one can depart from mainstream macroeconomic models. We have chosen to do so by assuming that agents experience cognitive limitations preventing them from having rational expectations. These agents use simple forecasting rules (heuristics) and evaluate the forecasting performances of these rules ex-post. This evaluation leads them to switch to the rules that perform best. It can be argued that in a world of great complexity that nobody fully understands this adaptive learning is the rational way to deal with this complexity (see Simon 1957; Gigerenzer and Selten 2002; Akerlof and Shiller 2009; Kahneman 2002). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. “Animal Spirits and Business Cycles: The Basic Feature” section provides a short discussion on the basic feature of the behavioural models. (i.e. the role of animal spirits and business cycle). “Animal Spirits and the Optimal Level of the Inflation Target” section discusses an application of a one country behavioural model. This allows us to analyse the issue related to low inflation targets that can cause economies to hit the zero lower bound during deflationary periods caused by shocks. “Animal Spirits and Synchronization of Business Cycles” section discusses another application based on a two-country behavioural model. We use this model to explain the possible channel that could lead to a high degree of synchronization between the business cycles of different countries. We conclude in “Animal Spirits and Synchronization of Business Cycles” section.",4

In the European context, convergence also has a political dimension, as EU policies rest implicitly on the idea of closer integration. Economic divergence would also complicate the conduct of single monetary policy, as it would imply that the euro area is moving further away from an optimal currency area (Wunsch 2013). Not surprisingly, policymakers—especially in the new member states—are quite interested to know how close different performance measures are to some EU average.Footnote 1 This note examines recent evidence on the convergence of per capita incomes in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The motivation for revisiting this well-researched topic is a revival of interest among policymakers in speeding up the convergence process, after it had apparently stalled during the financial crisis of 2008–2012 and the subsequent slow recovery.Footnote 2 It clarifies some pitfalls in common approaches to assessing convergence, takes stock of progress in convergence over the past 2 decades, and asks whether this concept remains a useful goal for economic policy in CEE. There are two main findings. First, the choice of benchmarks can make a significant difference for assessments of convergence. Most studies seem to ignore this “fine print” of data. Second, despite disappointments, the goal of convergence remains a useful anchor for economic policy in CEE. Going forward, it would be important to recognise that convergence is a slow process, but nevertheless requires sustained reforms to avoid prolonged periods of stagnation or pronounced booms and busts. Section “How to assess economic convergence?” discusses methodological issues. Section “How much convergence is still out there?” reviews evidence on convergence in CEE. Section “Is convergence a useful policy goal?” asks what the lack of convergence may imply for economic policy.",5
60,2,Comparative Economic Studies,02 March 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-018-0059-3,The Political Economy of Populism: An Empirical Investigation,June 2018,Petar Stankov,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper studies the economic roots of populism in 49 European and Latin American countries since 1980. In political science populism is defined as a “communication style,” a discourse, which tries to be as close to the people but at the same time takes an anti-establishment stance and excludes “specific population segments” from an image of an ideal society (Jagers and Walgrave 2007, p. 475). Typically, populists are extreme right or extreme left parties or leaders who fight against the elite political and corporate establishment (Dalio et al. 2017; Hawkins 2009), emphasizing the us-against-them rhetoric. Economists define populism as an “...approach to economics that emphasizes growth and income distribution and deemphasizes the risks of inflation and deficit finance, external constraints and the reaction of economic agents to aggressive non-market policies” (Dornbusch and Edwards 1990, p. 247). Dalio et al. (2017, p. 2) specify a typical set of those policies in the period after the Great Depression: protectionism, nationalism, increased infrastructure building, increased military spending, greater budget deficits, and capital controls. They find that the causes and evolution of populism across those episodes are so similar that they follow an almost identical pattern. This pattern is described as “populist playbook” by Dalio et al. (2017) and “populist paradigm” by Dornbusch and Edwards (1990). Dornbusch and Edwards (1990) infer that populism ultimately leads to welfare deterioration for most voters initially favoring populist leaders or parties. If history indeed suggests that large groups of people are made worse-off for supporting parties elected to make them richer, then we need a more systematic understanding of the reasons people vote for populists. The literature offers several explanations. First, the depth of a recession affects the likelihood of populist insurgence in Europe and Latin America (Dornbusch and Edwards 1991; Moffitt 2015). Research on Asia has also shown a significant effect of crises on the likelihood of populism. For example, Tejapira (2002) and Hewison (2005) review the rise of economic nationalism in Thailand as a result of economic stagnation which followed the 1997 East-Asian crisis. As the post-crisis reforms created a vast number of losers, economic freedom reforms were rejected in the 2001 elections, creating a far more nationalistic political agenda fitting well into the “populist paradigm.” Therefore, Greskovits (1993) contends that to make populism less likely, all reform packages need to contain an adequate compensation mechanism for the reform losers. If the group of losers is large enough, this would inevitably surface as mounting social discontent which will meet with the supply of populist agendas. Second, normally any reasonable government would create compensation mechanisms to counter-act the persistent unemployment during or after a deep recession. However, the fiscal stance after the Great Recession is different than in previous recessions. Unlike before, governments now need to curb government expenditures exactly when voters need them most because of the high existing levels of government debt. As a result, austerity has been fueling a sense of disenfranchisement among voters. Third, persistent inequality, combined with stagnant growth or outright economic depression, stands at the heart of social discontent which motivates the supply of populist agendas, according to Dornbusch and Edwards (1990) and Kaufman and Stallings (1991). To arrive at this conclusion, both teams review an array of populist episodes in Latin America. Dornbusch and Edwards (1991) argue that “populist regimes have historically tried to deal with income inequality problems through the use of overly expansive macroeconomic policies.” Macroeconomic mismanagement, however, leads to recessions and banking and fiscal crises, which ensued hyperinflation episodes. In turn, this worsened inequality rather than remedy it, thereby hurting the very people who elected populists. Kaufman and Stallings (1991) also predict that populism would become a more isolated political phenomenon, a conclusion which definitely calls for a revision a decade after the Great Recession. In fact, even before the Great Recession it was apparent that populism is coming back to prominence in Latin America as a result of persistent income inequality and stagnant growth in the presence of market-oriented reforms (Roberts 2007). Leon (2014) also argues that the use of macroeconomic redistribution to alleviate income inequality may make populist agendas more likely, and Dornbusch and Edwards (1990) add that large-scale redistribution proposals are a persistent feature of populism in Latin America. Populism has also emerged in other regions of the world. Some countries in Europe are already embracing populist agendas like they used to after the Great Depression (Dalio et al. 2017). Unlike elsewhere, the European brand of populism has a distinctive trait: xenophobia. For a number of years now, and even before the Great Recession, various authors have studied the nascent comeback of populism to the European political scene. According to Jones (2007, p. 37), populists “are making headway across Europe and from all points on the political spectrum”, and a distinctive trait of this comeback is its “xenophobic, anti-immigrant rhetoric”. The reasons for this rhetoric are outlined also by Cahill (2007). He asserts that the immigration waves from “North Africa and Eastern Europe, fear of economic dislocations under European Union enlargement, and the struggles to integrate Muslim immigrants have breathed new life into anti-immigration platforms” (p. 79). Therefore, these platforms may appeal to the large masses of people experiencing discontent from the consequences of austerity, persistent unemployment and stagnant growth in Europe. As a result, the fourth driving factor behind populism is the “migration issue”, i.e., how large is the inflow of foreign-born population in a given country. Fifth, various types of globalization shocks such as increased migration, trade openness, and capital account liberalization have been outlined in the recent study of the populist drivers by Rodrik (2017). Increased trade participation and the alleged export of jobs to cheap labor locations have also played well into the populist rhetoric at times of persistently high unemployment or underemployment. For example, a significant part of the Make America Great Again platform appeal to a large mass of working class voters was based on bringing those allegedly lost jobs back to the USA. Sixth, it has long been established that natural resource rents produce dictator regimes (Sachs and Warner 1999, among others). Some of those regimes are populist. The recent literature has linked the natural resource abundance with populist support (Matsen et al. 2016; Mazzuca 2013). The above literature suggests eight major factors for the rise of populism across the globe: recessions, inflation, unemployment, austerity, income inequality, immigration, trade and financial openness, and natural resource abundance. The analysis below tests if any of those has played a statistically significant role for populist insurgences. However, first we need a way to measure populism.",18

During these eight years, they were clearly converging with the EU-15, as they achieved an average growth of 5.7% a year, to compare with 2.2% a year in the Eurozone. From 2010 to 2016, however, their growth rates were only 2.1% a year on average, admittedly twice the minimal growth of the older EU members, but that barely amounted to any convergence. This observation raises the question what went wrong. Are the CEE countries falling behind? Have they ended up in a middle-income trap? Or are they doing just find but suffer from the global financial crisis and slow growth in the Eurozone in its aftermath? The period 2010–2016 has been a time of lower growth throughout most of the world, so a lower growth is not remarkable in itself. The global credit and commodity boom of 2000–2008 had ended. Most of the world has had lower growth rates after 2008 for numerous reasons. For the CEE, the financial overheating during the years 2004–2007 was obvious. The long-lasting credit boom was most extreme in the three Baltic countries. Since the CEE countries predominantly export to the EU-15, they suffered from the Eurozone crisis. This paper will not pay attention to macroeconomic indicators because all the CEE countries are doing well in this regard with government budgets close to balance, public debt under control, sound foreign balances, and minimal inflation, so these factors are of no concern and certainly no reason for their slowing growth rates. The aim of this paper is exploratory. It investigates seven structural benchmarks, fiscal burden, tax system, labor markets, pensions, governance, education, and research and development. The aim is to find out whether the CEE has diverged from the road of successful economic reforms that it entered soon after the end of communism (World Bank 1996; Åslund 2013).",9

60,3,Comparative Economic Studies,21 December 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-017-0040-6,French Colonial Trade Patterns and European Settlements,September 2018,Tania El Kallab,Cristina Terra,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Economic interests were the main driver of colonization, and trade was one of the main tools of colonial extraction. Mitchener and Weidenmier (2008) assess the impact of colonization on colonial trade flows by adding colonial status dummies to a standard gravity model. They find that trade is twice as large among countries that are part of an empire. We propose to deepen the understanding of the impact of colonialism on trade in three dimensions. First, we investigate whether the share of European settlers in the colonies affected that relation. The colonial dummies used by Mitchener and Weidenmier (2008) indicate whether a country is a colony, but it does not capture the extent and depth to which a country is colonized. The size of European settlements in the colonies can be taken as one measure of the intensity of the colonization, since settling in the colonies was a way to concretize it. Second, we examine the impact of colonization on trade of agricultural and of manufactured goods separately. Looking at sectoral trade, we inspect the pattern of trade between the colonizer and different groups of colonies. Third, we explore differences on the impact of colonialism on trade with the colonizer’s own colonies and with colonies from other empires. More precisely, we examine the trade pattern of France with its own colonies and with colonies of other nations, using a new data set we constructed containing trade data of France with all its trading partners from 1880 to 1913. European powers were able to establish their colonial control by settling in the colonies and exploiting their resources through trade. This assertion is not new to the literature and can be traced back to Lenin and farther back to Hobson and Marxist thinkers who regarded trade as the primary cause of imperialist expansion (Kleiman 1976). French colonization offers a quite representative example: French colonizers settled in the form of military troops, imposed territorial control, and set up trade policies and preferential trade agreements in order to transfer resources from the colony to themselves and to secure favorable markets for their products (Crowder 1968). The presence or absence of European settlers affected the insertion of European trading companies and the type of institutions set up by the colonial administration. In some French colonies in Africa, for instance, where production was in the hands of domestic farmers, European settlers helped create large companies to lobby the colonial government and establish a controlled system of oligopolistic firms. In turn, the colonial administration generally supported the activity of trading companies by implementing coercive institutions (Hopkins 2014). In British colonies, production was often controlled by the European settlers who had a political influence over the colonial government. In that case, the cost of imposing extractive institutions was higher (Tadei 2017). Whether production was organized through small domestic farmers or plantation companies, trade revolved around the activity of European trading firms, whose relation with settlers was crucial. Notice that there are other features of colonization, such as the establishment of currency unions and trade agreements, that also impacted trade and are not necessarily related to the extension of colonial settlements. Trade agreements are likely to not only increase trade among partners to the agreement, but also to affect trade with other partners (Glick et al. 2017). For instance, France applied policies of tariff assimilation/ custom unionFootnote 1 with its colonies to encourage intra-Empire trade, while Great Britain applied an open-door policy. Such policies surely shaped trade patterns of France with British colonies and ought to be accounted for. We try to control for those variables in our empirical investigation. To carry out our empirical investigation, we constructed a new data set on French trade between 1880 and 1913. The data were collected from Tableau General du commerce which is the most complete and reliable database, for it is the official French customs record.Footnote 2 Our data set contains information on bilateral French exports and imports with all trade partners, disaggregated into three sectors: agricultural raw materials, raw materials necessary for industry, and manufactured goods. With data on trade by sector, we are able to examine the pattern of trade between France and the colonies. More specifically, we are able to identify whether the trade was directed toward primary or manufactured products. Using this new data set, we investigate the impact of European settlements on the trade pattern between France and its own colonies, and between France and non-French colonies. Once we establish this relation, we explore whether that impact is related to the institutions brought by the European settlers. Typically, colonies with more European settlers developed more European-style institutions with property rights, checks and balances and accountability (Acemoglu et al. 2001). Higher quality of institutions, in turn, may have had a positive impact on bilateral trade flows due to the lower transaction costs and higher level of trust they produce (Briant et al. 2009; Sousa and Lochard 2012; Groot et al. 2004; Linders 2004). A number of studies has investigated the impact of colonial status on both historical and current trade (Estevadeordal et al. 2002; Mitchener and Weidenmier 2008; Sousa and Lochard 2012), while others have examined the impact of independence on post-colonial trade (Lavallée and Lochard 2015; Head et al. 2010). Some of these studies look at the effect of colonization on bilateral trade (Mitchener and Weidenmier 2008; Rose 1999; Sousa and Lochard 2012) using colonial dummies as an explanatory variable of total bilateral trade, and they find that being colonized exerts a positive impact on total bilateral trade. In our empirical investigation, we add new insights by using European settlements in addition to colonial dummies. Furthermore, we investigate sectoral bilateral trade, instead of only total bilateral trade. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the impact of colonial settlements on trade. We find that greater French settlements increased the overall French imports and exports with French colonies, and the impact is strongest with respect to the imports of raw materials. The British or other European settlements in their respective colonies had either a negative or a nonsignificant impact on the trade of those colonies with France. We then examine the impact of European settlements through colonial institutions. Using principal component analysis, we constructed a new variable capturing the common variability between the three variables capturing institutions, namely democracy, constraints on the executive, and the duration of colonization. To try to disentangle the part of European settlements corresponding to colonial institutions from the residual part corresponding to other channels, we then estimate the predicted value of European settlements explained by this variable that captures institutions. We find that the part of European settlements associated with better formal institutions has a positive impact on French imports of raw material and exports of manufactured goods to their own colonies. These results indicate that strong institutions facilitated the trade of France with their own colonies, and this pattern of trade is likely to be related to the comparative advantages of the trade partners. In non-French colonies, on the other hand, European settlements with better institutional quality do not impact trade between those colonies and France. This paper is organized as follows. The second section presents an overview of the literature examining the link between colonialism and trade. The third section presents the empirical model and the data, and the fourth section presents the baseline results along with the various specifications and robustness checks. The fifth section explores the channels through which settlement might have affected trade. The last section concludes.",2

Carlson (1998) is among the first authors who identified the East–West divide in self-perceived health using data for 35–64-year-old people from 25 Eastern and Western European countries included in the World Values Survey (WVS) 1990. Deaton (2008) uses the Gallup World Poll 2006 to show that countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union report extraordinarily low levels of health satisfaction, representing 11 of the 20 lowest among 132 countries (Deaton 2008).Footnote 1 Jen et al. (2010) use the most extensive data from 60 WVS and European Values Study (EVS) surveys taken in four waves (1981, 1991, 1995–1997 and 1999–2001) across 69 countries and find that nine out of ten countries that reported the highest levels of poor health are transition states. Earlier studies of self-perceived health in transition concentrate on a limited number of countries or years (Carlson 1998; Deaton 2008) and do not compare transition countries to non-transition ones (Bobak et al. 2000; d’Hombres et al. 2010) or do not use the most recent data (Jen et al. 2010). The advantage of this paper over previous studies is the incorporation of all publicly available up to now WVS and EVS waves (Inglehart 1997, 2004) starting from the beginning of transition in 1989. Given their sporadic timing, surveys are combined into three waves: early transition 1989–1997, mid transition in between the Asian and the Global financial crises and late transition starting from the 2008 crisis. This paper uses methodology inspired by recent studies of the happiness gap in transition (i.e. Guriev and Melnikov 2017; Coupe and Obrizan 2017).Footnote 2
 The goal of this paper is to test whether there still exists a transition gap in self-rated health using the most recent available data and a rich set of covariates identified in previous studies. The answer to this question is important from a policy perspective. Health (together with education and income) is among the key determinants of human development in a country.Footnote 3 Transition to a market economy and democracy cannot be considered complete if people in transition countries systematically report low levels of health. In addition, poor self-reported health may be responsible for abnormal health-care utilization and an excessive (and expensive) network of physicians and hospital beds, which still characterize transition countries.",3

The socialist system is generally seen as a twentieth century phenomenon that appears inseparable from Marxist ideology that advocated nationalization of the means of production and replacement of the market by central planning as a resource allocation mechanism. This gives the impression that the emergence of these two systems appeared only as a consequence of industrialization. Humanity experienced in the twentieth century with socialism, and it failed dramatically. However, if we go back in history, a long time before industrialization, at the time of formation of the first states, we will find differences between economic systems that are as stark as those studied by comparative economics focusing on the twentieth century. Looking more closely at the ancient world, we find that some systems (Egypt, China, Peru under the Incas and others) were more like centrally planned economies. There was no private property of land (the land belonged to the Emperor or ruler), agricultural goods and craft goods were allocated by the government. Markets were hardly developed and foreign trade was under the control of government. Following Roland (2018) I will call them statist systems. Other economies, like ancient Mesopotamia, Athens, the Aztecs in Mexico, the Champa (covering roughly today’s South Vietnam), were more clearly market economies with private property of land and developed markets, both domestically and internationally. I will call them market systems. Many other systems were in between both these systems, as documented below. These differences have been noted before. Weber (1922) used the term of patrimonial state to characterize states like Ancient China and others where the absolute domination of the father figure in a family is projected onto the state. Private and public property are blended in the patrimonial state. Wittfogel (1957) theorized about oriental despotism and hypothesized that the absolutist rule in ancient China and Egypt was based on the facilitation by absolutist rulers of what he called the hydraulic state where the state organized large scale irrigation systems, creating ideal conditions for bureaucratic and government despotism.Footnote 1 Polanyi et al. (1954) documented the limited role of markets where private goods were exchanged in the Antiquity. Trigger (2003) provides a very interesting classification of ancient societies, based on archeological evidence. He emphasizes mostly the difference between territorial states and city-states, but his classification is quite comprehensive and based on extensive scholarly evidence. British historian MacFarlane (1978) found that as early as the thirteenth century, individualist culture was more prevalent in England compared to the European continent and that households tended to be more nuclear, relying more on the market in economic transactions than societies where people were embedded in larger clans. Among economists, Greif and Tabellini (2017) analyze the relative importance of clans in formation of cities in China and Europe. They find that in Chinese history, the development of cities was based on clans and clan organization, which has played an extended role in Chinese history. In contrast, cities in Western Europe developed on the basis of individual citizenship.Footnote 2 They trace these differences to cultural differences: generalized morality in Europe versus limited morality within the clan in China. Mayshar et al. (2017) emphasize the role of transparency in production. Whenever output could easily be measured, peasants worked directly for the state, as was the case in ancient Egypt. When output was instead less transparent, peasants had property rights over land like in Mesopotamia. In this paper, I present a database based on historical and archeological research to characterize the major differences between statist systems and market systems in the antiquity and periods of early state formation. The evidence we present shows clearly that these two systems form distinct institutional clusters that are comparable to the difference between socialism and capitalism in the twentieth century. These different systems operated in mostly rural societies where modern industrial technology was absent and where labor (in particular slave labor) and land were the major factors of production. Interestingly, we find different legal arrangements relative to these two factors of production. In market systems, there was private property of land but also of slaves. In statist systems, slaves were also used extensively, but they worked for the state. Households did not have the right to buy and sell slaves, and there were no private markets for slaves. In statist systems, land was owned by the state and there was no market for land. In market systems, legal systems were designed to deal with horizontal conflicts between citizens, in particular over property right disputes. In statist systems, the law was essentially a tool for the ruler to oppress citizens, as in China’s “legalist” doctrine developed during the Qin dynasty. There were also marked differences in political institutions in market versus statist systems. Market systems were often organized in city-states, like in Mesopotamia, ancient Greece and Rome, the Champa Empire in South Vietnam or the Aztec city-states in Mexico. Statist systems, in contrast, were usually organized in territorial states like ancient Egypt, China, or the Inca Empire. The latter were also much more centralized and had less developed cities, except for administrative centers. As a consequence of these legal and political institutions, trade of private goods, within and across polities, was much more developed in market systems compared to statist systems. There were also important sociological differences, some a consequence of institutional differences, others more a source of those differences. The role of merchants was much more recognized in market systems compared to statist systems. There was also more ethnic diversity and tolerance toward foreigners. Differences in kinship systems were also quite notable (see also Enke 2018). One was more likely to observe market systems in places with bilineal kinship systems, and instead statist systems in places with unilineal kinship systems. Unilineal kinship systems trace ancestry through only one parent (usually the father, i.e., patrilineal systems, but sometimes also the mother with matrilineal systems), whereas bilineal systems trace ancestry through both parents. Since unilineal kinship systems traces ancestry only through one line, many people know that they share unequivocally the same ancestor, which makes it easy to define somebody’s belonging to a clan. It is thus not surprising to see that clans were much stronger in societies with unilineal kinship systems. Strength of clan also affects the strength of market development. In societies with strong clans, a lot of economic activities were done inside the clan, on the basis of division of tasks within the clan. In societies with weaker clans, people needed to resort more to the market for their production and consumption. This paper describes in detail the institutional part of the data base we have built over the last few years, and how the different variables relate to each other. In a companion paper (Roland 2018), I examine the relationship between these institutional clusters and the major cultural divide in the modern world between individualist cultures, present mostly in the West, but also for example in India and the Middle East, and collectivist culture, present mostly in Asia, but also for example in the Andes region in Latin America and parts of Africa. In Sect. 2, we explain the choices we made in terms of the time periods for data collection, In Sect. 3, we describe our scoring choices for the variables on which we collected data. In Sect. 4, we document the presence of institutional clusters showing the presence of different institutional systems in ancient times. In Sect. 5, we show that these institutional clusters are associated with the extent of market and trade activities. Section 6 concludes.",7

There is no simple way to recount the ECB’s measures during such a prolonged and mutating crisis. This paper explains the events as they unfolded against the backdrop of a changing institutional framework, and governance reforms. No encompassing study of such an exceptional period exists. The architecture of the European Economic and Monetary Union has also been changing. We also report several studies of the monetary measures during the prolonged crisis, as well as diverse criticisms of the ECB actions. The crisis started as a Financial Turmoil in August 2007, followed by the Global Financial Crisis in September 2008, and the Great Recession in 2009–2010. These events exacerbated several imbalances that had already been emerging in the euro area not long after the launch of the euro. The financial governance could not deter them and financial market discipline was weak. Flaws in EMU’s architecture became apparent. Then, in early 2010 the Sovereign Debt Crisis of the euro area was triggered by unsustainable fiscal positions and overleveraged banks in diverse countries. Financial backstops for either sovereigns or banks lacked. At the peak of this phase, there was financial fragmentation and a disruption in monetary transmission. During the mutating crisis, the policy toolkit of the ECB has expanded to also encompass: the provision of liquidity on demand at a fixed rate and with full allotment since October 2008; a series of longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) providing liquidity to banks against a set of collateral that was broadened; the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) programme; enhanced monetary policy communication through forward guidance (on both policy rates and asset purchases); a large-scale private and public asset purchase programme (CBPP, SMP and APP); and the use of negative interest rates. In the euro area, banks play a predominant role in the financial system. Thus, a feature of the ECB’s responses is that they have supported banks’ credit provision throughout the crisis. The effects of the ECB’s monetary policy responses to the prolonged crisis have been showing through in the euro area’s recovery since mid-2014. Monetary policy has been accompanied by exceptional policy responses by national governments, strengthening of European institutions, building a crisis management framework with fiscal backstops, launching the single supervisory mechanism (SSM), and various other reforms. These milestones are also noted in the chronology. Several criticisms of the euro, the ECB and the single monetary policy have been put forward in recent years. In fact, such criticisms started even before the launch of the euro. For example, Paul Krugman and Joe Feldstein argued that the euro area was not an Optimum Currency Area and a crisis was a matter of time. Stiglitz (2016) revisits these arguments in a recent book.Footnote 1 Yet others questioned the fiscal dimension of exceptional monetary policies as well as swelling TARGET system (Sinn 2011, 2012; Sinn and Wollmershäuser 2011), the handling of sovereign crisis by “Troikas” (also Stiglitz 2016), the “too low interest rates, for too long” like from BIS researchers (Borio et al. 2016, 2017). This article is organised as follows. “Financial Turmoil: August 2007 to September 2008” section describes the financial turmoil that marked the beginning of the crisis in August 2007. “The Global Financial Crisis and the Great Recession: September 2008 to May 2010” section reviews the global financial crisis that started in September 2008 and the Great Recession of 2009–2010. “Euro Area Sovereign Debt Crisis: May 2010 to 2nd Half 2013” section covers the euro area sovereign debt crisis that began in early 2010. “The Low Inflation Phase: Starting in 2nd Half of 2013” section discusses the policy responses during the low inflation phase of the crisis starting in the second half of 2013. “A Recap of the Policy Responses to the Crisis” section groups the non-standard monetary policy measures into four main clusters. “Final Remarks” section offers some final remarks. The paper provides only a selective account until June 2018.",5

61,1,Comparative Economic Studies,31 July 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-018-0070-8,Is Privatization Working in Ukraine?,March 2019,J. David Brown,John S. Earle,Volodymyr Vakhitov,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Privatization has again become a priority for the Ukrainian government, with plans for a big push as a part of the general revival of the reform process since the new government and parliament came to power in 2014. It is therefore of more than historical and academic interest to inquire how privatization has proceeded over the 25-odd years of the Ukrainian transition, and what effects it has had on firm performance. More generally, there is still much to learn about state and private ownership from studying transition economies, particularly a country such as Ukraine that has undergone such an extensive—yet partial—privatization process and that offers unusually excellent data for analysis. In this paper, we exploit such data, consisting of a long panel of all initially state-owned manufacturing firms, to produce empirical evidence on several important aspects of the productivity impact of privatization in Ukraine. Our description of the Ukrainian privatization process is much more detailed than we have supplied before and includes new measures of the size of residual state ownership within and across firms, the degree of foreign involvement, and the relative quality of firms privatized early and late in the process. Our estimation of private-state firm-level productivity differentials examines variation associated with calendar time, privatization year, domestic versus foreign ownership, foreign source country, and percentage privatized, and we place our new estimates in context by comparing with results from previous research for Ukraine and for Hungary, Romania, and Russia. The data run from 1989, when Ukraine was still part of the Soviet Union’s centrally planned economic system, through 2013, the most recent year available. The long time series, longer than in any previous paper on privatization, is valuable not only because it enables the use of statistical methods for controlling for certain forms of selection bias, but also because it contains variation in privatization method, in macroeconomic and general policy environment, and in length of time since privatization. The paper builds on a large previous literature on privatization in many countries as well the small number of previous papers that exist for Ukraine.Footnote 1 The theoretical starting point is the model of Schleifer and Vishny (1994) and Boycko et al. (1996), who analyze the impact of privatizing control and cash flow rights on the degree to which firms employ excess labor. Our analysis is motivated not only by the general proposition that privatization may raise efficiency but by more specific hypotheses emerging from the model on the heterogeneity in privatization effectiveness across types of new owners and with respect to the general business and macroeconomic environment. We also draw upon Aghion and Blanchard’s (1996) analysis of initial share ownership and its evolution, and studies of partial privatization (e.g., Perotti 1995; Gupta 2005) to motivate our analysis of differential effects of minority, majority, and 100% privatization, which has received relatively little attention in previous research. Within the large empirical literature, in some ways we take Brown et al. (2006a) as a starting point in terms of types of data and methods. BET also focused on multifactor productivity outcomes and their data were also limited to manufacturing firms, but their time series ran only through 2002. Part of our motivation is BET’s finding that Ukrainian privatization boosted productivity only modestly if at all in that early transition period, much lower than in Romania and Hungary (although a bit more than in Russia). With our much longer time series, we are able to assess the extent to which the Ukrainian privatization effect has remained low or has risen in recent years, and to disentangle some of the potential explanations for changes.Footnote 2 The current paper goes much farther than the existing literature in several important ways. To start with, the data have several advantages over those studies in previous research. We are able to analyze a much longer panel than in any previous study of privatization. This enables us to re-examine BET’s finding of a modest productivity effect in Ukraine, with nearly double the length of the time series, and allows analysis of the extent of privatization and its effects over a much longer window. As we show, a significant number of firms were privatized in the late 1990s, and even after 2000. The longer time series also permits us to examine changes in the relative productivity of privatized firms over time, and the association of these changes with other economic and political changes in the country. In addition, the previous literature (including BET) was forced to rely on crude indicators of ownership, both for percentage privatized and foreign investor participation, while this paper uses improved data on domestic private and foreign shareholdings and the source country of foreign investors. The estimation approach in the paper examines relative productivity by ownership type within industry-year cells to control for aggregate and sector-specific shocks as well as mismeasurement of deflators across industries. The analysis permits differences in estimated production functions across industries to avoid biases associated with technology mismeasurement, and it takes into account selection bias associated not only with fixed differences among firms but also differing trend productivity growth rates. Either of these factors—level and trend differences—may affect the probability of privatization and whether the new owners are domestic or foreign investors. The availability of several years of pre-privatization data is also useful for evaluating anticipatory effects and for comparing possible selection bias across specifications. The several years of post-privatization data help shed light on how quickly any benefits from privatization are realized and whether they are sustained or tend to diminish over time. The paper also goes beyond the existing literature in estimating the heterogeneity in relative productivity effects by event time (centered on privatization year), calendar time, and privatization period (corresponding to dominant method of privatization), and in examining possible selection bias in choice of firms for privatization, in sequencing, and in survival. We distinguish the effects of different types of new private ownership structures—partial privatizations (minority and majority), and domestic versus foreign. For foreign acquisitions, we also take into account the foreign country of origin—whether an “offshore” country (which may represent a channel for Ukrainian nationals to hide their ownership), Russia, or other foreign (genuine FDI). This paper is the first privatization study, to our knowledge, that provides empirical evidence on several of these important questions for any country. The evidence may therefore be relevant not only for Ukraine but also for other economies with significant state sectors and for policymakers designing privatization programs. The following section on “Data and Ownership Description” contains information on data sources and the evolution of ownership in the Ukrainian manufacturing sector over the transition period. The section on “Privatization Policies” section summarizes the history of Ukrainian privatization policies. The “Econometric Framework” section presents estimation procedures, and the “Estimation Results” section discusses the estimates. Findings are summarized in the “Conclusion” section.",7
61,1,Comparative Economic Studies,23 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-018-0062-8,Sovereign Defaults and Democracy,March 2019,Antonis Adam,Kostas Karanatsis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since the outset of the global economic crisis, there have been concerns about the effects of recession on political stability worldwide. For example, the Washington Post reported on February 26, 2009, that the CIA added an update on the effects of global financial crisis on political stability in its daily White House intelligence report. The new director of the agency, Dennis C. Blair, said thatFootnote 1: “Our analysis indicates that economic crisis increases the risk of regime-threatening instability if it continues for a 1- or 2-year period…(the economic) Instability can loosen the fragile hold that many developing countries have on law and order.” If this assertion is correct, the adverse effects of political turmoil should be included when assessing the recession costs. Our argument is that the above concerns are valid, as economic crises cause declines in the level of democracy and often lead to more autocratic regimes. To determine the timing of an economic crisis, we restrict our attention to crises that are associated with a sovereign debt default. Our approach has the advantage that it considers only severe crises that lead to state defaults. Moreover, the occurrence of a default is clearly determined by the data. Nevertheless, identifying crises is particularly difficult in early data, as in many instances a slow economic recession did not lead to a default. Our analysis is based on econometric evidence from an unbalanced panel of 105 countries, over the 1824–2004 period. Our results indicate a significant decline in the level of democracy, after a default episode. This main finding is robust irrespective of the measure of democracy employed, econometric specification and sample period. Furthermore, our results are supported by a number of country case studies that we consider before turning to our quantitative analysis. As our interest lies on estimating a causal relationship between crisis/default and democracy, we examine the robustness of our results under various identification strategies. Firstly, we estimate a fixed effects model, which controls for country- and year-specific effects that affect the underlying relationship. Therefore, the results do not suffer from omitted variable bias, as long as the omitted variables are fixed in time and across countries. Secondly, we use instrumental variables (IV), to deal with problems of reverse causality, confounding factors and measurement error on the main variable of interest. Following the literature on sovereign defaults, which indicates regional clustering of default episodes (Reinhart and Rogoff 2014; Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer 2006), we instrument country default, with the number of defaults in neighboring countries. Finally, to verify that our results do not rely on the selection of instruments, we employ the semiparametric propensity score estimator, as proposed by Angrist et al. (2017) and adapted for panel data by Acemoglu et al. (2014). This method uses a propensity score weighting approach to correct for the effect of the political dynamics that pre-existed the treatment (i.e., default), thereby controlling for the possibility of reverse causality and selection.Footnote 2 The paper is structured as follows. In the following section, we present a short account of the related literature. In “Data and Model” Section we present the data used in our statistical analysis. In “Results” Section, we report the results of the econometric models. Finally, “Conclusions” Section offers some concluding remarks.",1
61,1,Comparative Economic Studies,24 July 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-018-0071-7,The Norwegian Oil Bonanza and the Scandinavian Model in Comparative Perspective,March 2019,Roberto Iacono,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The aim of this research is to evaluate the response of two economic and institutional features of the so-called Scandinavian or Nordic model [namely, (a) low income inequality and (b) high welfare spending] for Norway, after the country became one of the world’s largest oil exporters. In other words, this paper provides a quantitative comparative case study that can highlight the robustness of the key features of the Nordic model when subjected to a substantial structural shock. In doing so, this paper complements previous studies with a similar focus, such as Mideksa (2013) and Larsen (2006), which analyze the impact of the resource windfall on the Norwegian GDP per capita. The supposed exceptionality of the Nordic model has been analyzed, questioned and tested by scholars (among others, Lane et al. 1993; Bergh 2014) with regard to a variety of aspects, with egalitarianism of the wealth distribution often receiving most attention. Fochesato and Bowles (2015) attempted to measure the relative egalitarian performance of the Nordic economies by comparing their level of material wealth inequality with respect to a large group of economies over the past three thousand years. Their conclusion is that the Nordic economies do not produce a more egalitarian distribution of material wealth than, for example, some horticultural and forager economies, although they show a higher level of intergenerational and social mobility. Barth et al. (2014, 2015) provide a theoretical overview of the main political and economic features of the Nordic open economies, summarizing and putting together results from previous economic research on the issue: Moene et al. (1993), Moene and Wallerstein (1997) and Barth et al. (2013). This research follows Barth et al. (2014) in representing the Nordic model as a set of three distinct but interconnected mechanisms. These are: (I) collective bargaining which leads to labor wage compression (i.e., high minimum wages and low maximum wages) through a combination of central wage negotiations and local wage negotiations at the firm level; (II) high labor productivity which, combined with wage compression, stimulates high private investments and creation of new highly productive enterprises; (III) political support for large ratios of public welfare spending to GDP. The scope of the present study is to briefly review and empirically evaluate the robustness of mechanisms (I) and (III), by comparing Norway to the other Nordic economies. In order to observe a wholly hypothetical counterfactual, the treatment (i.e., the resource windfall) would ideally impact only a unit or a subgroup of the four Nordic economies (i.e., Norway, Denmark, Finland and Sweden) representing the full sample of this study. For this reason, the donor pool provided by the untreated countries represents the perfect sample in order to construct a counterfactual that matches the treated country. The countries of Denmark, Finland and Sweden, resembling the economy of Norway without being (large) oil producers,Footnote 1 therefore provide the most reliable donor pool of comparison units. Additional non-Nordic countries are arbitrarily not included in the sample due to the chosen focus on the functioning of the Scandinavian model. The Synthetic Control Method (SCM, hereafter) is implemented to assign weights to the countries of the donor pool, in order to obtain a synthetic control unit that is subsequently used to estimate the comparative effects constituting the paper’s twofold contribution. Abadie et al. (2010, 2011, 2015) have lately implemented this statistical method in the economic literature. The advantage of the SCM is that it allows generalizing the difference-in-differences approach to a cross-country context in which only one of the countries has being subjected to a shock/treatment. First, results show that the windfall did not contribute to substantially higher top income shares relative to the Nordic neighbors. This finding goes in the direction of disregarding natural resources from the set of variables that explain the increase in income inequality in Norway documented in the economic literature and summarized in Aaberge and Atkinson (2010). Second, results indicate that the oil bonanza contributed to financing a steadily increasing gap in the degree of welfare generosityFootnote 2 between Norway and the other Nordic countries, with an increase in generosity in Norway. The result of an increasing gap in the overall degree of welfare generosity could for instance be explained by the volatile income streams in the resource sector, which increase individuals’ exposure to the risk of income losses and hence foster the voters’ preferences for public spending and welfare generosity. In addition, resource revenues boosted tax revenues, allowing the Norwegian government to finance a sustained level of overall welfare generosity. The paper proceeds as follows: “The Resource Windfall” section  presents the windfall that accrued to the Norwegian economy, “Top Income Shares” section analyzes the comparative effects on top income shares, “Public Welfare Spending” section focuses on the effects on public welfare spending. “Concluding Remarks” section provides concluding remarks.",4
61,1,Comparative Economic Studies,12 June 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-018-0069-1,"Output Costs of Currency Crisis and Banking Crisis: Shocks, Policies and Cycles",March 2019,Ryota Nakatani,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"After the recent global financial crisis, the effects of financial crises on output growth have attracted more attention from researchers (e.g., Romer and Romer 2017; Reinhart and Rogoff 2013). In this paper, we analyze the output costs of a currency crisis, which is one type of financial crisis that has frequently occurred since the 1970s (Laeven and Valencia 2014). In doing so, we also control banking crisis as these two types of financial crises sometimes occur coincidentally. Many empirical studies on the output costs of currency crises have focused on the recovery from output declines or medium-term and long-term output losses, but no literature has cast a spotlight on the sources of shocks that led to the crises. Against this backdrop, it would be interesting to understand the sources of shocks that led to currency crises. Our research contributes to the literature by focusing on shocks that can lead to currency crises. Although economic theories predict that different types of shocks can trigger currency crises, only empirical analysis can quantify the different effects of each shock on output, and this has not been previously analyzed. For example, Céspedes et al. (2004) developed a theoretical model in which an external shock in the international financial markets increases a country’s risk premium, which in turn worsens the balance sheets of firms and leads to a currency crisis. Another model developed by Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2001) shows that a production shock can cause a currency crisis that is induced by liquidity problems under binding international and domestic collateral constraints. Nakatani (2016) and Nakatani (2017a) developed a model in which both financial shocks and productivity shocks can trigger currency crises through the deteriorating balance sheets of commercial banks and firms, respectively. Therefore, it is also interesting to connect the theories to empirical studies by focusing on the roles of shocks during currency crises. Recently, Nakatani (2017b) and Nakatani (2018a) used his above-mentioned theoretical models to empirically analyze the effects of different shocks on exchange rates and on the probability of a currency crisis, respectively. This model has several advantages. It can well explain currency crises occurring in countries with foreign currency debt, it can be applied to both fixed exchange rate regimes and flexible exchange rate regimes, and it can study the effects of several types of shocks and analyze the possibility of multiple equilibria. Following the theory, his two empirical papers focused on two types of shocks, including shocks to a country’s risk premium in the financial markets and productivity shocks in the real sector. He found that both shocks significantly affect exchange rate dynamics and the probability of a currency crisis. Furthermore, the model well explains past major currency crises in Asian and Latin-American countries. Specifically, the Nakatani (2016, 2017a) model shows that the equilibrium is determined by the intersection of two curves that simultaneously determine the exchange rate and output. Thus, it is natural to analyze the effects of shocks to both exchange rates and output. Although Nakatani (2017b) analyzed the effects of shocks on exchange rates and Nakatani (2018a) analyzed their effects on the probability of a currency crisis (from the viewpoint of multiple equilibria), no literature has analyzed the effects on output. In this regard, we empirically analyze the effects of the aforementioned two shocks on output by applying the data and estimation methods developed by Nakatani (2017b) and Nakatani (2018a). Using unbalanced panel data on 49 emerging markets and developing countries from 1980 to 2011, we examine different definitions of currency crises, including the ‘standard’ currency crisis and the ‘severe’ currency crisis. Our results show that the output costs of a currency crisis are approximately 4% on average and approximately 8% for a severe crisis. We also find that although both types of shocks affect output dynamics, the sizes of their effects are different. Namely, productivity shocks appear to be more important for output declines during past famous currency crises that occurred in emerging markets. By contrast, risk premium shocks amplify the output costs during currency crisis periods, but the size of this effect was very small during the past selected emerging market crises. In addition to productivity shocks, we found that business cycles and the economic adjustments associated with overvalued exchange rates also had large effects on output declines during past major currency crises in Asia and Latin America. The organizational structure of this paper includes a review of the literature in which we briefly summarize and discuss the empirical literature on the output costs of currency crises and the theoretical literature on generational currency crisis models. Then, we explain the methodology and data used in this article and discuss our empirical results and their implications for past emerging market crises. Finally, we conclude the work.",7

In OECD countries, the widening of the income gap between rich and poor has been mainly driven by greater inequality in market income from the mid-1980s (OECD 2008, 2011, 2015). Several explanations of income inequality have been introduced by researchers in sociology, economics, and political science.Footnote 1 One of the main driving forces behind disposable income distribution is the reduction of inequality through the tax-transfer system.Footnote 2 The overall redistributive effect can be divided into redistribution by transfers and by taxes, or even into more details.Footnote 3 In the mid-2000s, the average redistributive effect achieved by public cash transfers is twice as large as that achieved through household taxes, although, for example, the USA stands out for achieving a greater part of redistribution by taxes (Wang et al. 2012, 2014; OECD 2008, 2011; Whiteford 2010). As the tax and transfer system was only able to offset a part of the rise in market income inequality over the last 25 years, disposable income (i.e., after taxes and social benefits) has also become more unequal in many countries. The growing interest in national and cross-national differences in earnings and income inequality has produced a wide range of studies. An important development has been the launching of the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) in which microdata-sets from various countries have been “harmonized.” LIS offers microdata that are comparable, detailed and accurate. Specifically, LIS offers data on a large number of individual sources of income from both the private and public sectors (LIS 2017). Consequently, it is possible to study income inequality across countries and years (see Atkinson et al. 1995). In this paper, we use the most recent LIS data to analyze fiscal redistribution after the Great Recession. Are welfare states still effective in reducing income inequality? On the one hand, some social transfers, notably unemployment benefits, work as automatic stabilizers and will increase in times of economic downturn. On the other hand, many countries have implemented retrenchments on social programs during the crisis in order to restore public finances. We focus on the effect of income taxes (including social contributions) and transfers in redistributing income. Our expectation is that social transfers are mainly directed to lower income groups, while income taxes are mainly paid by the rich, and therefore both will have an impact on income (re)distribution. We use the traditional budget incidence approach—despite some methodological problems we will address—to study the combined effects of income taxes and transfers on the income (re)distribution. The distribution of market income is compared with the distribution of income after taxes and after social transfers. The change in summary measures of inequality between pre- and post-government income represents direct government redistribution. Many factors make it difficult to compare the redistributive effect of taxes and transfers across countries (differences in income concepts, the income units (summary) measures, equivalence adjustments and other factors). Moreover, there are numerous possible ways to analyze the impact of taxes and transfers on the distribution of income; some of these approaches are listed in our references.Footnote 4 It is generally agreed upon that there is no single “correct” methodology. However, the budget incidence approach is—still—a standard methodology for studying the combined effects of all taxes and transfers on the magnitude of (re)distributing income. In this paper, we elaborate on the work of Jesuit and Mahler (2010, 2017), Mahler and Jesuit (2006), and Wang et al. (2012, 2014). We offer a user-friendly dataset Leiden LIS Budget Incidence FiscalRedistributionDatasetonIncome Inequality  (Wang and Caminada 2017). Also, we undertake a detailed study [compared to Wang et al. (2012, 2014)], containing a simulation approach which allows us to decompose income inequality through income taxes and several social transfers. It should be mentioned here that social transfers include public pensions. We employ a budget incidence simulation model to investigate to what extent several social transfers and income taxes reduce income inequality in 31 countries. Other recent studies in the field, Jesuit and Mahler (2017) and Causa and Hermansen (2017), analyze the trend of income inequality and fiscal redistribution. This paper is a cross-country comparison at one moment in time for as many countries as possible and for the most recent data year available. The study is novel because it offers an extensive decomposition of the redistributive effects of social transfer programs. In addition, we present sensitivity analyses, applying various measures of global inequality and different equivalence scale methods. Finally, this study offers a detailed analysis of fiscal redistribution for both the working-age population and the total population. The paper is organized as follows. In “Income Inequality and the Redistributive Effects of Taxes and Transfers Across Countries” section, we summarize literature on the redistributive effect of taxes and transfers in LIS countries. “Research Method” section presents our research method. “Inequality and Fiscal Redistribution across LIS Countries Around 2013” section provides a descriptive analysis of income inequality and redistribution across 31 countries around 2013. “Decomposition of Redistributive Effects of Social Transfers and Taxes Across LIS Countries Around 2013” section presents the empirical results of our detailed decomposition of the redistributive effect of social transfers and income taxes across countries. “Sensitivity Analyses” section contains sensitivity analyses. “Conclusion” section concludes the paper.",16
61,1,Comparative Economic Studies,08 March 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-018-0058-4,J-Curve in Transition Economies: A Large Meta-analysis of the Determinants of Output Changes,March 2019,Ichiro Iwasaki,Kazuhiro Kumo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"When they initially abandoned socialism with the aim of restructuring and revitalizing their national economies with market principles, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the former Soviet Union (FSU) were hit by a catastrophic collapse in economic activity. Even in the least affected countries, the size of this collapse ranged from 13 to 20% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the final stages of socialism, while in those countries most seriously affected, it amounted to declines of between 64 and 87%. Moreover, this dramatic drop in production continued for as long as between 6 and 8 years in some countries (Table 1). That the transition to a market economy would probably trigger social disorder and economic decline was to some extent predicted by policymakers and researchers both inside and outside the former socialist countries. At the end of the Cold War, however, hardly anyone could have foreseen that the CEE and FSU countries would experience such a serious and protracted output fall. Furthermore, the recovery process dashed the hopes of large numbers of people. This was because even the most developed CEE countries took between 5 and 8 years to restore output to the levels at the end of socialism. Not only that, but even in the 25th year of the transition from socialism, some countries have yet to fully recover from the economic damage they suffered during the crisis.Footnote 1 A sharp contraction in production at the start of the transition and the relatively gradual recovery that followed was a situation common to all the CEE and FSU countries. In other words, without exception, the former socialist transition economies have followed the so-called J-curved growth path to date (Brada and King 1992). Because the J-curve was observed not only in the countries with extensive transitions but also in non-reforming states like Belarus, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, it is obvious that this phenomenon cannot be ascribed to economic policies alone. There must be a bigger picture beyond them. At the same time, as Table 1 shows, there were marked differences among CEE and FSU countries in the length and depth of the output decline as well as the growth speed during the recovery phase. Faced with such a situation that was profoundly interesting from an academic point of view, researchers have not only offered various theoretical considerations of this unique phenomenon but also performed a variety of empirical analyses to specify its background factors. Currently, much attention is being paid to this accumulated research, and it is by no means an overstatement to say that it has become one of the most important research fields in the economics of transition. The results of this aggressive research have led us to share a common understanding of the determinants of macroeconomic growth in the CEE and FSU countries. Among others, not only education levels and human capital investment, which are emphasized in traditional growth theory, but even inputs such as capital and labor were not critical explanatory variables for economic growth rates during the crisis and the initial phase of recovery. Rather, the only interpretation is that various unique factors pertaining to the CEE/FSU zone and the former socialist transition economies were quite important in determining macroeconomic performance during these periods. Specifically, these unique factors are (a) structural changes in the national economy, (b) the transformation policy toward a market economy, (c) the legacy of socialism as an initial condition, (d) inflation, and (e) regional conflict. In fact, many previous studies have empirically verified that the first two factors serve to enhance economic growth, while the last three factors tend to cause a downturn. Nevertheless, more than a few studies have produced results that contradict the above policy implications. Thus, it cannot be said that the transition economy growth debate has reached a final conclusion. Furthermore, no comparison has been conducted on the effect size and statistical significance of the above five determinants of growth, so the question of why the CEE and FSU countries have followed not a U-shaped or V-shaped growth path, but a J-shaped trajectory has not been answered by previous research. Elucidating this issue will therefore fill a big gap in the study of transition economies. Based on the above perception of the issues, in this paper, we will attempt to shed light on the mechanism that generated the J-curved growth path in transition economies by performing a meta-analysis to compare effect size and statistical significance of structural change, transformation policy, the socialist legacy, inflation, and regional conflict. The meta-synthesis, which comprised 3279 estimates extracted from 123 previous studies, revealed that the growth-enhancing effects of structural change and transformation policy were small, yet statistically significant, while inflation and regional conflict demonstrated a highly significant and strongly negative effect on output. The effect size and statistical significance of the socialist legacy were similar to those of structural change and transformation policy, so it is likely that this factor also contributed to the decline in production in the early stages of transition. The meta-regression analysis that simultaneously controlled for various research conditions and the assessment of publication selection bias provided supporting evidence for the policy implications obtained from the meta-synthesis. Based on these results, we conjecture that while the interaction between the above five factors led to a J-curved growth path in all of the CEE and FSU countries, differences among the countries in terms of historical preconditions, political circumstances, and reform efforts resulted in large differences in their growth trajectories. The earliest meta-analyses on the factors of macroeconomic growth in former socialist transition countries were performed by Babecký and Campos (2011) and Babecky and Havranek (2014). In this paper, we will utilize the advantages of later research to supplement these two early studies in three ways. First, whereas the two early studies constituted meta-analyses focused on economic reform, in this paper, we will verify the growth-enhancing effect of transformation policy in a broader sense. Second, as stated above, because this study deals simultaneously with five determinants of growth that differ in nature, the effect size and statistical significance of transformation policy are in clear contrast to the other four factors. Third, by involving an extensive examination of related studies covering almost every piece of literature targeted by these previous meta-studies, this paper provides a wider picture of the research on transition economies.Footnote 2 The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The next section gives an overview of the process of output decline and recovery in CEE and FSU countries during the past quarter century. The third section describes the procedure of literature selection and an overview of the studies selected for meta-analysis. The fourth section conducts a meta-synthesis and meta-regression analysis, and the fifth section verifies the presence and degree of publication selection bias. The last section summarizes major findings and concludes the paper.",5

For example, since 1999, the gap between the ECB’s interest rate and the interest rate that would have resulted from the application of a Taylor rule in the core and peripheral countries was very large.Footnote 1 In fact, monetary policy was relatively loose in the periphery (see the left-hand panel of Fig. 1), mainly between 2002 and 2007, which could have contributed to the building up of financial and economic imbalances (Altunbas et al. 2014).Footnote 2 This calls for the use of macroprudential (henceforth MaP) policy as a complementary instrument to monetary policy. The global financial crisis has made it clear that financial stability has a macroprudential or systemic dimension that cannot be ignored. Treating the financial system as merely the sum of its parts leads one to overlook the system’s tendency to swing from boom to bust. There is indeed a growing literature that claims that monetary policy should factor in financial stability considerations. Monetary policy should “lean against the wind” (LATW, Borio and Lowe 2002; Gambacorta and Signoretti 2014) to prevent financial imbalance, rather than merely “clean up afterwards” (Bernanke and Gertler 1999). Blinder (2010) notes the emergence of a new consensus on the responsibility of central banks to combat asset price bubbles, by using targeted regulatory tools, rather than interest rate, which is considered as a blunt tool (Svensson 2016). In the meantime, many economists think that the central bank’s interest rate could play a major role to ensure financial stability,Footnote 3, in order to avoid leakages overseas and notably to shadow banking. In addition, LATW is also a way to take into consideration the banks’ risk-taking channel (Adrian and Shin 2009; Borio and Zhu 2012) especially when many asset types show signs of overpricing. However, MaP policy can revisit this debate in the case of a monetary union where financial shocks could be asymmetric and a (common) LATW policy could be not successful. From the standpoint of the “optimum currency area” theory developed by Mundell (1962), MaP policy may be interpreted as a complementary adjustment tool that enhances the degree of optimality of a monetary union, specifically when economic cycles are out of sync. This is particularly the case of the Eurozone which suffers from low mobility of production factors, the absence of fiscal transfers between countries (Kenen 1969), and heterogeneous real-estate cycles (Krugman 2012). Additionally, business and financial cycles are divergent among European countries (Stremmel 2015). Figure 1 (right-hand panel) illustrates that the core and the periphery have divergent financial conditions, that have been amplified since 2010. It also shows also that the credit spread between the lending rate and the ECB interest rate has been increasing since 2010, particularly in the periphery. Sources: ECB; authors’ calculations Euro area financial conditions\(^{^{1}}\)(in per cent). \(^{^{1}}\)Core countries include Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Austria and France, while the periphery countries are Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Ireland. \(^{^{2}}\)The aggregated cost of borrowing for non-financial corporations is based on short-term loans. Within the European Union, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) is responsible for the MaP oversight of the financial system primarily by issuing warnings and recommendations.Footnote 4 The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) designates the ECB as an important player of the MaP framework for the countries that participate in the banking union, mostly those of the Eurozone. According to Article 5(2) of the SSM Regulation (ESRB 2014),Footnote 5 the ECB has the power to set tighter (not looser) regulatory requirementsFootnote 6 than national authorities. The asymmetric nature of the ECB’s powers reflects the potential inaction bias of national authorities. In fact, the costs of applying MaP tools are felt immediately (constraints on demand), while benefits are long-term (reduction in the probability, frequency and severity of financial crisis). Nevertheless, other MaP measures, mainly related to housing stock, such as loan to value (LTV) ratios and debt to income (DTI) ratios, remain under national competence and are not coordinated at the Union level. The complex decision-making processFootnote 7 in the European Union ( the ECB, national authorities, and the ESRB) calls for adequate coordination, information sharing, and communication. Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, our paper analyses how macroprudential policy could enhance the degree of optimality of a monetary union. Second, it identifies some key general principles for the conduct of a policy mix that combines a single monetary policy and a MaP policy. Third, despite its simplicity, the model can analyse simultaneously the effects of some financial frictions: countercyclical credit spreads, financial shock and imperfect transmission of monetary policy to financial conditions (pass-through). Our study emphasises that a better policy mix promotes not only financial but also macroeconomic stability, particularly when core and periphery economies are hit by asymmetric shocks. A single monetary policy conducted at the Union level reacts only to average conditions, which mask differences in member countries (Constancio 2015b). For example, the unintended accommodative (restrictive) effect of monetary policy for countries that record higher (lower) inflation may be counteracted by country-adjusted restrictive (loose) MaP measures, such as an increased (reduced) countercyclical capital buffers or lower (higher) LTV/DTI caps. Our analysis also shows that unless economies and shocks are completely symmetric, a national implementation of MaP policy, adapted to the situation of each member state, is more appropriate than a federal implementation that reacts to the average situation. The reminder of the paper is organised as follows: The “Literature Reviews” section presents literature, “A Simple New Keynesian Model with Credit Intermediation” section presents the model, “Monetary and Macroprudential Policy Mix” section discusses optimal policy mix under different scenarios and the last section concludes.",10

The global financial crisis in 2007–2008 was followed by a deep recession in 2008–2009, a European debt crisis in 2010, and a second recession in the Eurozone in 2012–2013. To avoid a collapse of the European monetary union (EMU), the Eurozone countries, that were severely hit by the crisis (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Cyprus), received financial assistance. Yet, recovery has been uneven. Some countries are still struggling to cope with the consequences of massive job losses. The Eurozone unemployment rate was 9.1% in 2017 (from 7.5% in 2007 to 12% in 2013), but the highest unemployment rates were in Greece at 21.5%, Spain at 17.2%, Italy and Cyprus at 11.1%, whereas the lowest unemployment rates were in Germany at 3.8%, Malta at 4.0%, and the Netherlands at 4.9%.Footnote 1 The severity of the Eurozone crisis shows that mechanisms of adjustment to shocks within EMU are lacking or don’t work properly. In this respect, the literature about optimum currency areas (OCA) is useful for drawing some lessons (Krugman 2012; Eichengreen 2014; Gibson et al. 2014; Aizenman 2018). According to this literature, the costs of joining a monetary union and giving up the exchange rate as an economic instrument could be minimized if some other mechanisms of adjustment to shocks were available. Geographic labor mobility is among such mechanisms, and its extent is considered as a criterion for optimality (Mundell 1961; Kenen 1969).Footnote 2 In this paper, we analyze geographic mobility in the Eurozone. We provide a measurement of mobility in the Eurozone and an assessment of its responsiveness to national labor market conditions. Thus, we address the following questions: What is the extent of mobility in the Eurozone? Do people move from one country to another in response to an increase in unemployment? Does mobility across the Eurozone respond to national wage developments as well? How did the crisis affect mobility? In theory, labor mobility can help prevent the persistence of unemployment in a country hit by an adverse shock as long as unemployed people move to other countries. Besides, within a monetary union, a common currency ought to facilitate labor mobility between member countries thanks to price transparency and reduced transaction costs (elimination of conversion fees).Footnote 3 In reality, however, it is common knowledge that labor mobility is low in Europe in comparison with the experience of the USA, Canada or Australia (Heinz and Ward-Warmedinger 2006; European Commission 2015). There is also evidence that the role of labor mobility in labor market adjustments is limited in Europe, but it has increased over time (Dao et al. 2014; Jauer et al. 2014; Beyer and Smets 2015; Arpaia et al. 2016). It is worth noting that empirical studies relate to mobility flows in the European Union (EU), especially between the latter and the rest of the world, but not in the Eurozone. Yet, from the standpoint of the analysis of optimum currency areas, it is interesting to know whether citizens in the Eurozone migrated to another country in the Eurozone or elsewhere during the crisis. For example, the entry of Spanish citizens in Germany was about 34,300 in 2014 against an average of inflows of about 8100 per year before the crisis (1999–2007). Likewise, inflows of Greek citizens in Germany peaked at 32,600 in 2012 against 12,600 on average before the crisis. In contrast, Irish and Portuguese people moved to non-EU countries: for the most part, Irish citizens headed toward Australia (inflows of about 6200 in 2014 against an average of 1300 before 2008), while Portuguese citizens went to Switzerland (a peak of about 19,900 in 2013 against 10,000 on average before 2008).Footnote 4 The original feature of our work lies precisely in the fact that we analyze mobility in the Eurozone. It is a threefold contribution. First, our approach is based on a direct measure of migration: we use data on stocks of foreign population by nationality to compute net inflows of migrants between Eurozone countries.Footnote 5 This measure provides valuable information about mobility flows in the Eurozone. In contrast, in most studies (e.g., Eichengreen 1993; European Commission 2011; Jauer et al. 2014), mobility is measured indirectly by migration-induced population growth (crude rate of migration).Footnote 6 With such a measure, the country of origin of migrants is not known. There are also studies that use direct measures of mobility based on bilateral flows. However, panel data include non-European countries (European Commission 2015; Beine et al. 2017) or Germany only as the destination country (Bertoli et al. 2013). Second, we calculate three net migration rates for Eurozone countries.Footnote 7 These rates differ depending on the group of countries of origin of migrants: Eurozone countries, EU countries that are not members of the EurozoneFootnote 8, and non-EU countries. They are useful to compare mobility flows in the Eurozone with those between Eurozone countries and other countries from the EU or the rest of the world. Last, we apply the model proposed by Pissarides and McMaster (1990) to estimate the response of net migration rates to national labor market conditions. Eichengreen (1993) and the European Commission (2011) used this model, but they measured mobility with crude rates of migration. Our regression tests are an attempt to determine whether mobility flows in the Eurozone changed during the crisis and reacted to national differences in unemployment or wage developments.Footnote 9 Our approach certainly has some limitations. We study mobility between countries and not between regions. We do not use regional data because there is no direct measure of mobility flows at the regional level in the EU. Besides, due to data availability issues, our dataset includes 14 out of 19 Eurozone countries and covers the 1999–2015 period. The fourteen countries are the first eleven countries that adopted the euro in 1999 (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain), plus Greece (joining the Eurozone in 2001), Slovenia (2007), and Slovakia (2009). The five countries that are not included in the dataset are Cyprus and Malta (the two islands have been Eurozone members since 2008), and the three Baltic countries (Estonia adopted the euro in 2011, Latvia in 2014, and Lithuania in 2015). The problem of missing data is particularly acute for these countries.Footnote 10 It is important to note that, in our empirical analysis, the 14 Eurozone countries are destination countries. The countries of origin of migrants are the 19 Eurozone countries, the EU countries (except Eurozone countries) and non-EU countries (the rest of the world as a whole). Our three measures of net migration rates are ultimately based on an aggregate of bilateral net inflows between the 14 Eurozone countries and each group of countries of origin (Eurozone, EU countries outside the Eurozone, non-EU countries). Unfortunately, it is not possible to study the impact of the creation of the euro on labor mobility because the sample period is too short. We look at the impact of the crisis instead. Furthermore, we do not examine the mobility of workers but of people. Our empirical approach is indeed based on data of foreign population of all ages, because there is a lack of data on migrants of working age from Eurozone countries.Footnote 11 The paper is organized as follows. In “Related Literature” section, we review the related literature. In “Methodology” section , we explain the methodology, and in “Data” section, we present the data. We comment our estimation results in “Estimation Results” section and conclude in “Conclusion” section.",2
61,2,Comparative Economic Studies,04 December 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-018-0080-6,"Monetary Union, Competitiveness and Raw Commodity Dependence: Insights from Africa",June 2019,Alexandre Henry,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Two African economic and monetary communities, the “West African Economic and Monetary Union” (WAEMU) and the “Central African Economic and Monetary Community” (CAEMC) have been using the franc CFA (standing for African Financial Community, in French) as a currency since 1945. Eight countries belong to the WEAMU, and six countries belong to CAEMC. The franc CFA zone is an excellent economics case study because it combines two key features: an unaccomplished economic integration and a double monetary constraint. The economic integration in both these two communities still lags today due to the establishment process of the franc CFA zone. Monetary integration was first imposed by the French and is part of the WAEMU and CAEMC’s post-colonial legacy. This legacy is an obstacle that prevents CFA members from meeting the criteria which would make it beneficial for members to join a monetary union. Following Mundell (1961) and McKinnon’s (1963) definition of optimal currency area (OCA) criteria, the recent literature has stressed that the CFA zone is a poor match due to the lack of trade integration and the low synchronization of business cycle. Furthermore, the recent literature states that the CFA zone is not an optimal currency area (Bénassy-Quéré and Coupet 2005; Karras 2006; Tapsoba 2008; Debrun et al. 2005; Loureiro et al. 2011; Couharde et al. 2013a, b; Gnimassoun and Coulibaly 2014). Another unique feature of the CFA zone is that it is the only monetary union that uses a common currency which is itself pegged to another one. Therefore, one could infer that CFA countries are subject to a double constraint regarding their monetary policy. Not only are CFA countries constrained by the common policy determined by their common central bank (respectively, the BCEAO—Banque Centrale des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest—for the West and the BEAC—Banque des Etats de l’Afrique Centrale—for the Central region), but they are also required to align their common monetary policy to that of the eurozone. On top of these monetary constraints, the export structure of the CFA economies is heavily dependent on commodities. All of these constraints are challenges for the macroeconomic policy of the CFA member states. The academic literature assessing the adverse consequences from belonging to a less-than-optimal monetary zone has yet to look at the transmission channel challenges introduced by the peg to the euro of the franc CFA. To the best of our knowledge, no study has explored the relationships between exchange rates and key macroeconomic variables in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. There exists however the literature arguing that the peg contributes to macroeconomic stability in the WAEMU and CAEMC. A number of researchers highlight the benefits of the stability of the monetary zone, in particular for its positive effect on the attractivity for foreign direct investment (FDI) compared to other SSA countries (Suliman et al. 2015 for US pegs; Reinhart and Rogoff 2003; Ramirez and Tsangarides 2007; Bangake and Eggoh 2012, for the euro pegs). Yet, no paper has focused on the transmission channels of FDI in CFA economies, leaving open the question of the macroeconomic benefits of the monetary union. This paper aims to fill the gap left by the existing literature by addressing the following question: to what extent are the constraints on monetary policy able to affect trade, competitiveness and growth of countries that are highly dependent on commodities? To answer this question, we perform a comparative analysis of two sets of SSA countries: those belonging to the franc CFA monetary zone and those integrated in an economic union but not in a monetary zone—also referred to as extra-CFA countries. A panel VAR analysis is performed on these two subsets of countries to assess the impact that the peg has on the relationships between growth rate, current account, real effective exchange rate, foreign direct investment and terms of trade. The paper contributes in several ways to the existing literature on the franc CFA zone and the impact of the peg to the euro area. The analysis compares SSA countries that belong only to an economic union to those which have integrated further through a monetary union to estimate the cost-benefit trade-off of belonging to the CFA zone and its double monetary constraint. In addition, the paper contributes to the literature related to the competitiveness and trade balance challenges faced by developing economies which are dependent on commodities. The first major result shows the inefficiency of investment transmission channels in CFA economies. Even if the peg sends a positive signal to foreign investors, FDI is mainly driven by the prices of exported commodities. Moreover, the results show the absence of a positive impact that foreign investment has on the trade balance in CFA countries, in contrast to extra-CFA countries where there is a significant impact. The second major result is the rejection of the Marshall–Lerner condition in the CFA zone. As opposed to other monetary zones where members suffer from an inability to stimulate exports through the nominal exchange rate tool, the competitiveness of CFA members is not impacted by this monetary constraint. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. “Combining Commodity Dependence and a Peg” section develops the theoretical challenge associated with the combination of the peg and commodity dependence, “Empirical Strategy” section presents the empirical strategy, the dataset, and the PVAR model. “Results and Interpretation” section presents the results, “Transmission Mechanisms and Public Policies” section gives policy recommendations, and “Conclusion” section presents the conclusion of the paper.",2
61,2,Comparative Economic Studies,18 December 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-018-0081-5,Trade in Fuels and Environmental Regulation: A Two-Sided Story,June 2019,Thais Nunez-Rocha,Camelia Turcu,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"The objective of this paper is to empirically assess, the impact of environmental regulation on the trade in fuels.Footnote 1 More specifically we aim at providing answers to the following questions: What are the effects of environmental laws related to the extraction and to the use of non-renewable resources on the bilateral trade of fuels? are there specific differences depending on the international or national character of the laws, or on the environmental subject of these laws? is there a polluting resource displacement effect—i.e., will a more stringent use-type environmental regulation in the exporting countries lead to greater export of polluting fuels? In order to answer these questions, we use a newly constructed environmental regulation variable in a gravity model framework on a panel of 141 countries over an 18-year time span. Further on, we explain why it is interesting to focus on this link between trade in fuels and environmental regulation. At international level, the oil production, in volume, doubled between 1965 and 1980, and continued to increase further on, by 30% a year until 2010 (Ruta and Venables 2012). If this is true on the supply side, on the demand side, significant changes have taken place as well, with a surge in the oil import demand coming from emerging countries (Ruta and Venables 2012). Therefore, the share of fuels production traded internationally has increased sharply in the recent period. In particular, 93% of the total oil production at the world level is exported nowadays.Footnote 2Hence, when it comes to fuel products focusing on trade, captures, to a large extent, what it happens also with the production. Moreover, the share of the fuel exports in total natural resources exports is between 71 and 75%, in the period of our analysis (See Fig. 1). The extraction and export of this non-renewable resource, incorporated in the fuel products, generate important revenues for exporting countries. Nevertheless, this comes along with environmental drawbacks that can generate pollution, either from the extraction or the use of these resources. National and international environmental damages related to the use of fuels are largely documented in the literature (Frankel 2009). For example, the greenhouse gas effects, acid rain and respiratory disease are to a large extent caused by the burning of fossil fuels (i.e., motor vehicle emissions are one of the main causes of air pollution) (Schauer et al. 2001). Additionally, fuel products are important sources of anthropogenic air pollution coming from industry, agriculture, transportation and household sources. The process of fuels’ extraction itself can cause pollution as well: However, these environmental problems can be more localized (Frankel 2009). For example, fuels extraction can impact human and wild life through water and land pollution (Epstein et al. 2011; Allred et al. 2015). For these reasons, we consider fuels as a non-renewable resource causing pollution: This is an idea put forward in the underlying literature (Schou 2000; Amundsen and Schöb 1999; Kolstad et al. 1993) without being very much explored (Copeland and Taylor 2013). These pollution effects related to the extraction and the use of fuels can be tackled through environmental regulation. Natural resources and Fuels exports Countries can react and built environmental regulation to fight against this pollution (Woo 2007). Environmental regulation can be measured in several ways and at different levels (Brunel and Levinson 2016). At international level, it is usually captured by the number of international treaties with environmental provisions signed and or ratified by countries (Bazillier et al. 2017; Baghdadi et al. 2013); at national level, it is frequently measured by the Environmental Performance IndexFootnote 3 or by the indexes constructed based on the perception of economic agents (i.e., based on survey of business managers, as the one of WEF Executive Opinions). These indexes, widely used in the literature, have several limitations. The EPI index is rather narrow, covering few environmental subjects, and is available only for several years. The survey indexes have a limited country coverage and are considered to be subjective, since they are intrinsically biased by the perception of the respondents. As for the count indicators related to the international treaties, they underline mainly the trade perspective and less the environmental one. In addition, even if now they have been emerging very fast, they are available only for short time periods: Therefore, it is not easy to assess their variability when using them individually, except in some specific cases (Núñez-Rocha and Martínez-Zarzoso 2018a; Kellenberg 2012). Within this framework, we choose to take an original approach and proxy the environmental regulation by the environmental laws, passed by countries at national and international levels. This choice is justified on several grounds. First, environmental laws are supposed to be the expression of different social and economic claims and of government priorities in relation to different environmental subjects (Karelakis et al. 2013; Daramola 2012; Prizzia 2005). Second, environmental laws could change the behavior of economic agents and can thus have a positive impact on the environmental outcomes, depending on the national or international character of the law and on the economic and institutional development of the country applying it.Footnote 4 Third, and probably the most important, the goal of this research is to use an environmental regulation variable that can be comparable across countries and have a sufficient time dimension, to allow us working in a panel data setting. This enables to capture, ceteris paribus, long-term phenomena and to tackle, in our specific framework, countries’ reaction in terms of fuels exports, when an increasing environmental regulation is at work. Therefore, we use an environmental regulation intensity index based on the number of laws by country, year and subject.Footnote 5 Specifically, this index is determined by the sum of laws in a country for a given year and environmental subject.Footnote 6 Taking into account the different subjects, we are able to distinguish between environmental intensity indices dealing with (1) the extraction of fuels (Mineral resource laws; Water) and (2) with the use of fuels (Environmental general issues; Air and Atmosphere; Energy laws). Moreover, we take a step further and compute each of these indices at national (i.e., taking account of the national environmental laws of a country) and international level (i.e., using the international environmental treaties). Environmental regulation is not very much present in the literature on the non-renewable resources and trade. This literature is mainly constructed along two conventional lines: (1) one that investigates the effects of fuels exports on the economic growth of the exporting countries, in the spirit of Sachs and Warner (1995); (2) another one that considers fuels as natural endowments and analyze accordingly countries’ and regions’ economic geography (Collier et al. 2008). In the first approach analyzing natural resources and trade (1), the question that is raised is whether the resources’ extraction and export is generating a resource curse or blessing (Sachs and Warner 1995; Lederman and Maloney 2008). Studies about trade in non-renewable resources as fuel and mining products do not put forward clear cut conclusions concerning the link between trade in non-renewable resources and depletion (Van der Ploeg and Venables 2011a). This is due to the fact that different factors affect trade in fuels, as exchange rates, long-terms contracts and taxes (Frankel 2012). In this perspective, countries’ institutional quality is also considered as it can impact the link between natural resources’ availability, extraction and trade (Venables et al. 2007; Frankel 2012; Porter 2011). The other strand of the literature focusing on the trade of natural resources (2), considers natural resources as factor endowments. Two dimensions can be underlined within this framework: On the one hand, the location of natural resources’ extraction is analyzed in order to identify trade patterns (Collier et al. 2008); on the other hand, trade structure and the intensity of extraction are studied (Venables et al. 2007; Van der Ploeg and Venables 2011b). Within this framework, there has been considerable interest in integrating trade rules focusing on resource management into GATT and other international trade agreements as underlined already by Brander and Taylor (1995). However, in this setting, little has been said about the link between the environmental regulations and trade in fuels. Bringing pollution and environmental regulation issues into this literature related to non-renewable natural resources and trade, allows to make reference to the general concept of industrial pollution displacement (Kellenberg and Levinson 2013; Millimet and Roy 2016; Zugravu-Soilita 2017; Cole et al. 2013). We can reformulate this concept, by following the logic of Copeland and Taylor (2013)Footnote 7, and apply it in the case of fuels. Hence, we propose a novel approach, introducing the idea of a pollutant resource displacement that can emerge if there is an increasing environmental regulation. We do this by arguing the following: If a country is relatively endowed with non-renewable natural resources (i.e., fuels) and it uses intensively these resources in the industry sectors, it might increase its pollution level when it produces more; if the country introduces a more stringent environmental regulation (related to the use of fuel products, for example), then it might be induced to export more of the polluting resources and resources-related products in order to comply with the increased environmental laws. This might be associated, in our framework of trade in fuels, to a polluting fuels displacement. Our paper is different from the literature as: (1) it addresses the link between trade and environmental regulation at empirical level by putting a specific focus on the trade in non-renewable resources (i.e., fuel products) seen as future potential pollutants; this is, as far as we know it, the first paper to address the effect of environmental regulations on trade in fuels; (2) it focuses on environmental regulations, evaluated in an original way, both at national and international levels, and in relation to the extraction and the use of non-renewable resources. Introducing this latter classification in terms of environmental regulation is new in the literature. Moreover, the environmental laws database covers a time-country dimension that was not studied till now; and (3) our results show a stronger impact on trade of the laws focusing on the use of fuels than of those focusing on the extraction. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Second section presents the methodology and data. Third section describes the results and interpret them. Fourth section presents the robustness tests. Fifth section summaries our key findings and considers their policy implications. Fifth section concludes.",4

The pace of reforms has varied over time, and in some sectors reforms have progressed faster than in others, but generally the direction of travel has been clear throughout the past four decades: toward more market-based determination of production and prices. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has sought to maintain its overall control over the society, and has also succeeded in this. This dichotomy is interesting in itself, and may prove to be a serious obstacle to future reforms. Nevertheless, so far the economic results of the reforms are nothing short of remarkable. Figure 1 shows the evolution of per capita GDP in China and—for comparison—in the USA. At the beginning of the reforms, China’s per capita GDP (with purchasing power correction) was less than 3% of the US level.Footnote 1 In 2018, 40 years after the start of the reforms, this ratio was approximately 30%. Source IMF World Economic Outlook database Per capita GDP, current purchasing-power corrected US dollars. To mark the 40th anniversary of the beginning of economic reforms in China, the Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition (BOFIT) together with the Global Research Unit of the City University of Hong Kong and Fordham University organized a conference in Hong Kong on December 3–4, 2018, to assess the current state or Chinese reforms and outcomes of those reforms. This special issue includes five papers from that conference, covering various aspects of China’s economic and institutional development.Footnote 2 In this article, I shall both discuss these papers but also assess the last 40 years of economic reforms in China—briefly. In many ways, China’s economic transition has been quite different from the transition experience in the Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia. In China, the political system and the ultimate holder of power, the Communist Party, have remained intact throughout the reform period. In the Soviet Union and its former satellites, economic reform started in earnest only after the political system had been transformed. Also, in many cases the dissolution of political power also led to break-up of countries, which complicated the task of reforming the economy even further, as production networks and trading arrangements were broken (Korhonen 2019). In the second section, I look at the early economic reforms in China, and the third section looks at external liberalization, China joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), and developments since the global financial crisis. Fourth section concludes by speculating about the future of economic reforms and economic growth in China.",

In the case of China, the world’s second largest economy by nominal GDP and largest in terms of purchasing power parity, gross domestic product figures matter for the entire world. China accounts for nearly a fifth of global aggregate GDP and a third of global GDP growth. Against this backdrop is the long-standing debate over the reliability of China’s GDP figures. An appendix in Jia (2011) offers an extensive literature review on the studies of China’s macro-data quality. For example, Rawski (2001) argues that the Chinese economy may have grown by a couple of percentage points less than the official 1997–2001 figures (about 7% p.a.). Others (e.g., Maddison and Wu 2007; Maddison 2006a, b; Young 2003) make similar findings after comparing official GDP figures against various supply side indicators. Other studies contradict these findings. For example, Holz (2006a, b, 2014), Clark et al. (2017a, b), and Perkins and Rawski (2008) assert that the official data is roughly correct and may even understate true economic growth. To resolve this issue, several alternative GDP measures have emerged. The Conference Board’s Total Economy Database provides an alternative estimate for Chinese GDP data based on the working paper of Wu (2014). The Conference Board assessment presumes biases in the data relate to misreporting at the local level and methodological opacity, especially with regard to price deflators. The Conference Board’s alternative series is constructed from the bottom up on a sector-by-sector basis, relying on both official and constructed series. This alternative GDP series indicates much larger volatility in the year-on-year estimates, sometimes showing higher growth rates than the official numbers (de Vries and Erumban 2017). A second widely cited alternative is the Li Keqiang index, named after the current premier. A US State Department memo released by Wikileaks reveals that Li, while serving as a party committee secretary in Liaoning, confided to the US ambassador in 2007 how unreliable China’s official GDP figures were. Instead of the official GDP figures, he personally used three alternative indicators to determine what was actually happening in the economy: electricity volume, bank loans, and railway cargo volume. The Li Keqiang index reveals a much more volatile economy in recent years than the official figures suggest. Fernald et al. (2015) proxy China’s economic activity with trade partner export data. Because imports move very closely with GDP in economies with good statistical systems, they utilize export data to China or Hong Kong as reported by the USA, the euro area, and Japan. For a dataset ending in 2014, they find a significant improvement in the reliability of reported Chinese GDP figures since 2008 in capturing fluctuations in economic activity. Chinese GDP growth has also been estimated from outer space. Growth in nighttime light intensity has proven a good proxy for economic growth that is immune to falsification and misreporting (Henderson et al. 2012). Satellites measure the brightness of nighttime lights across Chinese provinces over time. The estimated GDP in Henderson et al. (2012) for 1992–2006 indicates a sizable gap to the officially reported GDP figures. Clark et al. (2017a, b) further utilize this nighttime light data to estimate an alternative weighted average of the three indicators in the Li Keqiang index. Since 2012, their estimate of Chinese GDP was never lower than the official statistics and shows an acceleration in 2016, even as the official growth rate remained virtually unchanged. Other alternative indices include Barclays’ index, which uses purchasing manager indices (PMIs), as well as the Bloomberg and Capital Economic (CE) indices, which use linear combinations of variables such as value added of industrial production, freight, passenger traffic, electricity production, floor space completed, and retail sales. The Lombard Street Index (by TS Lombard) takes the official nominal GDP and a range of price indices covering all expenditure components of GDP to compute an alternative deflator, from which is calculated the alternative real GDP growth rate. Based on the broad range of alternative estimates, the current “true value” of Chinese GDP growth could be anywhere between 3% and just over 10%. Data discrepancies are always problematic and can distort assessments of the economic situation leading to inappropriate economic policies and bad business decisions. Equally problematic is the remarkable stability of the real GDP growth figures reported in recent years masking all changes in economic activity. This paper seeks to track the missing fluctuations of the real GDP growth rate by experimenting with alternative deflators. The paper is organized as follows. A brief overview of the national gross domestic product and deflators is given in the next section. Alternative deflators and the respective real GDP growth rates are calculated and presented in “Computing Alternative Deflators” section. “Discussion of Findings and Conclusions” section discusses the findings and concludes.",6

Agrarian Institutions and Contract Choice in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,December 2019,Nozilakhon Mukhamedova,Richard Pomfret,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Agrarian contracts that make farmers less than full residual claimants may lead to potentially low agricultural productivity. Marshall (1920, Book VI, ChapterX.4fn) pointed out the inefficiency associated with rewarding farmers with only a portion of their marginal product; farmers will supply less labor than under arrangements in which they receive their full marginal product, and output will be sub-optimal.Footnote 1 Even if sharecropping as an institutional feature of agriculture has historical roots, it should disappear because landowners can obtain more by self-managing the production or by offering fixed rental contracts. However, rural agricultural societies recurringly opt for output-sharing contracts in which a tenant farmer pays a share of his output to the landowner. Hence, the Marshall Paradox: Why do we still observe sharecropping? Drawing on survey evidence and qualitative study of land and labor institutions in Central Asia, we focus on tenancy and labor contracts and particularly on sharecropping as a second-best response in a situation where agents are constrained by inefficient institutions. Central Asian rural societies and agricultural systems have experienced major institutional changes over the last half century from responses in the late Soviet era to the inefficiency of collective agriculture and through the dissolution of the Soviet Union and end of central planning, to separate reform trajectories in the newly independent countries. Over a quarter century after independence, the institutional evolution is still ongoing, and a complex re-arrangement of old and new institutions is taking place.Footnote 2 In the Soviet farming systems, experiments in contractual relations linking land and labor aimed at increasing productivity by moving workers from wage contracts to alternative forms of remuneration (Wädekin 1989; Brooks 1990). Since independence, Central Asian countries have been searching to construct new organizational forms of agriculture. Fragmentation of the large-scale farm system promoted the establishment of smaller family farms, which were expected to achieve higher levels of productivity and efficiency than corporate farms (Lerman 2009). The limited field evidence (Veldwisch and Spoor 2008; Djanibekov et al. 2013) suggests that the new systems have not yet led to efficient contractual arrangements, such as generally characterize agriculture in high-income countries, and evidence of sharecropping, although of uncertain legality, is reported. The first section of this paper reviews the sharecropping debate. Section 2 describes the main institutional changes in Central Asia and the data. The third section cites respondents’ views clearly indicating that they appreciated the Marshallian inefficiency argument and also understood the potential for dispute among participants in a sharecropping arrangement that could destroy friendships or even family ties. At the same time, respondents recognized that in the presence of institutional constraints (e.g., bans on subleasing, limited access to irrigation and other inputs, or valuable non-marketed benefits from some actions) some form of sharecropping could be the second-best contractual arrangement. The fourth section revisits the determinants of sharecropping by differentiating between crops; cotton harvesting is relatively easy to supervise and is associated with fixed wages, while labor inputs in rice or vegetable production are harder to monitor, favoring a fixed land rent. By taking evidence from two countries, we examine the importance of the institutional differences between the more market-based allocation of labor and land in Kazakhstan and the more regulated markets in Uzbekistan. The final section concludes.",7

Empirical Evidence from North Africa,December 2019,Ousama Ben-Salha,Zouhair Mrabet,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The relationship between output and unemployment has been largely documented in the economic literature. Such a relationship has been captured by means of the so called Okun’s law, which suggests the presence of an inverse statistical association between the two variables. According to the original work of Okun (1962), one percentage point more in the unemployment rate has been associated with about three percent fall in real GNP during the postwar period in USA. Since then, the output–unemployment link has received a huge attention from both economists and policymakers and continues to be in the center of the scholars’ interest, especially in the aftermath of the latest economic and financial crisis. Although the inverse relationship between output and unemployment has been frequently confirmed, recent empirical studies have often reached mixed results regarding the robustness and stability of the Okun’s law. First, some researchers have focused on the Okun’s law by extending the analysis beyond the aggregate macroeconomic variables. The diverse reaction of unemployment associated with some groups of the labor force to fluctuations in the business cycle has prompted a fresh discussion framework on the relationship between output and unemployment (Razzu and Singleton 2013; Zanin 2014). The disaggregation of unemployment might offer a clearer picture on the degree of vulnerability of some specific groups, such as youth, to economic fluctuations. Second, a large body of the literature has been based on a linear framework by implicitly assuming the presence of a symmetric impact (Christopoulos 2004; Gabrisch and Buscher 2006). However, recent empirical investigations suggest that the Okun’s law may exhibit nonlinear and asymmetric behaviors (Silvapulle et al. 2004; Huang and Chang 2005; Koutroulis et al. 2016). This has been especially motivated by the sharp fluctuations of business cycles experienced by many countries around the World and resulting in recession and expansion periods. Third, some other studies shed lights on the relevance of Okun’s law at a regional level and conclude that the magnitude of the Okun’s coefficient is subject to important spatial heterogeneities (Pereira 2014; Binet and Facchini 2013). The present study contributes to the existing literature by estimating the relationship between gross domestic product and unemployment in four North African countries, namely Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. By doing so, it discriminates itself from previous studies in several directions. To start, this is the first study investigating the validity of Okun’s law in the North African region, since most of previous studies focused on developed and some Asian and Latin American countries. In fact, North African countries have witnessed many economic and financial reforms during the last decades, such as the adoption of structural adjustment programs and the conclusion of many bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. Despite all efforts, their economies have been trapped in a vicious development cycle and have been unable to reach economic growth that allows creating enough jobs. The situation is particularly critical in countries that experienced heavy political turmoil known as the Arab Spring. As it is well known, despite the Arab Spring led to important political changes, its deep reasons have not been political, but rather social and economic. Among others, the significant regional disparities, the endemic corruption and the high unemployment rates pushed people to manifest against the existing political regimes. In addition to these political and economic changes, North African countries have faced important social challenges, materialized especially by the exponential growth of youth population and the demographic pressure. According to the Global Employment Trends for Youth 2015 published by the International Labour Organization (2015), North African countries recorded the highest youth unemployment rate in the World, reaching 30.5% in 2014. Understanding the relationship between the economic activity and unemployment in these countries might help policymakers to design suitable labor market policies. Second, this paper investigates the validity of the Okun’s law for different categories of the labor force as determined by age-group (youth, adult) and gender (male, female). This analysis is mainly motivated by the potential existence of labor market disparities and will allow identifying group-specific reactions. Moreover, it is possible that the Okun’s law may be confirmed for some groups of the population, while this may not be the case for the whole population. Third, this paper aims not only to estimate the Okun’s coefficient, but also to check its stability and robustness. Regarding this point, we employ two versions of the linear Okun’s law (first difference model and gap model) and account for potential nonlinearities, threshold and asymmetries in the unemployment–output relationship. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. “Brief Review of the Related Literature” section reviews the recent empirical literature documenting the Okun’s law. In “Key Characteristics of Labor Markets in North Africa” section, we outline the key characteristics of labor markets in North African countries. “Empirical Issues” section describes the empirical methodology and data. The empirical results are wrapped in “Empirical Findings” section, while “Concluding Remarks and Policy Implications” section draws concluding remarks and policy implications.",7

These shocks are analysed as unfortunate, but separate events. This paper argues that far from being unrelated, the banking crisis and Brexit are intimately connected with the fiscal costs of the former precipitating the vote in favour of the latter. If this claim is accepted, it is reasonable to suppose that the total impact of the financial crisis on potential output is of the order of twice the conventional estimate. It is widely accepted that banking crises have a lasting negative impact on the level of GDP that the economy can produce at full capacity, i.e. on potential output. This effect comes through decreases in capital, human capital and total factor productivity. A conventional estimate might be that the crisis of 10 years ago probably reduced the level of potential output in the UK by somewhere between 3.8 and 7.5%. This would account for part, but by no means all, of the ‘productivity puzzle’. There are typically severe fiscal implications of a banking crisis which will be reflected in a significant rise in the structural budget deficit and in the public debt to GDP ratio; by 2010, the UK was in just this position. Damage will be done in the short term by the impact of recession on the public finances and by the costs of rescuing the banks, and in the long term by lower tax revenue consequent on the fall in productive potential. A period of painful fiscal consolidation (‘austerity’) will typically be required to restore fiscal sustainability. Prolonged austerity is likely to have political ramifications. Losers can be expected to protest. After the UK fiscal squeeze began in 2010, it seems that a large part of the protest vote went to UKIP and then continued into voting Leave in the EU referendum in June 2016. Without this protest vote, Leave would not have won and without the surge in support for UKIP there would not have been a referendum. So Brexit can be seen as a consequence of the fiscal costs of the financial crisis. There is a near consensus that Brexit will adversely affect the level of potential output compared with the counterfactual of remaining in the EU. The size of this effect depends on the type of Brexit that takes place and is quite difficult to estimate. That said, the mainstream literature suggests that it could easily be of a similar magnitude to the impact of the banking crisis, perhaps within the range 3.9–8.7% of GDP. If it seems reasonable to see Brexit as an outcome of the financial crisis, then the total (direct and indirect) loss in the level of potential output from that crisis would be between 7.7 and 16.2% of GDP. This argument is developed in the paper, as follows. In ‘Estimates of the Impact of the Banking Crisis on UK Potential Output’ section, the direct effect of the banking crisis on potential output is quantified using the best available estimates from the literature. In ‘Fiscal Implications of the UK Banking Crisis’ section, the fiscal consequences of the crisis as seen at the time and the associated changes in fiscal policy compared with pre-crisis expectations are reviewed. The case for considering post-crisis austerity as a crucial factor in the victory of Leave in the EU referendum is developed in ‘Austerity and Votes for Leave’ section. Estimates of the impact of Brexit on the level of potential output are discussed in ‘Mainstream Estimates of the Effect of Brexit on Potential Output’ section. ‘Conclusions’ section concludes.",3

62,1,Comparative Economic Studies,16 July 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-019-00101-3,National Identity and Public Goods Provision,March 2020,Ani Harutyunyan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Nation-building and creation of strong national identity are believed to have a positive influence on economic and political outcomes of the country and are proposed as a remedy for alleviating the adverse effects of fractionalization (Miguel 2004; Ahlerup and Hansson 2011; Manning and Roy 2010, etc.). However, empirical investigations showing the positive effect of national identity remain largely absent. This paper investigates the relationship between national identity and public goods provision for a broad cross section of countries. Using a survey data for measuring national identity, a broad set of indicators of public goods provision, and a full battery of controls, this study shows that national identity and public goods provision are negatively related. The results also show that national identity does not mitigate the adverse effects of fractionalization on public goods provision and might even amplify it by hindering provision of public goods. National identity is a type of social identity. The concept of social identity was first developed by Tajfel and Turner (1979) to explain inter-group discrimination. The main insight into the identity theory is that when people belong to a group, they identify themselves with that group and are likely to derive self-esteem from the group membership, which creates in-group enhancement in ways that favour the in-group members. Following the social identity theory, a growing body of experimental research investigates the impact of common identity on behaviour. It focuses either on artificially created group identity in the laboratory or on social identities, such as a nation. The experimental research, pioneered by Tajfel and Turner (1979) and continued with experiments conducted by economists including monetary incentives (Chen and Li 2009), shows that even a weak categorization of groups makes subjects to show favour to their in-group members. This is expressed in form of more charity, less envy, more positive reciprocity, less negative reciprocity, and more social welfare-maximizing actions towards in-group members (West et al. 2009; Cunningham 2005; Dovidio and Gaertner 2000; Dovidio et al. 2009). For instance, Eckel and Grossman (2005) show that highlighting group members common attributes increases cooperation in public goods games. National identity is a common identity among people living in the same country, so according to social identity theory and based on the ample evidence that experimental research provides, strong national identity is expected to mitigate the adverse effects of the biases among different groups in a country and have a positive effect on public goods provision. However, this study, contrary to the social identity theory, reveals a negative relationship between national identity and public goods provision. Without rejecting the possibility that national identity may have a mitigating effect on group biases for effective provision of public goods, this study suggests other channels through which national identity affects public goods provision. The findings of this study also contradict the common wisdom on nation-building, which has been proposed as a policy tool for mitigating the adverse effects of fractionalization. The adverse effect of fractionalization on public goods provision is well documented in the literature (La Porta et al. 1999; Alesina et al. 1999, 2003; Miguel and Gugerty 2005; Banerjee et al. 2005; Habyarimana et al. 2007), which often discusses nation-building as a remedy for potential problems associated with social distance in general and with ethnically fragmented societies in particular. For example, Miguel (2004) examines the provision of public goods in two nearby rural districts: one in western Kenya and one in western Tanzania, and argues that the Tanzanian nation-building approach has allowed ethnically diverse rural areas to achieve considerable success in fund raising for local public goods, while diverse communities in the nearby Kenyan region typically fail. However, this study shows that national identity, as an indicator of successful nation-building, does not mitigate the adverse effect of fractionalization on public goods provision and even amplifies it. 
Alesina and Reich (2013) define nation-building as “a process which leads to the formation of countries in which the citizens feel sufficient amount of commonality of interests, goals, and preferences so that they do not wish to separate from each other.” Consistent with this definition, this study argues that national identity is a tool for keeping the citizens together and the country stable, along with the provision of public goods. Therefore, national identity acts as a substitute for public goods provision for keeping the country stable. As a result, countries heavily engaged in nation-building might not find the necessity of improving public goods provision. Figure 1 depicts the relationship between national identity and a well-known indicator of public goods provision, infant mortality. Based on the top and bottom quartile percentiles of each measure, four grids are drawn. Most of the countries either have a high level of national identity and a high level of infant mortality, thus low level of provision of that public goods [High–Low (HL) segment], or low level of national identity and low level infant mortality, thus high level of provision of that public goods [Low–High (LH) segment]. There is only one country in the High–High (HH) segment with both high national identity and high public goods provision. The figure detects no countries in the Low–Low (LL) segment, where both national identity and public goods provision are at low levels. The depicted pattern of the relationship between national identity and infant mortality is observed with many other well-known indicators of public goods provision: school attainment, illiteracy rate, infrastructure quality, as well as various measures of health care and access to public services.Footnote 1 Most of the countries are either in the HL or the LH segment; there are only a few countries in the HH segment and no countries in the sample which are in the LL segment. The observed consistent pattern across a wide range of indicators of public goods provision yields to a hypothesis that countries should have either a high level of public goods provision or strong national identity. National identity and infant mortality In order to explain the mechanism behind the observed relationship between national identity and public goods provision, the paper develops a theory on country stability incorporating the concept of social identity into economic modelling. The approach is inspired by the undertakings of Akerlof and Kranton (2000), Benabou and Tirole (2003), and Shayo (2009), who incorporated social identity theory into economic theory to shed light on the understanding of different phenomena not well captured by the theories solely based on individual-level incentives. The short-term model on country stability, developed in this paper, links stability to the strength of national identity and the level of public goods provision. The government’s objective is to maximize country’s stability subject to limited tax revenue for providing public goods and also so-called national identity goods for the purpose of raising national pride among its citizens. The provision of national identity can be implemented through inventing and reinforcing “national flags, symbols, anthems, holidays, rituals, and traditions” (Tilly 1994), sponsoring public schools and mandating national histories to be taught in them (Lewis 1975), establishing national museums, building national monuments, naming and renaming streets, schools, and government buildings for national “heroes” (Centeno 2002), as well as through public broadcasting (DellaVigna et al. 2014), language policies (Clots-Figueras and Masella 2013), and military conscription. In order to strengthen country’s stability, the government spends the tax revenue between the provision of public goods and national identity goods, depending on the costs associated with the provision of those goods. For example, the low cost associated with public goods provision due to well-developed infrastructure and high total factor productivity leads to more investment on public goods provision versus national identity, especially when the country does not have well-established national institutions. Such countries are likely to locate in the LH segment. On the contrary, when the country does not have a well-established infrastructure for the provision of public goods and, instead, has favourable preconditions for the provision of national identity goods, the government chooses to invest more on national identity for the purpose of strengthening country stability, locating in the HL segment. Some governments distribute the tax revenue on both goods equally, due to equal costs, and if the tax revenues are high enough, the country locates itself in the HH segment. If a country is not able to invest in either of the goods, due to low tax revenues or high costs associated with the provision of both goods, it ends up in the LL segment as an unstable country.Footnote 2 This research closely relates to the following studies which link national identity with economic outcomes. Shayo (2009) studies the effect of national identity on redistribution in democratic countries and shows that national identity tends to reduce support for redistribution. The findings of this study are along the lines of the findings of Shayo (2009) on the negative relationship between redistribution and national identity. That is expected, since public goods entail a dimension of redistribution. Shayo (2009) explains the negative relationship between national identity and redistribution through reduced demand for redistribution among the poor due to the attachment to the nation, which acts as a substitute to income for increasing utility. This study explains the negative relationship between national identity and public goods provision through reduced investment on public goods provision due to the attachment to the nation, which acts as a substitute to public goods provision for increasing country stability. 
Suesse (2018) suggests that the break-up of the Soviet Union was a result of incentives to restrict domestic trade by regional elites from the regions with low levels of “soviet” national identity. This argument is consistent with the theory of this paper, which argues that low levels of national identity, unless accompanied by high levels of public goods provision, have an adverse effect on country stability and may yield to break-up and secession. 
Lan and Li (2015) examine the effect of economic openness on nationalism and find that a region’s increasing foreign trade reduces its economic interests in its domestic market and thus weakens its nationalism. Mayda and Rodrik (2005) examine individual attitudes towards trade and find that national identity is associated with protectionist tendencies. However, Ahlerup and Hansson (2011) find no evidence that nationalistic sentiments affect actual trade flows. They also examine the effect of national identity on government effectiveness across countries and find U-shaped relationship. The findings of this study relate to Ahlerup and Hansson (2011) regarding the relationship between national identity and government effectiveness, which also encompasses measures of public service delivery. However, this study shows that when public goods provision is considered in particular, the relationship with national identity is not U shaped but strongly negative. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: The second section introduces the data used in the empirical analysis. The third section presents the empirical analysis and its results. The fourth section builds a theoretical framework to explain the empirical findings. The fifth section explores the relationship between national identity and fractionalization. The sixth section concludes.",1

The existing literature related to conflicts and trade has explored several aspects without being concerned about the spillover effects of interstate conflicts on trade in services. Interstate conflicts deteriorate market access and the mobility of factors of production, affecting goods and services at the same time. Even if trade in services is mainly concentrated in developed countries and North-North trade, it is interesting to consider whether conflicts have the same influence on trade in services. Moreover, what service sectors are the most impacted and for what reasons? This paper examines how interstate conflicts affect trade in services at the aggregated and sectoral levels by taking into account the hostility and fatality levels of conflicts based on the Correlates of War (COW) Project data. We also attempt to disentangle the possible heterogeneity in the effects of these events across countries through the geographical locations of the belligerents. As defined by the OECD,Footnote 1 trade in services is the value of servicesFootnote 2 exchanged between residents and non-residents of a country, including services provided through foreign affiliates established abroad. Kimura and Lee (2006) and Ceglowski (2006) show that gravity models applied to trade in services have statistically better results than those applied to trade in goods. For instance, geographical distance has a higher negative effect on trade in services than on trade in goods. Moreover, economic freedom has a stronger impact on services trade relative to trade in goods due to liberalization. At the sectoral level, Guillin (2013) investigates the effects of depth trade agreements in services. She shows that the more sectors are incorporated in RTAs, the higher the impact on trade in services will be. van der Marel and Shepherd (2013) underline the importance of the heterogeneity of services by employing sector-specific analysis. They find that RTAs have the greatest positive impact on finance and business services, whereas Lee and Cho (2017) find significant results for transport service trade. Very few studies focus on the effects of conflict on trade in services relative to trade in goods. Blomberg and Hess (2006) found that external and internal conflicts (such as terrorism) deteriorate trade, and this effect is higher than trade barriers. Martin et al. (2008a) show that military conflicts have a significant negative effect on trade and that the probability of war escalation is lower when trading partners have important bilateral trade linkages. Martin et al. (2008b) mainly found that the trade openness of countries decreases the risk of high-intensity conflicts: “international trade can affect the opportunity cost of civil conflicts through both deterrence and insurance effects”. Glick and Taylor (2010) demonstrated that World War II strongly affected trade when at least one trading partner was engaged in the conflict. Vicard (2012) showed that deeper trade agreements with supranational institutions prevent war, allowing the increase in intra-member trade, whereas shallow trade agreements have no effect on war probabilities. Qureshi (2013) found that intrastate and international war in neighbouring states significantly undermine bilateral trade. We know that military conflicts strongly deteriorate bilateral trade due to an increase in trade costs. Eckstein and Tsiddon (2004) found evidence that the high rate of the index of terrorFootnote 3 during the Arab–Israeli conflict undermined the macroeconomic performance of Israel and had a negative impact on output, consumption, investment and exports. More precisely, conflicts damage physical capital and infrastructure such as transportation corridors harming production capacity and trade. The economic literature has also paid much attention to the role of politics in international trade, as trade can be used as a policy means in the case of conflicts. Indeed, Michaels and Zhi (2010) found that trade decreased by 9% in 2003 due to the political tensions between France and the USA caused by the Iraq War. Heilmann (2016) quantified the impact of international trade boycott (Muhammad Cartoon Crisis in 2005, islands conflict between Japan and China, US boycott of France in 2003, Turkey’s boycott of Israel in 2014). The findings underline that there is no substitution of exports from the boycotted to non-boycotted countries. Rotunno and Vézina (2017) evaluated the effectiveness of boycotts in Israeli trade relations with Muslim countries, and they showed that cutting ties led to reduced exports by 90% on average. This paper contributes to the empirical literature on the spillover effects of interstate conflicts on international trade in services. We therefore build a theory-consistent structural gravity model (Anderson and van Wincoop 2003; Head and Mayer 2014) with a panel database over the period 1985–2016 for eight service sectors (communication, construction, finance, insurance, other business services (OBS), personal, cultural and recreational (PCR) services, and transport and travel). We estimate the effects of conflicts between belligerents, and we take into account the level of hostility (use of force or not) and fatality (victims or not) in conflicts but also the geographical locations of the belligerents to show a possible heterogeneity. Our specifications include three sets of fixed effects: exporter-year, importer-year, and country-pair to account for multilateral resistance terms and the endogeneity of political factors. We implement a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) model with fixed effects for its robustness properties to avoid an omission bias due to zero trade flows in the sample (Santos Silva and Tenreyro 2006, 2011; Fally 2015). This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology and dataset. Section 3 provides empirical results. Some concluding remarks are offered in Sect. 4.",1
62,1,Comparative Economic Studies,17 April 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-019-00092-1,Central Bank Equity as an Instrument of Monetary Policy,March 2020,Mojmir Hampl,Tomas Havranek,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the next recession, central banks will need unconventional monetary policy tools again. By that time, policy rates will hardly have risen high enough to create a sufficient cushion because of the depressed and perhaps even negative natural real rates of interest in all major economies (Holston et al. 2017). Any substantial increase in the natural rate would necessitate unlikely changes in demographics, inequality, globalization, infrastructure investment, relative capital price, and the spread between return on capital and the risk-free rate [see Rachel and Smith (2017), for a structured discussion of the decades-long fall in the natural rate]. In the USA, for example, the average response to a recession has involved cuts in the policy rate of 550 basis points (Reifschneider 2016). Consequently, even when using a relatively optimistic estimate of the natural real rate at 1%, the current research suggests that the zero lower bound will constrain future monetary policy 30–40% of the time (Kiley and Roberts 2017). Interest rate cuts will not suffice in restoring price stability when a downturn occurs. Of course, central banks can resort to the same unconventional policies that were used in the aftermath of the late 2000s crisis: quantitative easing in large economies and foreign exchange interventions in small open economies. These measures appear to have been quite efficient [as shown, among others, by Caselli (2017) and Rodnyansky and Darmouni (2017)], but their incomprehensibility to the public further deepens the already daunting communication problems that central banks face (Braun 2016; Haldane 2017). Moreover, especially in the case of quantitative easing, it is difficult to model and predict the measure’s transmission to the real economy. Central banks handled the Great Recession well, but next time they can do better. Two major streams of literature offer alternative solutions to the zero (or, more precisely, effective) lower bound. The first stream argues that the bound is a policy choice and that central banks can resolve the problem by either abolishing cash or creating an exchange rate between cash and the money stored in bank accounts (Agarwal and Kimball 2015; Rogoff 2017). This is a straightforward solution, though negative rates may create other challenges, especially regarding financial stability, and the concept of an exchange rate between cash and electronic money could prove difficult for the public to grasp. The second stream of literature argues for an increase in the inflation target from 2 to 4% [as summarized, for example, by Ball (2014)]. Although this change would help to avoid the zero lower bound in some mild recessions, it is essentially a proposal to surrender price stability for reasons of technical incompetence. Of the 100 empirical studies that explicitly estimate optimal inflation, less than one-tenth recommend a rate of above 2% (Diercks 2017). The same survey reports that the estimations which specifically incorporate the zero lower bound find on average a desired rate of inflation of 1%. Clearly, 4% rate is far from optimal. Here we discuss a third potential solution to the zero lower bound problem. We call it direct support of consumption, and it is a straightforward application of the helicopter drop idea by Friedman (1969). A helicopter money-based solution to the lower bound emerges as the optimal one in the traditional New Keynesian model plausibly enriched by behavioral inattention (Gabaix 2017) and brings about the first-best outcome: no output gap and inflation at the target. We envision that the central bank creates a digital currency and that all citizens are entitled to sign up for a corresponding digital wallet. In normal times, the wallets stay dormant, and the central bank blocks any transactions to the wallets from standard bank accounts to prevent risks to financial stability. In a recession and at the zero lower bound, the central bank starts to send a specified sum of digital currency to the wallets at regular intervals (say, weekly or monthly), later tapering the drops off as the economy recovers and inflation reappears. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic paper to describe such a policy option explicitly and in practical detail. Direct support of consumption does not alter the size of the central bank’s balance sheet (assets remain completely unchanged), but it immediately leads to an increase in (digital) cash enabled by a decrease in the central bank’s equity.Footnote 1 Hence, central bank equity is used directly as a monetary policy tool, not just as an absorber of the consequences of other policies. Transfers to bank accounts from digital wallets are blocked, and the funds in the wallets have limited time validity or are charged with large negative rates so that households are motivated to spend the funds quickly. In this way, the central bank can influence consumption and thus aggregate demand directly rather than relying on the complex transmission mechanism of quantitative easing and other more conventional unconventional measures. Of course, many practical objections can be made to such a policy, and it is the purpose of the remainder of this paper to study them. The most serious objection is that weakening the financial strength of the central bank by depleting equity could lead to an inability to deliver price stability in the long run. Quite a few empirical studies have examined this topic, and we devote “Central Bank Financial Strength and Price Stability: A Meta-Analysis” section to a quantitative review of this literature. Our results suggest that there is little to no interplay between central bank financial strength and inflation. In “Bolstering Financial Strength with Private Shareholding” section, we discuss how, if considered necessary, central bank financial strength could be bolstered by allowing private shareholding. In “Using Central Bank Equity to Directly Support Consumption” section, we examine the remaining important objections to direct support of consumption: issues of independence, authority, and efficiency. “Concluding Remarks” section closes the paper.",9
62,1,Comparative Economic Studies,15 October 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-019-00107-x,The European Corporate Equity Puzzle,March 2020,Philipp-Bastian Brutscher,Christopher Hols,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"A strong reliance on debt can negatively affect firms’ resilience in times of crisis. Following the financial crisis, companies in Europe suffered from severe debt overhang, which depressed corporate investment and slowed down growth in Europe for several years (Geanakoplos 2014; Lo and Rogoff 2014; Reinhart and Rogoff 2015; Kollmann et al. 2016). In addition, as investments in intangibles become an ever more important part in firms’ investment mix (Falato et al. 2013; Dell’Ariccia et al. 2017; Thum-Thysen et al. 2017; EIB 2017b), a heavy reliance on debt finance risks to hamper future investment activities as the lack of collateral associated with this type of assets makes debt finance less suitable. Notwithstanding, firms in Europe rely primarily on debt if they need external financing for their investments.Footnote 1 Results from the 2016 European Investment Bank’s Investment Survey suggest that debt finance (specifically bank loans) accounts for the vast majority of firms’ external finance.Footnote 2 Only a negligible share of external finance comes in the form of external equity. In addition, IPOs are still far below their pre-crisis levels and have been stagnating over the recent years, despite massive increases in stock prices, which should encourage firms to issue new stocks (Taggart 1977; Marsh 1982; Hovakimian et al. 2001; Baker and Wurgler 2002).Footnote 3 There are two potential reasons why firms might neglect equity financing. First, there could be a shortage in the supply of this kind of finance, i.e. firms do not use more equity because investors do not buy their shares. Second, firms might simply not be interested in equity financing. To understand why firms in Europe continue to rely so much on debt and so little on external equity for their investment activities, we conducted an online choice experiment. By offering firms pairs of hypothetical financing options, we were able to study their preferences over different types of financing. In this paper, we run a controlled and randomized online experiment to analyse firms’ financing preferences over debt and equity in a controlled manner. The samples targeted are the firms that take part in the EIBIS Survey (European Investment Bank Investment Survey), which is a representative sample of the EU corporate sector (NACE C-J). Due to the survey responses, we are able to target specifically firms with a planned investment project. In the experiment, firms are presented with eights pairs of hypothetical financing offers and are asked which one they preferred. As the offers differ in their characteristics including amount, cost of finance and type of finance (loan vs. equity participation), we can examine firms’ willingness to pay for each characteristic. Our results suggest that firms have an aversion towards external equity finance vis-a-vis debt. When faced with the choice between a debt offer and an equity offer, firms pick the debt offer in 80% of cases. Our results suggest that firms would be willing to pay 880 bp more for a debt offer compared to an equity offer with comparable characteristics (assuming a debt offer with the desired amount, maturity, uncollateralized and a fixed interest rate and an equity participation including voting rights). The net premium on debt, which corrects for the influence of corporate control rights, taxes and growth expectations, is around 250 bp.Footnote 4 Our setting does not enable to pin down the root of the debt premium. However, our data suggest that the dominance of banks in financing European companies may have led to a crowding-out effect in the corporate finance market. We observe, for example, that firms that have used bank loans in the last financial year, that report no issue in accessing external finance and firms that are located in regions with stronger property rights, i.e. firms that seem to be better suited to use bank debt, exhibit a larger debt premium. While the willingness to pay a higher cost of capital seems irrational in the first instance, this behaviour could be justified to the extent that firms’ relationship with their main bank provides them with benefits, e.g. emergency credit lines or prolonging credit in case of temporary earning shortfalls that we do not capture—and hence control for—in our experiment. Furthermore, we observe that firms with greater growth perspectives, measured by higher expected net income growth and lower company age, are willing to pay less for debt compared to their less innovative counterparts. Our paper adds to the literature in several ways. First of all, it adds to the literature on capital structure choice. Numerous studies (i.e. Titman and Wessels 1988; Rajan and Zingales 1995; Frank and Goyal 2009) have addressed the question of which type of firms tend to rely more on debt (vs. equity), looking at the correlates between firms’ leverage ratios and their level of uniqueness, size, asset tangibility, profitability.Footnote 5 However, they take the supply of external finance as given, which is not the case, since the availability of equity finance in particular is likely to vary over time, across countries, sectors and firms types. Our study overcomes this obstacle by presenting firms with exogenous financing offers (both debt and equity). This allows us to see which types of firms prefer debt over equity. Secondly, while the existing literature had to be largely qualitative in its prediction on firms’ preference structures (Hovakimian et al. 2001; Bancel and Mittoo 2004; DeAngelo and Roll 2015), our choice experiment allows us to quantify these preferences and put a “willingness to pay” label on the debt versus equity trade-off. This is particularly interesting, insofar as it allows us to examine the question of whether firms opt for the cheapest financing source or whether—in line with the pecking order theory—they inhibit a strong hierarchy in their choice of financing (Leary and Roberts 2005; Lemmon et al. 2008; Lemmon and Zender 2010; DeAngelo and Roll 2015). Finally, our results add to the discussion on the skewness of equity returns. Bessembinder (2018) suggests that stock returns skewness is so large that the median stock delivers a lower return than a 1-month treasury bill and that only a very small fraction of stocks are responsible for all wealth creation. Our findings complement this to the extent that we are able to quantify the firms’ willingness to pay for an equity participation and confirm that firms are unwilling to accept large costs of equity, which could explain the large amount of firms that deliver returns below the one-month treasury rate. Furthermore, this is in line with the results of Fama and French (2004), who suggest that companies that newly list on the stock market have lower survival rates and skewed returns. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: “Experiment, Data and Descriptive Statistics” section lays out the experimental design and the data. “Derivation of the Debt Premium” section describes our calculations of the debt premium. “Estimation and Baseline Results” section presents the empirical results. The relationship between the financial structure and the debt premium is analysed in “The Corporate Equity Puzzle and Financial Structure” section. “Heterogeneity and Robustness Checks” section checks for heterogeneity in the debt premium and performs several robustness checks, while we conclude in “Conclusion” section.",

It has been documented that political fragmentation hinders government ability to rein in hyperinflation (Veiga 2000; Hamann et al. 2002) or tackle unsustainable debt trajectories (Roubini and Sachs 1989; Alesina and Drazen 1991). However, less attention has been paid to the impact of political fragmentation on developed governments’ ability to undertake structural reforms in normal times, especially in the financial domain.Footnote 2 Disperse ruling coalitions are often blamed for delays in the legislative process, but no systematic test of this common assumption has been performed yet. In this paper, we fill this gap by analyzing systematically the impact of political fragmentation on the pace and extent of reform activity in the financial sector across OECD economies. Our results confirm that government fragmentation in itself hinders the structural reform process in the financial sector, independently of contingent economic factors.Footnote 3 The notion of government fragmentation is based on the concept that each party in a coalition government is an elementary decision-making unit, whose multiplication affects the cohesion of the government and, thereby, its ability to reach an agreement to deviate from the status quo.Footnote 4 Circumstantial analyses on the pursuit of reforms in specific countries suggest that fragmented governments may not be able to finalize initiated financial reform proposals and thus postpone them indefinitely. For instance, Ben-Bassat (2011) carefully reviews all the attempts to reform the financial system in Israel starting from the mid 1980s, finding that it took 32 attempts to pass ten reforms, each one being discussed in the Knesset for 10.2 years on average. Ben-Bassat (2011) supports the idea that the composition of the ruling coalitions, among other variables, plays a significant role in explaining the differences in speed of completion of the proposed reforms over time. This finding is consistent with the observations on delays in fiscal stabilization reported by Alesina and Drazen (1991) based on historical accounts of politically polarized belligerent countries after World War I and with the inability to respond quickly to financial crises due to political gridlock studied by Mian et al. (2014) and Funke et al. (2016). One question thus naturally arises: are these observations documenting specific features of the countries and periods analyzed, or are they part of a more general pattern holding true across time and space? We address this issue by focusing on structural financial reforms in a panel of yearly observations for 30 OECD countries from 1975 to 2005. The period under investigation has been characterized by a big wave of reforms in the financial sector involving almost every country of the world, although not at a uniform pace (e.g., Abiad and Mody 2005; Kaminsky and Schmukler 2008). The dataset displays remarkable within-country variation in the extent of reforming activity, which makes financial regulation an ideal domain to study the impact of government fragmentation on the capacity to reform. Specifically, the index of financial reforms used in this paper is a composite index covering several areas of financial policy put together by Abiad et al. (2010). In order to capture the multifaceted nature of financial reforms, the index aggregates information on seven different dimensions of government intervention in the financial sector. In each dimension, countries are classified on a continuum that ranges from full repression to full liberalization. We exploit the variation in the timing of these changes in financial policy across countries by using panel fixed-effects models. Our results confirm the generality of the claim that fragmented governments do represent an obstacle to financial policy change. The economic effect is noticeable. Our preferred estimate indicates that a one standard deviation increase in the Herfindahl index for ruling coalitions leads to a change in financial policy equivalent to the full liberalization of one dimension of the index of financial reforms in slightly less than 6 years. Further analyses suggest that policy reforms on credit controls and reserve requirements, interest rate controls, and prudential regulation are the most affected by government fragmentation. We test the robustness of our results in several ways. We first test whether they are driven by characteristics of countries’ constitutional design and population, which may influence both outcome and treatment variables. To assuage this concern, we further control for the proportionality of the electoral system, the federal structure of the nation, income inequality, and the underlying national fractionalization of ethnicities, languages, and religions, which are shown not to affect our results. Second, using instrumental variables (IV), we find that our results are robust to reverse causality. Third, we obtain similar results if we control for financial crises of different types, if we use ordered logit estimations, and if we run “horse races” between our indices of government fragmentation and other dimensions of political fragmentation. As an external validation of our hypothesis, we also extend the analysis to a key element of financial policy promoting financial sector development that is not explicitly included in our main index of financial reforms: investor protection. Reforms aimed at protecting the rights of outside investors, including minority shareholders and creditors, have been shown in the literature to be beneficial to an economy’s performance (see surveys by Porta et al. 2000; and Beck et al. 2005), but fragmented governments may find it difficult to enact such reforms because they are likely to imply a loss of rents for corporate insiders. We therefore investigate whether government fragmentation may be associated with poorer investor protection by employing the adjusted “anti-director rights” index constructed by Pagano and Volpin (2005) and the “creditor rights” index of Djankov et al. (2007). We do find evidence that fragmented governments are associated with delays in enacting reforms to bring a country with poor investor protection in line with the best practices. Summing up, our empirical results point decisively in the direction of a significant impact of government fragmentation on the capacity to reform finance, but how to justify this result theoretically? Based on different strands of the political economy literature, we adapt to the context of financial reforms three non-mutually exclusive explanations: one interpreting the delay in reforms as an inefficient supply of a public good (the reform proposal) and the other two as the result of a conflict of interests between constituencies. First, we show how to adapt a standard “war of attrition” model to the context of financial reform where, instead of considering a conflict of objectives between different agents as in the stabilization literature à la Alesina and Drazen (1991), the problem is framed as the result of a coordination problem à la Bliss and Nalebuff (1984).Footnote 5 The intuition is that even uncontroversial reform proposals can be seen as public goods that must be provided by individual agents incurring monetary and non-monetary private costs; thus, parties in larger coalitions have an incentive to wait for the others to make the proposal slowing down the reform process. We then show how to interpret the results in terms of models involving conflicts of interests among holders of different factors of production. After having outlined a simple model to show the reason for diverging interests in financial reform, two political economy mechanisms are analyzed: the first, inspired by the veto player literature (Tsebelis 2002), assumes that different parties in the ruling coalition perfectly represent the potentially conflicting interests of their constituencies and can veto unfavorable reforms; the second, adapting to the financial reform context the strand of literature that focuses on semi-benevolent politicians (Grossman and Helpman 1994), does not require parties to be associated to particular constituencies, but just attributes the differences in reforming activity to the presence of small parties in the governing coalitions, which may be easier to influence for groups opposing reform.Footnote 6 The three models presented in this paper are not mutually exclusive and can all partly contribute to the overall result. The theoretical contribution of the paper thus lies in adapting these models to the context of structural reforms in the financial sector, covering both uncontroversial decisions and regulations which may cause conflicts among coalition members. This paper is related to several strands of the literature. It builds on the empirical literature linking political fragmentation and legislative impasse. The typical field of application is fiscal stabilization, which has been extensively tested since the seminal work by Roubini and Sachs (1989). Works by Alesina et al. (1998), Perotti and Kontopoulos (2002), Woo (2003), and many others show that higher political fragmentation leads to higher public deficits or public debt. Veiga (2000) and Hamann et al. (2002) make a similar point concerning inflation stabilization. However, the papers closest to ours are the ones dealing with structural financial reforms. Besides the above-mentioned analysis of the Israel’s financial reform history by Ben-Bassat (2011), Mian et al. (2014) highlight the obstacles to crisis management posed by a fragmented legislative body. By comparing pre-crisis and post-crisis periods, the authors argue that political and ideological polarization between government and opposition parties resulting from financial crises actually translate into weak reforms and legislative stalemate. We expand upon Mian et al. (2014) along three main dimensions. First, our analyses covering a large panel of democratic countries focus on long-term trends as opposed to short-term reactions to shocks. Second, we study in detail the features of political fragmentation in legislatures and uncover that the fragmentation arising within governing coalitions is the most critical concept of political fragmentation hindering financial reforms. Third, we theoretically show that the most compelling explanation of our findings has to be searched in the conflicting objectives of relatively different coalition members. Other works specifically focus on privatization policies. Using data on Indian state-owned firms, Dinc and Gupta (2011) find that privatizations are significantly delayed in regions where the national government party faces more competition from opposition parties. Bortolotti and Pinotti (2008) find that political fragmentation hampers the implementation of privatization programs in 21 OECD countries.Footnote 7 We add to these papers by stressing that government fragmentation is another relevant driving force behind a broader set of financial reforms. Finally, we contribute to a long-standing body of research in political economy portraying regulatory decisions as the outcome of private interest motives as opposed to the public interest. For example, Kroszner and Strahan (1999) investigate whether interest groups in the USA may have influenced the decisions by state politicians to deregulate bank branching. They show evidence that deregulation occurred earlier when banks were relatively larger and firms more bank dependent. Rajan and Zingales (2003) argue that the level of financial development (a proxy for financial reform) results from the political influence of incumbent firms which try to shield their rents from competition by outsiders. By instrumenting elites’ political power with local suffrage laws in nineteenth century America, Benmelech and Moskowitz (2010) conclusively show how financial regulation was shaped by elites to control entry (see also Degryse et al. 2018, for international evidence).",

However, in the words of Blanchard et al. (2013), Latvia’s adjustment and recovery from the 2008 economic crisis represents “a rare case study,” which “has been an object of intense attention” (p. 325). After a period of transition to a market economy and structural reforms, the country enjoyed solid economic growth since the beginning of the 2000s. At the outset of the crisis, it faced a decline in GDP of 25%, and if the drop would have reached 30% as was predicted by the IMF it would have made Latvia’s loss more than that of the US Great Depression in 1929–1933 (Weisbrot and Ray 2010). The unemployment rate in Latvia increased the most in EU, from 6% in 2007 to close to 20% in 2009 and 2010, making it the highest unemployment rate among the new EU members and one of the highest in the whole EU. It also faced significant emigration. Other two Baltic countries, Estonia and Lithuania, experienced similar trends. Given this remarkable deterioration of economic conditions and the Latvian pegged exchange rate regime, devaluation seemed an obvious rescue scenario and was advised by many international experts.Footnote 1 However, despite this advice, the authorities decided to maintain Latvia’s currency peg and to adjust through internal devaluation and front-loaded fiscal consolidation. External devaluation was seen as inconsistent with the aim to join the Eurozone, and internal devaluation was also supported by the European Union. In all three Baltic countries, the policy response of radical reforms and fiscal adjustment was rapid, early and concentrated in the first half of 2009, with Latvia undertaking 60% of its needed adjustment within this year (Åslund 2012). Large cuts in public expenditures were undertaken together with major structural reforms mainly in three sectors, namely public administration, health care and education (ibid). By the end of 2009, unit labor costs declined by almost 25% and remained stable thereafter, while productivity increased, with both labor shedding and a large increase in unemployment. The decline in the share of low productivity workers and firms’ ability to reduce some X-inefficiency were potentially behind this increase and set the stage for potential future growth (Blanchard et al. 2013). The fact that the productivity increase was not matched by the increase in wages suggests a crucial role played by increased unemployment, weak unions and limited employment protection (ibid). After 2012, however, Latvia has experienced fast wage growth and since 2013, wages rose faster than labor productivity. Emigration also played a role, and there exists a positive correlation between unemployment in Latvia and emigration (see, e.g., Hazans 2019).Footnote 2 There has been an intensive debate about the macroeconomic rationale and consequences of the policies chosen by the Latvian governments, including large wage cuts in the public sector as well as cuts in pensions and reductions in personal income tax allowances (see Blanchard et al. 2013). Krugman (2013) points to a poorly performing labor market long after the economy has bounced back from a large shock, while Forbes (2013) finds that “Latvia provides a model of an alternative response to a balance-of-payment crisis for countries that do not wish to devalue their currency.” The recovery was also remarkable. The strong negative trend in GDP growth was soon overturned, with GDP growing at positive rates from the third quarter of 2010 onwards. Since 2010 Latvia has one of the largest GDP growth in the EU. Regarding unemployment, it has been declining steadily since 2010. Finally, Latvia adopted the Euro in 2014. However, there has not been a careful study that assesses the costs to workers of macroeconomic policies that focus on internal devaluation. If we want to say something about these costs, we need to analyze labor market adjustment over the medium horizon, using micro-data. We have spent a considerable amount of time to put the Latvian Labor Force Survey (LFS) data into a form that allows us to analyze the flows between labor market states and their determinants, covering the years 2002–2016. We take our inspiration from Fallon and Lucas (2002), who document the impact of the financial crises of the 1990s on labor markets in Argentina, Mexico, Turkey and several Asian countries. Their evidence shows that in all these countries even when GDP returns to robust positive growth after the initial impact of the crisis, the negative effects in the labor market are longer-lasting, with higher unemployment of heads of household, higher child labor and less long-run human capital formation. It strikes us, therefore, as opportune to see whether and to what extent certain groups of workers are particularly hard hit by the crisis. Having more than a decade of data enables us to analyze the costs of labor market adjustment in the medium term, long after the crisis has run its course. In addition, we also employ EU SILC data for Latvia to analyze occupational mobility and wages over 2007–2015. There are some papers on labor market adjustment in Latvia using micro-data. For example, Fadejeva and Krasnopjorovs (2015) analyze adjustment in the Latvian labor market using firm level data, while Fadejeva and Opmane (2016) employ Latvian LFS data and discuss internal labor market mobility between 2005 and 2014. The focus of the latter paper is, however, on institutions that further the mobility in the labor market; it is less on the costs of adjustment as a result of the crisis. Zasova (2015) discusses labor market institutions as a vehicle to facilitate labor market recovery. Finally, Masso and Krillo (2011) discuss labor markets in the Baltic States during the crisis, but their detailed analysis with micro-data is restricted to Estonia and does not include the recovery period. An interesting paper that uses similar estimation techniques is by Monastiriotis et al. (2019), which looks at transition dynamics in European labor markets during the crisis and recovery. The authors, however, cover all 28 EU countries, and there is little room for a detailed analysis of transitions in the Latvian labor market. Our paper provides three contributions to the literature. First, we do some macro-analysis that has not been done over such a long time span. For the years 2002–2016, we analyze labor market aggregates and assess whether contingent employment, underemployment and informal employment provide important adjustment mechanisms in the Latvian labor market to cushion the impact of the crisis. We also check whether job mobility has increased labor productivity. Second, a very careful and time-consuming effort has resulted in a reliable panel data set that straddles more than a decade and that allows microeconomic analysis of labor market adjustment in one of the Baltic States. Our third contribution consists in establishing whether macroeconomic policies that use internal devaluation to address a balance-of-payment crisis generate large costs to some groups of workers in the medium run. This latter contribution is particularly relevant in the policy debate. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. “Data, Definitions and the Sample” section presents economic and labor market conditions in Latvia during and after the Great Recession. “Trends in the Latvian Labor Market Between 2002 and 2016” section discusses the data sources and the definitions used, while “Transitions Between Labor Market States and Their Determinants” section presents the analysis of labor market trends. “Wages and Occupational Mobility During and After the Crisis” section looks at transition probabilities between labor market states and their determinants. Wage regressions are analyzed in “Conclusions and Policy Implications” section. The final section provides conclusions and implications for policy.",

Scientists believe that the first massive migration of modern humans happened between 80,000 and 60,000 years ago, from Africa to Asia (Gugliotta 2008). In modern history, and in particular in the past few years, migration has typically been the subject of heated policy and political debates, often relying on rhetoric not always supported by empirical evidence in economics or the social sciences more broadly. The number of people living in a country other than where they were born increased from 75 million in 1960 to about 266 million nowadays. Despite the significant nominal increase, the number of migrants relative to global population has remained steady at about 3.5% for the past decades. Yet, as of today, many countries have significant communities of their own citizens living abroad, or diasporas. This likely irreversible trend begs the question: Can growing diasporas represent an opportunity for their home nations—many of them developing countries—in nurturing their economies? The purpose of this is to review some of the literature on the gains from diasporas and the economic opportunities that these diasporas represent to their countries of origin. In addition, the paper presents a discussion on policies aimed at leveraging the “diaspora capital.” This paper is structured as follows. First, I describe some of the stylized facts regarding diasporas, their sizes, and geographical distribution. Then, I review available evidence on some of the different ways through which diasporas can be an asset for the economic development of their home countries and discuss policy ideas around them. I focus on three specific channels: remittances, business networks, and the diffusion of knowledge. A final section presents concluding remarks.",4

This buildup in lending was mostly financed by short-term wholesale funding (Borio et al. 2011; Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2018) in which cross-border banking flows played a prominent role. In particular, subsidiaries of foreign-owned banks in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) relied extensively on cross-border wholesale funding from their parent banks in Western Europe. This meant that they could finance faster domestic credit growth than would be possible with only customer deposits. During this period, foreign currency loans to non-banks without a steady income in a foreign currency soared in CEE (Brown et al. 2011; Brown and de Haas 2012; Brown et al. 2014a, b; Krogstrup and Tille 2015; Temesvary 2016). Mortgages were financed by loans, particularly in Swiss francs but also in euros. Similarly, in Western Europe, increasingly higher gross capital flows in the banking sector contributed to the rapid expansion of banks’ balance sheets and a substantial increase in leverage (Auer et al. 2012; Kalemli-Ozcan et al. 2012). Financial integration, along with a heavy reliance on wholesale funding and widespread foreign currency lending to non-banks, amplified vulnerabilities in the financial sector and propagated risks across borders during the GFC (Fender and McGuire 2010; Ranciere et al. 2010; Yeşin 2013). After 2008, European banks started deleveraging because of the GFC, the euro area sovereign debt crisis, and in preparation for Basel III. A successful deleveraging process foresees a contraction of banks’ balance sheets as well as an increased reliance on customer deposits to fund lending. Furthermore, a series of financial and macroprudential measures was introduced to stem the demand for foreign currency loans in various CEE countries (Cerutti et al. 2017). While the decline in foreign currency loan volumes was a slow process for most countries, some in Europe, namely Croatia, Cyprus, Hungary, Montenegro, Romania, and Serbia, implemented foreign currency loan conversion programs to eliminate the risks associated with foreign currency loans (Fischer and Yeşin 2019). Consequently, the European banking sector experienced a significant transformation after the GFC. This paper takes stock of this transformation in European banking in light of the deleveraging process and foreign currency loan conversion programs. For this, we use an exclusive data set, namely the CHF Lending Monitor by the Swiss National Bank. This is only available for research purposes and policy discussions among contributing central banks in Europe. It provides comparable and comprehensive banking sector data across countries. Using this data set, our paper first reviews developments in the size and composition of the European banking sectors’ balance sheets since the GFC, including their domestic credit growth and financial integration. It then assesses the impact of foreign currency loan conversion programs on financial dollarization and systemic risk. The cross-country evidence suggests that the deleveraging process in Europe has been sizeable, while credit growth 10 years after the GFC may be hampered in several countries. Furthermore, macroprudential measures and foreign currency loan conversion programs achieved their goal of lowering financial dollarization in CEE countries only to some extent. Lastly, systemic risk has come down in many countries from 2009Q1 to 2019Q3. Nevertheless, systemic risk remains elevated in the non-euro area, even in countries with foreign currency loan conversion programs. The below section “Aggregate Banking Sector Data of CEE Countries” gives an overview of the banking sector data used in this paper. The section “Credit Growth and Deleveraging” evaluates the impact of the deleveraging process and foreign currency loan conversion programs on credit growth in Europe. “Financial Dollarization and Foreign Currency Loan Conversion Programs” section assesses the evolution of financial dollarization; “Systemic Risk” section discusses currency mismatches on banks’ balance sheets arising from foreign currency loans; and then the “Conclusion” section summarizes the evidence.",2

Economists’ View,June 2020,Milan Deskar-Škrbić,Davor Kunovac,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"While most European countries were eager to join the European Union (EU),Footnote 1 the idea of monetary integration still does not appeal to all of them. In this paper, we first review main reasons for their reluctance to join the monetary union. After that, we formally assess whether this choice is supported by more formal economic arguments. More precisely, we test whether the common monetary policy of the European central bank (ECB) could, in fact, successfully stabilize those economies that have not joined the monetary union. Nineteen member states of the European Union (out of 27 of them) adopted the common currency and joined the euro area. Out of the remaining eight non-euro area EU members, three of them, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania, expressed strong interest in joining the ERM II and adopting the euro in the near future.Footnote 2 These countries, especially Croatia, are all characterized by high level of financial euroization. For that reason, private and public debt in these countries is highly sensitive to exchange rate risk and the possibilities for autonomous monetary and exchange rate policy in these countries are thus already fairly limited. In that context, euro adoption seems like a viable and reasonable policy option for the three countries (for details see Deskar-Škrbić et al. 2019). Thus, there are still five European countries that are not willing to give up their monetary sovereignty. Among them, Denmark is not legally bound to adopt the euro (opt-out clause). On the other hand, Sweden and the remaining three new member states, Czechia, Hungary and Poland, are legally bound to adopt the euro at some point.Footnote 3 However, these countries postponed this process indefinitely and are therefore are included in our analysis. There are various reasons why these countries are not rushing to adopt the euro. Some of them are political, some are sociological, and some are emotional. Although all are very important and sometimes crucial for shaping the attitude toward joining the monetary union, these reasons are not of primary interest to us. Rather, we are interested in the key economic argument against euro adoption in non-euro area countries—the potentially large costs of the loss of an independent monetary policy. As Eudey (1998) and Alesina et al. (2002) point out, among all the costs of euro adoption, the loss of monetary policy independence is the largest.Footnote 4 Thus, the key policy question in this context is: Would euro adoption lead to significant loss in terms of the possibility of countercyclical reaction of monetary policy? To address this question, we follow two approaches. First, we look at developments of key interest rates in the euro area and the four non-euro area countries of interest. In this way, we initially assess the independence of monetary policy in these countries, during and after the crisis. Here, we define monetary policy independence as the ability of the national central bank to set interest rates independently of international rates (Obstfeld et al. 2005; Aizenman et al. 2013). The limits to independence of monetary policies in countries with fixed exchange rates are well understood. However, contrary to the standard propositions of the monetary policy trilemma (Mundell 1961; Friedman 1953), countries with inflation targeting and floating exchange rate regimes can also have very limited monetary policy independence. The fear of floating argument is usually used to explain this (Calvo and Reinhart 2002; Frankel et al. 2004). Countries like Sweden, Czechia, Poland, and Hungary, all inflation targeters and strongly financially integrated with the euro area,Footnote 5 can have limited maneuvering space for setting national key monetary policy rates independently of the euro area key rates. Indeed, a strong deviation of key rates can trigger capital flows, which then may affect exchange rate developments and can endanger the ability to maintain inflation targets and/or have destabilizing effects on external balances. In addition, Rey (2015) emphasizes the role of financial flows in today’s integrated world, which can turn the Mundellian trilemma into the Mundellian dilemma. Besides these theories, the high correlation and convergence of key interest rates we often observe between small open economies and large currency areas can also result from increasing business cycle synchronization (Frankel and Rose 1998) and/or reactions to some common determinants of GDP and inflation. In that sense, the similarity in key interest rates does not necessarily reflect a lack of independence in an institutional sense, but a similar reaction to common shocks hitting the two economies (Goczek and Mycielska 2019). Our second approach builds on the optimum currency area (OCA) literature. This literature emphasizes that the loss of monetary policy independence should not be too costly : (1) if business cycles and economic shocks between non-euro area countries and the euro area are synchronized and coherent (Bayoumi and Eichengreen 1992, 1993, 1994; Mongelli 2002; (2) if non-euro area countries and the euro area are hit by symmetric shocks (Peersman 2011); and (3) if non-euro area countries react to the ECB shocks in a manner similar to that of the euro area (Feldkircher 2015). If these conditions are all met, the common countercyclical monetary policy should be suitable for potential new euro area members and the cost of the loss of monetary policy independence would be small. To address these questions, we rely on a small open-economy Bayesian SVAR model (BSVAR). The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we briefly review the evolution of the European single currency. The third section focuses on how public sentiment on euro adoption changes over time in Sweden, Czechia, Hungary, and Poland. In order to provide some context, we also compare the public support for euro adoption in these countries with the support for the euro in euro area countries. Also, we provide a brief overview of the most important reforms of the euro area implemented so far and stress the importance of reforms that are still pending. The fourth section analyzes monetary policy measures and correlation of key interest rates in the crisis and the post-crisis period in the four non-euro area countries. The fifth part is based on the BSVAR approach and studies the relevance of the euro area (common) shocks for the business cycle and consumer inflation in non-euro area countries. The last section summarizes key findings and provides conclusions.",3

Uberti,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"With the early stage of marketisation reforms almost completely over, the post-socialist countries have embarked on ambitious efforts to build and consolidate market-supporting institutions (Douarin and Mickiewicz 2017). In this context, corruption—the sale by public officials of government property for personal gain—has climbed to the very top of the “transition agenda”. Donor agencies have financed anti-corruption programmes all across the transition region. Meanwhile, corruption reduction has become a key element of EU conditionality in the Western Balkans, where six post-socialist economies (the “Western Balkans-6”, or WB-6) are hoping to join the European Union in the not-too-distant future. In Albania, for instance, corruption is “regarded as the country’s main problem, overshadowing […] unemployment, crime and low wages” (UNDP 2016, p. 6). Partly because of a strong focus on institution building and anti-corruption, the WB-6 have attached relatively little importance to promoting industrial development (Bartlett 2008). More recently, however, the donor community has woken up to the risks inherent in a growth model based primarily on aid- and remittance-driven consumption, calling on the WB-6 to launch new measures to strengthen and diversify their productive base (Lemay-Hebert and Murshed 2016; World Bank 2017). Industrialisation has long been regarded as an important engine of economic growth and social change (Szirmai 2012; Szirmai and Verspagen 2015). A long-standing literature has also emphasised the critical role of the state in promoting industrial development (Khan 2000; Chang 2002). Yet, a popular and oft-cited criticism of industrial policy is that it breeds corruption and rent-seeking (Ades and Di Tella 1997). Thus, for the WB-6, an important policy question is how corruption relates to industrial policy in the context of firm development. Do industrial policy rents bring benefits to recipient firms? Are rent transfers associated with corruption? If so, how costly is that corruption? Do the costs of corruption offset the benefits, if any, of the rent transfers that firms secure by means of bribery? To answer these questions, we examine new perception-based indicators of corruption and rents from a representative survey of 239 mining and manufacturing firms conducted by the authors in Albania and Kosovo, the two poorest WB-6 economies. These two countries are very similar in many important respects—level of development, language and culture,Footnote 1 historical (socialist and Ottoman) legacies, institutional endowments, policy environment and market openness. It is therefore appropriate to examine them together. Our purpose is to draw conclusions about the population of industrial firms in Albania and Kosovo, although our findings are likely to be relevant for the WB-6 economies more generally, as well as other low–middle-income transition countries. The micro-literature highlights a number of mechanisms through which corruption may influence firm performance.Footnote 2 The process of negotiating corrupt transactions diverts management time from the task of supervising and coordinating production, leading to shirking and lower productivity. Corruption may also induce a misallocation of inputs, as firms with output targets have to employ additional labour to make up for the productivity loss caused by corruption. To cope with corrupt officials, bribe-paying firms may also have to increase the ratio of administrative to technical/engineering staff. The need to maintain secrecy, moreover, may promote the adoption of management strategies that hamper innovation, further reducing productivity.Footnote 3 Since corrupt transactions are illegal and cannot be enforced in the courts, the uncertainty caused by a “corrupt” business environment may have a chilling effect on the firm’s investment and hiring decisions. Lastly, the bribes themselves are real monetary costs which reduce profits and diminish the pool of resources available for re-investment. A fast-growing literature presents evidence consistent with these mechanisms. Based on panel data from Latin America, Dal Bo and Rossi (2007) find a large negative effect of country-level corruption perceptions on the labour productivity of electricity distribution firms. Fisman and Svensson (2007) use a sample of Ugandan firms to show that an increase in the share of total revenues paid in bribes has a detrimental effect on the rate of sales growth. Focusing on Latin America, Seker and Yang (2014) examine the consequences of firms’ exposure to bribe solicitations and find a robust negative effect of corruption on firm sales. Based on a cross-section of firms from 10 transition economies, Athanasouli and Goujard (2015) uncover a negative relationship between regional-level corruption and a firm-level measure of management quality. The only partial outlier in this literature is the paper by Commander and Svejnar (2011), which reports a mostly insignificant effect of corruption on total-factor productivity (TFP) in 26 transition economies. While most economists agree that corruption has an unambiguously deleterious impact on firm performance, two parallel literatures have called for caution and nuance. The classic “grease the wheels” hypothesis contends that bribes can work as “speed money”, allowing firms to side-step cumbersome regulations or speed up the delivery of essential government services (Leff 1964; Lui 1985; Meon and Weill 2010; Heckelman and Powell 2010).Footnote 4 In developing and transition countries, firms are often subject to extortion by public officials, who demand side payments to perform tasks (e.g. provide a water connection) or issue documents (e.g. health and safety certificates) that should be performed or issued to eligible businesses as a matter of course. In these contexts, bribes are costs that firms must incur in order to “get things done”. Holding constant the presence of extortion by public officials, the firms that refuse to pay are at a competitive disadvantage. In other cases, firms pay bribes not to “grease the wheels” of a mechanism that should in principle work without “grease”, but to seek special privileges—that is, rents. Recent contributions have moved the conversation from the bribe payments to the special privileges—the investment licences, public contracts, subsidies and monopolies—that some firms are able to capture by means of bribery (Khan 2001; North et al. 2009; Uberti 2016). The bribes are by definition costs (and, as discussed above, by far not the only costs of corruption); the rents, however, may improve firm performance. Thus, the net effect of corruption depends on both the magnitude of the rent-seeking cost and the value of the rents created and distributed as a result of rent-seeking (Khan 2000). While the rent-seeking “input” is always negative, the “outcome” of the rent-seeking process may be positive if the rents allocated promote accumulation and learning. To date, the empirical literature has focused almost exclusively on the “bribe side” of corrupt transactions. Although the efficiency and output loss occasioned by rent-seeking is well documented, the potentially beneficial effects of corruption on the “rent side” have received considerably less attention. To examine how bribes and policy rents affect firm performance in Albania and Kosovo, we extend traditional approaches along three main lines. First, we allow corruption to influence systematically all aspects of the production process. Whereas most existing contributions estimate the total impact of corruption on firm sales,Footnote 5 we disaggregate its total effect on output into two main components: a “direct” effect on total-factor productivity (TFP)—the efficiency with which factor inputs are combined—and an “indirect” effect working through the rate of factor (especially, capital) accumulation. Whether bribes are paid to “grease the wheels” or to seek rents, “corrupt” firms internalise a cost—a cost that is not incurred by firms that do not engage in corruption. It is unclear, however, whether this cost is primarily in the form of a productivity or investment loss. Second, we explicitly test for a “greasing” effect of corruption at the firm level. We do so by allowing for potential complementarities between corruption, investment and hiring decisions. The intuition here is that fixed capital investment may not translate into additional sales revenue unless the firm can resolve the logistical and bureaucratic bottlenecks associated with operating new equipment. Corruption helps managers get past these hurdles. Thus, although “corrupt” firms may incur a cost in the form of a TFP or investment loss, the corruption enables them to “grease the wheels” of the system and reap higher returns from an additional unit of capital. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper that explicitly includes an interaction term between factor inputs (capital and labour) and corruption, allowing for the marginal product of factor additions to depend on the incidence of corruption. Third, we use our survey data to construct four perception-based indicators of rent allocations in the firm’s business environment. In line with the assumption that rents are often allocated corruptively, the overwhelming majority of the firms that claim to receive rents in our sample also report high levels of corruption in their immediate environment. As with corruption, we examine the impact of rents on several aspects of the production process, allowing for the firms that extract rents to experience higher (or lower) levels of performance compared to firms, “corrupt” or else, that do not succeed in extracting rents. Lastly, we contributes to the micro-literature on corruption by focusing specifically on the effects of corruption on industrial-sector firms, rather than firms in general. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper with this particular focus, at least in the context of the transition literature. Our findings suggest that, in the two poorest Balkan economies, the costs of corruption manifest themselves in the form of a large TFP loss. Corruption, however, is not associated with changes in the firm’s investment and hiring decisions. In line with the “grease the wheels” hypothesis, we find robust evidence that corruption and capacity expansion are complements: the marginal products of capital and labour are nonzero only if the firm is “corrupt”. That said, the returns from corruption—its “greasing” effects—are dwarfed by the costs of corruption—its negative impact on TFP. Next, we find that, holding corruption constant, rent allocations are correlated with higher rates of TFP growth. The effect of rents on capital and labour accumulation, however, is more mixed and depends on the type of rent. Overall, the benefits earned by the winners of rent-seeking contests—the firms that succeed in capturing special privileges, typically by corrupt means—are again dwarfed by the costs incurred in the process of rent-seeking. Although it is always difficult to firmly establish causality when working with perception-based indicators, throughout our analysis we pay particular attention to mitigating the risk of omitted variable bias. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the next section, we provide some background on the recent transformation of industry in Albania and Kosovo. Based on qualitative fieldwork research, we discuss the most common types of rents and rent-seeking in these two economies, and how they affect industrial-sector firms. The purpose is to formulate context-sensitive hypotheses that may be tested econometrically. The “Data” section presents the data and the enterprise survey. The “Firm Productivity” section examines empirically the impact of rents and bribes on TFP growth, while the “Factor Accumulation” section discusses their influences on factor accumulation.",3

Grigoriadis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since the Global Financial Crisis and the development of non-standard monetary measures, spillover effects from monetary policies in large advanced economies to emerging market economies (EME) have become the subject of considerable debate and a focal point of criticism from policymakers in EMEs (Chen et al. 2014: 3; Fratzscher, Lo Duca and Straub 2018: 330, Mongelli and Camba-Mendez 2018: 549–553). It is pertinent to ask how domestic monetary policies are transmitted abroad and what consequences they have on foreign economies. The existing literature focuses heavily on spillovers emanating from the Federal Reserve’s policies. This paper contributes to the debate by investigating the international transmission of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) non-standard monetary policies and their spillover effects to Eastern Europe and Russia, which hitherto have been overlooked in the literature (Åslund 2018: 255–258). Although the ECB’s price stability mandate, assigned by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, only formally encompasses the 19 euro area member states, this paper suggests the body’s monetary policies also have serious macroeconomic implications for Eastern Europe and Russia, which through extensive economic integration with the euro area in terms of economic and financial linkages provides the ideal testing ground for monetary policy spillover effects.Footnote 1 This paper expects countries with the strongest linkages to the euro area to experience the most significant spillover effects, whereas countries with weaker linkages should experience fewer. Thus, REE countries (Russia and Eastern Europe) within the EU such as Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Romania are expected to experience the greatest spillover effects, while non-EU countries such as Russia, Serbia and Ukraine are expected to experience fewer spillovers. Furthermore, the magnitude of spillover effects likely also depends on the exchange rate regime of each country. Countries with currency pegs or fixed currency regimes are more exposed to changes in euro area financial conditions than countries with free floating regimes. Similarly, the monetary policy framework of a country also influences spillover effects. Countries pursuing exchange rate anchor frameworks are suspected to be more vulnerable than inflation targeting countries because they have less space to counter spillover effects with domestic monetary policy. Furthermore, this paper hypothesizes time-varying spillover effects. The ECB’s initial programmes, both unprecedented in nature and lacking forward guidance, likely generated greater announcement-related spillover effects than their later counterparts. The announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) is proposed as an inflection point, at which announcements take on different characteristics, leading to changed spillover effects. Many empirical methods are available to test spillover effects. However, given the role monetary policy announcements play in influencing market expectations and thus prices, this paper employs an event-based empirical approach to study spillover effects specifically related to the ECB’s non-standard monetary policy announcements to the following REE economies: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine. In total, 76 separate ECB policy announcements are tested for spillover effects on a range of financial variables including exchange rates, stock market indices, interbank lending rates, short- and long-term sovereign bond yields, as well as 5- and 10-year credit default swap spreads. Additionally, this paper conducts several tests on the channels of international monetary policy transmission. In this paper, we find that the ECB’s unconventional monetary policy has produced significant spillovers to Eastern Europe and Russia. More specifically, asset prices, particularly sovereign yields and CDS spreads, have reacted strongly to the ECB’s non-standard monetary policy announcements; the latter have been associated with declining sovereign yields, falling CDS spreads and appreciating exchange rates. A key, yet unsurprising, finding is that a country’s bilateral integration with the eurozone is an important determinant of the strength of spillover effects. Similarly, the hypothesis that the depth and openness of domestic financial markets exacerbate spillover effects is also confirmed. Specifically, non-euro EU countries experienced many more significant spillover effects than non-EU countries. Among the sample countries, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Romania experienced the most spillover effects, while Russia, Serbia and Ukraine experienced the fewest. For example, the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) led to between 36 and 98 bps tightening of mid-term sovereign bond yields in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Romania, while no significant impact was detected in Russia, Serbia or Ukraine. While Serbia and Ukraine were largely insulated from spillover effects related to ECB policy announcements, spillovers to Russia were noticeably stronger, albeit weaker than those to non-euro EU countries. Two factors drive this very interesting and surprising result. First, according to the IMF’s exchange rate regime classification of 2008, Russia pursues a fixed currency peg regime, whereas Ukraine and Serbia both follow managed floats. Second, financial markets in Russia, although politically shielded, are deeper and more mature than those in Serbia or Ukraine. Constrained by its fixed exchange rate regime, domestic monetary policy in Russia had less policy space to counter spillover effects than the managed floats in either Serbia or Ukraine, a factor contributing to Russia’s greater vulnerability to spillover effects. For example, spillovers related to LTRO and FRFA announcements significantly impacted Russian 5- and 10-year CDS spreads, while only affecting 10-year spreads in Serbia and neither in Ukraine. Similarly, SMP announcements affected Russian 5- and 10-year CDS spreads, while only impacting Ukrainian 10-year CDS spreads and neither maturity in Serbia. These results underscore the finding that the depth and maturity of financial markets as well as the exchange rate regime are key determinants of spillover effects. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. “Unconventional Monetary Policy and Emerging Markets” section reviews the literature on monetary spillover effects. “ECB and International Monetary Policy Transmission” section provides an historical account of the ECB’s non-standard monetary policy measures and analyses the international monetary policy transmission mechanism. In “Data and Empirical Strategy” section, we introduce the event study methodology, present the data used and outline the empirical strategy. “Results” and “Transmission Channels” sections present the results and empirically test the transmission channels. “Conclusions” section concludes.",

In the euro area, the crisis is still far from being solved: Public debt affects the evolution of market economies, several EU members cannot repay or refinance their government debt, and economies are reliant on the support by other countries. The recent dispute on the draft budget between Italy and the EU Commission shows that fiscal policy is still a challenge for Europe and that there are still frictions and pressure among the Member States of the EU and European countries in general. Even the countries participating in the European Economic and Monetary Union that have signed the Maastricht treaty which states that the public deficit and the public debt relative to GDP must not exceed 3\(\%\) and 60\(\%\) to ensure compliance with budgetary discipline, these countries had, and a part of them still have problems with their debt service and some even had to be bailed out by the European Stability Mechanism to prevent bankruptcy (Greiner and Fincke 2015). During the crisis, different approaches have been implemented such as counter-cyclical expansionary fiscal policy in the USA and in Europe, countries embarked on austerity, pro-cyclical policies that aimed at lowering sovereign debt and the interest rate (Arčabić et al. 2018). The EU reaction to the crisis was the introduction of strong fiscal consolidations under the surveillance of the European Commission. Expenditure cuts, notably lower public investments, led to a reduction of public deficits. The debt reduction benchmark announced by the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)(also called “Six-Pack”) in December 2011 states that Member States whose current debt-to-GDP ratio is higher than the 60\(\%\) threshold must curtail the distance to 60\(\%\) by an average rate of one-twentieth per year (Morimoto et al. 2017). After analyzing the empirical literature, we can state that it is controversial about the effect of high public debt-to-GDP ratios. On the one hand, economists such as Checherita-Westphal and Rother (2012) identify that the effect of public debt on economic growth is hump-shaped which means that up to a certain threshold, higher public debt-to-GDP ratios go along with higher economic growth; however, after this threshold, there is a negative correlation between public debt and economic growth. An important contribution in this context was the paper by Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) who stated that a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 90 percent has a significant negative impact on long-run economic growth, which gained attention and initiated a debate in research and policy (Arčabić et al. 2018). On the other hand, there exist empirical studies that do not find that nonlinear effect. Panizza and Presbitero (2014) study the negative correlation between public debt and economic growth; however, the effect of debt on GDP depends on the structure and accumulation of debt and the link between debt and growth disappears when they correct for endogeneity. Fincke and Greiner (2015) describe a statistically negative effect for developed countries, but the relation between debt and economic growth is statistically positive for fast growing developing economies. Based on the empirical studies, the relation between public debt and economic growth seems to be negative for developed economies, although there is not a high effect and especially the effects are different between countries. Arčabić et al. (2018) illustrate a survey of empirical studies that aims at analyzing the effects of public debt on economic growth or the other way around. Hence, empirically, there is no final clarification how public debt impacts economic growth. In our paper, we do not want to focus on debt thresholds, but rather is our objective to analyze sustainable debt policy rules (Balanced Government Budget and Permanent Public Deficits) and economic growth using a model of endogenous economic growth theory. Fiscal sustainability means that the government is able to repay its debt at some point in the future. In this context, an important aspect for the so-called golden rule of public finance is the inter-generational redistribution. Our analysis starts with the intertemporal budget constraint of the government to which the government must stick. Then, the primary surplus (ratio) plays a crucial role. The rise of public debt in an economy implies an increase in future primary surpluses to fulfill its intertemporal budget constraint. When the government does not raise the future primary surpluses, it accepts a default that can be followed by social turbulences which can be a danger for the political system. Raising taxes, reducing public spending or a rise in GDP that leads to more tax revenues can lead to higher primary surpluses and can prevent social turbulences. Naturally, a combination of these three measures is also possible to raise the primary surplus. We concentrate on public spending and public revenues and neglect in this paper the central bank of an economy since normally governments should not count on money creation by central banks that raises the money supply and leads to a higher inflation rate to reduce the real value of public debt because central banks are independent and assisting in pursuing sustainable debt policies is not one of their main tasks (Greiner and Fincke 2015). In our paper, it is possible for the government to run into debt, but the primary surplus relative to GDP is a positive linear function of the debt-to-GDP ratio which guarantees that public debt is sustainable. This concept is based on the tests by Bohn (1995). The economic intuition behind it says that if governments run into debt today, they must take corrective actions in the future by increasing the primary surplus. If the government does not act in this way, public debt will not be sustainable (Greiner and Fincke 2015). Even if there is a substantial and expanding literature on endogenous growth (Romer 1986; Barro 1989), there is a lack of explanations of the effects of budgetary policies for economic growth in open economies (van der Ploeg 1996). As in reality, the private sector and the government are able to lend and borrow their assets in the foreign capital market, countries like Greece, Italy, Ireland, and Portugal hold large levels of debt and thereof as well large external debt. Hence, it is crucial to analyze the sustainable debt policy rules in a model of an open economy (Morimoto et al. 2017). The literature states some results of the analysis of open economies (van der Ploeg 1996; Alogoskoufis 2014; Turnovsky 1996a, b; Barro et al. 1992; Turnovsky 2000; Huang et al. 2017). The foundation of our model is Futagami et al. (2008) who analyze productive public spending and public debt in an endogenous growth model where government debt has to converge to a certain exogenously given debt ratio asymptotically. Morimoto et al. (2017) investigate this model for a small open economy and indicate that sufficiently low debt-to-GDP ratios can avoid indeterminate equilibrium paths. In the model, endogenous limit cycles can emerge. As in Greiner and Fincke (2015), in our paper, the government invests in a productive public capital stock that has positive externalities on goods production and raises aggregate production possibilities. Futagami et al. (1993) and Turnovsky (1997) show the positive effects on private goods production of public capital accumulated through public investment. Other studies on public debt finance in endogenous growth models in which the inputs for private goods production are government services or public capital analyze the policy impacts of public debt finance on equilibrium dynamics, long-run growth and welfare (Greiner and Semmler 2000; Ghosh and Mourmouras 2004; Greiner 2007, 2012; Yakita 2008). Here, in our model, the expenditures of the government are financed by levying an income tax and by issuing bonds. We investigate the effects of different sustainable debt policies in this small open economy model of endogenous growth with public capital accumulation, where the government can borrow from abroad to finance its debt, on the dynamics of the economy with respect to the characteristics and stability of steady state and with respect to welfare. The economy in this model consists of three sectors: a household sector, a productive sector and the government. Our small open economy does not follow an independent interest rate policy, and in the long run, on the SBGP, it does not have an influence on its rate of economic growth. We define economic growth as the medium to long-term development of GDP. Therefore, we do not analyze the short-term impacts of a government’s debt policy, as after Keynes they are used for smoothing economic fluctuations. Therefore, we assume that all markets are in their equilibrium, in particular the labor market with a natural employment rate. We analyze the welfare effects on the sustainable balanced growth path of the different scenarios. Furthermore, we examine the welfare effects along the transition path that is the effects resulting from a transition from one scenario to the other scenario. Our aim is to answer the question: Is in this model a sustainable balanced government budget worthwhile? Which effects do transitions from one scenario to the other scenario have on welfare? What are the different macroeconomic consequences of these different sustainable debt policies? In section “Model Structure and Model Dynamics”, we introduce the model and present the model structure by explaining the household, the productive sector and the government. Further, we illustrate the model dynamics by describing the equilibrium conditions and the (sustainable) balanced growth path. In section ""Model Analysis: Debt Policies on the SBGP"", we analyze the two different debt policies, Balanced Government Budget and Permanent Public Deficits, on the SBGP. In section ""Welfare Analysis of Debt policies"", we study the welfare effects on the sustainable balanced growth path of the different scenarios and along the transition path. Section ""Conclusion"" summarizes our results.",2
62,3,Comparative Economic Studies,24 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-020-00128-x,Fiscal Policy in an Age of Secular Stagnation,September 2020,Michael Buchner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Advanced economies around the world have been experienced a period of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates over the past decade. This environment is known as “secular stagnation”, a term most prominently brought forward by Larry Summers who has shared his views in November 2013.Footnote 1 These circumstances have important consequences for fiscal policy and should be taken into consideration at the stage of decision-making. The objectives of fiscal policy are seen as to provide means to enhance welfare (e.g. providing public goods and address market failures), promote equal opportunities by addressing distributional disparities and use it as an instrument for macroeconomic stabilisation in the short-term and for long-term sustainability. Against this background, fiscal policy should seek to create buffers in “good times” in order to create space for necessary stabilisation actions. A central theoretic point is the assumption that governments face a inter-temporal budget constraint which limits fiscal space. A government borrows money and has to pay interest on its debt. Interest rates can also be seen as the “price of money”. If money becomes cheaper, e.g. interest rates decrease, it is more attractive to borrow. If the interest paid by the government is lower than the output growth induced by additional government spending even the budget constraint for the government does, in theory, not longer exist. This paper focuses on this very relationship, the so-called interest rate—growth differential (IRGD). A negative differential enables debt rollovers, e.g. debt decreases relative to GDP over time since GDP grows faster than interest payments. Hence, a period of low interest rates entails important consequences for fiscal policy. Assuming stable growth,Footnote 2 lower interest rates lead to a more negative IRGD. Since the 1980s, real interest rates in advanced economies face a downward trend and the global financial crisis leads to a further drop. Since then, interest rates remained at (or close to) the zero lower bound (ZLB). Years of persistent low interest rates have lead to peculiar observations with regard to the value of money. For example Austria has issued a 100-year bond at an interest rate of just 1.2 percent; other countries have issued bonds with negative interest rates—e.g. bondholders pay for lending money.Footnote 3 Thus, a crucial question is whether this period and its accompanying consequences will persist or not. 100-year bonds are a sign that (institutional) investors expect low interest rates for a long period. Furthermore, there are several papers which show evidence that there is a sizeable decline in the “natural interest rate” in advanced economies.Footnote 4 This view is also supported by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, where interest rate reactions in response to sizeable government spending programmes where only minor in most countries.Footnote 5 The current economic crisis may even further decrease long-term interest rates (see Jordà et al. 2020). The conclusions reached in this paper should be seen in the context of a medium to long-term view. While the COVID-19 pandemic leads to a massive drop in economic growth and may also have short-term implications on interest rates, which means it affects also the IRGD, it should only have minor effects on the long-run IRGD. In the following, I will argue that there is indeed growing evidence that the favourable IRGD in the past decade is not a temporary phenomenon but will persistent in advanced economies in the coming decades. This paper concludes that several structural factors such as demographic shifts, high inequality and lower economic growth contribute to lower interest rate levels while potential output levels continue to be on a low but steady level. Thus, it is likely that the IRGD will be negative in many Euro area member states over the next decades. As a raw numerical example: if one assumes an average nominal GDP growth rate in Euro area economies of around 3 percent, the IRGD continues to be negative as long as interest rates paid stay below this value. This is in line with findings from Summers (2014) who suggests that the zero lower bound and secular stagnation are likely to stay in the future. I will show that fiscal policy makers should take greater account of this transition. The findings should not be seen as a free licence for higher debt levels but rather as an impetus for using additional space for effective public spending on a debt decreasing path. As I will show in my analysis, macroeconomic conditions are expected to be quite heterogeneous within the Euro area. While indicators in some countries show signs of a very favourable debt reduction environment in the future, fiscal space remains tight despite low interest rates in other EU member states and requires additional effort. The COVID-19 economic crisis underlines that past believes on fiscal deficits and their meaning for interest rates seem to lose importance. This longer-term trend of a changing economic environment requires a rethinking in fiscal policy. Therefore, this contribution aims to fuel discussions on how economic policy circumstances are different now and in the decades to come and what implications this entails for fiscal policy making. This paper contributes to the literature by running an empirical forecast of long-term interest rate levels which builds on structural variables, such as demographic indicators or inequality. This stands in contrast to the interest rate mean reverse assumptions that are mostly used in economic models. Against this background, the findings have important consequences for long-term debt sustainability analysis and address potential issues in the existing assumptions of such models. Finally, it connects the argument of a lower or even negative IRGD in the coming decades to relevant economic policy questions in the Euro area, in particular, low public investment and the lack of an Euro area-wide stabilisation instrument . The paper is structured as follows: section two gives an overview on the fundamentals of public debt development and discusses the potential future development of the key variables in this process. The third chapter explains the methodology and the econometric setting for the projections. Furthermore, it includes simulations and different scenario estimations on the IRGD and possible debt dynamics. Finally, the fourth and fifth chapters take the key points of the results in order to derive policy implications on how to best adapt fiscal policy to the new environment.",11
62,3,Comparative Economic Studies,13 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-020-00123-2,The Short-Run and Long-Run Determinants of Household Saving: Evidence from OECD Economies,September 2020,Philemon Kwame Opoku,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Perhaps the most crucial assumption underlying recent years policy approach of adopting negative interest rates by some major central banks relates to the commonly perceived positive interest rate effect on saving.Footnote 1 Most economists would share the view that, at least in the short run, monetary policy can significantly influence the consumption and saving decisions of households. However, they pay lip service to what happens in the interim regarding the relationship between saving and interest rate, thereby forcing empirical investigations to focus on long-run estimations and conclusions. In this paper, I do not attempt to engage in a theoretical discussion of short-run nor long-run mechanisms. Instead, I analyse the income and substitution effects within the context of a two-period overlapping generations (OLG) model and then proceed to investigate such effects in a dynamic heterogeneous panel framework. The goal is to test empirically which of the interest rate effects, income or substitution, dominate in the short- or long-run, or both periods, and to emphasize that such a distinction is crucial and can contribute to the identification of most appropriate policy responses for short- and long-run purposes. Moreover, I examine the impact of other economic factors like inflation, taxation, unemployment, financial development, household wealth and general government debt on household saving, and whether the empirical results obtained are robust to variables choice and alternative specifications of the model. Given this, I apply the Pooled Mean Group Method (PMG) proposed by Pesaran et al. (1999) to a panel of 19 countries for over two and a half decades (1995–2018) in order to test these hypotheses. The PMG method uses the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model as the basic structure in conducting estimations and offers the advantage of being able to detect any long-run equilibrium relationship, as well as the short-run dynamics. It is known a priori that two ambiguous forces are likely to interplay when one considers the interest elasticity of saving. The debate on this has long been a severe bone of contention among economists and policy-makers. Gylfason (1981) notes that the classical view that aggregate saving is an increasing function of the interest rate may not be correct because the substitution effect and the income effect may go in opposite directions, thus rendering the net effect ambiguous. Thus, on the one hand, a fall in interest rate renders future consumption more expensive, hence, can discourage saving (substitution effect), while on the other hand, can encourage saving at the present as households would require more money for the same amount of consumption in the future (income effect). In an extremely low-interest-rate environment such as one faced by some economies today, the income effect is likely to outweigh the substitution effect. In such a case, for example, individuals may be worried about the possibility of not being able to meet their planned future objectives such as pensions and hence may try to overcome this low return by increasing the aggregate amount of saving. The disparities in household saving rates across and within many industrialised and developing economies over time, given the trends in the nominal interest rates and inflation rates, cast more doubt on the link between the saving rate and interest rate and calls for the need to broadly re-examine the factors that impact household saving in the short- and long-run period.Footnote 2 Such disparities in saving rates led to a witness of persistent divergences in external balances in the run-up to the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008. The disparities also suggest different institutional settings and the tendency of some countries to rely more on foreign savings to finance domestic investments making these countries more vulnerable to external shocks (Rocher et al. 2015). Hence, this study could contribute to the ongoing debate regarding the global imbalance. The inability of policies, for more than a decade since the GFC of 2008, to generate its intended effect, has brought back to the forefront of recent year policy debates, the question about the extent to which households change their saving and consumption behaviour in response to a change in interest rate. Therefore, a re-examination of the nexus between household saving rates and other macroeconomic factors such as interest rate, taxation, government debt, et cetera is significant for assessing the impact that both monetary and fiscal policy have on consumption and saving behaviour in the short- and long-run periods. Previous works focused mainly on the United States and reported mixed evidence of long-run estimates or some support for positive interest rate effect. This heavy focus of many studies on the USA means that much of the existing body of empirical evidence on saving behaviour has been dominated by the specific characteristics and circumstances of a single country and may, therefore, lack cross-country generality (Zee and Tanzi 1998). Evidence on short- and long-run estimates of the magnitude of such effects using a panel data approach is minimal. Also, those studies ignored the significance of the possibility that a particular variable, say, the interest rate could exert different significant effects (in terms of magnitude and sign) on household saving in the short- or long-run period. Short-run effects are likewise crucial as long-run effects. For instance, whether policy interest rates and saving rates have a positive or negative relationship in the short term also refers to the kind of impact a monetary policy could have on consumption and saving and is therefore related to the question of stabilisation measures (Aizenman et al. 2019). If theoretical evidence (see, for example, Diamond 1965; Summers 1981; Gylfason 1993) is a guide, then one would expect that in the long run, the interest rate, saving and capital accumulation will all be interrelated in a manner such that current consumption and saving would be impacted. Therefore, the interest elasticity of the saving rate can be an essential channel for long-term economic growth. I report results which confirms some of the literature findings and also unveil some novel features. First and most importantly, given the goal of this paper, I detect that the income effect of the short-term nominal interest rate dominates the substitution effect in the short run, and vice versa in the long run. I also find evidence that almost all the macroeconomic variables considered in this study impact household saving in the long run. When the long-term nominal interest rate is used instead of the short-term nominal interest rate, I find a consistent positive long-run effect, but no short-run relationship with the household saving rate. When I examined for the impact of Inflation on household saving, I find that the inflation rate (expected or actual) is inversely related to the household saving rate in the long run. Household wealth proxied in this study with real housing prices also has an inverse relationship with the household saving rate in the long run. I also find that the unemployment rate, which represents the effect of diminished actual resources, is inversely related to the household saving rate in the long run. To examine the effect of government policies on household saving, I extend the conventional approaches, notably by including fiscal policy variables such as current taxes on income and wealth, and general government debt in the specification. I find that these two variables likewise do have an inverse relationship with household saving rates in the long run. Availability of domestic credit often associated with financial development or liberalisation process is found to be positively related to the household saving rate in the long run, a result which contradicts with theory, although other empirical studies have reported similar findings. Second, among the variables considered, I find that only the short-term nominal interest rate and current taxes on income and wealth have significant short-run effects on household saving and are robust to alternative specifications. The findings also highlight the importance of short-run heterogeneous characteristics of the countries in the sample, and why household saving rates vary across these countries. This paper makes three significant contributions to the literature on the determinants of household saving. First, the novel feature of this study is that more attention is devoted to isolating short-run effects from long-run effects in order to test the validity of the hypothesis that the income effect outweighs the substitution effect in the short run, and vice versa in the long run. It is one of the few studies to introduce dynamics and to also take into account the view that the disparities in household saving behaviour might be as a result of diversity in institutional structures across countries.Footnote 3 Second, this study is among the few studies, in a panel framework, to rigorously examine nominal interest rates and the expected rate of inflation consistently in order to obtain reliable estimates of the effects of real interest rates on household saving. Many of the previous studies only focused on the effects of real interest rates and ignored expected inflation. Third, the study also incorporates other potential household saving determinants identified by theory but not previously considered in the empirical literature. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: second section reviews previous work on saving behaviour. Third section presents a basic theoretical model upon which the empirical estimations are conducted. Fourth section presents the empirical strategy, the data used for estimations and also some stylised facts of household saving and the interest rates to show the general trends of these variables. Fifth section reports the estimation results, and sixth section concludes.",1
62,3,Comparative Economic Studies,21 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-020-00127-y,A Systemic Approach to Estimating the Output Gap for the Italian Economy,September 2020,Tommaso Proietti,Marco Fioramanti,Libero Monteforte,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Potential output, i.e. the maximum value of output obtainable by efficiently using the productive factors of an economic system with stable inflation, is a key variable for economic policy. The output gap, the difference between actual output and potential output, identifies both the cyclical fluctuations and the imbalances in the use of the production factors, which have an impact on prices. Potential output and the output gap are very useful for policy institutions but extremely difficult to tackle empirically. They are unobserved variables, for which statistical offices do not provide figures and which can only be estimated with a very high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors. First, the econometric approaches presented in the literature to measure them are many and varied. Moreover, even with the same specification, the choice made by the analyst about the initial conditions and the variances of the stochastic processes can lead to very different measures of potential output (Fioramanti 2015; Fioramanti and Waldmann 2017). Given the approach and the econometric specifications, potential output estimates are also affected by the uncertainty generated by the data. Revisions of official time series and updates of the input macroeconomic forecasts engender further variability in the real-time estimates. As a result, the use of the output gap for economic policy decisions could lead to inappropriate ex post choices (Orphanides and Van Norden 2002). The fiscal policy of the European Union (EU) Member States is affected by the uncertainty surrounding the real-time estimates of potential output and the output gap, as these variables have a significant role in the main EU fiscal rules. This paper proposes to estimate potential output and the output gap for the Italian economy using multiple models, all estimated by means of the unobserved components approach, as in Zizza (2006), but based on different economic theories. Specifically, we start from simple models that connect the gap with inflation (a bivariate model based on the Phillips curve) and with unemployment (a trivariate model based on the Phillips curve and on the Okun law), possibly corrected to consider structural changes that occurred during Italy’s double-dip recession; a production function is also proposed, characterised by a systemic approach in which the different components are estimated simultaneously, with a multivariate model. Finally, we consider a univariate statistical filter, based on the estimates of the Phillips curve from the bivariate model. The proposed multi-model approach enables us to take account of a variety of methods proposed in the literature and therefore to provide an economic interpretation of the estimates obtained in the light of different theories. Differently from the multi-model approaches adopted in other studies for the Italian economy (as in Bassanetti et al. 2010) all the models proposed here are estimated with the same econometric approach (the unobserved components of time series). This consistency in the econometrics behind different models is extremely relevant in our context, as it allows for a comparison of the different measures of OG obtained; in this regard, we benefit of the plurality of output gap series obtained in order to build a measure of uncertainty. The econometric specifications of the models are selected taking into consideration the statistical properties and the real-time stability as well as the plausibility with respect to economic theory. This allows us to built a coherent and synthetic measure based on the performance of the five different specifications. Moreover, the estimates of our models do not depend on a priori constraints or parameters, as in the institutional approach adopted by the European Commission (described in “The European Commission Model” section). The analysis shows that the bivariate model for GDP and inflation is reliable from a statistical point of view and is consistent with the interpretation of the potential output as the level of GDP that does not generate inflationary pressures. The trivariate model also enables the identification of NAIRU, but is less stable when the information set is updated. The multivariate model, based on the production function, also takes account of the degree of capacity utilisation. This latter is the most suitable for the economic interpretation, but appears less stable than the bivariate model. Finally, the univariate statistical filter of GDP is an alternative to the simple statistical filters, such as the HP, in which the parameters are normally defined independently of the properties of the specific time series under examination. The paper is organised as follows: after a synthetic review of the most relevant literature, section three outlines the use of the estimates of potential output for the PBO’s institutional purposes. Sections four, five, and six describe the models in detail, while section seven presents an assessment of the models along with some diagnostics. Finally, section eight compares our range of output gap estimates with the measures recently published by other organisations.",1

However, the crisis emphasized the need to implement alternative measures and to expand the scope of monetary policy to include a focus on the maintenance of financial stability while maintaining the primary objective of achieving price stability. Kryvstov et al. (2015) discuss the relationship between financial and macroeconomic conditions. They note that financial stability conditions are an important part of monetary policy implementation as financial stability is a precondition for a well-functioning financial system. The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of monetary policy shocks on financial stability for the cases of Chile, Colombia, Japan, Portugal and the UK. Monetary policy influences the amount of money in circulation in the economy as well as the borrowing cost of money. The countries chosen have autonomous, inflation-targeting Central Banks, which provides the opportunity for more independent monetary policy decisions. In the case of Colombia and Chile, this combined with a lack of empirical studies due to limited data availability makes for an interesting case study. The UK dilemma following a tumultuous period of Brexit negotiations and uncertainty topped off by growing economic and social uncertainty and loss in the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic and Japan’s unending battle with deflation and sluggish growth justifies the study of the UK and Japan. Lastly, although Portuguese monetary policy is determined by the objectives of the European Central Bank, the effect on credit growth in Portugal is noteworthy considering Portugal’s recent economic recovery following a bailout from the troika formed by the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The potential impact of the current global pandemic on the newly recovered Portuguese economy solidifies the need to study the case of Portugal. The five countries are looked at on a case-by-case basis with the impact of monetary policy shocks on financial stability being studied for each individual country case. A decade after the GFC, financial stability and the effective implementation of monetary policy remains a priority for many Central Banks. Studying the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability, in particular, the effect on different areas of potential vulnerability may play an important role in future targeted policy decisions. A number of structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) analyses have been conducted on the US Economy as well as other advanced economies. However, due to shorter time series caused by limited data availability as well as structural reforms in Latin American countries, SVARs have not been used frequently in econometric studies. SVAR models based on the VAR approach suggested by Sims (1980) have been used frequently in Japan, Portugal and the UK with four available examples being Nakahira (2009), Afonso and Sousa (2011, 2012) and Elbourne (2008), respectively. In this paper, an SVAR is employed and impulse response functions are used in an effort to test the impact of monetary policy on financial stability. As in Cocriş and Nucu (2013), the impact of short-term interest rates on three proxies for financial stability, namely credit growth, stock prices and the exchange rate, is studied. Industrial production is included as a proxy for the real sector and hence, for economic growth. In line with Cocriş and Nucu (2013), policy rates are used to represent monetary policy choices in emerging economies. Shadow rates are used to represent monetary policy intervention in advanced economies. Our main results show that monetary policy may be used to correct asset mispricing due to the inverse relationship between monetary policy intervention and the stock market index for four of the five cases, namely the cases of Colombia, Japan, Portugal and the UK. Conventional wisdomFootnote 2 suggest that contractionary monetary policy would result in a currency appreciation in countries with a floating exchange rate regime as foreign investment is attracted. The results show that the exchange rate appreciates following a monetary policy shock for the cases of Chile, Japan and Portugal while the currency depreciates for the cases of Colombia and the UK. The currency depreciation in the case of Colombia could be attributed to the country’s reliance on exports as Colombia relies heavily on commodity exportation while, in the case of the UK, this depreciation is attributed to uncertainty in the local market. The results also show that monetary policy may be used to limit fluctuations in the real business cycle as can be seen by the inverse relationship between the industrial production index and monetary policy intervention in the majority of cases, namely, for the cases of Colombia, Japan and Portugal. Credit growth also has an inverse relationship with monetary policy intervention in the cases of Chile and the UK. Ergo, monetary policy may be used to tame credit cycles. In the cases of Colombia, Japan and Portugal, credit moves in the same direction as monetary policy intervention. Thus, positive monetary policy shock results in an increase in credit. The results show that monetary policy intervention as represented by policy rates and shadow rates may indeed be able to contribute to financial stability. The results show that monetary policy may not have the ability to maintain or re-establish financial stability in all cases. Alternative policy choices such as macroprudential policy tools aimed at targeting the financial system as a whole may be useful to reinforce the monetary policy framework.

After the initial economic reforms, China opened itself to the outside world, triggering the initial rise of foreign direct investment (FDI). Along with a series of other policy initiatives, China launched an economic development drive that included the establishment of the world’s low-cost export base and its own domestically focused manufacturing industry (Young and Lan 1997). For 20 years, due largely to its vast, under-utilized rural labor supply that had languished for decades in remote rural communities, China was able to attract tens of millions (indeed hundreds of millions) of rural workers into low-cost manufacturing (Lu and Xia 2016). Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, these labor-intensive workers, seen in China’s factories and on its construction sites, earned wages that were quite low when viewed in an international context (Yang et al. 2010). Because the rural economy employed large numbers of workers who had been engaged in low-productivity farming and sideline activities, China did not experience a significant rise in the labor-intensive wage rate during those first two decades (Lin et al. 1996). Indeed, in part based on this, China was able to launch its economy into one of the fastest periods of growth in history (Wei et al. 2017). Although wages were still relatively low at the beginning of a new phase of development that emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s, rising wages began to be a defining feature of China’s economy. Wages began to rise around the late 1990s (Yang et al. 2010), and, as the available supply of young rural workers who had not yet left the farm began to decline (de Brauw et al. 2002), wage growth gradually accelerated, beginning in the mid-2000s (Yang et al. 2010). Because the level at which these labor-intensive wages began in this period of increase was so low, at first, there was almost no noticeable change in the ways that firms organized themselves (Zhou and Tyers 2019). Gradually, however, firm managers and business owners began to look for ways to cut costs and improve profits (Hu and Kahn 1997). Indeed, in the early 2000s, growth continued in no small part due to labor-intensive technologies and business practices (Yueh 2015). Between 2003 and the early 2010s, China enjoyed what is now known to be its fastest period of growth. As employment opportunities were widely available, and wages trended upward, this growth period improved the welfare of labor-intensive workers throughout the country (Li et al. 2012a; Zhang 2018). Due to the two distinct paths of employment and wage growth noted above, China’s growth pattern between 1980 and 2010 has been described as following the classical Lewis/Fei-Ranis model of economic development (henceforth, the Lewis model; Cai and Wang 2010). Using the lens of the Lewis model, we see that, in the early years as industrialization began, labor was pulled out of what was, at the time, an effectively unlimited pool of under-utilized workers in the rural population. In these early years, there was almost no effective increase in the labor-intensive wage rate. The shift from farming to off-farm employment with a stagnant wage rate lasted until the late 1990s, reflecting the first phase of the Lewis model (de Brauw et al. 2002). In the early 2000s, however, after large shares of the younger cohorts of both men and women already had moved into the off-farm sector, the unlimited supply of labor disappeared (Cai 2010; Knight et al. 2011). It was at that time that wages began increasing, gradually at first but then steadily through this period, following the path predicted by the second phase of the Lewis model (Cai and Wang 2010). These forces of supply and demand predicted by the Lewis model were also buffeted by policy change in the early 2000s, which contributed to the wage growth seen in China during that time (Liang et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2018; Lu and Xia 2016). As the Lewis model predicted, these two growth phases boosted China out of low-income status and facilitated its transition into a middle-income economy. Although China did seem to follow the path predicted by the Lewis model over the first three decades of its era of reform, it appears that, in 2010, China reached another turning point in its economic development. As wages shifted ever higher during the 2010s, pressure began to build on some sets of firms, especially those that had been involved in low-wage/labor-intensive production activities, to make more fundamental adjustments to their business strategies. In some cases, wages became sufficiently high to motivate foreign firms that were producing for export to move their operations to other countries (Dawn.com 2019). A new trend of outward foreign direct investment by China’s firms also began to emerge in this same period (Mumtaz and Smith 2018). Such trends were, in part, responsible for the prominent rise of new electronic production bases in Vietnam (Martin 2018), the rapid expansion of textiles in Bangladesh (Emont 2019), and the relocation of many shoe manufacturers to Ethiopia, among other examples (Bain 2018). Cheng et al. (2019) also have documented the recent push of firms in China in the 2010s to automate to reduce the reliance on increasingly expensive workers and to avoid moving overseas. This new phase of development that China has begun to enter, however, appears not to be unique to China. There is a subset of modern economies that, over the past several decades, have also experienced wage growth high enough to induce a fundamental shift in the nature of the technologies that firms use and the role of labor in the production process. The best known of the countries that most recently have moved successfully into this new phase are South Korea, Ireland, and Singapore (Li et al. 2017). In these countries, after wages were sufficiently high, firms began to globalize and automate to replace expensive labor, causing demand for labor-intensive labor inside firms to fall sharply. In the countries that have made this transition successfully, the workers who once worked on the factory floor or construction sites in labor-intensive jobs were able to transition into jobs with higher skill requirements (Rozelle and Hell 2020). The ability of the labor forces in these economies to make this transition depended on their human-capital levels, which were all relatively high at the time of this shift, allowing workers to make this transition (Khor et al. 2016). Importantly, after making these shifts, these economies’ growth continued, and wages continued to rise in most segments of the labor force. It is in this way that countries have broken through the high-wage/skill-intensive barrier, becoming nations that provide high and rising remuneration for a large share of their workforce. Due to the composition of China’s labor force, the consequences of entering this third phase of employment and overall economic development in China are not clear. To the extent that its workers can adapt to these changes, globalization and rapid automation could help China to flourish. The level of education of the labor force in China, however, is systemically lower than that in South Korea, Ireland, and other successful middle-income “graduates” (Bai et al. 2019; Li et al. 2017). China’s workers, in general, have relatively weak skills, and their levels of education are, on average, low (Rozelle and Hell 2020). A growing service sector exists in China, but if the supply of labor-intensive workers who shift to the service sector outpaces demand for these services, fundamental questions about future wage trends arise. The goal of our study is to examine the extent to which this third phase of economic development is impacting China’s economy. We seek to achieve our goal through addressing three specific objectives. First, we identify trends in employment data, generally and in terms of individual industries and sub-economies. Second, we examine wage data, also identifying trends at both the general and industry/sub-economy levels. Finally, drawing on the international literature on China’s recent economic development, we posit several explanations for the trends that we find. We include an examination of how wage polarization has played out in other economies—both middle income and high income—and the overall consequences for longer-term growth and social welfare in those economies. The organization of our paper is as follows. In the next section, we describe the sources of the data that we examine. In the third and fourth sections, we identify employment and wage trends in that data. We then posit explanations for these trends in the fifth section. In the sixth section, we discuss wage polarization and potential consequences for China. In the seventh section, we conclude.",13
62,4,Comparative Economic Studies,25 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-020-00125-0,Economic and Political Motivations in Debt Finance in China: Bank Lending and Trade Credit Offering,December 2020,Go Yano,Maho Shiraishi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper investigates whether economic motivation or political motivation is dominant in bank lending to private firms in China. In the context of China, many studies have supported either economic motivation or political motivation or have found observations consistent with either of them (for example, Firth et al. 2009; Li et al. 2009; Chang et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2012; Tsai et al. 2014). When the field of view is expanded beyond China, several more studies can be found that argue the predominance of either economic or political motivation by banks in lending to firms. Anderson et al. (2004) offered evidence that better-governed firms enjoy a lower cost of bank financing in the USA. Ashbaugh-Skaife et al. (2006) also found that stronger corporate governance increases a firm’s probability of receiving an investment-grade credit rating in the USA. Khwaja and Mian (2005) found that firms with political connections tended to obtain more loans and preferential interest rates in emerging economies. Charumilind et al. (2006) argued that political connections help firms obtain more long-term loans in Thailand because political connections are a form of guaranteed collateral for banks. Claessens et al. (2008) found that firms that establish political connections by contributing to winning deputies can obtain more loans after each election, which indicates that an important way to obtain credit support is to establish political connections. However, these studies do not compare the two forms of motivation. Of course, economic and political motivations by banks in lending to firms theoretically do not exclude each other, and both can be important and decisive. What about trade credit offering, another important form of debt financing? Also for debt financing, to our best knowledge, no preceding studies have compared the relative weights of these two motivations by supplier (creditor) firms. This study therefore aims to fill these gaps. The objective of this study was to clarify the factors that promote or hinder economic and political motivation if either or both is(are) crucial. Furthermore, a trial to detect promoting and hindering factors also investigates the relation between these two motivations for lenders to extend credit beyond simple competition, for example, the possibility of political motivation as a hindrance to economic motivation. Clarifying the dominance of economic over political motivation in debt financing such as banking and trade credit and the factors promoting or hindering it has important policy implications, in that it provides evidence of efficient or inefficient financial intermediation through debt financing in China and can suggest how to promote or secure efficient financial allocation. In particular, private firms are the fastest-growing Chinese firms and have been the main driving force for rapid growth of the Chinese economy (Allen et al. 2005). Economic motivation in external debt financing such as bank lending and offers of trade credit to the private firms tends to lead to efficient allocation of financial resources, whereas political motivation may result in distorted allocation of financial resources. Therefore, an empirical clarification of the effectiveness of these two motivations in providing credit to private firms is significant in determining whether the remarkable growth of private firms has been attained because economic motivation worked in bank lending and offers of trade credit to them or although political motivation worked there. Observations regarding this issue in China must also have important policy implications for other emerging and developing economies. For this purpose, an econometric analysis was carried out in this study by using matched datasets constructed from industrial firm data filed by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics, hand-collected bank branch data, and foreign bank entry information. We obtained innovative findings for bank lending as well as trade credit offerings using the panel data setting. The contributions that distinguish this study from previous studies are manifold. First, the statistical observations in this study provide empirical evidence that economic motivation is dominant over political motivation in bank lending to private firms in China. However, unlike lending to private firms, economic motivation does not work in lending by banks to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The same situation exists for trade credit offerings by supplier firms. For the first time in the literature, particularly in the context of China as the largest emerging economy, this study empirically determines that economic motivation predominates over political motivation in lending by banks to private firms, whereas the situation is different in bank lending to SOEs. This is our first contribution to the literature. Second, matched datasets from firm-level micro-data and hand-collected bank branch data provide statistical evidence that competition among domestic banks motivates mainly domestic banks to lend money to private firms for economic reasons, or in other words, according to a judgment based on aspects of the borrower firms’ performance such as profitability, ratio of sales to capital (a productivity measure), and growth rate of sales. Competition with foreign banks, which arise from foreign bank entry into each region, also promotes domestic banks to provide better-performing private firms with loans. To put it another way, competition with foreign banks also motivates lending to private firms through economic motivation. To the authors’ best knowledge, this study is the first to point out the relevance of these two findings in the relationship between lending motivation by banks and competitiveness in the banking market in China. A more competitive banking market motivates banks to search for better-performing borrower firms that are more likely to repay loans. The chances are that political connections held by private firms cannot provide financial support to these private firms from governments or officials, and therefore political connections are not so attractive for banks seeking good customer firms that will repay loans without fail. However, when banks or bankers attach great importance to political connections themselves and their uses other than financial support, politically connected private firms become attractive to banks or bankers. Third, more intensive market competition between firms enables better-performing firms to receive more trade credit. In other words, a competitive market environment intensifies suppliers’ trade credit offering through economic motivation seeking securer repayment of trade credit. Paraphrasing this argument, a more competitive product market enables more efficient financial allocation through trade credit finance. This can be seen our third contribution to the literature in that it empirically makes clear that not only for bank finance, but also for trade credit finance, a competitive market environment is a key factor in determining motivation by lenders and provides a deeper understanding of how to achieve more efficient financial allocation through debt financing from the viewpoint of policy-making. Fourth, although stand-alone state minority ownership does not have a significant impact on private firms’ access to bank loans, it is found to discourage economic motivation in bank lending to private firms. Economic and political motivations are related in that the latter works as a barrier to economic motivation by banks. Banks are less strict when checking the performance of private firms in providing loans when they consider the value of political connections held by private firms with state minority ownership, i.e., their relationships with governments. Chen et al. (2020) consider asset tangibility of firms as sources of their ability to overcome financial constraints due to the availability of tangible assets as collateral in borrowing bank loans. This implies that a firm with more tangible assets (high ratio of tangible assets to total assets), which can be easily collateralized (unlike intangible ones), hinders bank lending to private firms based on evaluation of the firm’s performance, i.e., economic motivation. Similarly, when loan repayments can be guaranteed by collateral, banks are less strict when checking the performance of private firms. Collateral-based lending is harmful to fostering sound banking. The discouraging effects for economic motivation of state minority ownership in private firms and collateral-based lending in bank lending have not been evidenced in China by previous studies, meaning that the findings in this study are an innovation in the literature. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. “Literature review” section reviews existing literature. “Conceptual framework” section explains the empirical models, the variables used for them, and the estimation strategy. “Empirical model” section describes the data used. “Data” section considers the estimation results of the econometric analysis, and “Estimation results” section presents conclusions.",1
62,4,Comparative Economic Studies,11 May 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-020-00120-5,"Was the Balassa–Samuelson Effect Small? Uncaptured Quality Improvements and Japan’s Real Exchange Rate Appreciation, 1956–1970",December 2020,Hiroyuki Imai,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The price level and per capita income are positively associated across countries (the Penn effect, Feenstra et al. 2015). A corollary is that the real exchange rate rises in a country moving from low to high income over the course of economic development. This long-term real exchange rate appreciation, which is accounted for by the Balassa–Samuelson effect (Balassa 1964; Samuelson 1964), would be most conspicuous during the catch-up industrialization phase. A high-growth country’s real exchange rate appreciates over time (Balassa–Samuelson theorem) due to long-term productivity growth in the tradable sector relative to the nontradable sector. The greater the positive productivity growth rate gap is between the tradable and nontradable sectors, the faster the real exchange rate appreciation will be. Assuming purchasing power parity (PPP) for tradables, an industrializing country’s nominal exchange rate settles at a level where its tradable prices are the same as that of the reference foreign country, expressed in a common currency. Reflecting high total factor productivity (TFP) growth, real wages in the tradable sector (largely manufacturing) are rising in the domestic country. As the wage hikes spread to the nontradable sector (largely services), the unit cost increases in the nontradable sector whose TFP growth is slow, and the relative price of nontradables rises. A country’s general price index is the weighted mean of tradables and nontradables. If expressed in a common currency, the domestic country’s general prices grow faster than those of the reference foreign country (real exchange rate appreciation). Indeed, substantial long-term real exchange rate appreciation was observed in a number of countries during their high-growth periods. The real exchange rate appreciation would represent the Balassa–Samuelson effect if the original theorem (Balassa 1964) was followed. However, the theorem was built on an assumption that PPP holds for tradables despite the fact that tradable prices often display significant deviations from parity. With the standard Balassa–Samuelson model, which admits price deviations from parity, the observed real exchange rate appreciation is decomposed into the Balassa–Samuelson effect, real exchange rate appreciation in tradables, and others. The Balassa–Samuelson effect in the model, which is defined narrowly, denotes the joint effect of the tradable-nontradable productivity growth difference between the domestic and foreign countries on the real exchange rate. General findings from decomposition are that the Balassa–Samuelson effect accounts for a relatively small part of the observed real exchange rate appreciation. A greater part is attributed to the real exchange rate appreciation in tradables, increases in tradable prices expressed in a common currency, which in theory should wash out to naught in the long run (PPP). Choosing Japan in the 1950s and 1960s as an example, we address the puzzle of why the Balassa–Samuelson effect was small and real appreciation in tradables was large during a growth episode. There are three notable growth episodes following the pattern. The first is Japan’s four decades from the 1950s to 1980s. Under the US dollar peg during the rapid growth era for 1956–1970, Japan experienced high output growth and significant GDP deflator-based real exchange rate appreciation against the US dollar, 9.7 and 2.7% per year, respectively. The Balassa–Samuelson effect accounted for 0.7 percentage points, while the real appreciation in tradables accounted for 1.9 of the observed 2.7% annual real exchange rate appreciation (Imai 2010). During the 1970s and 1980s, Japan maintained moderately high output growth of 4.2% per year under a floating exchange rate. The real exchange rate vis-à-vis the USA appreciated at a slower rate of 1.6% per year from 1973 to 1992; the Balassa–Samuelson effect and the real appreciation in tradables accounted for 0.4 and 1.2 percentage points, respectively (Ito et al. 1997). The second example is China during its investment-led rapid growth. China’s output expanded by 9.7% annually from 2005 to 2015. The Chinese yuan’s GDP deflator-based real exchange rate against the US dollar appreciated by 4.6% per year, which was the sum of China’s inflation in excess of the USA and the nominal exchange rate appreciation, 2.0 and 2.6%, respectively (Imai 2018). The Balassa–Samuelson effect was 1.2 percentage points per year, which was much smaller than the real appreciation in China’s tradables (4.4 percentage points). The third case is Central and Eastern European countries, which experienced substantial real exchange rate appreciation vis-à-vis Western European currencies and the euro during high-growth years in the 1990s and 2000s. A consensus is that the Balassa–Samuelson effect was small relative to the size of real exchange rate appreciation at that time (Égert 2010; Mihaljek and Klau 2004, 2008). The effect in ten countries for 1997–2007 based on labor productivity data fell between zero and 2 percentage points per year (Égert 2010). The mean of the 11 countries from around 1998–2007 was that the Balassa–Samuelson effect accounted for 0.8 percentage points (1.2 under an alternative method) of the 3.5% annual real exchange rate appreciation (Mihaljek and Klau 2008).Footnote 1 The observed 3.5% was the sum of the 11 countries’ inflation in excess of the euro area and a nominal currency depreciation, 5.0% and − 1.5%, respectively. Averaging the results, these 11 countries’ output grew by 5.0% per year over the decade to 2007 relative to 1.8% for the three core eurozone countries, France, Germany, and Italy (IMF 2009). The three growth episodes were largely associated with industrial modernization: post-WWII technological upgrading in Japan, changeover from labor-intensive to capital-intensive manufacturing in China, and industrial retooling in Central and Eastern Europe following systemic transition. Productivity growth in the manufacturing sector in each episode was presumably high, which put upward pressures on the real exchange rate via the Balassa–Samuelson effect. Nevertheless, in all three it was not the Balassa–Samuelson effect but real appreciation in tradables that was responsible for the bulk of real exchange rate appreciation. Among the three cases, the source of real appreciation in Japan’s tradables vis-à-vis the USA during the 1950s and 1960s can be investigated through the newly available 2016 US historical national income accounts data. The revised and expanded US GDP by industry series has 19 manufacturing subcategories, which can be matched with Japan’s 13 subcategories for analysis.Footnote 2 There are two probable factors leading to the observed sizable real appreciation in tradables in a high-growth country. The first is the difference in the composition of tradables between the domestic and reference foreign countries. The commodity weight difference in the price index may be responsible for the observed deviation of the domestic country’s tradable prices from the reference country’s even if PPP held for all pairs of tradable goods. If Japan’s tradable price index was heavily weighted in, and the index weight changes over time in favor of, goods for which prices increase relatively fast, Japan’s tradable prices would rise at a higher rate than US tradables, expressed in a common currency. We will look into this conjecture with the industry-level data during the 1950s and 1960s. The second factor for the real appreciation in tradables is price mismeasurement. If not captured, product quality improvements result in an upward bias in output prices in national income accounts. The growth rate of the price index for tradables overstates price inflation to the extent that the government statistical office fails to adjust upward the output quantity for quality improvements, and any overstated prices are matched by proportionate understated quantities. In an industrializing country where the manufacturing sector invests heavily in the capital stock embodying advanced technologies, the sector’s output grows and product quality improves fast. It follows that an upward bias in Japan’s tradable prices associated with uncaptured product quality changes may have been greater than in the USA during the 1950s and 1960s, and the bias may have been responsible for the observed substantial real appreciation in Japan’s tradable prices. Although this conjecture cannot be verified numerically in the absence of bias-free price and quantity indexes, we will consider the effect on Japan’s tradable prices with available information. Previous research suggests that the magnitude of real exchange rate appreciation in Central and Eastern European countries in the 1990s and 2000s was overstated on account of price mismeasurement (Égert 2010; Égert et al. 2006; Mihaljek and Klau 2008). Continuous income increases shifted consumption patterns in favor of higher-priced and higher-quality goods during the high-growth period. The manufacturing sector, which went through wholesale renewal, also shifted its output mix toward higher value-added goods with higher quality and prices. Part of the observed price increases in official statistics has been attributed to uncaptured product quality improvements. Filer and Hanousek (2003) constructed an alternative CPI for Czech Republic during the systemic transition (1990–1999) to estimate the upward bias in the official CPI. The quality change and new product bias estimated (3.9% per year) was much greater than that of a sample of advanced countries, removal of which would lower Czech Republic’s annual CPI-based inflation rate then to 5.2% from the reported 9.1%.Footnote 3 Zhang (2017) considers the subject in a broader context by demonstrating that not only service but manufacture prices are positively related with income per capita across countries based on the 2005 International Comparison Program (ICP) data. This deviation from PPP in manufactures originates from price mismeasurement according to Zhang. Product quality is high in high-income countries, which reflects a strong preference for quality. Uncaptured quality differences leave reported prices of manufactures high in high-income countries relative to low-income countries. Applying this logic to high-growth industrializing countries, we suspect that price mismeasurement from quality change would overstate the magnitude of long-term real exchange rate appreciation and real appreciation in tradables. Our investigation of Japan during the rapid growth era for 1956–1970 begins with a remeasurement of the estimates by Imai (2010) with the new US historical national income accounts series. The Japanese yen’s real exchange rate against the US dollar is decomposed into the Balassa–Samuelson effect, real appreciation in tradables, and other, mainly cyclical, factors based on a Balassa–Samuelson model. These subcomponents of the real exchange rate appreciation are computed directly from the decomposition equations. In order to estimate the Balassa–Samuelson effect, we break up the real exchange rate appreciation in each of the two countries into price increases in tradables and nontradables and then match these price changes to the two productive sectors’ TFP growth rates. Because this procedure relies on national income accounts data, the corresponding price index is the GDP deflator in Japan and the chain-type GDP price index in the USA. The productivity measure in this study is TFP estimated from multifactor (labor and capital) production functions. Since Japan’s high output growth was propelled by investment in fixed capital, we have chosen multifactor (labor and capital) production functions despite the fact that single-factor (labor) functions were more common in the Balassa–Samuelson model-based empirical works. The Japanese yen’s real exchange rate is the index (base year = 1955) of the ratio of Japan’s GDP deflator to the USA chain-type GDP price index expressed in a common currency, whose increase denotes the yen’s real exchange rate appreciation. Japan maintained a fixed exchange rate of 360 yen per US dollar under the Bretton Woods system during the 15-year period. A fixed exchange rate and a long time period should facilitate the measurement of the Balassa–Samuelson effect, because a source of real exchange rate volatility, nominal exchange rate fluctuations, is suppressed (Berka et al. 2018). And PPP in tradables holds better in a longer time frame considering slow nominal price adjustment (Rogoff 1996). In the second section, we review the updated decomposition results. The two probable sources of the observed real appreciation in tradables are examined and an alternative case decomposition, which adjusts for putative price mismeasurement, is offered in the third section. A summary of findings is presented in the final section.",

62,4,Comparative Economic Studies,30 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-020-00124-1,An Analysis of Argentina’s 2001 Default Resolution,December 2020,Martin Guzman,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In December 2001, Argentina defaulted on its debt. The decision occurred in the context of a deep social and economic crisis that had been preceded by a decade-long experiment that included major reforms aligned with most of the tenets of the Washington Consensus. The reforms came with promises of significant increases in the country’s wealth; had those expectations materialized, the debt path of the country would have been sustainable, but that did not happen. At the time of the default, Argentina’s GDP was falling abruptly and had dropped 15.7% since the beginning of a recession in 1998 until the default with a cumulative decline between 1998 to 2002 of 19.9%. The unemployment rate rose to 21.5%, and the poverty rate reached a historical peak of 45.7%. Continuing to serve debt in full would have implied further fiscal adjustments that would have depressed the economy even more, worsening debt sustainability. Full debt repayment was not politically or economically feasible—a risk that had been recognized by creditors who had been demanding large interest rate premiums.Footnote 1 The restructuring process that followed was possibly the most complex and most commented on in the history of sovereign defaults. It generated several controversies, with an impressive variety of opinions on the meanings of this case, ranging from early claims from influential academics stating that Argentina’s case suggests that “rogue debtors, rather than rogue creditors, are the ones that pose the greatest threat to the integrity and efficiency of the international financial architecture” (Porzecanski 2005, 331), to “[Argentina’s restructuring is] in most dimensions a textbook example of how to do an exchange” (Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer 2005, 10). Much has happened since those early assertions: Opinions evolved, but disagreements still persist on various fronts. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the crisis resolution and attempts to shed light on some important controversies that this process triggered. This is not an isolated debt restructuring episode. Instead, it is a case that raises general questions for the functioning of sovereign lending markets.Footnote 2 The analysis of its intricacies matters for understanding key features of sovereign lending markets, from the consequences of the lack of adequate frameworks for restructuring sovereign debt, to the implications of the victory obtained by a group of holdout bondholders that part of the literature has classified as “vulture funds”Footnote 3 for the functioning of these markets. Argentina followed an unusual restructuring strategy: Unlike many debtor countries, the country pursued a high initial debt relief that led to a sustained recovery of debt sustainability, which, in turn, was a key condition for the spectacular recovery that followed until 2008. The restructuring also featured GDP-linked warrants, such that if the country grew more, bondholders would receive more. This strategy was highly resisted by creditors and not appreciated by the US courts. By 2010, the country had settled with 92.4% of its bondholders. Among the holdouts was a group of New York-based hedge funds that specialize in buying distressed debt and exploiting gaps in the legal financial architecture—the group that has been referred earlier as the “vulture funds” in the literature. They bought Argentine defaulted bonds, litigated in New York courts (the jurisdiction under which much of Argentine defaulted debt had been issued) claiming full payment, and won. The ruling triggered an extensive debate among academics, practitioners and policy makers—as well as controversies on the nature of the activities of these hedge funds. The ruling also featured a powerful injunction that prohibited the country from repaying the restructured bondholders until it paid the holdouts in full and also stipulated that it would penalize any institution that helped Argentina to repay those creditors—no matter where in the world those institutions were operating. The group of bondholders that sued Argentina bought the majority of the bonds after the country defaulted. And a large proportion of the bonds were purchased after the first round of restructuring, mostly in 2008.Footnote 4 The litigants claimed for full principal, full interest (which, in one particular series, was indexed to the country’s risk premium, and in all cases was high enough to contemplate the risk of default at the time the bonds had been issued), and even pre-judgment compensatory annual interest rate of 9% for no repayment on due date. The victory they obtained in the US courts ended up delivering exorbitant returns. The resulting large intercreditor inequities raised concerns in the international community. Different influential actors approached the problem from different angles—in all cases trying to resolve the potential severe moral hazard problem that this resolution could entail. The large disparity in returns between the exchange bondholders and the holdouts incentivizes holdout behavior. In the legal disputes between Argentina and the holdout bondholders, those who did not participate in the restructuring and did not litigate either (a group that received the denomination of “me too”) received the same terms as the ones set by the US courts’ rulings in favor of vulture funds, as Judge Thomas P. Griesa from the New York Southern District Court made the ruling extensive to the former group. Therefore, the resolution of the case reinforced the expectation that in a restructuring process it would be enough to hold out, let a leading holdout litigate and then wait to get the same treatment the litigant would receive. But if many follow the same strategy, it would be impossible for the distressed debtor to finalize a restructuring—hence countries could not restore debt sustainability or, more generally, set the conditions for economic recovery.Footnote 5 Following the vulture funds victory, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations, the International Capital Market Association (ICMA), and the US Treasury all got involved in the debate on how to improve the frameworks for sovereign debt restructuring. The ICMA, with the support of the IMF, suggested new language for debt contracts that would make the vulture funds’ business more difficult to carry on—in particular, the ICMA suggested a formula for aggregation of collective action clauses (CACs) that would make it easier to bind minorities and issued a clarification of the pari passu clause.Footnote 6 At the same time, the United Nations launched a process for creating a multinational formal framework for sovereign debt restructuring that resulted in the approval of a set of principles.Footnote 7 These principles received the support of an overwhelming majority of countries, with six countries voting against it—countries that are very important in the international financial landscape: the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Japan, and Israel. The case also received much attention from academia—not just in the form of scholarly papers, but also in the form of academic blogging, an area where much of the most interesting writing took place. The number of commentaries is so large that a survey will surely miss important contributions. Some of the most valuable contributions from the legal side can be found in various commentaries by Anna GelpernFootnote 8 and Mark Weidemaier.Footnote 9 Juan Jose Cruces and Tim Samples (2014) is, to the author’s knowledge, the most complete analysis of the elements of the litigation with the holdouts. Several important elements of the restructuring process have also been analyzed in Amrita Dhillon et al. (2006), Miller and Thomas (2007), Tim Samples (2014), Federico Sturzenegger and Jeromin Zettelmeyer (2005) and Eduardo Basualdo et al. (2015). Martin Guzman and Joseph Stiglitz have also provided extensive commentary on the evolution of the saga and its economic implications.Footnote 10 This paper offers a comprehensive description and analysis of the whole restructuring process. It focuses on the economic consequences and meaning of the different actions, elements and events that were involved in the process without, however, delving too deeply into the set of complex of legal issues that received much attention as the saga was evolving.Footnote 11 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second section analyzes the elements of Argentina’s offers of 2005 and 2010. The legal disputes in US courts are described in the third section. The fourth section concludes.",2
62,4,Comparative Economic Studies,02 April 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-020-00118-z,"Corruption, Government Expenditure and Public Debt in OECD Countries",December 2020,Alfredo Del Monte,Luca Pennacchio,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In recent decades, public debt has increased quite sharply across a broad range of countries. In the early 2000s, it was around 70% of GDP in emerging economies, with some countries such as Argentina and Turkey reaching 100–150% (IMF 2003). The global economic and financial crisis led to serious concerns in advanced economies, which generally had high and increasing levels of public debt. For example, in the Group of Seven at the end of 2015, the ratio of public debt to GDP was about 120%. There is, however, wide variation in the extent of national debt. In the OECD, sovereign debt is on average 74% of GDP, but some countries have lower (Chile, Australia, Norway, Korea) or higher (Japan, Italy, USA, Greece) levels. Recently, the debate about the macroeconomic implications of corruption has emphasized the damaging effects on public finance by considering, for example, public deficits (Kaufmann 2010; Oto-Peralias et al. 2013). Less attention has been paid to the effect of corruption on public debt. This is surprising when policy-makers are increasingly focused on national debt, emphasizing the need to strengthen fiscal policies under the assumption that high levels of debt negatively affect economic growth. Very few papers have empirically analyzed the relationship between corruption and public debt, and they have usually considered samples of countries at different levels of economic development (e.g. Cooray et al. 2017; Apergis and Apergis 2019). This paper helps to fill this research gap, investigating whether corruption exacerbates public debt in OECD countries and whether its adverse effect depends on the size of government. To this aim, we estimated a dynamic econometric model of public debt in a sample of OECD countries during 1995–2015. This analysis enriches the literature on the macroeconomic implications of corruption in several ways. First, we focused on advanced countries. Previous studies have examined the effects of corruption in developing countries or in groups of countries at different developmental stages. It is therefore necessary to understand the effects of corruption on public finances of advanced economies (Kaufmann 2010), such as OECD countries. Some developed countries have high levels of public debt, and there is much debate about reducing this. Public debt of OECD countries represents more than 80% of world public debt (CIA 2013). Corruption is lower in these countries, but there are still differences in the levels of corruption and the ability to control it among advanced economies. Previous literature has suggested that corruption may have a more detrimental effect on public debt in these countries than in less developed ones (Benfratello et al. 2017). Second, we investigated whether the detrimental effect of corruption on public debt is shaped by government expenditure. Some macroeconomic variables that affect public debt also affect corruption, which makes it difficult to assess the relationship between corruption and debt. Government expenditure, for example, is considered a proxy of government size and may have an important role in both the economic performance of a country and public sector corruption. It can be argued, indeed, that the real concern for public debt lies in the size of government, not in corruption; by reducing public expenditure, governments could also reduce public corruption and the damaging effect on sovereign debt. The strand of literature analyzing the relationship between corruption and government expenditure, however, is largely inconclusive and needs further research. Lastly, we tried to quantify the impact of corruption on public debt. We analyzed the estimated regression coefficients to identify short- and long-term effects and considered two countries characterized by high levels of both corruption and public debt, namely Greece and Italy. We simulated the quantitative impact of corruption on public debt to show the hypothetical effect of governments having reduced the extent of corruption to the average of other OECD countries. Overall, our results show that corruption is an important determinant of public debt in developed countries. Government expenditure contributes to increased public debt but does not reinforce the damaging effect of corruption. On the contrary, some specific categories of public spending reduce the damaging impact of corruption, and this suggests that advanced economies could strengthen control of corruption if they increased specific categories of expenditure. Finally, our simulation exercise to quantify the impact of corruption suggests a relevant effect in both the short- and long term. These results are robust against a number of tests including three different measures of corruption, various subsamples of countries, and alternative model specifications. “Theoretical Background and Hypothesis Development” section of this paper provides the theoretical background about the relationship between public debt and corruption, and develops the research hypotheses. “Empirical Evidence” section reviews selected empirical studies on corruption and government expenditure. “Methodology and Data” section sets out the econometric model and the data used to analyze the impact of corruption on public debt. “Empirical Results” section shows the empirical results and the sensitivity analysis. “Conclusions” section provides some concluding remarks.",8

Russia’s self-sufficiency doctrineFootnote 1 generates large political interest toward agriculture, with 0.93% of the country’s GDP allocated toward direct and indirect support (OECD 2017). However, the regions benefit from these resources unequally since the composition of federal and regionalFootnote 2 co-funding differs greatly between the sub-federal units. Subsequently, subsidies per hectare vary substantially across sub-federal units: sometimes we observe 20-fold differences. There could be two main reasons for these imbalances: first, because agricultural support is legally a primary responsibility of the regions (Shagaida et al. 2015) that have a substantial discretion in the size of the co-funding (Uzun et al. 2016), regional economic strength may affect the size of local co-funding. Second, although federal co-funding of agricultural subsidies is regulated by distribution formulas under the country’s current legislation,Footnote 3 de facto amounts may be substantially different (Frumina 2016). Controlling for the major variables in the distribution formulas and other agricultural economic factors, we still cannot fully explain the differences in agricultural subsidies. In light of the growing scholarly interest in redistributive politics in Russia, this study draws upon political economy literature to analyze and further explain the subsidies’ allocation and distribution. We examine how political incentives of central and regional politicians in Russia may affect the distribution of agricultural subsidies across and within the regions. A growing body of literature suggests that within the setting of a competitively autocratic Russian regime, political actors maximize their support by redistributing state resources (Popov 2004; Jarocińska 2010; Marques et al. 2016; Treisman 1998). However, all these scholars examine the motives behind the distribution of intergovernmental transfers to the regions. These analyses are lacking a more nuanced account of how Russian politics works with respect to concrete groups of voters and to the support for specific sectors. To our knowledge, this study is the first one to contribute to this body of literature by examining how central and regional governments appeal to a very important voter group: rural residents, who represent roughly one-third of the Russian population. Even though the agricultural sector employed about 7% of Russia’s entire labor force in 2016 (RosStat 2017), agriculture is of central importance for rural residents and subsidies may affect the growth of their local agricultural sectors (Petrikov 2016; Uzun and Lerman 2017). Considering these circumstances, politicians may instrumentalize agricultural subsidies to reward or incentivize voters within a given sub-federal unit to support an incumbent political party. In particular, as “core voter” theory (Cox and McCubbins 1986) holds, incumbent politicians will transfer more resources to politically loyal voter groups. “Swing voter” theory (Dixit and Londregan 1996) describes another strategy, by which incumbents will target those groups of voters that are more likely to swing to, and vote for, their side. In other words, higher political competition may incentivize incumbents to cater to certain voter groups (Besley and Burgess 2002). Because Russian agricultural support involves relatively independent federal and regional co-funding components, strategic redistribution may occur on both levels. In particular, federal politicians may target “core” or “swing” regions, whereas local politicians may be incentivized by the federal government to cater to local agricultural interests contingent on existing political competitors. Since Russia’s current party in power, “United Russia” (UR), is highly hierarchical and well organized (Reuter 2010), the pressure from the party leaders may coerce regional representatives to maximize political support. Weingast (2009) argues that authoritarian regimes tend to make local elites dependent on transfers from the center to ensure that manipulating their size is an effective tool in controlling local elites. Russian politicians may also have a strategy with respect to intra-regional distribution. Russia hosts some of the largest agricultural enterprises in the world, employing a substantial share of the rural labor force (Lerman 2017). This may have two implications for the politicians’ strategies: first, considering Russia’s experience of using employers as vote brokers (Frye et al. 2018), federal and local politicians may target large agricultural enterprises within their redistributive politics. Federal decision makers may see regions with predominantly large-scale agriculture as an attractive avenue for buying votes via manipulation with agricultural subsidies. Regionally, these enterprises may represent effective vehicles for voter mobilization for local politicians who are pressured via party hierarchies. Second, large agricultural businesses may be better organized and exert significant lobbying pressure. Following Olson’s (1965) collective action theory, they have better administrative capacity and face lower transaction costs for engaging in lobbying activities in comparison with small producers. To test our hypotheses, we use a unique 2008–2015 panel data set on federal and sub-federal shares of agricultural subsidies spent across 78 Russian regions.Footnote 4 This allows us to follow two election cycles where the incumbent parties may have faced a dilemma to strategically distribute agricultural subsidies among the regions in order to maximize political support. Russia represents an interesting case since we observe a large variation among comparable regions in terms of the degree of political competition, farming modes and the amount of subsidies received. Because redistribution has been shown to be effective for voter mobilization in both democratic and autocratic settings (Stokes 2007), with its weak institutions, Russia’s autocratic regime represents a fertile ground for redistributive politics. In general, the evidence suggests that Russian politicians may be allocating and distributing agricultural subsidies with the end goal of maximizing their political support. In particular, we find evidence that the federal government targets those regions where the support for UR was lower in the past, while sub-federal politicians appear to be motivated to allocate more co-funding should they face larger political threats from local challengers. Regional governments appear to instrumentalize large agricultural enterprises as vote brokers.",5

63,1,Comparative Economic Studies,01 September 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-020-00119-y,Brexit or Euro for the UK? Evidence from Panel Data,March 2021,Petros E. Ioannatos,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum where 51.9% of the thirty million voters that participated supported exit of the UK from the European Union (EU). The impending withdrawal of the UK from the EU became also known as Brexit. On March 29, 2017, the UK invoked Article 50 of the Treaty of the EU which provides a plan for a member to leave the EU. Subsequently, negotiations between the UK and EU took place on several issues including, the trade relationship between UK and EU, the situation of the UK and EU expatriate citizens, the status of the Northern Ireland border, referred to as “backstop,” and UK’s compensation to the EU for the Brexit. The terms “soft” and “hard” Brexit have surfaced implying negotiations could produce, respectively, either Brexit with a mutually beneficial trade agreement or Brexit without a trade agreement, under World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, commonly referred to as no-deal Brexit. On February 1, 2020, the UK pulled out of the EU. However, the status of most major issues separating the two parties is to be determined in future negotiations. Brexit is an unpreceded event, and both sides are exploring unchartered territory. Historically, the relationship of the UK with the EU has not always been harmonious. The UK had to overcome ten years of French vetoes before joining the EU in 1973, then, referred to as the European Economic Community (EEC). The distinctly opposing views in UK’s political establishment on matters relating to the EEC led to a 1975 referendum with regard to exit of the UK from the EEC. In this first referendum, the electorate voted 67.2% in favor of staying in the EEC. Despite the outcome of the referendum, UK’s relations with the EEC continued to be tense regarding concerns that the UK places own interests above the collective interest of the EEC partners. The Thatcher years (1979–1990) that followed this first referendum are notorious for UK’s Eurosceptic attitude. The odd partnership continued unabated and after the Thatcher years echoing British fears that the EEC, which became EU on November 1, 1993, is expanding to a “super-state” with a federal structure, increased centralization in decision making and legal authority to exercise political and economic dominance over the member states. There was no surprise when the UK did not follow the EU in the next stage of integration. In 1999, the majority of the EU members pegged the nominal exchange rate of their domestic currencies to a new currency, the euro, creating the European Monetary Union (EMU) or Eurozone which is the largest monetary union worldwide. However, the UK was conspicuously absent from participating in the Eurozone over fears of reduced sovereignty in terms of the authority assumed by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the role of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). Thus, the UK assumed a segmented membership with the EU in that continued to participate in the single market but abstained from adopting the euro. Whereas the literature on Brexit concentrates on the consequences of Brexit for the UK and the EU, the alternative course for the UK to remain in the EU and become further integrated with the EU by joining the Eurozone has not been evaluated. In view of the impending Brexit, this study aims to fill this gap in the relevant literature and contribute to the Brexit debate by evaluating this alternative. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to determine whether Brexit is, indeed, the correct decision for the UK as compared to becoming a Eurozone member. The study relies on the theoretical foundation of the neoclassical growth model extended to include human capital accumulation. Counterfactual analysis is applied in terms of the Differences-in-Differences (DiD) methodology to evaluate the effect of UK’s per capita income had the UK joined the EU when the EU was formed in 1999. This involves the counterfactual evaluation of the direction and significance of the sum of the average difference in per capita income between the Eurozone and the UK from before to after the formation of the Eurozone. The empirical analysis is based on a balanced panel dataset composed of fifteen countries for the period from 1980 to 2017. It is demonstrated that had the UK adopted the euro when the Eurozone was formed, UK’s per capita income would have been higher by a significant 15.48% for the period after the formation of the Eurozone. If Eurozone’s less performing economies of the southern periphery are excluded from the study, the effect is even higher in that UK’s per capita income would have been higher by a significant 24.98%. The robustness of the results is evaluated by a number of sensitivity tests, thus, by extending the analysis to the entire non-Eurozone EU group (UK, Denmark, Sweden), by accounting for the recent global financial crisis, by changing Eurozone’s start date from 1999 to 1992 when the Maastricht Treaty was signed, and lastly, by using an alternative model specification based on the endogenous growth theory. The analysis shows the UK’s per capita income would have been significantly higher had the UK been a Eurozone member. This result is compatible with Campos et al. (2019) where it is demonstrated that UK’s per capita income has increased significantly from participating in the EU. Thus, this study not only supports the result by Campos et al. (2019) but goes further as to show that the UK not only should have remained in the EU but also should have been further integrated into the EU by seeking membership into the Eurozone and adopting the euro. Thus, the evidence suggests that Brexit is not the correct action for the UK.",1

The post-WW2 Harvard Project provided Western researchers with a detailed description of the manner in which resources were allocated by bureaucrats in the Soviet Union. We need to contemplate this from the perspective of the bureaucrat responsible for arranging prospective inter-enterprise flows, as described by Levine (1959, 1961), elaborated on by Montias (1959, 1962a, b), and analyzed by Manove (1971). They described in detail the Soviet bureaucratic method, by which all flows of materials in the economy were “planned” one period ahead, usually a year, of the plan period. Thus, they answer the question first raised by von Mises: How could bureaucrats manage to coordinate these flows so that the plans they had drawn up months in advance became roughly feasible? Clearly, plans that fail to provide downstream producers with the supply flows that they need are not feasible and cannot guide production. This should not be taken to mean that the plan is carried out to the letter; in fact, the planner is busy throughout the plan period replacing undelivered inputs and sparing enterprises from breakdowns in contracted deliveries. The SBC is an extremely useful concept for the description of this reality. It is, so to speak, the dual of a bureaucracy’s inability to shut down an enterprise just because the latter cannot cover its costs. If an enterprise cannot be allowed to cease operation, it acquires a very high shadow price; i.e., its closure will inflict a substantial damage on the economy. The concept is useful because it is not restricted to socialist economies, has proved of much utility in explaining recent events in capitalist economies, and allows for gradation—from a hard BC to a “soft-ish” iteration to a “perfectly” soft version. Suppose our enterprise is a lossmaker. Does this imply that it is inefficient and should cease operations? This might be the case if it were functioning in an environment where prices mirror scarcities, say, in an ideal market economy. Such surely was not the case in the productive sectors of the socialist, Soviet-type economies (STEs). I came across an extreme example from the early history of the GDR (or DDR). There, the cost of copper ingots exceeded the price of the output manufactured from them (Keren 1968, p. 112; Oelssner 1956). This happened because new products (copper ingots in this case) were priced at their calculated cost at time of entry whereas the old (low) prices of existing products produced from these ingots, were not adjusted, i.e., not raised. The ruling price system in STEs in the 1970s and 1980s was not as distorted as that. Yet these prices were bureaucratically fixed and reflected, at best, the production costs of enterprises that were protected from competition. Hence, their losses may have meant that their bureaucratically fixed prices were too low or their input prices too high; had they earned profits, it may have meant the opposite. Thus, losses could be obviated by raising output prices. This also explains the existence and toleration of planned losses and the lax treatment of losses in general. Although unplanned losses—those exceeding what the planners assumed to be justified given the production plan and the existing price structure—were taken into account, they were not heavily weighted in evaluations of enterprise performance. To repeat, upstream enterprises, those that supply other enterprises, are essential for the maintenance of the supply chain. If they cease operation, the downstream flow slackens, threatening whole swathes of the economy with disruption—unless alternative suppliers are found. In a market economy, such catastrophes are usually averted easily with the help of the price system and the potential entry of competitors. In the taut STE universe, in contrast, suppliers had to be found by the planner, a bureaucrat who found the task hard to accomplish, while entry has to await political decision. This was reason enough to keep alive enterprises that produced shoddy output at high cost. At the cost of belaboring the familiar, it has to be borne in mind that entry and exit decisions in STEs were political, hence had to take their time. Therefore, excess demand or supply took a long time to clear, at the cost of production breakdowns or the accumulation of unneeded inventories.",

Tabrizy,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"International exchanges of goods and services do not occur in a vacuum. Political and trade agreements accommodate such transactions. In particular, by restraining conflicts, political agreements may contribute positively to trade, as there is ample evidence suggesting that conflicts may hinder international trade in goods and services. For example, Blomberg and Hess (2006) and Glick and Taylor (2010) examine historical data showing that conflicts may adversely affect international trade as well as national income and global welfare.Footnote 1 Beyond the adverse effects on merchandize trade, Didier (2020) suggests that conflicts may negatively impact trade in financial and travel services. Plus, conflicts appear to have some spillover effects. For example, Qureshi (2013) finds that internal or external conflicts in contiguous countries have persistent adverse effects on neighboring countries who may not even be involved in any disputes. Pham and Doucouliagos (2017) and De Sousa et al. (2018) offer more evidence for such spillover effects.Footnote 2 Along with the potential for restraining conflicts, political agreements may also lead to the removal of trade barriers, including international sanctions. In return, they may contribute positively to trade in goods and services. Several studies have already examined the adverse effects of sanctions on trade; examples include Caruso (2003), Yang et al. (2004), and Felbermayr et al. (2019). These studies suggest that sanctions negatively affect international trade, though their ultimate impacts may vary significantly. Considering the adverse effects of sanctions on trade, we expect that sanctions removal may contribute positively to trade. But there are only a few studies that examine this channel. In this paper, we examine the trade effects of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (henceforth, JCPOA), reached on July 2015 between Iran, China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK, and the USA (i.e., the permanent members of the UN Security Council, plus Germany). This political agreement successfully restrained the potential for a new conflict in the Middle East. It also led to the removal of an array of nuclear-related sanctions against Iran. Sanctions relief did not last long, however, as the USA terminated its participation in the JCPOA agreement in May 2018. Nevertheless, this short-lived agreement provides a rare opportunity for us to study how restraining conflicts and sanctions removal may affect trade. We exclude crude oil exports, focusing on Iran's non-oil exporting activities. As described more fully in Sect. 3, the JCPOA agreement led to a significant recovery of Iran's oil exports. This positive effect is plain to see. Yet, the impact on non-oil exports has remained unexplored. Plus, as shown in Fig. 1, non-oil exports have increasingly become more important in Iran's current account. Ever since 2012, more than 30% of Iran's exports are comprised of non-oil products, which may, in part, be the result of intensified sanctions that hampered oil exports. Further, as Haidar (2017) argues, the private sector in Iran has engaged more actively in non-oil exports when compared to oil exports, which are dominated by the state and semi-governmental entities. Also, those exports are likely to make greater contributions to employment, as opposed to highly capital-intensive oil exports. Source: Central Bank of Iran (2019) and authors' computation The share of non-oil exports in Iran's aggregate exports. We explore quarterly trade data for a panel of 28 industries in the manufacturing, mining, and agriculture sectors. The time series of the panel begins as of March 2011 and ends in March 2018. It provides an array of observations before and after the JCPOA agreement, enabling us to draw an informed comparison. Following the empirical approach in Santos-Paulino (2002), Santos-Paulino and Thirlwall (2004), and Ratnaike (2012), we employ canonical dynamic panel data estimation techniques to study the effect of sanctions removal on export growth. Our estimation results suggest that the growth rate of Iran's non-oil exports is significantly higher after the JCPOA agreement when compared with a similar window of time before the settlement. Conditional upon a wide range of covariates, including the initial value of exports and lagged growth rates, we find that on average industry-level exports grow 9.9% faster following the JCPOA agreement.Footnote 3 This positive effect is also evident when we employ an ordinal measure based on the timing of the nuclear negotiations and the interim deal that ultimately led to the comprehensive agreement of interest. We also examine industry-level heterogeneities. We find that the exports of industries that have relatively low shares in Iran's non-oil exports grow significantly faster when compared to industries with relatively high percentages in non-oil exports. We show that the exports of industries with relatively low shares were affected more severely by sanctions. Once sanctions were removed, we observe that their exports grow relatively faster, making up for prior contractions. Our findings suggest that even a short-lived political agreement could have significant positive effects on exporting activities in middle-income countries, including those who rely heavily on commodity exports. They also suggest that these effects could be of great importance for industries that are not necessarily known as the leading exporting industries in such countries. This finding is in line with the results that are recently reported by Giri et al. (2019), who suggest that reducing trade barriers may lead to higher export diversification among commodity exporters. In Sect. 2, we review previous studies on the trade effects of sanctions. In Sect. 3, we describe the background of the JCPOA agreement. In Sect. 4, we present our empirical analyses by describing our data, empirical approach, and findings. Section 5 concludes our findings and arguments.",2

It was totally unanticipated leaving medical establishments unprepared in face of the COVID-19 virus. It is disrupting aggregate supply, aggregate demand and is inflicting painful arbitrary losses of income on large segments of consumers and businesses. Like the GD and the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007/2009 it calls, among other, for substantially larger fiscal and monetary measures as well as tax relief. Unlike the GD and the GFC whose origins were financial the origin of the corona crisis is on the real side creating a tradeoff between averting a plague and a major economic downturn.Footnote 1 The initial absence of a vaccine, its slow administration to the public along with the emergence of new variants are still forcing most governments to severely limit social interactions leading to serious disruptions in employment, production, supply chains, and aggregate demand. Following their early success in reducing the number of new corona cases tight lockouts were subsequently replaced by less stringent sanitary measures. Unfortunately, as of March 2021 many countries have gone through additional waves of high virus infections. Policymakers in most countries responded by deploying huge fiscal packages leading to large deficits and substantial increases in debt/GDP ratios. The huge financing needs triggered by those policies along with the tameness of inflation and the frequently reached zero lower bound (ZLB) on the policy rate led a number of economists to seriously consider temporary lifting of the existing taboo on seignorage financing of deficits by the central bank. Once seignorage is admitted as a legitimate source of deficit financing along with national debt, optimal taxation theory implies that the contribution of those two sources of funds should be determined by weighting the marginal distortions associated with each source of funds. Although under current institutions the CB has the sole authority to increase the monetary base, this is a task that is naturally within the realm of elected fiscal policymakers. This raises the following non-trivial dilemma: How to implement an efficient use of seignorage during serious emergencies without opening the spigot for monetary financing of fiscal deficits during normal times. The paper considers possible solutions to this dilemma and the associated risks including the, currently remote, risk of inflation and of upward unanchoring of inflationary expectations. The need to resort to seignorage varies across countries in line with their initial debt/GDP ratios and access to the bond market. Although seignorage is probably superfluous for countries with good credit ratings and relatively low debt/GDP ratios, it may be essential for heavily indebted countries with poor access to capital markets. The paper documents substantial variations in debt/GDP ratios across country groups and discusses the roles of differences in access to financial markets and in levels of development for the need to rely on seignorage. There is an important technical similarity between QE and seignorage in that they both are implemented by creating new base money to buy government securities. The main difference between them is that under quantitative easing the CB is allowed to buy only seasoned government bonds to maintain price and financial stability. By contrast when seignorage is legal, the CB is allowed to buy new public securities at source in order to provide direct financing to government. Unlike QE each $ of full impact seignorage contributes a full $ toward deficit financing.Footnote 2 Although smaller, the contribution of a $ of QE to deficit finances is nonzero since it provides a deeper market for government securities lowering governmental debt service costs. The paper organization follows. Section ""Economic Impact of the Corona Crisis and the Response of Aggregate Demand Policies"" briefly documents the economic impact of the COVID-19 virus and the response of aggregate demand policies. Section ""Seignorage and the Role of CBs: Past and Present"" discusses the views of economists and central bankers in the past and present on the use of seignorage during emergency periods. Section ""Seignorage as a Source of Public Finance within the Theory of Optimal Taxation and the Tradeoff between Implementation of Optimal Taxation and Central Bank Autonomy"" places seignorage within the theory of optimal taxation and explores some ideas aimed at improving the tradeoff between implementation of the optimal taxation principle and CB autonomy. Implication of cross-country variations in the need to use seignorage is discussed in section ""Deployment of Fiscal Policies during the Corona Crisis and Cross-Country Variations in the Need to Use Seignorage"". An implication of the discussion is that for governments with adequate access to capital markets seignorage may be superfluous but it is likely to be an essential temporary device for governments with limited access. Seignorage and QE are compared in section ""Seignorage versus Quantitative Easing (QE) and Central Bank Dominance"". Two implication of this comparison is that (i) seignorage can be implemented temporarily under CB dominance without much change in existing institutions, (ii) sufficiently larger doses of QE can achieve results similar to those of one dose of seignorage. It is likely that, in spite of huge increases in Debt/GDP ratios, this is the implicit thinking underlying the decision of practically all advanced economies to rely on QE rather than break the taboo on monetary financing. Section ""Should Seignorage be used in View of the Current Inflation Outlook?"" evaluates the case for limited use of seignorage in light of the current inflation outlook. It notes that for groups of countries affected by deflation, such as the Euro area and Japan, some limited amount of seignorage is also beneficial because it is more effective than QE in generating inflation. Empirical evidence on the higher effectiveness of seignorage in raising inflation is provided by means of a comparison of substantial QE operations through base expansion practiced in the USA during the GFC with base expansion of the same size used for seignorage operations during part of the post-WWI German hyperinflation. This is followed by concluding remarks.",5

Weak investment can lower economic growth and prolonged episodes of weak investment can have long-lasting effects on output. Empirical evidence shows that the trend slowdown in economic growth since the 2007/08 crisis has been driven by weak capital deepening. Countries with the largest economic contractions experienced the largest drop in the growth of their capital stock. In particular, countries with larger capital misallocation in the run-up to the crisis such as the Southern European countries had a larger downward adjustment in the capital stock. The deceleration of trend labour productivity growth after 2008 was to a large extent the result of persistently weak capital deepening (ECB 2016; Ollivaud et al. 2016; see Panel B in Fig. 1). Source: Panel A: Author’s calculations using data drawn from the OECD Economic Outlook database; Panel B: Ollivaud et al. (2016) Investment in OECD countries Panel A. Investment and GDP growth (% annual average, 2001–2019). Panel B. Decomposition of growth in trend labour productivity across the OECD. Investment in OECD countries has been weak in the immediate aftermath of the 2007/08 financial and economic crisis (Fig. 2). Some argue that business investment evolved after the crisis similar with other post-crisis periods (Ademmer and Jansen 2018; ECB 2018) and that business investment recovered by 2016 to its pre-crisis level (EIB 2017). Taking a longer perspective suggests that investment may not be that weak after all. Aggregate investment reached a low in 2010 comparable during other economic downturns (1983 and 1993) but recovered to its historical average by 2016 (Fig. 3), though still well below its peak in 2007. Similarly, business investment exhibits a similar pattern of recovery. Contrary to aggregate investment, it shows a trend increase over time. But similarly to aggregate investment, it is very close to its trend (Fig. 3). Looking at individual OECD countries shows that business investment is not particularly weak in comparison with the pre-crisis period, with the exceptions of a handful of countries (Panel A in Fig. 4). The picture for aggregate investment is more balanced: investment is below its pre-crisis period for more countries (Panel B in Fig. 4).

Panel A. Business investment (% of GDP, constant prices). Panel B. Aggregate investment (% of GDP, constant prices). Source: Author’s calculations based on data drawn from the OECD Economic Outlook database Weakness in investment can be due to a number of reasons related to the business cycle, including weak aggregate demand (Bond et al. 2015; Busetti et al. 2016; ECB 2016).Footnote 1 Research suggests that weak domestic and foreign demand has been the main driver of the post-crisis weakness in business investment in many advanced countries including France, Germany and the USA (Lewis et al. 2014; OECD 2015). The case of Germany shows that if weakness in investment is due to weak foreign demand in geographically close markets, business investment may go to faraway markets such as the USA or China (Fuentes-Hutfilter et al. 2016). Part of business investment could have gone ‘abroad’ to support outsourcing in other countries (Zwart 2016). Recent studies documented that outsourcing in some advanced countries such as Germany and the Netherlands implies strong FDI outflows (Fuentes-Hutfiler et al. 2016; OECD 2015; Zwart 2016). Such capital outflows may have implications for the labour market of the home (originator) country. Empirical research indicates that the impact differs across countries and industries. For instance, FDI outflows are associated with aggregate employment growth in the USA but this relationship is negative in Japan, in particular for FDI going from Japan to China. At the sectoral level, employment reacts strongly to changes in labour costs, especially in manufacturing sectors, which have trade links to non-OECD countries (Molnár et al. 2008). It is, however, not always clear whether outward FDI is a substitute for or complementary to domestic business investment (OECD 2015). Other related cyclical factors may have contributed to the decline in investment over the past years. First, deleveraging following the crisis amplified the decline in investment (Lewis et al. 2014). Second, access to finance has tightened for small- and medium-sized businesses. Third, high global uncertainty and lower business confidence have been acting as a drag on business investment (Millar and Sutherland 2016; ECB 2018; Kopp 2018). Nevertheless, less uncertainty, reduced financing costs due to accommodating monetary policy and a decline in credit constraints helped the recovery in business investment after 2011 (ECB 2016, 2018). Weak investment can, however, become a more structural phenomenon. The cyclical downturn can exacerbate existing structural weaknesses. For instance, uncertainty related to policies and regulations can stabilise at high levels in the aftermath of an economic slowdown or existing uncertainty can become larger. Access to funding may become fundamentally difficult in some countries if an economic downturn hits the banking and financial sector hard. Existing barriers to funding may become unbearably high following an economic crisis. Business investment recovered both in the USA and Europe, but it was quicker in the USA (ECB 2016). Nevertheless, investment growth in European countries was one percentage point lower than in the USA. Also, Europe lags behind in terms of investment in machinery and equipment and there is a persistent gap in investment in R&D vis-à-vis the USA. US investment is also more pronounced in automation and digitalisation (EIB 2019).",1

Over the last decade, central banks in major countries have been adopting aggressive unconventional monetary policies, resulting in concerns about their balance sheets. This paper discusses the literature regarding these concerns. If a central bank is faced with a substantial loss, due to a negative financial shock, its capital decreases or may even become negative. This risks the bank’s credibility. The question then has to be addressed as to why a central bank needs sufficient capital and how insufficient capital is harmful to the bank’s reputation. Many research papers on this topic have concentrated on developing countries, as some of these have experience of central bank failure due to foreign-exchange or banking-sector crises. For example, Leone (1994) studied the losses of central banks by analyzing 14 Latin American countries. Central banks in developed countries have not, until now, been considered as victims of this issue. However, a number of them have begun aggressive unconventional monetary policies, putting them at risk of substantial losses as they look to move away from these policies in the future. The first central bank to introduce such an unconventional monetary policy was the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in 1999. In their studies, Ueda (2004) and Cargill (2005, 2006) addressed concerns about the BOJ’s balance sheet, which had been affected by unconventional policy. In 2008, “Lehman Shock” struck global financial markets. The central banks in developed countries, such as the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB), introduced unconventional policies. In the 2010s, further papers about central bank balance sheets in developed countries were starting to appear. The studies cited in this paper have various motivations, but are arranged here to support the context of central bank capital and credibility. “Capital and Monetary Policy” section reviews the early literature concerning central bank capital. Without sufficient capital, a central bank cannot implement an appropriate monetary policy, putting its credibility at risk. Empirical studies focusing on capital and policy performance are also summarized in this section. “Solvency” section deals with the development of a theoretical framework in this area. Initially, the central bank budget constraints that create adjustments in the bank balance sheet are addressed, followed by their intertemporal version, leading to a consideration of solvency. Additionally, several studies on the behavior of banks to prevent insolvency were studied. “Relation with the Government” section reviews the literature on fiscal transfers to and from the government.",2

This plan is the outcome of a momentum of coordinated fiscal decisions between EU governments, the European Commission and the European Parliament. Meanwhile, concerns about debt sustainability have also arisen and they may tend to reverse the fiscal stance. In this contribution, I use the Fiscal theory of the price level as a backdrop for a discussion on the risks that expansionary fiscal policies may pose on debt sustainability. I recall that a regime of fiscal dominance does not lead to macroeconomic instability. I also review a few empirical papers on fiscal sustainability and I conclude, also based upon own estimates, that it is not a major concern, at least in the short to mid-run. Finally, I argue that Europeans should continue on the fiscal impetus they contributed to in 2020 by fostering coordination and transparency on EU fiscal policies. To achieve this objective, I revisit the idea of an enhanced dialogue on fiscal matters at the European Parliament and propose to establish a Fiscal Dialogue with the EU Member States. How exceptional fiscal responses to the Covid-19 crisis have been can be contemplated in Table 1. Fast-growing fiscal deficits have contrasted with slower moves towards either consolidation or expansion that had been usual over two decades. The change in the primary balance between two consecutive years has never been that large in absolute value and in contrast with the mean and standard deviation between 1995 and 2019, the expansionary shift of 2020 seems gigantic. While it is fair to say that part of this change can be attributed to the historical drop in GDP, year 2020 may be the starting point of a new era during which fiscal policy will be the “only game in town”, an expression that had been formerly associated with unconventional monetary policies (see Wolf 2012; El Erian 2017). There are many possible reasons behind the renewed use of fiscal tools, including a reappraisal of fiscal policy. First, the intensive use of monetary policy to cope with the crises may have reduced its ammunitions. In a low rate environment, monetary policy has limited margins of manoeuvre, whereas those of fiscal policy tend to increase (Blanchard and Summers 2020). Second, governments or central banks may have turned towards a regime of fiscal dominance conducive to a strategic shift in their interactions: fiscal policy may act first, whereas monetary policy would follow in a Stackelberg-game approach. The achievement of the objectives of the former would then weigh on the achievement of the latter’s. Stated differently, monetary policy may embrace States’ objectives and adapt its policies to their achievementsFootnote 1. Third, reliance on fiscal policy beyond the fiscal limits that exist in, e.g. the European Union (EU), may reveal a lack of satisfaction with the fiscal framework. Fiscal rules may have appeared as inappropriate or inefficient. They have not prevented the rise in public indebtedness in a positive interest rate environment and they have become unnecessary to curb debt to GDP ratios with interest rates below the GDP growth rate (Blanchard et al. 2020). Fourth, after decades of criticisms against fiscal policy, its stabilizing properties during recessions have been positively reassessed (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012; Creel et al. 2011). Finally, the rise in deficits and debts during Covid-19 crisis may have not resulted from a reappraisal of fiscal policy but from a lack of an alternativeFootnote 2. Actually, governments reacted swiftly to compensate households and firms for the loss incurred by health measures like lockdowns, but they may have done so under assumptions of low fiscal multipliers. Low appraisal of fiscal policy may therefore imply a quick reversal in policies after the Covid-19 crisis. Whatever the reasons, good (reappraisal) or bad (TINA), for which fiscal policy has become the ‘new’ fashion, the same questions arise: will it be sufficient and stabilizing? Will public finance remain sustainable? And what kind of governance will help give positive answers to the first two questions? While appealing, these questions cannot be answered easily. Covid-19 crisis has produced so much uncertainty that the use of pre-Covid analytical tools might be a poor predictor of the future. However, episodes of large increases in debt and deficits are not entirely new, so that macroeconomics is equipped with theories and empirical evidence to shed light on the consequences of fiscal policy on the economy and on the influence of the economy on the behaviour of policymakers. In the following, I will mainly focus on long-run issues and on the last two above-mentioned questions. I will pay less attention to the fiscal multiplier effect, hence to the stabilizing properties of fiscal policy. I will take the results by Gechert and Rannenberg (2018) for grantedFootnote 3. In their meta-analyses, they notably show that fiscal tools like transfers and public investment have had high multiplier effects. Fiscal stimuli drawing on these two tools should be a priority then. I will turn to the consequences of fiscal policy on debt dynamics, and then on the fiscal reactions of policymakers to debt dynamics and the economy. While the effectiveness of fiscal policy to dampen the crisis is of utmost importance, reassuring on debt sustainability even if effectiveness is not achieved immediately is also important to convince that fiscal policy deserves a long-lasting try. I will discuss debt sustainability in the context of fiscal dominance. I will then discuss about fiscal governance and about combating the rise of discontent vis-à-vis politicians and elites (i.e. populism) by enhanced accountability and control of fiscal policies. In this respect and in the context of the EU, I will advocate enhanced accountability vis-à-vis genuinely European democratic bodies, and I will propose to enforce a Fiscal Dialogue between governments and the European Parliament (EP).",3

First, income taxation has become less progressive and the top marginal income tax rates have significantly decreased. Second, the between-country gap in top marginal income tax rates has substantially shrunk and the tax structures have converged. Third, taxation has become regressive at the top in a number of countries, i.e. the effective tax rates are decreasing for the highest incomes. Forth, these moves have not come with a decrease in social and redistribution public expenditures, which suggests that the tax burden has moved towards the middle class. Finally, the after-tax and transfers inequality has increased in most advanced countries since the mid-1990s despite the rise in public social expenditures. Those facts are exposed in the Section “Stylized Facts”. An abundant economic literature has studied the effects of taxpayers’ mobility on income tax structures and income tax competition (see the literature review in “Literature” section). In this paper, we show that if globalization lessens the cost of migrating between advanced countries, this leads to a progressivity–redistribution tradeoff and a social democracy curse. Globalization lessens the cost of migration through several channels. First, the adoption of English as lingua franca at the World level and the harmonization of living standards across countries have typically reduced the every day’s sacrifice of living abroad. Second, the international recognition of diplomas and skills allows the migrants from advanced countries to work abroad without reducing their incomes, particularly for the highest skills.Footnote 1 Third, the decrease in transportation costs and the expansion of financial globalization and international communications through the internet substantially lower the cost of moving to and living abroad. These developments began in the 1980s, and they have known a rapid and general extension in the 1990s and 2000s. In the model developed here, we assume that globalization results in a continuous decrease in the cost of migrating and living abroad. This reduces the between-country differences in income tax rates consistent with no-migration, and it is shown that this gap is lower and its reduction greater for the highest incomes. We subsequently introduce a government with a threefold goal, i.e. disposable income of the national residents, redistribution and tax progressivity. We then analyse the occurrence of setting progressive income tax schedules and the relation between redistribution and tax progressivity. We firstly show that the decrease in the cost of migrating and living abroad generates three stages in the taxation schedule. When this cost is above an endogenously determined first level, the policy maker can achieve its redistribution goal with a progressive income tax. Below this level but above a second cost threshold, the achievement of the redistribution goal requires a regressive-at-the-top tax structure. Below this second threshold, the policy maker cannot enforce his redistribution objective and the taxation schedules become volatile. We secondly show that the decrease in migration cost produces and magnifies a tradeoff between redistribution and progressivity. This makes redistribution and progressivity to become contradictory and generates thereby a social democracy curse. Second section exposes the stylized facts and the literature related to the subject. The third section builds the model framework in terms of taxation and migration. The fourth section presents the governments’ objectives, determines the equilibrium tax structures and reveals the model major findings. These findings are discussed and we conclude in the fifth section.",2

Its purpose was to overcome some of the shortcomings of the structural budget balance (SBB) calculation, which is an indicator based on a non-observable variable subject to frequent revisions. The EB was supposed to provide “more operational guidance to the Member States in the conduct of prudent fiscal policies, by focusing surveillance on indicators directly under the control of the government” (see the Communication from the European Commission COM (2020) 55 final, Box 1). The EB is a very specific implementation, in the context of the European Union (EU) framework for the supranational surveillance of the fiscal policies of Member States, of a more general fiscal rule that imposes a limit on aggregate expenditure of general government or subsets thereof. Over time the Commission has been making the case for a more prominent role for the EB in both the preventive and the corrective arm of the SGP.Footnote 1 More recently, several proposals to reform the economic governance of the euro area aim to give to the EB or to a more general expenditure rule an even stronger role in the rules-based European fiscal framework. The EB was added as an additional layer to the European fiscal rules framework, which comprised reference values for the general government deficit and gross public debt, a Medium Term Objective (MTO) for the structural budget balance (SBB), and a required adjustment path towards it. At the same time, it was also introduced a debt rule to operationalize the debt criteria of article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU known also simply as the Treaty). This set of rules is not entirely consistent.Footnote 2 As recognized by (European Commission 2020a), the fiscal framework “has grown excessively complex” and is “increasingly complex” (European Commission 2021). Darvas and Anderson (2020) go further and claim it suffers from “extreme complexity” while (Thygesen et al. 2020) refer to “an intractable set of rules and benchmarks”. The layers over layers of complexity were even compared to the Cathedral of Seville (Blanchard et al. 2020) and to the Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba by Gaspar (2020): complex constructions whose original structure is still recognizable, but where many successive additions leaves the consistency of the whole indecipherable. The complexity is the cost of pursuing multiple objectives (such as debt sustainability and economic short-term stabilization) with elements of flexibility and discretion (European Commission 2020a). Moreover, as this paper shows, the EB is per se a very complex indicator. The paper concludes that the current design of the EB is not fit to serve all purposes it was created for. Overall, the EB as is: (1) is not an operational indicator directly under the control of the government; (2) still relies on non-observable variables and on data inputs that are not readily available; (3) is not fully consistent with the structural budget balance by design; (4) the Commission has almost full discretion regarding the classification of Discretionary Revenue Measures that are netted-out from its calculation; (5) is very complex to calculate and to replicate, and thus not suitable to monitoring by national Independent Fiscal Institutions (IFIs) in real-time, being also very difficult to communicate to the public. This paper thus contributes to the current policy discussion on the usefulness of the EB for policy surveillance, making suggestions on how to improve its governance, simplifying the indicator and taking into account the creation of Independent Fiscal Institutions (IFIs) in the Member States, simultaneously improving its transparency and enforceability. This paper also adds to the literature on the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) the identification of internal inconsistencies in the EU fiscal framework, namely between the SBB and the EB, as well as a detailed assessment of the EB mechanics. The paper also adds to the literature on the reform proposals to the EU fiscal framework. Most of them are in favour of keeping debt sustainability as the main policy objective, while making use of an operational indicator in full control of the national Governments, usually in the form of an expenditure rule [see for instance (Carnot 2014; Claeys et al. 2016; Beetsma 2017; Bénassy-Quéré et al. 2018; Kopits 2018; Darvas et al. 2018; European Fiscal Board 2019, 2020a; Hauptmeier and Kamps 2020; Thygesen et al. 2020; Darvas and Anderson 2020; European Commission 2020a; EU Independent Fiscal Institutions 2021)]. This paper complements such literature arguing that the EB in its current form is not fit to be such operational rule, while providing several reform options on both its setup and governance. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section briefly reviews the role of an expenditure rule in the fiscal rules literature and in the EU fiscal framework. Section ""The Concept of the Expenditure Benchmark"" provides details on the calculation of the EB and how it relates with the SBB. Section ""Continued Reliance on Non-observables"" makes the point that the EB still relies on non-observable variables. Section ""The IFIs’ Role in the EB"" examines the role of national IFIs in the EB. Section ""Conclusions and Policy Recommendations"" concludes the paper and makes some policy recommendations to improve the EB design and governance.",3

A decade later, its consequences are still being studied and policy makers and economists are still analysing its dimensions. After the beginning of the crisis, financial markets faced a long period of uncertainty and high volatility, with almost all countries experiencing significant declines in GDP. In order to face the crisis, Central Banks (CB) around the world cut interest rates at a fast pace. However, it was not enough and a new chapter began for central bankers: the implementation of the unconventional monetary policy (UMP). Interest rates in Europe and the USA came close to 0%, and new measures were adopted in early 2008. Before 2007, only Japan had had relevant experience with very low interest rates; however, it was seen as an exception. The ECB adopted several measures, namely extraordinary overnight operations, liquidity agreement with CBs and additional Long-Term Refinancing Operations. However, the crisis was spreading faster, so the ECB had to be more incisive. In 2009, it launched the first Asset Purchase Programme (APP) and the Covered Bond Purchase Programme (CBPP), which were followed by new programmes focusing on different assets, including government and non-financial corporate bonds. Both fiscal and monetary authorities made every effort to avoid a deep and long recession. Their measures aimed at saving corporations from bankruptcy, saving jobs and avoiding the total disruption of the financial system. In this context, the full extent of the consequences of untested policies is not known and undesirable side effects might have taken place. Many scholars analysed such measures, and most of them agreed that unconventional measures were able to reduce long-term interest rates and avoid a major drop in GDP and a significant increase in unemployment. Besides that, UMP measures increased equity prices and inflation and stimulated credit granting. The main divergence between the authors concerned the magnitude and duration of its impacts. After the financial crisis, politicians and economists began to question the increase in inequality that occurred thereafter. The UMP measures adopted by several CBs around the world were mainly to blame. Due to the significant increase in money supply from APP programmes, some economists recovered the Cantillon effect (Bagchi et al. 2019), highlighting the unequal distribution of the “new money”, which distorts access to goods and services markets. In particular, the purchasing power of high-income households would increase before the low-income households, with consequences over income and wealth disparities, as noted in Piketty (2014). The economic environment is different from the one before 2008. Inflation in most European countries is very close to 0%. In some of them, GDP is below pre-crisis levels and in others the unemployment rate is still above 10%. Considering that high net worth individuals are getting even richer through financial markets, it raises the question of whether the UMP adopted by the ECB distorting wealth and income distribution deserves a deeper analysis to better assess the overall effects on inequalities. In our article, we explore the impact that monetary policy (MP) transmission channels have on income and wealth distribution. Our goal is to understand the role of MP on the income and wealth inequality dynamics and which variables are relevant to explain the increase in inequality on recent years. We explore the connection between MP and income and wealth inequality by resorting to a new dataset and developing a data panel for all Eurozone countries. In fact, the new proposed dataset and methodology regarding wealth disparities are the main contribution of our article. Due to the scarcity of data for wealth inequality, we developed an indicator that can give us interesting insights regarding the pace of wealth accumulation in a given region. Despite the possible criticisms of this new methodology suggested, we believe that this approach contributes to a coherent comparison to analyse the effects of MP on wealth inequalities. Despite the shortcomings of this methodology, we believe that it is an important step towards achieving more comparable data across economies and covering more periods with respect to wealth inequalities. Our article is structured as follows: Section two discusses the literature about MP and inequality and presents the main findings of the authors; section three describes the data and methodology used in our analysis; section four provides our main results and, lastly, section five presents our conclusions. We conclude that MP measures adopted by the ECB were able to eschew the increase in unemployment rates in the Euro Area. However, this effect may have had a greater weight in decreasing wealth and income inequality than in increasing asset prices, mainly equity, as did the same MP in increasing wealth and income inequality.",1

A Postmaterialism Value Approach,September 2021,Nicolae-Bogdan Ianc,Thierry Baudassé,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Tax revenues are higher, as a percentage of GDP, in developed countries compared to developing ones. An 18 percent tax-to-GDP ratio for developing countries, versus 37.9 percent tax-to-GDP ratios for developed countries during the period from 1995–1997, is displayed by Tanzi and Zee (2000). Direct taxation is characterized by the same trend like tax revenues as a whole, namely a lower tax base for developing countries, as Auriol and Warlters (2005) note. As result, direct taxation is differentiated between developed and developing countries. We can see in the lower chart (Fig. 1) that the values for direct tax revenues, as a percentage of GDP, vary significantly in selected countries. Direct taxation as a percentage of GDP. Source: World Bank (average from 1990 to 2020) Our aim in this paper is to emphasize that there is an important argument that is put forward to explain the variations shown in Fig. 1, called cultural diversity. Culture impacts several economic outcomes as well, as the literature shows (La Porta et al. 1997; Guiso et al. 2004, 2006). We consider panel data with a heterogeneous set of 46 countries, including both developed and developing ones, and we use culture, namely the degree of postmaterialism, that we present below, to explain the variation of direct tax revenues, as a percentage of GDP. Economists measure culture using data surveys (Alesina and Giuliano 2015). In our study, the relationship between cultural attitudes and direct taxation are considered using a cultural measurement tool based on survey questions. Within the World Values Survey,Footnote 1 there is a form called Materialist/Postmaterialist 12-item index, which is the most relevant in measuring the degree of postmaterialism, according to its questions’ design. A country whose citizens care more about non-materialistic values, such as improving environmental protection, self-expression, quality of life, freedom of speech, or social equity is a postmaterialist country (Inglehart 1971, 1977; Inglehart and Welzel 2005). The “postmaterialism” question was first raised by Ronald F. Inglehart.Footnote 2 The tax burden is therefore less important for citizens in postmaterialist countries, and a higher ratio of tax revenues to GDP is then justified. Figure 2 illustrates each country’s score on the postmaterialism scale. We use Sweden such as benchmark,Footnote 3 so it corresponds to a level of zero, and lower values mean moderation in postmaterialism. Materialist/Postmaterialist 12-item index. Source: World Values Survey (average values for six waves from 1990 to 2020). Note: The actual values are deflated by the benchmark’s (Sweden) score of 2.59 Our paper contributes to the literature through the following aspects. Primarily, we use the most recent data set regarding the culture dimension, namely the Wave 7: 2017–2020,Footnote 4 launched by Haerpfer et al. (2020). Our work is, as far as we know, the first study which uses this newest wave for measuring the culture dimension concerning public policies. Second, we work with the Materialist/Postmaterialist 12-item index, which is not common in widely-available literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper which employs this index to account for cultural variety with respect to taxation, and we choose it because of its comprehensiveness. Several works use the Post-materialist 4-item index form,Footnote 5 which presents four questions where two of them are related to materialist fundamentals, and the other two are relying on postmaterialist perception. For instance, Koenig and Wagener (2012) propose the usage of the 4-item index to illustrate that values and norms in OECD countries predict the tax structure. The 4-item index is employed within selected countries by Jordaan et al. (2016),Footnote 6 who notice that postmaterialism has a positive relationship with stock markets. But Inglehart (1977) admits that the use of the 4-item index exhibits serious weakness (for measuring cultural attitudes) and it is sensitive to short-term forces.Footnote 7 The author confirms that the newly built items within this index are more stable and robust, and they exhibit a better vision of people’s goals. A third contribution is that our work concerns the impact of cultural attitudes on total direct taxation, as a share of GDP, in contrast with Koenig and Wagener (2012). Their analysis performs the tax structure, namely the corporate to personal tax revenues ratio. A distinction between our paper and that of Cábelková and Strielkowski (2013) is that the latter use total tax revenues as a percentage of GDP and perform a modeling adopting the Hofstede’s cultural dimension (we describe below), in apparent contrast with our postmaterialist model approach. We follow a different approach and open up new research avenues regarding the closest works to ours (Koenig and Wagener 2012; Cábelková and Strielkowski 2013; Jordaan et al. 2016). In our research, we employ the latest postmaterialist index within a higher number of selected countries (46) and our dataset covers a more recent period. Our results show that values and beliefs, namely the idea of postmaterialism, point out the difference between direct tax revenues in selected countries. More precisely, our results demonstrate that higher direct taxation, as a percentage of GDP, is found in countries where the tendency toward postmaterialism is increasing. Moreover, we add to our study variables such as tax on personal income, tax structure (i.e., direct to indirect ratio) and energy taxes. The results obtained hold; namely, our robustness analysis is reliable. This paper is organized as follows. “Literature” section presents the Literature, “Methodology” section illustrates the Research Methodology, while ”Data” section describes the Data. “Empirical Results” section displays the Results, and Sect. Robustness Check” section presents the Robustness Analysis. “Conclusion” section Concludes.",2

This paper examines the evolution of Central Asia’s five national economies since 1991. The 1990s were dominated by nation-building and the transition from central planning. Despite initial similarities, the five countries created diverse market-based economies, ranging from possibly the most to the least radical reforms of all fifteen Soviet successor states. By 2000, the transition from central planning was essentially complete and the varieties of market-based economies have changed little in the 21st. century. Political systems, established in the 1990s around a general pattern of strong presidencies, also changed little, apart from in Kyrgyzstan. Between 1999 and 2014, national economic fortunes were largely shaped by the resource boom. While the transitional recession of the 1990s had been more difficult than many expected, economic performance over the next fifteen years generally exceeded expectations. Since 2014, after the end of the boom, governments claim to recognize the need for economic diversification. To re-orient Central Asia from dependence on primary product exports and remittances to more diversified outward-oriented economies, domestic change will be necessary. This paper assesses the pressures for economic reform and the forces resistant to change. The economic background is the types of market-based economies created in the 1990s (""Economic Background"" section) and the related wealth structure (""Political Economy"" section). The political context for reform in the 2020s includes autocratic non-democracies and generational change in leadership. Whereas the initial presidents had spent their entire lives in the planned economy, the presidents in 2021 have spent most of their adult lives in the post-independence market-based economies (""Pressures for Economic Reform and the Forces Resistant to Change"" section). The economic context includes an improved infrastructure for overland trade across Eurasia (""A Window of Economic Opportunity?"" section), as well as an uncertain global trading system and consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic. Taking advantage of the Presidential Address format, in the first section I review the economic history of the Central Asian countries since independence through the lens of my own research and publications on the region. The most striking feature has been creation of sustainable national economies. The challenge of the 2020s will be to ensure that the economies have sufficient economic dynamism to provide for rising living standards and other goals. In the 2020s, there is a window of opportunity as previous challenges of landlockedness have been alleviated by improved transport infrastructure. Successful economies will improve their chances of taking advantage of the window of opportunity by reinvigorating economic reforms. A key question is whether generational shift in Central Asian leadership and in the population at large will create a fertile environment for political and economic reform, or whether established elites will maintain nondemocratic political systems and resist economic reform.",5
63,4,Comparative Economic Studies,29 October 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-021-00169-w,Mortality in Russia Since the Fall of the Soviet Union,December 2021,Elizabeth Brainerd,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Extraordinary changes in mortality marked the first three decades after the fall of the Soviet Union. The post-Soviet period began in 1991 with a historic crisis of prime-age mortality in Russia, and ended with more than a decade of rapid and striking improvements in adult mortality. Similar changes occurred across most former Soviet republics over this period. Research on the mortality crisis and its reversal has identified a number of key factors in these changes, but the underlying causes remain at best partially understood. Yet deciphering the causes of these erratic swings in mortality remains an essential research and policy task. A better understanding of the impact of the collapse of the Soviet Union on health and well-being would provide insights into how to best mitigate the mortality impact of economic crisis in other countries. Discerning the causes of the remarkable improvement in mortality in recent years, and the role of government policy in promoting these improvements, surely holds lessons that would be beneficial for many countries. This paper provides an overview of mortality change in Russia over the last 30 years. The mortality history of the period, although well known, is briefly described. This is followed by a selective review of the literature in economics and public health that has attempted to identify the causes of the mortality crisis of the early 1990s. The remainder of the paper focuses on the mortality reversal that has occurred since 2005, and the possible reasons for this change. The anti-alcohol policies and tobacco control policies of the Russian government play an important role in this discussion, and the evidence to date on the effectiveness of these policies in reducing mortality is evaluated. Several empirical tests of the impact of anti-alcohol policies on mortality are conducted, and provide suggestive evidence of an impact of these policies on reduced male deaths due to external causes. A central theme running throughout the paper is that government policy has played a critical role in Russian mortality trends: government policy contributed to the early mortality crisis, and government policy has facilitated the remarkable mortality improvements of recent years. A second theme is that much remains unknown about the underlying causes of both the mortality crisis and the mortality reversal of recent years, leaving scope for important future research into these questions.",3
63,4,Comparative Economic Studies,12 November 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-021-00174-z,"Civil War, Famine and the Persistence of Human Capital: Evidence from Tajikistan",December 2021,Louise Grogan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"This paper examines the legacy of a Soviet era human capital advantage amongst residents of the least-fertile and most-isolated corner of the former empire, Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO). GBAO is one of five regions of Tajikistan, the only Soviet republic to experience civil war immediately following the Soviet collapse. Data from the 1999 Living Standards Monitoring Study (LSMS), Tajikistan 2012 and 2017 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the 2005–6 Tajikistan Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) are employed. Difference-in-difference (DD) estimation is used to examine the relative impacts of the Soviet collapse on adult stature and educational attainment of women in GBAO and Khatlon, the other southern border region of the country. The Khatlon region is the ancestral home of the Kulyabi clans which eventually prevailed in the war against fighters from GBAO (Kilavuz 2009). The results suggest that households in GBAO continue to invest strongly in early childhood human capital, even conditional on mother’s educational attainment and household wealth. These greater investments are consistent with the lack of agricultural employment opportunities in GBAO and the resulting need to obtain a broader range of skills. An original Bolshevik aim had been to achieve similar levels of socioeconomic development throughout the Soviet Union (Antonenko 1983; Nourzhanov and Bleuer 2013). The rapid industrialisation outlined in Stalin’s second 5-year plan necessitated the provision of cheap food for the millions of people who were to leave the countryside for jobs in cities across the country. Food distribution and pricing policies were set to favour city-dwellers (Johnson 1985). Strategically important regions were also favoured with an extensive system of subsidies (see, for example, Bahry and Walsh 1987). Enhanced food and consumer goods availability, known as “Moscow provisions” (moskovskoe obespechenie), were advertised as a means of attracting the high-skilled labour necessary to isolated regions. Those working in harsh and remote environments such as GBAO, the Far East and Far North were also given salary bonuses (nadbavki), holidays and lower official retirement ages. Access to scarce products could thus be greater in isolated cities such as Khorog, the capital of GBAO, than in the Russian cities where the goods had been manufactured (see, for example, Bliss 2006; Middleton 2016). Despite these huge Soviet investments in infrastructure and human capital, GBAO remained overwhelmingly rural throughout the Soviet period. The collapse of the Soviet Union and ensuing 1992–96 Tajik civil war instantaneously ended huge economic subsidies to Tajikistan (Scarborough 2018). These subsidies have been estimated to have been the equivalent of half of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Republic (see, for example Stucker (2009, p. 241) and Strayer (2016, p. 163). Large increases in food prices occurred. Fighting and food shortages were experienced in key cities across Tajikistan, including Dushanbe and Kurgan-Teppe, the capital of Khatlon, during the war. In Khorog, Garm, Dushanbe and Khujand food shortages resulted in riots in which people were killed by security forces. The collapse of health services led to several outbreaks of typhoid (Mermin et al. 1999). The collapse of the Soviet Union left Tajikistan with a much larger population than could be supported by the land. Mountains cover 93% of the land, more than half of which lies at elevations above 3000 metres (Water for Sustainable Development 2018). The total fertility rate (TFR), the number of children a woman might expect to bear in her lifetime declined from about 7.0 to 5.0 in Tajikistan between 1970 and 1992, but remained the highest amongst Soviet republics (World Bank 2019c). In GBAO, land is less suitable for growing crops or herding than in other regions of Tajikistan. Under heavy Soviet subsidies, the population of GBAO had expanded from about 40 000 to 167 000 between 1937 and late 1990 (Buškov and Kalandarov 2003). Eastern GBAO is home to a majority of the estimated 0.8% of Tajikistanis who are of ethnic Kyrgyz origin (Statistical Agency Tajikistan of Tajikistan 2010). The high elevation of much of GBAO also precludes fruit and rice production and sheep herding. Yaks are kept for milk and meat in Murghab, but in quantities insufficient to provide food security (Epkenhans 2016). In the late Soviet period, only about 10–20% of food requirements in GBAO had been met locally (Bliss 2006). From December 1992 to September 1993, almost no food or fuel reached GBAO, due to a blockade of the Pamir Highway (see, for example, Tadjbakhsh 1994; Jawad and Tadjbakhsh 1995; Babu Suresh and Tashmatov 2000; Middleton 2019). Famine conditions prevailed. Residents of the main city of GBAO, Khorog, and other large towns did not possess land and were not eligible for collective farm (sovkhoz) rations. The lack of fuel meant that wheat combine machines could not be used. A sudden lack of sugar, salt and vinegar in the region had left no means of preserving food for winter. Almost no meat or powdered milk was available for seven months. Only food aid from the Aga Khan Foundation prevented mass starvation in 1993 (Bliss 2006). A disastrous harvest in GBAO in 1995 further undermined food security. This absolute lack of food supply distinguishes the famine situation in GBAO from the Bengal famine of 1943, the Ethiopian famine in Wollo in 1973, and the Bangladesh famine in 1974, as described in Sen (1981). The combination of Soviet development policies with the pre-existing highland realities had resulted in cultural and economic differences between GBAO residents and other Tajik peoples by 1991. Both educational attainment and outmigration rates were higher from GBAO than from other areas of Tajikistan in the Soviet period (Nourzhanov and Bleuer 2013). Today those born in GBAO may identify themselves foremost as Pamiri, even when resident outside of Tajikistan and carrying Tajik passports (Dagiev and Faucher 2018; Jonboboev 2018). There are other potential several reasons for this, including memories of the civil war, the adherence of GBAO residents to the Ismaili faith and their knowledge that a large part of the local economy is now facilitated by the Aga Khan, but neglected by central government in Dushanbe (see, for example, Beeman 1999; Peyrouse 2012; Kuhistoni 2014). The other southern border region, Khatlon, was a key producer of cotton (“white gold”) for the Soviet textile industry. Land is much more arable and fertile than in GBAO. In the late Soviet period, nearly the entire adult population of Khatlon had engaged in weeding, watering and manual harvesting of cotton on collective farms. Ownership of these farms changed with decollectivisation, but the importance of cotton monoculture has diminished only more slowly. After independence, medium-sized Dehkan farms were created and leased to former employees of collective farms. In addition to these allotments, farmers generally maintain small-scale household vegetable gardens and domesticated farm animals, as in Soviet times. Wheat, rice, vegetables and fruits are produced. Because Tajik farmers are now free to choose what to farm, their ability to ensure food security may have improved. The Tajik government and local cotton ginners previously exerted substantial coercive power over planting, and controlled prices that farmers would receive (Eurasianet 2019). Some farmers continue to choose cotton. As in Soviet times, school children, doctors, teachers and university students are sent to harvest cotton (hashar) every October. Remuneration is often partly in the form of cotton stalks, which can be burnt for heat in winter, or traded for foodstuffs produced locally (see, for example, Kassam 2011; Boboyorov 2011; Swinkels 2014). Migrant remittances from seasonal work of men in Russia are now very important to family incomes across Tajikistan. Perhaps one-third of the adult population of the country engages in seasonal labour migration (see, for example, Olimova and Olimov 2007). In 2019, 29% of GDP was derived from this source (World Bank 2019b). A majority of migrants are men working in the construction sector in cities across Russia. Russian language skills and education are not required for this type of work. Large numbers of farmers and their male children have migrated rather than engage in domestic cotton production with only subsistence returns. Anecdotal evidence suggests that villages in Khatlon and other cotton-growing regions are devoid of working-age males because of the much greater potential salaries in Russia (Zarindast 2012; Luxmoore 2019). Migration is also associated with a large increase in the number of divorces (Demytrie 2012). Privileged access to goods and services had previously attracted ethnic Russians to live in GBAO urban centres such as Khorog and Murghab, and to work in teaching or healthcare across the Tajik SSR. Many skilled jobs had been filled by Russian nationals. Tajik students who performed particularly well in high school examinations had received funding to study in universities across the Soviet Union. As of 2012, the year of the first Tajikistan DHS, a majority of ethnic Russians had long left GBAO and Tajikistan. These skilled workers generally left for Russia in the early months of the Tajik civil war. Russian military airlifts were organized from Dushanbe. Many of those fleeing had filled high-skilled positions in administration, health and education in the late Soviet era. Although Russian workers had never constituted the majority of the Tajik or GBAO population, their departure substantially lowered population skill levels. Many skilled Tajik nationals also emigrated with their families to Russia permanently during and after the civil war. Permanent migrants from Badakhshan, as from Tajikistan as a whole, were relatively skilled. Those who remained were, on average, less skilled than those who emigrated. The paper proceeds as follows. “Data and Summary Statistics” section comprises a comparison of human capital in GBAO and Khatlon, by birth cohort. The recent history of the southern border regions of Tajikistan is discussed in more detail in Appendix A. “Adult Height and Years of Schooling” section presents difference-in-difference analysis of the impact of the Soviet collapse on relative adult stature and educational attainment of women in GBAO. Differences in contemporary early childhood educational investments across GBAO and Khatlon are then quantified. “Estimation” concludes.",

From the Baltic countries to Central Asia and the Far East, the socialist era bequeathed its collective and state farms to the newly independent states. In the decades to follow, policymakers, analysts as well as farm managers and rural workers would struggle with restructuring the former collectives into alternative farming models considered fit for the envisaged market economy. Before its ultimate demise, Soviet agriculture provided income to more than one quarter of the workforce, much more than in Western market economies (Lerman et al. 2004, p. 14). Widely considered as overstaffed, inefficient and import-dependent, the post-Soviet food economy also drew on vast resources of crop and pasture land, thus alluring investors with an eye on rising domestic demand and export opportunities. Land privatization and the creation of land sales and rental markets emerged as contentious political issues (Pryor 1992). Many Western economists considered the family farm, such as portrayed in Kislev and Peterson (1982), as the natural benchmark for reform. Based on the perceived superiority of family-led operations with regard to technical, allocative and innovative efficiency, international advisors recommended to split up (“individualize”) the former collectives into private family farms, to thus return control and ownership rights to producers, improve their incentives to elicit more effort and reduce the operational size of farming units (World Bank 1992, pp. 69–77; Lerman et al. 2004, pp. 49–51). In the years to come, highly varying privatization and reform policies across the region turned the set of post-socialist countries into a laboratory of farm restructuring. After the first transition decade, Swinnen and Rozelle (2006) documented how land restitution, the rise of land rental and the recapitalization of large farms had spurred notable productivity growth in Central and Eastern European agriculture. They observed even stronger growth in East Asia, where the property rights reform of the Household Responsibility System in China alone had created millions of family farms.
 Compared to these two groups of countries, the reform results in the Soviet successors known as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) were dismal. In the land-abundant European and most of the Central Asian CIS countries, little restructuring had taken place, substantial property rights reforms had failed to materialize, and both output and productivity indicators had plummeted into an ever deeper trough. Rural public opinion often favored the continuation of large-scale farming, thus challenging Western reform templates. Where political conditions allowed open discourse, such as in Russia, political representatives and national experts disagreed strongly on the desirable restructuring model, often leading to reform resistance and political stalemate (Van Atta 1993; Wegren 2005, pp. 52–59). Against this background, my aim here is to take stock of farm individualization, land reform and productivity dynamics in post-Soviet agriculture another two decades later. I organize the analysis around the guiding hypothesis—articulated by the international mainstream of experts—that strong property rights and the full individualization of farming are the key drivers of productivity increases in the former Soviet countries. I thus ask, in their second and third decade of transition, did these countries manage to emulate what Central Europe and East Asia accomplished in their first reform decade, as Swinnen and Rozelle conjectured (2006, p. 184)? How did farm restructuring progress and which role did it play in productivity growth? Which long-run development trajectories of agricultural sector evolution emerged? How should we qualify the initial expectations about farm individualization and the role of family farms? In the following empirical analysis, I examine agricultural input and output indicators at the country level published by international agencies, as well as updated national statistics on farm restructuring that are not available in the English-speaking literature to date. While a more in-depth and micro-level empirical analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, I refer to recent research findings in the literature using more advanced methodology and fine-grained data wherever suitable. Challenging the view that all countries will ultimately evolve toward a fully individualized farming sector, I argue that, over the past two decades, the bulk of the post-Soviet countries separated into two different reform paths in agriculture. One cluster includes the European CIS countries and Kazakhstan, in which corporate and family farms coexist, labor flowed into other sectors, and capital inflow boosted labor productivity. I call this the “Westernization” of post-Soviet agriculture, as it resembles the structural change observed in many Western countries (such as the US, Sumner 2014). The other cluster comprises the Transcaucasian and the remaining  Central Asian countries, in which almost complete farm individualization coincided with substantial growth of the agricultural labor force. Productivity increases from individualization thus did not contribute much to rising labor productivity, in turn keeping rural incomes depressed and perpetuating pockets of poverty in the region. I call this process the “Southernization” of agriculture, alluding to patterns of agricultural overemployment observed in the Global South (Gollin et al. 2014). I critically examine the definition of “individual farming” in the post-Soviet reform discourse and link it to a recent strand of literature reasoning that small farms typically do not fulfil the income expectations of would-be middle-class families (Adamopoulos and Restuccia 2014; Gollin 2018). In contrast to much of the literature on post-Soviet farm restructuring but in line with this more recent strand, I conclude that given the yardstick of labor productivity, the individual family farm turned out to be a questionable reform template. Based on a review of the literature on restructuring outcomes in the region, I highlight areas for further research. In the following, I start with summarizing the expectations voiced by international experts at the outset of post-Soviet farm restructuring. After a section introducing my metrics and data, I examine the output and productivity trends as well as the individualization and land reform outcomes. I present figures on country aggregates and review a range of more in-depth studies from the literature. After a discussion of the major drivers and barriers in the reform process, I conclude with an overall evaluation of the restructuring experience.",2

During the period 1997–2002, Mongolia underwent significant structural reforms. To enhance and strengthen its trade relationships, Mongolia became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997 and applied for the Generalized Systems of Preferences (GSP) of several large economies.Footnote 1 As a result, in 2008, Mongolia was a beneficiary of preferential schemes of Japan, the USA, the EU and Canada.Footnote 2 Mongolia also took a set of measures during the period. For example, agricultural reforms—privatization and price deregulation—caused substantial adjustment from crops reliant on state support to cashmere and other livestock activities.Footnote 3 Thus, the composition of Mongolia’s trade most likely drastically changed during this transition period. In fact, recent theoretical models (e.g., Melitz 2003; Yi 2003; Arkolakis 2010) predict that significant structural changes and trade liberalization have an effect on the extensive margin of trade.Footnote 4 Changes in the extensive margin of trade are changes in the variety of traded goods driven by countries starting to trade goods that they had not traded before. Changes in the intensive margin of trade, on the other hand, are changes in trade volumes of goods that were previously traded. This raises the empirical question: Has the extensive margin of trade actually changed in response to structural reforms or trade liberalization in the transition economy of Mongolia? Answering this question would be interesting especially for the Central Asian transition economies such as Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan that still have an observer status in the WTO as well as other small economies that still have trade barriers. This paper uses the Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) methodology to answer this empirical question. Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) have proposed a methodology for measuring changes in the extensive margin of trade. They measure the growth in the extensive margin by the growth in the least traded (LT) goods. They classify the set of goods, which accounts for only 10% of trade, as the LT goods. Growth in the LT goods indicates that a country started exporting (importing) goods that it had not exported (imported) before or had exported (imported) only in small quantities, indicating that the variety of exports (imports) increased in this country.Footnote 5 The main reason why we choose the Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) methodology is that, as will be mentioned later, their methodology could avoid the possible overstatement of the extensive margin growth for Mongolia with small trade relationships by defining non-traded goods—the LT goods—taking into account the relative importance of goods in a country’s trade. Applying their methodology, we find large increases in the extensive margin of Mongolia’s trade with 10 major trade partners during the period 1997–2002, when Mongolia was undergoing significant structural reforms. We also find further increases in the extensive margin for Mongolia–China and Mongolia–the main EU trade partners (Germany, the UK and Italy) after trade liberalizations due to China’s accession to the WTO (2001) and Mongolia’s becoming eligible for the EU GSP+ scheme (2005), respectively.Footnote 6 We, however, find no or relatively small further increases in the extensive margin for the Mongolia–Russia pair during the period 2002–2007, when there was no major change in the trade regime of these two countries. The results support the Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) hypothesis that the extensive margin growth is driven by trade liberalization or structural change but not by the usual turbulence of business cycles. The results are also compatible with those of Helpman et al. (2008). Estimating a gravity equation, they show that the effect of the extensive margin of trade varies across country pairs according to the characteristics of trade partners. Of course, there are other studies that also apply the Kehoe and Ruhl methodology to measure the extensive margin of trade, as does our paper. Mukerji (2009) studies the liberalization of trade in India in the 1990s. Sandrey and van Seventer (2004) study the liberalization of trade brought about by the Closer Economic Relationship agreement between Australia and New Zealand starting in 1988. Dalton (2014) studies the change in the extensive margin of trade between Japan and China after China’s entry into the WTO in 2001. Dalton (2017) studies the change in the extensive margin of trade between Austria and the ten new entrants to the EU in 2004, and relatedly, del Rosal (2019) documents the role of the extensive margin in trade growth for the new EU member states that acceded the EU in 2004 and 2007. Cho and Díaz (2018b) analyze the role of the extensive margin in the Baltic countries’ trade growth between 1995 and 2008. Cho et al. (2018) analyze the changes in the extensive margin of bilateral trade following the FTAs signed by Korea between 2004 and 2008. As does our paper, all of these studies show that extensive margin growth coincides with trade liberalization. Kehoe et al. (2015) go further and develop a methodology based on that of Kehoe and Ruhl’s (2013) to analyze the role of the LT products in export growth of each industry—a collection of products—in the context of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). There are also many studies that have determined the importance of the extensive margin using methodologies other than the methodology by Kehoe and Ruhl (2013).Footnote 7 Evenett and Venables (2002), for example, find that one-third of the increase in exports of developing countries between 1970 and 1997 can be explained by the extensive margin growth. Kang (2004) shows that the extensive margin played a more important role in export growth than did the intensive margin in Korea and Taiwan. Hummels and Klenow (2005) investigate cross-country differences in trade and find that the extensive margin accounts for 60% of the increased exports of larger economies. Studying the growing varieties of US imports from 1972 to 2001, Broda and Weinstein (2006) find that ignoring the increase in varieties leads to an overstatement of inflation by 1.2 percentage points per year, which is equivalent to an extra 2.6% increase in the GDP during the period. Felbermayr and Kohler (2006) find that the extensive margin was more important in the world trade growth between 1950 and 1970 and again in the mid-1990s, while the intensive margin was more important during the intervening period. Besedes and Prusa (2011) examine and compare the developed and developing countries based on their extensive and intensive export margins. In this line of literature, our paper makes the following contributions. First, the methodology by Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) for measuring the extensive margin has been applied to developed countries or economically large developing countries with large trade relationships. Our paper now applies the methodology to the transition economy of Mongolia, which is an economically small developing country with small trade relationships. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to apply the Kehoe and Ruhl methodology to Mongolia. In fact, it is the first to provide a comprehensive analysis of the extensive margin of Mongolia’s trade. Secondly, our paper provides a more detailed analysis of the extensive margin growth than that of Kehoe and Ruhl’s (2013). The LT goods may incorporate some traded goods in small trade relationships, and thus, the extensive margin growth, measured by the LT goods growth, may come from the growth of these goods. Hence, by decomposing the LT goods into three parts—zero traded, minimally traded and relatively traded goods—we check whether the extensive margin growth in Mongolia, measured by the LT goods growth, is actually a consequence of the increases in the trade volumes of previously zero or minimally traded goods. We also determine types of goods that contributed to the extensive margin growth. In particular, we find that mineral resources and resources coming from livestock herding contributed most to the increase in the extensive margin of Mongolia’s exports across country pairs. Thirdly, our robustness checks support Kehoe and Ruhl’s (2013) prediction that country-invariant methodologies (Evenett and Venables 2002; Hummels and Klenow 2005; Broda and Weinstein 2006) overestimate the extensive margin growth for countries with small trade relationships.Footnote 8 In fact, our results show that the extensive margin growth measured by using country-invariant methodologies is much higher than that measured by using the Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) country-variant methodology. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. “Data and Methodology” section presents the Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) methodology that we apply in our analysis of the extensive margin. In “Extensive Margin Growth” section, we show the extensive margin growth results for the three episodes—structural change episodes, trade liberalization episodes and business cycle episodes—in the case of Mongolia with its main trading partners. In “Robustness Check: Decomposing Trade Growth” section, we present the robustness check, that is, the decomposition of the trade growth consistent with the Hummels and Klenow (2005) methodology.Footnote 9 “Conclusion” section concludes the paper and mentions future work.",2

David Brown,Emin Dinlersoz,John S. Earle,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Although popular opinion has judged the post-communist “transition” in Eastern Europe to be finished and done with, or at least no longer fashionable to discuss, there is still potential to learn from the drastic changes and diverse experiences of the countries in the region. In terms of all the major categories of policies—stabilization, liberalization, privatization, institution-building—the countries took very different paths, and they experienced very different consequences. The magnitudes of the reforms and the changes in the economy as faced by consumers, workers, firms, and at the macro-level dwarf the typical natural and quasi-experiments studied in most economic research. Thinking about the transition greatly influenced research outside the directly affected region. The transition episode remains the largest economic experiment of our time. One area in which further research could be fruitful is productivity differences across firms. Recent research examining business-level data has documented a robust regularity of substantial productivity dispersion even within narrowly defined industries (Bartelsman and Doms 2000; Syverson 2011). In an early study, for instance, Syverson (2004) reports productivity at the 75th percentile nearly double that at the 25th percentile for labor productivity and about 50 percent higher for total factor productivity within four-digit manufacturing industries in the US. Findings such as these pose puzzles for economists, though they may be less surprising to non-economists who have not been weaned on models of representative agents and frictionless competition. One source of the puzzlement is the apparent inefficiency of productivity dispersion. If the same technology is available to all producers, then improving the productivity of poor performers can raise aggregate output. But what prevents productivity equalization? One way to explain persistent dispersion is through the presence of idiosyncratic taxes on output or inputs that change the marginal conditions in different ways for different participants. For instance, a firm facing a higher output tax will ceteris paribus produce less than one facing a lower output tax. Unifying tax rates would eliminate this source of distortion in production decisions, and market reforms that “level the playing field” can thus raise aggregate output. Restuccia and Rogerson (2008) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009) develop models of these “static distortions,” and the latter provide empirical estimates of the aggregate gains in total factor productivity that could be obtained from equalizing productivity within industries for China, India and the US.Footnote 1 The potential gains they claim are astonishingly (incredibly) large: as high as 43 percent for the US and up to 127 percent in India and 115 percent in China. A different set of factors influencing productivity dispersion, which we focus on in this paper, is analyzed in models of industry dynamics going back to Jovanovic (1982), Hopenhayn (1992), and Ericson and Pakes (1995). These factors comprise various types of reallocation frictions, including sunk costs of entry, fixed costs of operating, and costs of investment with stochastic outcomes. The magnitudes of these costs are partially a function of technological considerations, but they are also affected by policies that change entry barriers, bankruptcy costs, bailout possibilities, and access to finance. Our theoretical model shows that by contrast with the static distortions, policies to reduce such frictions need not decrease productivity dispersion. Indeed, they may result in higher levels of dispersion, especially in the short run. The reason is that while lower frictions tend to strengthen selection mechanisms by raising the threshold productivity for firm survival, they also encourage experimentation that raises dispersion. One type of experimentation is entry, when an entrepreneur receives a draw from a productivity distribution, as in Jovanovic (1982) and Hopenhayn (1992). A second type is investing in or restructuring an incumbent firm, involving a draw from another distribution, one with a higher mean than the firm’s pre-investment productivity but also with a non-trivial variance and a range including reduced productivity. For each type of reallocation friction, our model shows that reducing the friction may raise experimentation. The result of the reduced friction is a new productivity distribution, potentially one with increased dispersion.Footnote 2 Our empirical analysis uses firm-level data to provide evidence of the effects of reducing reallocation frictions in some wide-ranging settings. First, we consider the US telecommunications equipment sector, which was gradually deregulated between the late 1960s and early 1980s. Our analysis builds on Olley and Pakes’ (1996) study of this sector, but they do not examine productivity dispersion, which is our focus here. Second, we analyze the evolution of productivity dispersion in six economies undergoing a transition from central planning to some form of liberalized market economy, but with widely varying paces of reform. Using US productivity dispersion as a benchmark, as in Hsieh and Klenow (2009), we track productivity dispersion in the manufacturing sectors back into the planning period, and as they liberalize, some of them very quickly (with a “big bang” of reforms) and others more slowly (the “gradualists”). In each of these cases, the evidence suggests that deregulation and other reforms tend to raise, rather than to reduce, productivity dispersion. Dispersion rises throughout the deregulation of telecommunications equipment manufacturing in the US. Remarkably, our calculations of productivity dispersion in Soviet Russia, Soviet Ukraine, and Hungary under central planning are very similar to those for the US. In all the transition economies, dispersion rises with reforms, and it rises faster the quicker the reform process proceeds. Regression analysis shows that the extent of reform (as measured by an index from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development) positively predicts productivity dispersion, and that productivity dispersion is associated with subsequent growth in aggregate productivity. These findings do not exclude an important role for selection mechanisms in truncating the left tail of the productivity distribution, but they suggest a perhaps dominant role for experimentation in widening or thickening both tails. Some caveats are in order. Our theoretical model implies that overall productivity dispersion may either rise or fall in response to policies that reduce reallocation frictions, although it does predict that dispersion rises among new entrants to the industry when entry frictions fall. The model also includes idiosyncratic taxation, which if reduced would by itself have the effect of lowering dispersion, as already shown by Restuccia and Rogerson (2008) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009). Most economic reforms, such as deregulation and liberalization, have effects on frictions as well as on static distortions. Indeed, the purposes of many reform programs are expressed in terms of reducing entry barriers, hardening budget constraints, and increasing access to capital—implying that studies of productivity dispersion may benefit from taking such frictions into account. Our model is also very simple in assuming price-taking behavior, but rather than investigating more complicated market environments our point is only to demonstrate the possibility of different changes in productivity dispersion resulting from reduced frictions. A major caveat about our data is that, like most data sets, ours permits us to measure only revenue—not quantity—based total factor productivity (but see Foster et al. 2008). This implies that we cannot distinguish changes in pricing or markup behavior from changes in technical efficiency, which would be a particular problem if we were trying to measure potential aggregate efficiency gains from reduced dispersion. Our broader point, however, is that higher dispersion may reflect greater experimentation and therefore higher future growth, so that productivity dispersion need not measure misallocation. The next section provides our theoretical analysis, “Empirical Analysis” section describes the data, and “Conclusion” section lays out the empirical results. Section 5 provides a brief conclusion. Proofs of theoretical propositions are contained in an Appendix.",

Very long run analysis including the 1930s and 1940s must use personal income as the dependent variable as a continuous state-level Gross Domestic Product series (hereafter “GSP) begins only just after Alaska and Hawaii became states in 1963. Much of the early literature is summarized in Yamarik’s (2006) study of long-run state personal income convergence 1950-2000 with his call for more convergence analysis of individual regions once more data become available an impetus for this study. The consensus is that states converged in the twentieth century, but slowed down in the 21st perhaps reaching a steady state around the turn of the century that would make additional high convergence impossible (Partridge, 2005). The very long run convergence is much greater than cross-country convergence over the same period (Turner et al., 2013). Until very recently, cross-state spillovers were rarely accounted for within the models (Blanco and Ram, 2019) which we now do. New work is also needed to see if the convergence continued especially with the shock of the Great Recession, political polarization of the nation (e.g., Heckelman and Dinan, 2013) illustrated in the 2016 election, and questioning of the advantages of relative backwardness in eliminating poverty (Ravallion, 2012) unlike an earlier era when late twentieth-century inequality was seen as a net positive economic “good” (Welch, 1999). In addition to examining long-run overall and Census region economic growth, we show the contribution of factors of production at both levels of aggregation after finding and filtering out significant spatial autocorrelation. Prior system-GMM analysis often left out an explicit measure of human capital and/or ignored spatial issues. Further, most prior analysis could not take advantage of recent improvements in regional macro data that address some of the concerns about macroeconomic production functions using constant price data only instead of chain-linked series (Felipe and McCombie, 2012; Ram, 2021). More regional level data also allow sensitivity tests for the normality of residuals and whether the instruments are correctly specified. We focus on β-convergence at the national and Census region levels with sigma convergence and more detailed state by state convergence beyond the scope of this paper.

Palmer,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Over the past decade, Chinese enterprises have made significant progress in developing new business ventures in Africa. The Chinese government launched the “Going Global Strategy” in 1999, encouraging Chinese enterprises to develop their global strategies and ventures abroad, including expanding into Africa. Later in 2013, China introduced the Belt and Road Initiative, demonstrating China’s growing international influence through an infrastructure development strategy that promotes a regional and global network (Huang 2016). From 2003 to 2019, official overseas foreign direct investment flow from China to Africa increased from USD $75 million to USD $2.7 billion.Footnote 1 Chinese investments in Africa have not only increased tremendously in size, but also diversified from concentration in the mining sector toward construction, manufacturing, financial services, and information and communications technology (Bashir 2015). For the construction sector, Chinese construction projects in Africa have increased in complexity, including the building of a mini-city on the outskirts of Johannesburg; diversity, including ports, airports, stadiums, malls, public buildings, and renewable energy projects; as well as the number of countries served across the continent. The market share of Chinese enterprises in Africa’s construction market increased sharply form 9.9% in 2002 to 40.1% in 2011, and has since remained stable (Huang and Chen 2016). As shown in Fig. 1, by the end of 2016, the construction sector had attracted USD $11.3 billion of China’s direct investment in Africa, representing the largest share of China’s FDI stock on the continent, exceeding the mining sector for the first time. Gross annual revenue of Chinese construction companies in Africa stood at USD $46 billion in 2019 from about USD $20 billion in 2008. Stock of China’s FDI in Africa by Sector, 2016 China’s engagements in Africa have been controversial, too. Popular media and policymakers often question whether Chinese enterprises in Africa contribute to knowledge transfer and skill development of local employees. Some scholars argue that by relying on foreign workers from China, these enterprises contribute little to local skill development and knowledge transfer in host African countries (Alden et al. 2006). But others argue that such claims may not be supported by empirical evidence. Corkin et al. (2008) argues that formally owned Chinese enterprises across Africa engage in strong local hiring practices, and that Chinese expatriates in Africa are likely to be skilled workers that provide training to their local counterparts. Chen et al. (2016) also examines how Chinese enterprises contribute to technical transfer and skill development in African countries and finds qualitative evidence of technology and skill transfer from China’s enterprises in Africa. Besides the works of Corkin et al. (2008), Chen et al. (2016), that are qualitative in nature, empirical research on Chinese enterprises’ contribution to local skill development in Africa is lacking. Importantly, there is no empirical evidence as to whether the approaches used by Chinese enterprises in local skill development differ from those used by other foreign entities and local enterprises. Are foreign enterprises from other emerging and developed countries and local enterprises different from Chinese enterprises in terms of promoting local skill development and knowledge transfer in Africa? If so, what is the degree of variation between them? The aim of this study is to contribute to filling this knowledge gap. In doing so, we use survey data collected in 2016 on 240 employees working in the construction sector from 12 enterprises in Ghana’s construction sector, of which six are Chinese, three foreign owned, and three are local. We first compare the characteristics of the sampled construction enterprises and their workforce and proceed to quantitatively examine the heterogeneity in promoting local skill development of domestic employees through the provision of short-term general training and long-term specific training across the three groups of construction enterprises. For the quantitative study, the analyses are conducted at the employee level due to the limited sample size at the firm level. We intend to isolate the role of each enterprise group (whether Chinese, other foreign, or local) to identify to what degree local employees receive training from their employer and if the relationship and intensity of training differ for employees of Chinese firms. This will contribute to understanding the scholarly debate regarding local skill development resulting from China’s involvement in Ghana’s construction sector. To preview the main findings, first, our analyses show that there are no significant differences in the characteristics of local employees from Chinese enterprises and those from other enterprises in terms of age, marital status, education background, work experience, and union membership. In terms of employment attributes, while workers in other enterprises on average stay longer with their employers than those working for Chinese enterprises, statistically, we do not observe any significant difference in the share of workers that receive training between Chinese and other construction enterprises. Furthermore, regression estimates suggest that compared to local enterprises, both Chinese and other foreign enterprises contribute positively to short-term general training and long-term specific training of locally hired workers. Indeed, the likelihood of receiving training, especially short-term general training, is higher for Chinese enterprise employees than those of other foreign enterprises. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews Chinese enterprise involvement in Africa’s construction sector and discusses the process by which knowledge transfer and local skill development occur alongside foreign enterprise participation; Sect. 3 examines an estimation strategy; Sect. 4 discusses the data and summary statistics; Sect. 5 presents the estimation results; and Sect. 6 concludes the study.",1
64,1,Comparative Economic Studies,17 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-021-00145-4,"Microfinance, Poverty and Education",March 2022,Asma Boussetta,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The fight against poverty remains one of the most serious economic issues in the world. At the United Nations Summit in 2015, 17 sustainable development goals were adopted and approved by 193 countries around the world with the eradication of poverty at the top of these goals: “We recognize that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.”Footnote 1 According to the WorldBank (2018), an estimated 736 million people were living below the international poverty line (IPL) in 2015. In 1990, this number was 1.9 billion. In a quarter of a century, 1.1 billion people have escaped extreme poverty and improved their standard of living. Despite these recent advances, the number of poor people worldwide remains high. Therefore, the World Bank has set a target of reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty to less than 3% of the world’s population by 2030. Does microfinance reduce poverty? This issue has attracted a lot of attention in the past two decades and has been the subject of debate among opponents and proponents of microfinance. For some, microfinance can be a strategy to combat poverty (Johnson and Rogaly 1997; Mosley 2001; Morduch and Haley 2002; Khandker 2005), which is one of the main financial mechanisms oriented toward disadvantaged segments of the population who are excluded usually from traditional financial systems. The microfinance sector is a growing sector. Between 1999 and 2018, the number of borrowers from microfinance institutions (MFIs) increased from 9 million to 140 million. Similarly, the value of loans granted by MFIs has increased from $2 billion to $124 billion worldwide. People living in developing countries turn to MFIs to be granted credit for consumption or investment as the majority do not have access to the conventional financial system (Morduch 1999). Indeed, the aim of MFIs is to provide microcredit to those who have no access to commercial banks, in order to reduce poverty and help the poor set up their own income-generating business. The existing literature on the impact of microfinance on poverty can be divided into two main categories. I begin with the literature studying poverty effects of microfinance at the microlevel. For instance, Agbola et al. (2017) studied the impact of microfinance on poverty, education and standard of living in the Philippines. Using a survey of 211 households including those who are and are not microfinance clients, they found that microfinance reduces household poverty slightly by increasing incomes and savings. Similarly, Ghalib et al. (2015) examined whether household access to the microfinance program in Pakistan contributes to reducing poverty and improving well-being. Using a survey of 1,132 households in 2008–2009, both microfinance users and non-users, they showed that microfinance reduces poverty in participating households. This is manifested through several indicators such as expenditure on healthcare, clothing and income. Khandker and Samad (2018) investigated the role of microfinance in reducing poverty in rural Bangladesh. They used a long household panel survey, collected mainly from areas where microcredit programs were concentrated, during the period 1991–2011. In this study, the authors tried to analyze the effects of current and past participation in microfinance programs, and the effects of continued participation in microfinance programs and those of irregular participation. The results suggested that there is a greater decrease in poverty levels for participants in microfinance programs than for non-participants, and for female participants more than for male participants. In addition, regular borrowers see their conditions improve more than irregular borrowers. The authors support the idea that participating in microfinance programs is cost-effective for borrowers because, according to the results, it contributes to poverty reduction. Nevertheless, there are also research papers that challenge the role of microfinance in reducing poverty. Banerjee and Jackson (2017) analyzed the role of microfinance in reducing poverty through an ethnographic study of three villages in Bangladesh. The study showed that microfinance caused increased levels of debt, especially among the poorest communities. In line with this approach, Awaworyi Churchill et al. (2016) examined the impact of microcredit on poverty in Bangladesh using three indicators: income, assets and consumption/expenditure. The results showed that the effect of microcredit on assets and income is statistically insignificant. From the same perspective, Weiss and Montgomery (2005) have shown that, in Asia and Latin America, microfinance cannot reach the poorest segment of the population because they may be high-risk and therefore unattractive microfinance clients. Indeed, for the core poor, it will not be credit alone that will be required, but credit plus a range of support services. Lønborg and Rasmussen (2014) share this view through a study on the effectiveness of microfinance targeting indicators in a community in Northern Malawi. They tried to answer that question: do microfinance programs reach the poor or the poorest of the population? They find a regressive targeting : participants in microfinance programs are less poor than the general population in the region. At the macroeconomic level, there has been little research that studies the relationship between microfinance and poverty. The best known are Imai et al. (2012) and Bangoura et al. (2016). To examine the effects of microfinance on poverty, Imai et al. (2012) use cross-country data on 48 countries for 2007, and a panel dataset on 61 countries for 2003 and 2007. They consider the possibility of endogeneity due to the reverse causality from poverty to MFIs’ gross loan portfolio and address this problem only for cross-sectional estimations. Their results show that gross loan portfolio of MFIs is negatively and significantly associated with the incidence, depth and severity of poverty (the FGT class of poverty indices), which implies that microfinance significantly reduces poverty at the macrolevel. In the same vein, Bangoura et al. (2016) evaluated the macroeconomic impact of microfinance on poverty and inequality in 52 developing countries. Using two microfinance measures, panel estimations results show that an increase in the number of microfinance borrowers reduces income inequality. They also found that microfinance has a negative effect on poverty levels when loan sizes are large. Indeed, these macroeconomic studies have investigated the effect of microfinance on poverty and they found a poverty-reducing effect of microfinance. But they suffer from certain limitations. First of all, none of these studies have examined through which channel microfinance can reduce poverty. Second, they used largely heterogeneous country samples and their conclusion on the effect of microfinance on poverty was general. This means that, not conducting a study disaggregated by level of economic development, does not allow to detect accurately and effectively the effect of microfinance on poverty by country groups. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap and extends the macroeconomic literature in four respects. First, compared to Imai et al. (2012), whose poverty estimates are only available for two or three specific years for most countries. I use a sufficiently large dataset to enable robust conclusions to be drawn. Specifically, the sample used in this study consists of annual data for 116 countries from 1999 to 2018. Second, since the aggregate analysis may hide the fact that the impact of microfinance on poverty depends on the level of development of countries, I conduct a disaggregated analysis and the results show that microfinance has positive effects on poverty reduction in the group of middle- and high-income countries. However, there is no significant relationship between microfinance and poverty in low-income countries. This finding is confirmed by early microstudies (Navajas et al. 2000; Hulme 2000; Zeller et al. 2006; Lønborg and Rasmussen 2014), which show that there is a targeting problem because microfinance programs cannot reach the core poor. This paper is the first to confirm these results at the macroeconomic level. Third, compared to Imai et al. (2012), this study develops a more elaborate specification of the empirical model and addresses the potential problem of endogeneity accurately, resolving through panel data models using Two Within Stages Least Squares (2WSLS hereafter). To the best of my knowledge, there have been no previous studies that have succeeded to deal, accurately, with this problem in the case of a panel estimation. Fourth, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the effects of microfinance on poverty, I also study the relevance of a channel (education) through which MFIs gross loan portfolio might affect poverty ratio. Two education indicators are employed in the analysis—education index and gross secondary school enrollment—to capture various aspects of human capital. The results show that any increase in the size of the microfinance sector promotes education which, in turn, reduces poverty. To the best of my knowledge, there are no studies in the previous literature on the poverty-microfinance nexus that have identified channels to explain this relationship at the macroeconomic level. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 lays out the estimation strategy and describes the data. Section 3 discusses the empirical results. Section 4 concludes.",1

Indeed, the current imbalances, which progressively deteriorate before the financial crisis and suddenly tighten thereafter, have attracted a lot of attention both in political circles and among academics (e.g. Chinn and Ito 2008; Obstfeld 2012; Chen 2015). Some authors even believe that the pre-crisis global imbalance is the main cause of the crisis (e.g. Portes 2009) while others take a more nuanced view and believe that the root causes of current imbalances global and financial crises coincide (Obstfeld and Rogoff 2005). For example, the current account of the MENA countries fell from a surplus of around 15% of GDP in 2011 to a deficit of almost 5% of GDP in 2015 and 2018. In some cases, such as Tunisia, Jordan and Algeria, deficits have exceeded 10% as a percentage of GDP in some years. This of course involved huge variations in gross and net international investment positions. The consequences on the sustainability of current account balances are manifold.Footnote 1 As a result, efforts to understand the determinants of the current account have intensified. Though, while demographics, fiscal position, growth prospects, net foreign asset positions and level of oil dependency are identified as the main determinants of the current account (CA) balance, less attention has been paid to financial variables. Obviously, several studies have recently focused on analyzing the determinants of the current account, suggesting that political factors may be even more relevant in stabilizing the current account than economic factors. Nevertheless, the debate on the political environment most conducive to the sustainability of the current account remains far from conclusive. Regarding the influence of the financial surplus on the current account balance, a study conducted by the IMF (2013) has just shown that the underlying mechanism is as follows: if the authorities do not implement reduction policies of the budget surplus, there could be an explosion in demand, leading to a weakening of the balance of payments. All the same, Ekinci et al. (2015) and Ekinci and Omay (2020) are the two recent studies that include credit growth as a determinant of the CA balance. Both studies reveal a significant relationship between the two, even controlling for the output gap. For the past two decades or so, the MENA region's current account has been rather disappointing. One of the possible reasons for these results is that the relationship between financial development and the current account cannot be linear, but rather depends on certain conditions such as institutional quality. Really, due to corruption or intervention policies in the banking system, the increase in financial deepening reflected in standard financial development indicators cannot translate into further improvements in the CA balance. These can transfer credit to unproductive or even unnecessary activities (Law and Demetriades 2006). The main reasons that motivated us to choose the MENA countries to carry out our empirical surveys are that there are no studies on this region. In addition, MENA countries had initiated financial reforms since the mid-1980s, when financial development had not functioned as an engine of economic development in this region (Ben Naceur et al. 2007). In fact, Ben Naceur et al. (2014) show that the quality of institutions, in particular the rule of law, promotes financial development by expressing confidence in the quality of legal systems that support economic activities in MENA countries. The latest results from Gazdar and Cherif (2015) confirm that institutional quality plays an important role in the financial system of the same region. However, this role is more important for the banking sector than for the development of the stock market. The debate on the political environment most conducive to financial development is still far from conclusive. It is therefore interesting to note that the countries which have succeeded in ensuring financial development and efficient judicial systems are those keep their current balances viable. To do this, we follow the work of Cheung et al. (2013), Garg and Kp (2017) and of the International Monetary Fund (2019). On the one hand, Cheung et al. (2013) have shown that the medium-term evolution of current imbalances can be linked to structural fundamentals, in particular demographic differences between countries, budget deficits and dependence on oil, stage of economic development, market development financial and institutional quality. Thus, part of the deterioration in current account balances since the financial crisis appears to be linked to various cyclical factors, including changes in output growth, oil prices and exchange rates, and is expected to reverse accordingly economic. On the other hand, Garg and Kp (2017) consider that the evolution of the current account is determined both by macroeconomic fundamentals such as the fiscal balance, the real effective exchange rate and private investment, as well as by external factors such as oil price volatility and external income. These facts give importance to the study of how the quality of political institutions, more specifically, how improving good governance in the MENA region would affect the stability of the current account. Interestingly, a lot of empirical research suggests that the effect of financial development on the current account is conditioned at different levels of the institutional system. It is on the basis of this work as well as their recent extensions that we develop, in this study, our empirical contributions. Surprisingly, the role of institutional quality in the link between financial development and the current account has been overlooked in recent literature. In this context, marked by the debate on the current imbalance, this article aims to test this relationship by examining whether the institutional environment plays an important role in limiting the former. To our best knowledge, no study has addressed the case of countries in the MENA region. Such an attempt is the aim of this article. Furthermore, this study aims to fill the theoretical and empirical gaps in the existing literature and to contribute to the debate on the political economy of the current account in various ways. In particular, we examine the relationship between financial development and the current account, then the role of institutions in determining the latter relationship for a panel of 12 MENA countries over the period 1990–2018. To do this, we first use the generalized method of moments (GMM) to identify the key fundamentals of the current account and demonstrate to what extent could affect the stability of the current account in countries studied. Then, we study the asymmetric relationship between oil prices and the current account based on the Panel Vector Autoregression (VAR) model. Second, our study focuses only on MENA countries. This is particularly important for two main reasons. The financial systems of many countries in the region remain underdeveloped compared to other regions of the world (Arezki et al. 2018). Furthermore, poor governance has limited the role of financial institutions in financing the private sector (Gritli and Charfi 2016). This paper is expected to contribute to the literature by providing evidence on the MENA region that could help policymakers implement corrective measures for the current account imbalance. Third, we use various institutional indicators, each of which covers different aspects of the broad concept of institutional quality, with particular emphasis on political institutions. Interestingly, if there is a stable political environment that can provide better legal protections for referendum rights, freedom of expression and the rule of law, and ensure better protection of the banking system against corruption and interference policy, it will improve the functioning of the financial system (Kaufmann et al. 2009). The remainder of the document is as follows: the “Literature review” section examines the existing literature; The “Methodology and data” section deals with the methodology and data used; The section “Empirical results” deals with empirical results; Finally, ""Conclusion"" section concludes.",2
64,1,Comparative Economic Studies,28 June 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-021-00155-2,Does Peace Promote Bilateral Trade Flows? An Economic Analysis of Panel Data in Asian Perspective,March 2022,Ghulam Shabbir,Amjad Naveed,Shabib Haider Syed,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Theoretical debate, whether and how economic flows frame a nation’s foreign policy, and especially decision against war has gained importance in the field of political economy. Despite, significant support to the hypothesis that an increase in the cross-border economic flows lowers the probability of conflict/war, researchers yet need to develop a consensus about the precise nature of this relationship (McDonald 2004). The empirical findings of extensive literature documented evidence that interdependence between economies, the emergence of international organizations and democratic states on the globe limited the interstate conflicts (Jervis 2002; Gleditsch 2008). In addition, it is reported that interstate conflicts adversely affect economic flows, but bilateral trade does not decrease the risk of disputes (Keshk et al. 2004). A study on liberal peace by Kim and Rousseau (2005) supported the growing consensus for liberal peace but also argued that these commerce benefits disappear in case of simultaneous estimation of trade-conflict relationships. The supporters of liberal peace always argued that interstates interdependence reduces the risk of conflicts because the use of power hurts the gains from trade and jeopardizes the flow of information essential for the development of mutual understanding (Russett and Oneal 2001). Thus, interstates commercial relations and economic interdependence promote the likelihood of peace because interstates conflicts are inconsistent with mutually beneficial economic ties (Gartzke 1999; Polachek and Xiang 2008). Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the reciprocal link, whether the promotion of peace between states promotes economic flows/trade flows or commerce between the nations lowers the interstate conflicts/wars. Two independent states: Pakistan and India appeared on the world globe in August 1947, resulting from the partition of British India and independence from colonial rule. The partition of British India into two separate states created hostility between the newly emerged states, which lead to wars between the countries and the presence of nuclear weapons in both states. On the other hand, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 pushed a huge influx of Afghan refugees to Pakistan that not only adversely affected the socioeconomic and political environment of society, but also posed an alarming threat to Pakistan’s security (Hilali 2002). The incidence of the 9/11 attacks was another calamity for Pakistan’s economy that promotes terrorist activities in the country because it plays the role of the frontline state against terrorism. These terrorist activities drastically (directly as well as indirectly) influenced the economic performance of the country (Khan et al. 2016; Khan and Yusof 2017) and, in particular, Pakistan’s foreign sector performance. For instance, Afghanistan’s war in 2001 and its adverse impacts on Pakistan’s economy significantly decreased its exports from 28.38% in 2003 to 10.44 in 2018, and even become negative − 15.0% in 2012. This implies that Pakistan has paid a huge direct and indirect cost for the war that amounts to more than US$ 125 billion. This loss was in the form of loss in exports, FDI flows, physical infrastructure, etc. Pakistan’s military, security and intelligence forces started Zarb-e-Azb Operation in 2014 to curb terrorist activities along with the foreign office’s dialogue with its neighboring countries for peace. These struggles become fruitful in lowering the external conflicts and improve the law and order situation within the country, and hence, exports increased from − 6.34% in 2015 to 10.44% in 2018. Besides, other factors such as an increase in electricity tariff and its shortage, lack of market diversification, lack in technological advancement, lower investment in human capital, reduction in research and development expenditures, an increase in interstates conflicts and elements of war significantly hampered the economic flows (trade and capital). Because interstate conflicts, terrorist activities and violence not only destroy the human and physical capital but also undermine the socioeconomic and political institutions required to increase the economic performance of an economy. Therefore, there is a need to re-investigate the proposition, whether and how the promotion of peace in Pakistan relative to its trading partners affects its foreign sector performance. Many studies theoretically analyzed the causal relationship between peace and trade flows. Some studies concluded that international commerce/trade promotes peace among states (Polachek 1980; Domke 1988; Mansfield 1994; Oneal and Russett 1999a, b; Russett and Oneal 2001; Gartzke et al. 2001). Despite substantial empirical support to this proposition, researchers challenged these claims for failing to demonstrate a model of domestic politics, which links commerce, social interests in commerce with peace, and helps to formulate foreign policy (Stein 1993; Barbieri and Schneider 1999; Simmons 2003). This oversight was focused on the liberal international relations theory that deals with the behavior of individuals and state-society interactions to explain foreign policy behavior (Moravcsik 1997). Another neglected variant of the Commercial Treaty of Cobden (1868, 1870), Schumpeter (1919/1951) and Standard Trade Theory is how international trade designs the domestic politics of war. These classical scholars describe the linkage between commerce and peace through the connection between the politics of international conflict and the domestic distributional consequence of commercial policy. In the same strand, Domke (1988) argued that aggregate trade flows should promote peace, as the political influence of the trade beneficiaries and commerce expands in relatively equal proportion. In the empirical literature, the quality of trade policy indicators remained controversial (e.g., Edwards 1993, 1998; Leamer 1988) and suggested measures that include trade-to-GDP ratio, trade duties to total imports ratio, premiums for foreign exchange and residuals from models predicting aggregate trade flows. However, the best measure of the quality of trade policy is the trade-to-GDP ratio to investigate the link between trade flows and interstate conflicts (Mcdonald 2004). Hiscox and Kastner (2002) used the gravity model and trade-to-GDP ratio to measure the degree of protection, to predict the size of bilateral trade flows between economies due to the advantages of this measure over previous ones. Mcdonald (2004) investigated the hypothesis that an increase in the protection level promotes interstate conflict, but fail to find the reverse causation, reduction in interstate conflicts promotes free trade. Hegre et al. (2010) used a simultaneous equation model to test the liberal trade theory through the trade model derived by Long (2008). The proposition of the study was whether trade flows reduce interstate conflicts or not. The findings of the study argued that an increase in trade flows reduces the possibility of a fatal militarized dispute, which means promotes interstates peace because aggression has a cost that is paid prospectively. This implies that interstate conflicts and violence hinder the trade flows and, hence prosperity of the country. The findings of the study became suspicious when it was admitted that the instruments of the study failed to meet the criteria of identification. In Pakistan, few notable studies investigated the behavior of trade flows using the gravity model. Khan and Mahmood (2000) analyzed the link between Pakistan’s trade flows and economic size, geographic and cultural factors, border and common language using the augmented gravity model. The results of the study documented that the domestic economic size (GDP) and trading partner’s economic size, real exchange rate and common language positively affected the bilateral trade flows, whereas distance, tariff and border dummy affected negatively. Achakzai (2006) tried to investigate Pakistan’s trade flows with nine ECO member economies using the augmented gravity model and panel data. The study’s results reported a significant positive impact of ECO countries’ economic size (measured by the GDP) on intra-regional trade flows. The predicted value of inter-ECO trade was significantly higher than the actual value of trade flows, suggesting greater scope for regional integration. Butt (2008) empirical findings revealed that Pakistan’s GDP, importing nation’s GDP and real exchange rate positively affected the export flow, whereas distance and tariffs affected negatively. It is also concluded that trade between Pakistan and India can be fostered by reducing military expenditures, promoting democracy and lowering hostility between the states. Gul and Yasin (2011) also tried to investigate the trade flows of Pakistan using the augmented gravity model and panel data. The findings of the study documented the expected impact of selected macroeconomic variables, except the border dummy variable that indicates a political conflict with border-sharing nations. Recently, few scholars have given particular attention to investigate the link between peace and trade. For instance, Mollaian (2019) investigated the role of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in maintaining international peace through international trade. Besides, it discusses the effectiveness of the imposition of trade restrictions, whether the security exception needs reform for the WTO to better engage in the pursuit of international peace through international trade. Similarly, Fauchald (2019) discussed the important challenges currently facing by the WTO dispute settlement mechanism and argued that promotion of peace would certainly solve the sensitive issues between trading partners. Likewise, Shang (2020) exposed that the number of terrorist attacks is inversely related to the volume of trade between China and its five trading partners from central Asia. Moreover, they observe that China is less affected due to its comparative advantage. Another study by Karlsson and Hedberg (2021) revealed that one of the main reasons for the rapid integration of goods and factors market during the initial phase of globalization (1830–1913) was the result of peaceful characteristics of the post-Napoleonic nineteenth century. They further argued that in the nineteenth century, the adverse impact of a trade war was mainly limited to the belligerent economies, while belligerent–neutral economies’ trade was either unaffected or even increased during the war times. On the other hand, few studies have investigated the impact of trade on peace. For example, Chen (2021) confirms the tested commercial peace theory—that trade fosters peace—by developing the idea of extended dependence. This argument is strongly supported by the empirical analysis. There is very limited literature available that investigated the impact of relative peace in the country relative to its trading countries on trade flows by using appropriate methodology. Therefore, the existing empirical literature is deficient and needs to explore the impact of relative peace on Pakistan’s bilateral trade flow using an augmented gravity model framework under panel data modeling. The gravity model has important implications because it not only includes the distance between trading partners but also incorporates the impact of economic size on trade flows. Furthermore, distance in the gravity model not only implies geographical distance but also reflects the changes in costs of transportation and other trade barriers, e.g., tariff and non-tariff, interstate conflict and political tension. Thus, the aims of this study are twofold: (1) to test, whether the relative peace in Pakistan to its trading countries has a significant impact on the trade flows of Pakistan under the framework of the gravity model. (2) To test, whether the promotion of infrastructure facilities in Pakistan makes it more competitive in the international market. The results of the study indicate that the traditional gravity model does not hold in the case of Pakistan’s economy. The share of Pakistan’s trade with its neighboring nations is negligible due to its conflicted relation with India, Afghanistan’s economy is not stable due to long-lasting war and Iran’s economy is constrained by international economic sanctions. The impact of relative peace on trade flows is significant and positive which supports the hypothesis that trade between the countries lowers interstate conflicts and eliminates the elements of war. The contribution to infrastructure facilities in the trade flows is positive and significant, which implies that reduction in transportation cost promotes the country’s competitiveness in the market. Hence, the initiative of CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) by the Pakistan government is important for the promotion of Pakistan’s trade. The rest of the study is organized as follows: Section 2 contains the theoretical framework and model specification. The empirical methodology is given in Section 3, results and their discussion is presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the study with possible implications.",1

Over the last decades, this approach has been used to evaluate the contribution of information and telecommunication technologies (ICTs) to growth. It consists in decomposing the growth of value added per hour worked (labor productivity) into the growth of ICT capital and non-ICT capital per hour worked, based on a set of input-specific elasticities.Footnote 1 Early studies on the impact of ICTs on productivity yielded largely inconclusive results. The well-known Solow paradox for which “computers are visible everywhere except in productivity statistics” summarizes the state of art in the early 1990s. The lack of correlation between ICT investment and productivity growth was mostly due to incorrect measurement of ICT capital prices and quality. Significant improvements in the measurement of ICT capital (OECD, 2001 and 2009) have opened the way to a new stream of analysis on the growth effects of ICTs. According to OECD (2019), the yearly contribution of ICT capital to labor productivity in a set of 23 OECD countries over 1995–2017 ranged between 0.66 percentage points a year in New Zealand to 0.25 percentage points in Finland. The average yearly contribution, however, decreased from 0.42 percentage points in 2001–2007 to 0.25 percentage points in 2010–2017. A new paradox, however, has appeared over the last two decades: While ICTs, robots and new productivity-enhancing digital technologies continue to diffuse at a sustained rate, productivity growth has slowed down in all advanced economies. This paradox has not yet received any consensual explanation so far (for a literature review, see Bergeaud et al. 2019). Gordon and Sayed (2020) observe a difference between US and Europe: The productivity slowdown appears from the mid-2000s in the US after a short revival during the decade mid-1990s to mid-2000s, and from the mid-1970s in Europe, and “as a result, the story of US productivity growth since the mid-1970s has been one of slow-fast-slow over the three intervals divided at 1995 and 2005, in contrast to a two-step deceleration in Europe.” The aim of this study is to analyze such a paradox of productivity slowdown in the age of the emerging digital economy. By developing a new database, it contributes to the growth accounting literature with three original aspects: First, it covers a long period from the early 60’s to 2019, just before the COVID-19 crisis; second, it analyzes a large set of economies (30 plus the Euro Area) at the country level; finally, it singles out the growth contribution of ICT capital as well as robots, the latter being bundled with non-ICT capital in the System of National Accounts (SNA). The original database for our analysis is built for the total economy and includes GDP, hours worked, ICT and non-ICT capital, the number of robots and educational level. Several sources were used to build this database, based on some common assumptions and according to a harmonized methodology for all countries. Our growth accounting approach shows that the main drivers of labor productivity growth over the whole 1960–2019 period appear to be education, TFP and non-ICT, non-robot capital deepening. The overall contribution of ICT capital is found to be declining from the mid-2000s, although our total economy dataset does not make it possible to estimate the TFP contribution of ICT, for instance, from ICT-producing industries. The contribution of robots to productivity growth through capital deepening and TFP appears to be significant in Germany and Japan in the sub-period 1975–1995, in France and Italy in 1995–2005, and in several Eastern European countries in 2005–2019. Our findings also confirm the slowdown in TFP in most countries from at least 1995 onwards. This slowdown is mainly accounted for by a decrease in the contributions of non-ICT non-robot capital deepening and TFP. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of previous studies. Section 3 presents the data and the methodology of the analysis. Section 4 examines the main trends in ICT capital and robots. The findings of the growth accounting analysis are presented in Sect. 5, while Sect. 6 concludes.",5
64,2,Comparative Economic Studies,19 July 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-021-00163-2,"Distributional Consequences of Monetary Policy in Emerging Economies: Dollarization, Domestic Inflation, and Income Divergence",June 2022,Zhandos Ybrayev,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It is well documented that income and wealth inequality have been dramatically increasing in the last several decades, even as poverty levels in major parts of the developing world have substantially fallen (Milanovic 2016; Saez et al. 2018). The causes of this rise of inequality are diverse, though not completely understood. However, it is clear that they partly result from deep underlying structures of inequality embedded in the global architecture of international finance. An important distinction between soft and hard currencies is a central characteristic of these structures of inequality. “Hard currencies,” in contrast to “soft currencies,” can easily be used to purchase goods, services, and assets from practically anyone in the world. Soft currencies can be used primarily only in the country of issue and must be typically exchanged for hard currencies for buying foreign-owned goods and services (Epstein 2018). This configuration leads to a significant institutional disadvantage and specific distributional schemes of developing and emerging economies in the global economic order. Academic literature has long been indicating the issues of potential negative effects from an increase in financial dollarization and the conduct of domestic monetary policy. As such, domestic financial intermediation in many emerging economies allows for simultaneous circulation of two types of currencies: domestic and foreign. In fact, households in the developing world hold substantial amounts of foreign currency (or “financial dollarization”). That makes emerging markets exposed to external macroeconomic shocks and often prone to subsequent volatile waves of inflationary pressures. According to Levy-Yeyati (2006), despite the fact that monetary authorities in developing countries have succeeded in bringing down domestic inflation over time, the degree of deposit dollarization of banking system remains relatively high. Hence, most medium and large developing economies historically have developed a combination of monetary policy mix consisting of inflation targeting (with flexible exchange rates) and countercyclical exchange rate intervention due to various experiences with dominant currencies in their respective regions (Levy-Yeyati 2019). The author also notes that whereas floating exchange rates help buffer the adverse external shocks, the same channel would be contractionary in heavily dollarized economies, which would be better off with more rigid exchange rate arrangements. Additionally, Acosta-Ormaechea and Coble (2011) found that traditional interest rate channel is effective in less dollarized economies, while in relatively highly dollarized economies, the exchange rate is more relevant in the transmission of monetary policy. As a result, savings accounts denominated in foreign currency can serve as a hedge against domestic income fluctuations. Moreover, the foreign currency deposits gain in value when inflation gradually erodes the purchasing power of local currency incomes. Thus, the concept of dollarization is an integral part in the long evolution of monetary policy in developing and emerging markets and should be included in the analysis of its distributional effects. In this paper, I conduct empirical tests to analyze the distributional effects of monetary policy regimes in a small open economy framework. We presume that the key diverging mechanism is the presence of heterogeneous households with a differential level of financial dollarization, which are especially relevant for the study of monetary policy in emerging market economies. We follow the logic of the Prasad and Zhang (2015) model with an exogenous fraction of financially excluded (or rule-of-thumb) consumers coexisting with unconstrained households that are able to save in foreign currency and thereby smooth income fluctuations. Poor households divide their labor income between consumption and holding of domestic liquid assets. In emerging economies, this heterogeneous aspect in a household’s portfolio composition is a driving mechanism of differential response to inflation and interest rate changes. I also show that the periods with relatively high inflation are positively related to the ratio of top incomes in a developing country. The paper presents evidence that increasing average level of inflation is negatively related to the share of the lowest incomes of population. I specifically concentrate on the evolution of the top 10% and bottom 50% of income shares as robust representatives of the concept of heterogeneous agents. At the same time, interest rate responses of monetary policy (represented by the hike in domestic short-term interest rates) exacerbate this unequal impact of inflation, further amplifying economic divergence between the top and bottom income shares in these countries. I find that contractionary monetary policy is associated with periods of higher income inequality in emerging markets. For the empirical exercises, I combine the World Inequality Database, World Bank Data, and World Income Inequality Database on BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) to establish a benchmark model. Using panel data analysis with country- and time-level fixed effects, results show that inflation is positively related to the top 10% of income shares, and negatively related to the bottom 50% of income of income shares in BRICS countries. Also, I conclude that financial frictions, in addition to heterogeneous agents’ framework, play a key role in the relationship of foreign exchange participation and subsequent income redistribution. This is likely to exacerbate the damaging impact of inflation on the bottom 50% of income distribution, although the long-run disinflation goal might positively affect the low-income groups through reductions in unemployment and asset price changes. Previously, the analysis of how monetary policy affects the distribution of income and wealth has traditionally focused on advanced economies with relevant theoretical assumptions of complete markets. However, emerging economies are structurally different from developed economies. They are generally associated with greater financial frictions, underdeveloped and incomplete financial markets, a high level of asset dollarization, and overall weak monetary transmission mechanisms. In addition, recent studies indicate that the distribution of foreign currency holdings is highly unequal. This raises new concerns about distributional effects of monetary policy in emerging countries. Financial dollarization in developing countries has become one of the most commonly observed characteristics in the literature. The share of foreign currency denominated bank deposits to the total deposits is a standard method to detect and quantify the level of dollarization of the financial system in a given country. In the presence of any sort of capital controls, the amount of remittances might also provide an indirect account of dollarization, because it measures the amount of private dollars, flowing into an emerging economy. According to Levy-Yeyati (2006), by the end of 2000, the mean dollarization ratio of all developing countries was 35%. At the same time, Ize and Levy-Yeyati (2003) argue that financial dollarization in developing countries is already beyond the phenomenon of currency substitution, and became more evident in the interest-bearing financial assets that leads to the mechanism of asset substitution. Moreover, monetary asset distribution and financial portfolios that can hedge against inflation are not uniform across individuals, which likely create asymmetric responses to various monetary policy shocks. Thus, in middle- and low-income emerging countries, high rates of exclusion from formal financial institutions and underdeveloped financial systems severely constrain the ability of households to self-insure against idiosyncratic shocks. In particular, more than half of the population in emerging markets does not have access to the basic financial instruments, such as bank account (Prasad 2015). Most households manage their financial transaction using cash, making them more vulnerable to inflation. Additionally, there are limited financial alternatives available to insure against income shocks for the low-income groups. These factors reduce the capacity of low-income households to increase the level of precautionary savings. Ize and Levy-Yeyati (2003) have shown that large fractions of the population in developing countries, and particularly in Latin America, still save and borrow in foreign currencies. In a recent study by Drenik et al. (2018), the authors show that the likelihood of having assets in foreign currency increases with households’ income. As a result, these features of a small open economy are most likely to aggravate the differential income response and exacerbate the distributional consequences of monetary policy. When investigating the welfare implications of monetary policy within developing countries, it is crucial to take into account the access to dollarized assets. Accordingly, rich households, who are mostly present in the tradable sector, hold more foreign currency and thus can alleviate the impact of an unexpected increase in domestic inflation, whereas poor households tend to hold more domestic liquid assets and accordingly are more exposed to inflation risks. Reinhart et al. (2003) found that there is a positive relationship between the likelihood of an inflationary past and the degree of dollarization. Similraly, Honohan (2007) documents that, over the period 2000–2004, countries that exhibit foreign currency deposits share of less than 50% were more successful in controlling inflation below 35% per annum from 1990 to 2005. Thus, the distributional effects in emerging economies along domestic inflation and interest rates dimensions institutionally linked to financial dollarization are of primary importance in this study. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section two presents a literature review. Section three explains the main working mechanism of income distribution through financial dollarization and domestic currency inflation. Section four introduces the data and basic descriptive statistics to provide some analytical intuition for the results that I report in our empirical analysis. Next, I discuss the panel data approach of the empirical analysis and present the key results. Section five discusses policy implications and finally section six concludes.",4

They open up interesting perspectives in the identification and quantification of the sources of divergence in living standards between nations. Their application here in the GDP per hour worked (GDP/h) disparities within the framework of the theory of production is not moreover the only perspective. The application to many other relevant variables, to assess the sources of inequalities between countries, regions, sectors ... as indicators of the World Bank (2019), is also possible. More generally, it is the same for indicators other than GDP (including non-economic issues) with the condition, like here, that their variances can be decomposed. As economic growth accounting, development accounting (DA) seeks to measure the contribution of each production factor (including that of total factor productivity (TFP)) to a chosen aggregate measuring wealth (GDP but also GDP per capita, per hour worked or per worker…). In summary, the difference is that growth accounting seeks to assess these contributions in the form of flow to flow (contribution of the variation in the volume of each production factor—including the quality associated with it when this is measurableFootnote 1—to the evolution of GDP in volume) while that of DA is concerned with stocks (contribution of the volume of each production factor—including its quality—to GDP in volume). In summarizing their respective objects, we can write: Economic growth accounting: Economic development accounting: The variation of TFP emerges as a residual between the change of GDP and that of volume production factors (A), while the TFP always appears as a residual between GDP and the volume of these inputs (B). Both accounting exercises (A and B) can be applied to national or regional macroeconomic frameworks but also at sectoral level… (one or more countries, regions or sectors, on one or more date or over one or more periods) or to international comparisons on one or more dates or periods. The application will concern here 19 EU countries in 2016 envisaged both at a macroeconomic level and at three sectoral levels: The global economy—EG, the sphere of market activities—SM, that of non-market or state activities—SNM, and finally the mixed sphere or semi-public—Sm. From an international DA perspective, the dependent variable is no longer the quantity itself (like GDP in the above formulations) but its variance. Thus, the so-called (international) DA method will specifically relate to the decomposition of the variance of GDP in levels for a given year. The formula for the variance of the dependent variable which is a function of \({\rm n}\) explanatory factors will obviously include the variances in these factors but also their covariances. In this article, the evaluation framework is therefore macro-accounting and sectoral using a production function with \(\mathrm{n}=3\) factors. A generalization to \(\mathrm{n}\) factors is also proposed showing how to identify and attribute explanatory powers of factor variances to disparities in GDP in each of the four configurations. The identification step makes it possible to know, for each explanatory factor considered in a production function, its variance as well as its co-movements with other factors. Because of these latter, there will appear a problem of breakdown of each co-movement toward the variance in each factor. In other words, the relevant amount to be attributed to variance of each explanatory factor should be extracted from each covariance: This is the question of attribution; we develop a breakdown approach for the co-movements of factors and show how it constitutes an advance compared to the usual way of proceeding. We will work here with 3 factors, but our approach will be generalized in the case of \(\mathrm{n}\) factors. Finally, as regards the evaluation of each factor contributions variance to the variance in living standards, we apply (see Sect. 2.1) the usual growth accounting method (Solow 1956, 1957). Summarizing these steps, we can say that the identification corresponds to the simple knowledge of the variances–covariances matrix of the explanatory factors selected, while the attribution corresponds to the transfer of the only covariances’ values to the variances of each factor. The scope therefore concerns 19 EU countries in 2016 (13 are in Eurozone). EU membership and the availability of data needed to calibrate the DA equation are the two criteria for constructing this sample. 2016 is the most recent year for which all the data are fully available. The sample is therefore currently the largest possible (19/28). It represents 9/10 of the wealth produced in EU. Finally, with regard to the decomposition of economies according to the spheres indicated, we use the EU-KLEMS database (Stehrer et al. 2019), which is based on the latest revision of the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community NACE Rev. 2 (Eurostat, 2008). The PPP comparability of the data is ensured by the use of the PWT 9.1 (Feenstra et al. 2015). Among the DA works based on a decomposition analysis of the variance in GDP, in which our contribution is situated, three aspects currently raise questions. They hinder identification and precise measurement of the determinants of variations in living standards between countries. A first aspect is that they consider the reproducible productive factors as a single aggregate of factors. This has two consequences in terms of measuring development: (i) the contribution of the variance of the other factors is not distinguished from that of the aggregate and (ii) the co-movements (covariances) between these factors are not either, since the single aggregation does not let them evolve separately. However, there can be differences between the contributions of each factor, on the one hand, and the co-movements are empirically considerable, on the other hand (the literature and our results corroborate it); there is therefore an interest in separating the factors in order to attribute more precisely the portion of each co-movement which should go back to the variance of each factor. This portion is added to the variance of each factor to form its true contribution in the total variance of living standards. A second is linked to the quality of accounting breakdown. Indeed, when all co-movements are not taken into account, outliers such as the TFP variance and that of the single aggregate of factors exceeding the variance in the dependent variable or is less than that of the dependent variable ... can arise. The example below allows to better visualize: Suppose, without loss of generality, we can write the general production function as: \(\mathrm{y}=\mathrm{TFP}*\mathrm{Factors}\) (in case of Cobb–Douglas, \(\mathrm{Factors}=\) \({\mathrm{K}}^{{\alpha }}{\mathrm{L}}^{1-{\alpha }})\). By taking the logarithms of this function and then its variance, we write: Suppose that the statistical results of the 3 series \(\left(\text{y, TFP} \text{and Factors}\right)\), give: 
From these results, ignoring the third term above leads to consider that the variance in the TFP explains 150% (9/6) of that of the product, which is an aberrant result. Similarly, the sum of the variances in the TFP and the factors would explain the variance in the product up to 166.7% ((9 + 1)/6) which is also aberrant. Saying that the variance in the factors explains 1/6 of that of the product is not in itself absurd but becomes so by noting that these factors are indeed in co-movement with TFP. A third is that the solutions to the aberrations presented in the empirical situation exposed above are not currently satisfactory. This third aspect draws attention to the fact that the solutions proposed in the literature to redistribute covariances are themselves likely to generate aberrations. It will therefore be necessary to find a redistribution key from each co-movement toward each variance concerned, without generating aberrations like those mentioned in aspect 2 and pointed out in the literature. The purpose of the article is fourfold. We are interested in a DA framework: (i) able to take into account all the co-movements, (ii) including in dimension \(\mathrm{n}>2\) production factors, (iii) which solves the possible aberrations in the explanatory powers reported in the literature and finally (iv) applied not only at the macroeconomic level (EG) but also sectoral (SM, SNM and Sm). It seems instructive before closing this introduction, to present this goal equivalently, by including it the evolution of DA works. Indeed, by mapping 4-step evolution process, we have: Step 1: \(\mathrm{var }\left(\mathrm{Standard\,of\,living}\right)=\mathrm{F }\left(\mathrm{var TFP},\mathrm{ var\,Factors\,of\,production}\right)\) Step 2: \(\mathrm{var }\left(\mathrm{Standard\,of\,living}\right)=\mathrm{F }\left(\mathrm{var\,TFP},\mathbf{c}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{v}\left(\mathbf{T}\mathbf{F}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{F}\mathbf{a}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{s}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{f}\mathbf{p}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{u}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{i}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{n}\right),\mathrm{ var\,Factors\,of\,production}\right)\) Step 3: \(\mathrm{var }\left(\mathrm{Standard of living}\right)=\mathrm{F }\left(\begin{array}{c}{\rm var\,TFP,\,cov} \left(\mathbf{T}\mathbf{F}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{f}\mathbf{a}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{f}\mathbf{p}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{u}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{i}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{n}1\right), {\rm cov} \left(\mathbf{T}\mathbf{F}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{f}\mathbf{a}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{f}\mathbf{p}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{u}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{i}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{n}2\right),\\ {\rm cov} \left(\mathbf{f}\mathbf{a}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{f}\mathbf{p}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{u}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{i}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{n}1,\mathbf{f}\mathbf{a}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{f}\mathbf{p}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{u}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{i}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{n}2\right), {\rm var} \left(\mathrm{factor\,of\,production }1\right), \\ {\rm var} \left(\mathrm{factor\,of\,production }2\right)\end{array}\right)\) Step 4: \(\mathrm{var }\left(\mathrm{Standard\,of\,living }\mathbf{b}\mathbf{y}\mathbf{s}\mathbf{e}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{o}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{s}\mathbf{p}\mathbf{h}\mathbf{e}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{e}-\right)=\mathrm{F }\left(\begin{array}{c}{\rm var\,TFP, cov} \left(\mathbf{T}\mathbf{F}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{f}\mathbf{a}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{f}\mathbf{p}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{u}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{i}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{n}1\right), {\rm cov} \left(\mathbf{T}\mathbf{F}\mathbf{P},\mathbf{f}\mathbf{a}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{f}\mathbf{p}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{u}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{i}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{n}2\right),\\ {\rm cov} \left(\mathbf{f}\mathbf{a}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{f}\mathbf{p}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{u}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{i}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{n}1,\mathbf{f}\mathbf{a}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{f}\mathbf{p}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{u}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{i}\mathbf{o}\mathbf{n}2\right), {\rm var} \left(\mathrm{factor\,of\,production }1\right), \\ {\rm var} \left(\mathrm{factor\,of\,production }2\right)\end{array}\right)\) Our contribution consists here in the elaboration and quantification of steps 3 and 4. The difficulty they pose (we allude here to the so-called problems of identifying and attributing the explanatory powers of each factor variance to the variance in the inter-country living standards) and its solution will also be explained and applied in a framework with three production factors. A generalization of this framework to \(n\) factors is also proposed. It will be macroeconomic (Step 3) and sectoral (Step 4), thus focusing on global economies (EG) as well as on their SM, SNM and Sm’ spheres. The text is organized as follows: “Development Accounting, Literature in Growth and Development Accounting” section reviews the practice of DA, draws up an inventory of literature and offers an overview of changes in living standards in the EU between 1999 and 2016. “Development Accounting Framework and Statistical Sources” section presents the accounting frameworks (macroeconomic and sectoral) and all the statistical data to be assembled for the calibration of these frameworks. “Numerical Applications for Identifying and Attributing Explanatory Powers of GDP Disparities in the EU-19 (Macro-Economic Case: EG)” section shows the identification results of each factor to the disparities in GDP/h between the 19 EU countries. It then lays out the question of the attribution of their explanatory powers and deduces from it, in a generalized framework, a proposal for a solution to the aberrations mentioned. It ends by applying this solution to determine the explanatory powers of the variance in each production factor to the disparities in GDP/h. “Numerical Applications for Identifying and Attributing Explanatory Powers of GDP/h Disparities in EU-19 (Sectoral Cases: SM, SNM and Sm)” section applies this same solution but at the three sectoral levels. To do this, it first shows how the economies considered are each distributed according to these three spheres; then, it determines the explanatory powers of each production factor to the disparities of GDP/h in each sphere; finally, results are summarized and commented before concluding.",

64,2,Comparative Economic Studies,01 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-021-00165-0,"The Financial Crisis in 2008, the Stimulus Package, and Distortion of Financial Intermediation in China: A Survival Analysis Approach",June 2022,Moho Shiraishi,Go Yano,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"This study investigated whether the 2008 financial crisis had a persistent negative influence on emerging and developing economies in which a well-functioning financial system was largely lacking. Thus, as a case, this study examined the relationship between company survival and the financial intermediation function in China. The rationale underlining this research question was aimed at statistically evaluating whether the 2008 financial crisis gave birth to “zombie firms” within the context of emerging and developing economies.Footnote 1 The analysis used a hazard model to assess the survival of firms. In contrast to previous research that employed a hazard model to analyze the influence of the financial intermediation function on the probability of a firm’s survival, this study adopted a novel perspective. The previous literature implicitly assumed that by increasing the probability of a firm’s survival, financial intermediation may be viewed to have elicited a positive effect. However, this study did not adopt this particular assumption. Instead, it utilized an approach situated within a new perspective that can be outlined as follows. Although the resulting increase in the probability of a firm’s survival can be viewed positively with respect to the individual firm, the firm’s survival results in inefficiency within the economy as a whole if, for example, owing to some treatment, such as relief loans, the firm with lower efficiency obtains competitive power and survives in the market. In this case, facilitating the survival of particular firm is undesirable for the market as a whole. To yield a favorable situation for the market as a whole, the factors influencing the probability of a firm’s survival, such as financial intermediation paths, should serve to decrease the probability of survival for firms that should naturally die out from the market. We investigate whether this phenomenon occurs in the real world. Within the context of this investigation, it was appropriate to examine the ways in which the enormous stimulus package from the Chinese government (i.e., 4 trillion RMB or ~570 billion USD) to address the shock arising from the 2008 financial crisis influenced the probability of firms’ survivals in China. The statistical evidence outlined in this study shows that access to bank loans led to a decrease in the risk of failure (i.e., dying out from market) for the relatively poorly performing and large-size firms.Footnote 2 The finding that short-term bank loans diminished the risk of failure for the poorly performing and large-sized firms suggests that the distortion of the financial intermediation function as a result of the 2008 financial crisis can be attributed to lending by banks to firms, which is the primary business of the banking sector. Based on strict econometric analysis, this study found that zombie firms, as portrayed by the media, undeniably came into existence as a result of the financial crisis and subsequent fiscal expansion, particularly with respect to manufacturing enterprises in China, which are examined by this current investigation. This study was innovative in two respects. First, the researchers highlight the indirect, though persistent, influence of the financial crisis on a national economy. More specifically, this empirical study successfully provided evidence that the revival of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) distorted financial intermediation in China following the financial crisis in 2008, whereas previously these conclusions had been solely anecdotal. A more detailed analysis has been presented by identifying the specific types of SOEs, determining the degree to which inefficient financial allocation was bolstered in China following the financial crisis, and examining which types of SOEs were revived as a result of the distorted financial intermediation. Second, by comparing the influence of bank loans on the survival probability of firms before and after the financial crisis, this study has clearly illustrated the way in which such distortion of financial intermediation and the resulting revival of SOEs also gave rise to distorted selection mechanisms in the Chinese market. The main findings of this study are as follows. First, following the 2008 financial crisis, the distortion of financial intermediation became a more serious issue in the Chinese economy. Second, however, any poorly performing SOE was not necessarily bailed out and allowed to survive through the provision of various kinds of bank loans in the distorted financial intermediation. Even after 2007, banks tended to provide or reschedule less risky short-term loans for SOEs that needed to be bailed out. Furthermore, although the SOEs targeted for a bailout showed relatively poor performance, the poorest performing SOEs were not bailed out by means of access to additional bank loans or loan rescheduling. Third, it should be noted that, all in all, distorted financial intermediation allowed the poorly performing firms to survive in the market, which directly suggests the distortion of the market selection mechanisms. To the best of our understanding, within the general context of emerging and developing economies, this study presents the first empirical analysis of the way in which the provision by banks of inefficient loans to poorly performing firms served to enable the market survival of firms that should otherwise have failed; that is, they should have died out. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. See “Literature Review and Conceptual Framework” section reviews the literature and shows the conceptual framework of our investigation. Our hypotheses are developed in see “Hypothesis Development” section. See “Empirical Models” section provides our empirical models. See “Data and Descriptive Statistics” section explains the data used for the empirical models. See “Estimation Results” section shows the estimation results.

64,2,Comparative Economic Studies,03 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-021-00180-1,"Wage Bargaining Coordination, Taxation and Labor Costs: The Effects of Fiscal Devaluation",June 2022,Mario Holzner,Maruška Vizek,Goran Vukšić,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The effect of taxes on labor costs is an important topic in the literature on institutions and labor markets. This research often analyzes the impact of a broad measure of labor taxes, the total tax wedge between real product wages and real consumption wages, which includes personal income tax, employers’ and employees’ social security contributions and consumption taxes. Thus, real product wages correspond to real labor costs of workers to the employer, while real consumption wages correspond to real net wages of employees. Some studies analyze the effects of single segments of the total tax wedge and examine whether shifts between different parts of the tax burden on labor have effects on labor costs and unemployment. In this paper we explore the effects of a tax shift from employers’ social security contributions (SCR) to a value added tax (VAT) on real labor costs. Such a policy is sometimes referred to as fiscal devaluation, as it can mimic the effects of a nominal exchange rate devaluation and improve devaluing countries’ trade balances by using fiscal instruments.Footnote 1 A cut in the SCR rate should enhance cost competitiveness of domestic producers as compared to their competitors abroad. Simultaneously, a VAT hike would reduce domestic real incomes and consumption, and thus, imports, without affecting the price competitiveness of exporters. As fiscal devaluation can be designed in a budget-neutral way, it is an appealing instrument for countries facing both fiscal constraints and competitiveness challenges that do not have an option of implementing a nominal exchange rate devaluation. Fiscal devaluation as a policy option was discussed particularly during the unfolding of the eurozone crisis since late 2009 for South-European economies with competitiveness problems (see, e.g., Koske 2013; or IMF 2011). It was expected to speed up the socially and politically painful process of adjustment of prices and wages and thus mitigate the undesirable social consequences of high unemployment (IMF 2011; 2015; Kang and Shambaugh, 2016). In particular, former Argentinian Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo suggested fiscal devaluation lessons from Argentina to Greece, Portugal and Spain (Cavallo and Cottani 2010a, b). Argentina implemented related fiscal policies (Bonvecchi, 2010) with an aim to improve competitiveness back in 2001, when the country was in a comparable situation as for instance Greece during the eurozone crisis. Both the IMF (2011) and the ECB (2011) recommended it as a tool for economic adjustment. The policy was considered for a while in Portugal but has later been put aside (Economist 2011). Croatia actually implemented a fiscal devaluation in 2012, but the cut in the SCR rate was reversed already in 2014 (Vukšić and Holzner 2016). Spain implemented tax changes during 2010 that are considered by Bernoth et al. (2014) to be a fiscal devaluation, although it involved a rather small decline in the rate of contributions.Footnote 2 Fiscal devaluation was further debated and suggested as part of the necessary policy mix (Shambaugh, 2012 and Economist 2012) to counter the crisis in the peripheral euro area members, but with little success in implementation. Instead of pro-growth policies, the path of austerity and painful internal devaluation has been taken. With the more recent paradigm shift in macroeconomic and fiscal policy discussions and the widely accepted understanding that austerity is not helpful in solving economic crises, policy discussions involving fiscal devaluation might gain again in importance. While earlier research provides insights on the mechanism of the relationship between taxation and labor costs in general, here we specifically test the effects of a tax shift constituting a fiscal devaluation on real labor costs that are assumed in the related theoretical and simulation studies. We do so for the sample of 23 countries of the European Union (EU) and over the period between 2001 and 2018. The choice of the sample was determined by the intention to perform the study on a sample used in the earlier empirical work that confirmed the impact of fiscal devaluation on the trade balances (in Holzner et al. 2018) and given data availability constraints. We use a rather standard empirical approach, controlling for the influence of other macroeconomic and institutional variables, in particular of different wage bargaining systems. Our results show that some features of wage bargaining system are crucial for the impact of taxes on labor costs. In particular, we find that fiscal devaluation is an effective tool in countries with intermediate and low coordination in the wage-setting process. This institutional characteristic largely correlates with the level of wage bargaining, where a tax shift from SCR to VAT is found to be effective only for countries with a predominantly low level of wage bargaining. Similarly, these groups of countries are often those with lower union density and lower scores in a corporatism index. In other countries, mainly those with highly coordinated wage bargaining systems, there should be less need for fiscal devaluation in the first place, as these countries should be able to influence real labor costs via coordinated incomes policy. We begin with a selective overview of related research that first provides a more detailed description of the fiscal devaluation literature, which is followed by a review of both theoretical and empirical literature on the incidence of labor taxation. We then present our sample and the empirical approach, which is followed by the results of our econometric work. The last section summarizes the results and the main conclusions.",
64,3,Comparative Economic Studies,23 November 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-021-00177-w,40 Years of Dutch Disease Literature: Lessons for Developing Countries,September 2022,Edouard Mien,Michaël Goujon,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Structural transformation, defined as the reallocation of productive factors across sectors in the economy and the subsequent change in the sectoral shares of value-added in GDP, has played a central role in explaining economic divergence across developing countries in recent decades (McMillan et al., 2014). Nevertheless, while integration into globalization is a commonly followed process, the reasons why structural change patterns differ across countries are still not fully understood. A fairly old explanation for this difference is the exploitation and export of natural resources, which are heterogeneously distributed across the world and which can strongly influence structural change through the so-called Dutch disease (DD). In broad terms, DD occurs when a resource boom reduces the internal incentives to produce, and/or the international competitiveness of, domestically produced non-resource tradable (exportable and importable) goods. It can be defined as “the resource-induced revaluation of the real exchange rate” (Paldam, 2013) and the subsequent decline in the non-resource tradable sector. DD was a popular explanation for the de-industrialization process experienced by several resource-rich developed countries in the 1970s and 1980s. However, from the 1990s, DD progressively faded in favor of the encompassing concept of “Resource Curse” (Auty, 1993) which more generally explains why many resource-rich countries experience weak economic growth. Literature reviews that specifically focus on DD remain rare, but the study of resource curse has resulted in an abundant literature and several literature reviews, which usually include a section on DD considering it to be a channel of the curse (van der Ploeg, 2011; Gilberthorpe & Papyrakis, 2015; Badeeb et al., 2017). The “curse” or “disease” concepts are arguably as negative as each other, but DD, contrary to resource curse, should not be analyzed as an inherently growth-reducing phenomenon but rather as a driver of structural transformation. DD models imply that non-resource tradable sectors decline while non-tradable sectors expand. Since these effects are the consequence of increasing resource revenues, final average revenues per capita are expected to be higher after the boom even in the presence of DD. Hence, it is tempting to define DD only as a shift from one equilibrium to another, and not as a ""disease"" for the economy. This might explain the recent shift from the analysis of DD to the study of resource curse. However, by transforming the structure of the economy, DD also durably affects average labor productivity (by reducing incentives to invest in human capital and in activities with potentially high productivity gains), fiscal policy (by shifting taxation from non-resource to resource sectors), inequalities (by shifting wealth from non-resource to resource sectors), and even demography (by encouraging urbanization). Therefore, there is a continuing interest in studying DD per se and in understanding its main consequences and policy options. DD has been studied for 40 years but is still the object of theoretical, empirical, and policy debates. To our knowledge, Nülle and Davis (2018) is the only survey of DD literature. Our article differs from Nülle and Davis in several ways. First, we focus on developing countries, because most of the recent empirical literature on DD has targeted these countries. Then, we review the large theoretical literature that emerged at the beginning of the 1980s, the diversity of DD models, and different sets of assumptions they use, whereas Nülle and Davis follow the initial model of Corden and Neary (1982) and the model of learning-by-doing effects proposed by Torvik (2001). Finally, while they argue that DD is the exception rather than the rule, we find more mixed conclusions. We also consider the conditions which allow or prevent DD, and the public policies that can be implemented against it. There is a large theoretical and empirical literature on DD, much more than can be covered in a single review of literature. Thus, we made two choices in this survey. First, we restrict the empirical sections to cover only developing countries. Due to a renewed interest in structural transformation issues and the observation of some cases of growth without industrialization, the DD hypothesis has regained relevance in the study of the development process, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America (Orvoty & Jibrilla, 2019). Even if there is a large literature on some industrialized countries (such as Canada, Norway, or the UK), DD appears to be more prevalent in developing countries. This is explained by the fact that natural resources represent a higher share of total revenues in these countries and that they often lack political or economic institutions that can effectively prevent DD. Second, we focus on the DD caused by natural resources only. In the 1990s, other sources of revenues were studied as drivers of DD, for instance, international aid, migrants’ remittances, or tourism. However, the mechanisms behind DD can vary according to the source of the revenue inflows. Focusing on DD caused by natural resources booms allows consistent comparisons across countries and so proposals for policy recommendations for resource-rich developing countries. Moreover, the 2000s and 2010s have seen big changes in international prices of natural resources and a multiplication of mineral and oil discoveries. This has led to new entries of small and developing countries into the group of resource-rich economies (see Fig. 1), making the need to understand the impact of natural resources even more acute. Natural resources rents in the world (average 2002–2018) Our aim is to survey the theoretical and empirical literature related to DD caused by natural resources revenues in developing countries, outline the main policy options, and present the unresolved issues. This paper is organized as follows: ""Brief History"" section sums up the history of the DD issues, recalls the difference between DD and resource curse, and explains why DD remains relevant in understanding structural transformation. ""Modeling Dutch Disease"" section describes the basic Corden–Neary model and its relevant variations for the study of small developing countries. ""Testing Dutch Disease"" section presents the evidence for DD in the empirical literature on developing countries. ""Responding to Dutch Disease"" section presents the main lessons and policy implications.",5

While the more developed countries of the Central Europe managed to recover from the chaotic monetary perturbations of the 90s’ economic transformation, the former Soviet Union (FSU) states still appear to be entangled in deleterious processes of never-ending currency crushes and volatility. An extensive amount of academic research has already been dedicated to those sorrowful events of abrupt devaluations and subsequent real economy downfalls common for the FSU countries in the twenty-first century; the unveiled explanations vary depending on the concrete situations in the individual countries, but usually include the discrepancies between monetary and fiscal policies, incorrect choice of the exchange rate regime, repercussions of the unconventional political experiments and inability (or unwillingness) to adjust the exchange rate policy to the external shocks (Korhonen and Wachtel 2006; Vinokurov et al. 2017; Barseghyan and Baghdasaryan 2019). In this paper, we lean towards a more general approach to explaining and predicting the currency crises in the FSU nations, employing a well-known but frequently overlooked technique—the analysis of the real exchange rate (RER) misalignments from their equilibrium values. The validity of such method has been established several decades ago, when RER development was discovered to be a relatively reliable indicator of upcoming monetary crises in the emblematic paper by Kaminsky et al. (1998). However, the outputs of its empirical verification remain rather scarceFootnote 1—the works by Holtemoller and Mallick (2013) and Vinokurov et al. (2017) stand as notable exceptions. This paper is an attempt at testing the feasibility of such technique with an ex-post identification of the misalignments between the actual RERs and various types of equilibrium exchange rates. After the estimation of the equilibriums, we compute and compare the misalignments that the FSU countries’ RERs induced before, during and after the crises; and regress the misalignments on the crisis episodes as explanatory variables to assess the linkages between the misalignments and currency constrictions. The paper is structured as follows. “Currency crises in the former Soviet Union” section surveys the literature on exchange rate policies and development in the FSU countries and outlines the basic phases of their RER evolution. The nexus between the RER misalignments and currency crises is briefly discussed in “Real exchange rates and currency crises” section. Subsequently, we describe the utilized theoretical construct of the equilibrium real exchange rates (ERER) and estimate it for a sample of 10 FSU states for the period of 2000–2019 using the frameworks of behavioural equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) and its out-of-sample and in-sample estimation; and natural real exchange rate (NATREX). It allows to identify and calculate the RER misalignments in the periods preceding, during and after the currency crisis spells in the region; and evaluate the potential impact of crisis-related events of the misalignments. By doing that, we establish the linkages between the misalignments and crises that would indicate the RER predictive capacity in regard to future currency crises. Our results offer the plausible explanation of the currency crises in the FSU countries springing from the increase in RER deviations from the equilibrium path with limited regard to the theoretical underpinnings behind the computation of the specific ERERs.",1

Democracy, Corruption and Foreign Direct Investments in Sino-African Economic Relations",September 2022,Sargis Karavardanyan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"How does openness to foreign direct investments (FDI) from China and ROW influence democratization in domestic markets of African countries overtime? Why some African countries that obtained high levels of Chinese FDI experienced more democratization than others? The impact of Chinese enterprises on institutions in African continent has been under severe scrutiny from academics and policy experts alike in recent years (Mourao 2018; Chen et al. 2018; Sanfilippo 2010). The scholarly community is divided into two camps on the role of China’s economic presence in Africa. Some scholars suggest that China deliberately selects states with weak governance in order to make a swift entrance into the local economic sectors of resource rich countries (Alden and Alves 2008; Bodomo 2009; Adolph et al. 2017). As a counterargument, other scholars propose that Chinese FDI investments have advanced the infrastructural development, manufacturing in different industries, and economic growth in Africa (Whalley and Weisbrod 2012; Amighini and Sanfilippo 2014; NguyenHuu and Schwiebert 2019). Some even suggest that healthy business environments and stable institutions are major motivators for Chinese FDI in African countries (Borojo and Yushi 2020). Local institutions in the destination country are decisive for attracting or discouraging foreign capital as some investors enter offshore markets having higher demands for stable and efficient socio-political foundations than others (Bailey 2018; Alence 2004). The previous research examining the relationship between institutions and FDI demonstrates that developing countries which have a better democratic political process (Busse et al. 2016), low inflation (Farazmand and Moradi 2014), economic growth (Acquah and Ibrahim 2020), low corruption (Gossel 2018), ongoing institutional reforms (Malikane and Chitambara 2017), availability of local resources for productive markets (Pinto and Zhu 2016), rich natural resources (Shan et al. 2018) and significant human development (Reiter and Steensma 2010) attract larger inflows of foreign capital from China and other economic partners. The research investigating how Chinese investments shape democratization in African countries in the long and short terms remains limited. The economic activities by Chinese investors in African countries have drawn a widescale attention from the global community. Chinese investments in the capital and production markets of African countries have grown substantially in the recent decades as China continues to stretch its powerful economic wings (Eisenman 2012; Broich 2017). The existing empirical studies exploring China’s foreign direct investments in Africa offer conflicting theoretical expectations for the effects of FDI on democratic development. Some show that resources and market potentials are important determinants of Chinese investments in African states (Shan et al. 2018; Pinto and Zhu 2016; Sanfilippo 2010; Pinto and Zhu 2016). The abundance of natural resources like oil and copper and large markets for agricultural goods and services production can further deepen the resource curse in Africa delaying democratization. This problem could worsen if Chinese state sponsored and independent investors approach African markets by proposing weak regulatory policies that can produce additional adverse effects on the society (Humphrey and Michaelowa 2019). Other scholars suggest that Chinese economic cooperation projects can lower the costs for improving the internal and external infrastructure in Africa (NguyenHuu and Schwiebert 2019; Busse et al. 2016). The persistent corruption in many African countries serves as an impediment for much needed economic growth from foreign investments (Quazi et al. 2014) as those investments increase in states with strong institutional capacity (Gossel 2018). Since the lack of accountability and institutions for checks and balances as well as the presence of pervasive corruption all hamper economic prosperity from foreign investments (Bougharriou et al. 2019), there are variations in long- and short-term temporal effects on democracy that are critical for more systematic investigation (Dinh et al. 2019). This paper aims to fill the gap in the growing research focusing on the impact of Chinese FDI openness in Africa while controlling for openness to other investment partners. We present a theory which hypothesizes that liberalization to Chinese FDI will yield different long- and short-term effects on democracy in African countries with various levels of corruption. Our main argument is that the effect that openness to FDI makes on democratic institutions is moderated by regime corruption. As such, following some related theoretical frameworks designed by Gossel (2018), Mourao (2018), Quazi et al. (2014), Bak and Moon (2016) and Borojo and Yushi (2020) who explore various relationships between FDI openness/flows/stocks and institutional qualities, we argue that openness to foreign investments will allow for more inclusionary politics and property rights protection hence more democratization over the years. As such, we theorize that in the short run, the democratic institutions will suffer from the potential exploitation of foreign capital from China and elsewhere to Africa by local elites who receive and manage those investments. However, in the long run, we expect African countries to experience more democratization as the society will benefit from spillovers of investment projects. To closely model the anticipated mitigating impact of regime corruption within the FDI openness and democracy nexus we refer to two prominent and competing hypotheses, the grabbing hand and helping hand. The grabbing hand hypotheses suggests that the uncertainty surrounding corruption increases the costs of investments for foreign firms (Quazi et al. 2014). While the helping hand hypothesis proposes that fraudulent tactics such as bribery, relaxed labor taxes, and low market entry barriers serve as a helping hand to make a swift route for foreign investors into local markets of recipient countries (Gossel 2018). The empirically supported conclusions regarding these hypotheses are largely inconclusive with scholars providing some evidence in both directions at different levels of corruption (Egger and Winner 2005). Unlike the previous studies that view these theories as conflicting, we argue that there is an inter-related association between the two. We argue that strategic yet corrupt entrepreneurs in domestic markets will utilize the advantages of the helping hand of corruption to allure investments (Fredriksson et al. 2003). Nevertheless, the properties of the grabbing hand of corruption will become more prevalent when they extract more rents by exploiting foreign capital for personal use (Marquette and Peiffer 2018). The latter tactic, as our framework and results reveal, is more harmful for the democratization in African countries. The novelty of our theoretical approach is twofold. First, unlike some existing works in this field of research we argue that operating through FDI’s impact, the short-term effects of market openness will produce negative effects on democracy. This outcome itself will validate the presence of the grabbing hand influences of corruption in domestic investment markets in the short term. Yet, in the long run, the effects of FDI openness on democracy will become positive because once the foreign investors get used to corrupt methods in foreign destinations and realize that those practices do not harm their potential to accumulate wealth, they will become complacent and invest more. The research shows that high levels of investments are positively associated with democratization (Moon 2019; Bak and Moon 2016). Second, we suggest that the effects of the grabbing and helping hands of corruption work in cycles. As illustrated in Table 1, we theorize that when the grabbing hand aspects are present then FDI openness has short- and long-term negative effects on democracy. However, we notice that when the helping hand features are at work the short- and long-run effects are positive. By contrast, the grabbing hand theory will be prevalent. With the theoretical framework developed in this paper, we also aim to examine whether the arguments criticizing China’s “no strings attached” economic cooperation in African countries with weak institutions have any empirical basis for validation. To probe the key assumptions of our theory, we build on existing studies from Quazi et al. (2014), Bak and Moon (2016), Malikane and Chitambara (2017), Gossel (2018) (Mourao, 2018), Henri et al. (2019), Dinh et al. (2019) and Kucera and Principi (2014) and design static and dynamic models which examine the long- and short-run effects of Chinese FDI on democracy levels in Africa, respectively. The static models testing the long-term trends of democratic transition employ two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression approach. In the first stage, we account for transaction costs and endogeneity problems by instrumenting the Chinese FDI openness and openness to the rest of the world (ROW) with traditional gravity model variables such as distance, landlock and common language (Borojo and Yushi 2020; Subasat and Bellos 2013; Bellos and Subasat 2012a, b). Following (López-Córdova and Meissner 2008), in the second stage we use the predicted values of instrumented economic variables to investigate their impact on our unique measure of democracy. To tease out the influence of FDI openness on democracy that is due to changing levels of corruption, we employ interaction terms between Chinese or ROW FDI openness and regime corruption index. To inspect the short-term effects, we follow Henri et al. (2019), Gossel (2018), and Quazi et al. (2014) and use system generalized method of moments (GMM) approach to build models that include both contemporaneous and lagged values of democracy index and FDI openness. We also include the interaction terms in our dynamic models. Using an unbalanced panel data over the period 2003–2017 for 48 African countries in our observed sample, we find mixed results on how investment liberalizations to China and ROW influence democratization in African countries with different levels of corruption in long and short run. The results in main models where the dependent variable is a composite democracy index from the Varieties of Democracy show that, after accounting for exogenous causes, when corrupt African regimes liberalize to Chinese FDI the democracy decreases in the long run which is against our hypothesized direction. However, as we expect there is a negative short-run relationship between democracy and Chinese FDI openness in African countries with high levels of corruption. Regarding the FDI openness to ROW, we find that in the long run the impact on democracy is positive as we hypothesized. The impact is still negative in the short run which is contrary to our expectations. An important finding delivered by our results is that the effects of FDI openness highly vary depending on the measurement, operationalization and sources of the dependent variable, the democracy. For example, our robustness analysis reveals that while Chinese FDI openness negatively impacts some variables of democratic indices, it has a positive effect on others. Additionally, following Quazi et al. (2014), we check for the unit root and address its presence by making it stationary in some of the explanatory variables in order to bypass inaccurate estimations that could be driven by random noise in our stochastic process. To save space, more details on the procedures and methodological techniques we took for tackling this issue are outlined in Supplementary Materials of this article that are available  online. This article proceeds as follows. The first section reviews the existing empirical literature on short- and long-term relationships between FDI, corruption, institutions and democracy. In this section, we also discuss China’s investments in Africa as well as the role of corruption in African countries for attracting FDI. The second section introduces the theoretical motivation behind the analytical framework surrounding the divergent relationship between FDI and democracy in Africa in long and short terms. This section also produces testable hypotheses derived from the main conceptual framework. “Research design and econometric models” section presents and describes the research design and econometrics models. This section also describes the data for main dependent and independent variables by interpreting some descriptive statistics. Also, in “Research design and econometric models” section, we discuss the instrument validity and explain study limitations. Section 4 discusses the main econometric outcomes of the static (long-term) and dynamic (short-term) models. “Robustness analysis” section defines the robustness check strategies and estimation procedures and presents explanation on the results of those estimations. “Discussion and implications of findings” section discusses the magnitude and implications of our key findings. “Policy recommendations and future research” section offers policy recommendations and suggests improvements for future research. Lastly, we conclude by summarizing the contributions of this article.",1

It involves the misuse of public office by engaging in practices involving bribery, embezzlement, tax evasion, collusion, cronyism, or other similar activities for private gains. In recent years, the consequences of corruption on banking performance have received renewed attention in the literature. The first strand of literature argues in line with the “sand the wheel hypothesis” (see for instance Shleifer and Vishny 1993; Mauro 1995; Gupta et al. 2002; Aidt 2009) that corruption may hamper banks’ ability to efficiently allocate capital to the most productive users. Thus, corruption could constitute an impediment to bank performance and decrease efficiency. Park (2012), for instance, shows that greater corruption exacerbates the problem with non-performing loans in the banking sector while Chen et al. (2015) document that rampant corruption increases banks’ risk-taking behaviour. The second stream of literature suggests that corruption may be efficiency enhancing as it creates the incentives for banks to perform or helps to overcome complex regulations, in line with the “grease the wheels hypothesis”. For example, Fungáčová et al. (2015) find that high corruption can increase firms’ bank debt ratio, providing evidence that bribing bank officials enhance firms’ ability to access credit from banks. Similarly, Weill (2011) documents that corruption can improve bank lending particularly when banks are highly risk averse and reluctant to grant credit. One key question in the corruption-bank performance nexus is whether corruption has an impact on banks’ costs. Indeed, a predominant theme that emerges from the evidence is that high levels of corruption in a country induce greater uncertainty regarding the costs of doing business (Kaufmann 1997; Wei 1997; Blackburn and Forgues-Puccio 2009). Does the increased uncertainty in costs due to high corruption have an impact on bank performance? The objective of this paper is to fill this gap by examining the effect of corruption on banks’ costs. This question is particularly important given the significant role of banks’ ability to operate at minimal costs in economic development. It enables banks to operate through lower loan rates (Shamshur and Weill 2019), enhances financial stability (Assaf et al. 2019) and fosters economic growth (Hasan et al. 2009). Thus, understanding how corruption affects bank costs is crucial given the primal role that can be played by the banking sector in stimulating economic development. From a theoretical perspective, the impact of corruption on bank costs is ambiguous. On the one hand, banks operating in corrupt countries are expected to have higher costs for two reasons. First, high levels of corruption in a country may increase the costs associated with bribery. In a corrupt environment, banks may incur extra costs in the form of bribery in order get things done.Footnote 1 For example, obtaining necessary licenses and permits in a corrupt country would require negotiating and paying bribes to public officials. As Glass and Wu (2002, p. 3) point out, corruption is usually related with “an extra fee or bribe paid to a government official by a private entrepreneur for obtaining an economic profit”. Increased corruption may therefore act as an irregular tax that raises banks’ costs. Second, excessive corruption in an economy may lead to misallocation of bank funds from productive investment projects to less efficient and risky ones thereby increasing the amount of bank non-performing loans, which has been empirically confirmed by Goel and Hasan (2011) and Park (2012). Consequently, the deterioration in asset quality could induce banks to devote extra managerial efforts and further incur additional expenses on the collection of the problem loans (Berger and DeYoung 1997). The escalation in operating costs due to the administration of the bad loans, in turn, may result in a decline in banks’ ability to minimise costs. On the other hand, corruption may not always be detrimental to banks’ costs. In a second-best world, corruption may help to overcome distortions created by ill-functioning institutions (Leff 1964; Huntington 1968). It may serve as a helping hand to speed up decision-making process and enhance efficiency in resources allocation.Footnote 2 Corruption may therefore decrease costs if bribes allow banks to avoid significant fees and time cost or finance the best projects. For example, Chen et al. (2013) find that bribery enhances banks’ decisions to grant larger loans to the most productive firms. Corruption may thus be the needed grease to improve banks’ costs. In sum, whether corruption increases or decreases banks’ costs is ultimately an empirical question we seek to address. In this paper, we shed light on this question by investigating whether corruption affects bank costs. We adopt the efficiency frontier techniques to measure bank costs. The cost efficiency of a bank measures the ability of a bank to produce a certain level of output whiles minimising costs. It therefore provides information about the bank performance to produce with the minimum costs by comparing a bank’s costs to that of the best-practice bank. Unlike accounting ratios like the cost-to-income ratio, using frontier techniques to measure how a bank minimises its costs offers the advantage of simultaneously taking into account all the inputs and outputs of a bank. To examine whether corruption influences bank cost efficiency, we perform a cross-country analysis using a broad sample of 2256 commercial banks in 126 countries for the 2011–2018 period. We employ the stochastic frontier approach to estimate bank efficiency, a technique which has been widely adopted in the literature (Bonin et al. 2005; Shamshur and Weill 2019). We combine the estimated cost efficiency scores along with corruption measures from Transparency International and a set of bank-level and country-level control variables to investigate the impact of corruption on bank efficiency. We further assess whether the link between corruption and bank efficiency may vary according to bank size and a country’s level of development. The results show that corruption influences banking efficiency. We find evidence of a negative effect of increased corruption on bank cost efficiency. We further find that this negative effect is linear: too low or too high corruption levels have detrimental effects on bank efficiency. Additionally, the results show that the impact of corruption on bank efficiency does not vary with bank size and the level of a country’s development. These results are confirmed in a battery of robustness tests. Overall, our findings suggest that corruption constitutes an impediment to banks’ ability to efficiently minimise their costs. Our paper contributes to the literature in two areas. First, it contributes to the vast literature on the determinants of bank cost efficiency (e.g. Weill 2003; Pasiouras et al. 2009; Chortareas et al. 2012) by investigating the role of corruption, which has been ignored until now. The closest paper to ours is Lensink and Meesters (2014) who examine the impact of institutions on bank efficiency. They focus on institutional quality and measure it by applying principal component analysis on the six World Governance Indicators. Our contribution significantly departs from this work as we focus explicitly on the consequences of corruption and not on the quality of institutions in a country. Our study therefore constitutes the first attempt, as far as we know, to extensively examine the impact of corruption on the cost efficiency of banks. Second, our work contributes to a better understanding of how corruption influences the banking sector. A growing number of studies have examined the consequences of corruption on various aspects of banking activities (e.g. Weill 2011; Park 2012; Chen et al. 2015). We add to this discussion by investigating how corruption impacts bank cost efficiency and draws lessons for banking sector policy. The structure of the remaining parts of the paper is as follows: In ""Data and Methodology"", we discuss the data and empirical strategy. ""Results presents results of the estimations. Robustness tests are discussed in ""Robustness Checks"". ""Concluding remarks"" concludes the paper.",3
64,4,Comparative Economic Studies,23 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-022-00201-7,On the Origins and Persistent Effects of the World’s First Meritocratic Institution,December 2022,James Kai-sing Kung,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"For some time, the importance of the effect of institutions on economic outcomes has been well-rehearsed under the corpus of literature popularly known as “New Institutional Economics.”Footnote 1 While few would disagree with Douglass North’s persuasive proposition that “institutions matter (for economic performance),” it was only two decades ago when Acemoglu et al. (2001) elegantly demonstrated the causal bearing of institutions on long-term economic performance in “the colonial origins of comparative development.”Footnote 2 Since then, their seminal article has influenced empirical research into institutions and culture so profoundly that studies of comparative historical development have flourished to this day.Footnote 3 It is thus obvious that my endeavor to examine the persistent effects of China’s civil service examination system (“keju”)—the longest-lasting meritocratic bureaucracy in China and the world’s first—on human capital outcomes today (Chen et al. 2020) was premised on the concept that historical institutions can generate either direct or indirect long-lasting effects through the cultural traits that they foster.Footnote 4 As remarked elsewhere, China failed both to undergo an industrial revolution and to adopt the “constraints on the executive,” but nonetheless “was the first in the world to have developed a meritocratic bureaucracy” (Kung 2021, p.159; see also Landes, 1998; Stasavage, 2011). The key question, from this perspective, is what makes meritocracy an important topic, worthy of scholarly attention? Meritocracy is arguably important because it is broadly concerned with what North (1990) termed the “rules of the game”—rules that have implications for incentives and economic performance. Consider the four qualities or virtues that Adrian Woodridge (2021) recently laid out when writing on this subject. To him, meritocracy ought to embrace a socially mobile society based on natural talents; to allocate job opportunities based on open competition; to reduce if not entirely eliminate discrimination based on observable traits; and, in order to allow the former conditions to operate smoothly, to provide education to all. These virtues are important as they allegedly lay at the heart of “the four great revolutions that created the modern world” (p.11).Footnote 5 But meritocracy is not without its critics. For example, Markovits (2019) criticizes meritocracy for having turned into a “trap,” as seemingly meritocratic societies have begun to transmit inherited privilege from one generation to another through the channel of elite education, blocking social mobility (see also Sandel 2020; Young 1958). Like the criticism made by Bourdieu and Passeron (1990) of the reproduction of elites through education and culture in France, these criticisms are directed not so much at the virtues of meritocracy but rather their prevention from being realized in a society that espouses its intrinsic values. To the extent that meritocracy is seen in a positive light, I aim at three goals in this essay. First, I provide a detailed assessment of whether the civil service examination system in imperial China qualified as a meritocracy, based on a descriptive analysis of the institution that evolved during the Song dynasty (c. 987–1267CE). Second, in the light of the fact that meritocracy emerged in imperial China long before either the French Revolution or the Industrial Revolution (Hobsbawm 1996), I provide a narrative of its origins based largely on the account of Chen and Kung (2022). Specifically, I show that (1) the civil service examination system had indeed become more meritocratic by several of the yardsticks mentioned above; and (2) the genesis of this meritocratic bureaucracy was largely an “accident.” Specifically, it came about as a consequence of both a “commercial revolution” and the accompanying rise of a merchant class who collectively fought for their children to be qualified for the examination (“inclusivity” in short), and a founding Song emperor who tried to dismantle the military, who fought with him in a coup, by expanding the civil service examinations greatly. Last, but not least, I provide a summary of the existing findings on keju’s persistent effects on both human capital outcomes (Chen et al. 2020) and occupational choice (Kung 2021).",1

At the national level, the dynamics of inequality in economic and social well-being have been largely documented and comparatively evaluated (Barrios et al. 2019; Dobson and Ramlogan 2002; Galvao and Reis Gomes 2007). Therefore, given the development gaps across countries in South America, studying inequality per se is of utmost importance. Moreover, in a continent that is aiming to integrate, the study of regional convergence is also important to systematically monitor  the degree of socio-economic integration. Relatively free movement of labor, similar institutions and common historical legacies are among the shared characteristics of the regions of South America. For these reasons, regional convergence is to a certain extent expected. Nevertheless,  regional convergence is rarely a smooth process, and caveats and heterogeneous processes need to be thoroughly documented and explained. In order to unveil whether regional convergence in well-being is taking place across South American subnational regions, this paper exploits a novel dataset to evaluate the dynamics of economic and social well-being across the first-level subnational regions of South America. The paper’s main contribution highlights the role of the spatial dimension on the regional dynamics of well-being. Specifically, the paper evaluates the role of spatial dependence as well as spatial heterogeneity in accelerating the process of regional convergence in gross national income per capita (GNI) and the human development index (HDI). Well-being is measured based on the human development index as proposed by the United Nations. Specifically, this paper uses a subnational version of the human development index and one of its components: gross national income per capita. This new dataset allows us to consistently evaluate social and economic inequalities across 151 subnational regions of South America over the 1990–2018 period. Compared to previous studies, this dataset provides a richer setting for evaluating the relationship between well-being and spatial effects in South America (Martín-Mayoral and Zúñiga 2013; Barrios et al. 2019; Galvao and Reis Gomes 2007; Dobson and Ramlogan 2002). Previous studies that focus on subnational-level data for a single country usually fail to thoroughly identify statistically significant and robust spatial effects, in part because of the reduced number of subnational units in a single country (Royuela and Garcia 2015; Magalhães et al. 2005; Resende 2013). In this paper, we use one of the largest and latest regional datasets available to overcome these limitations (Smits and Permanyer 2019). Furthermore, this paper also speaks to the literature that deals with testing regional convergence across multiple contries. This literature on multi-country convergence has been recently expanding (Lessmann and Seidel 2017; Mendez and Santos-Marquez 2020; Ayouba et al. 2020) in line with the discussion by Rey and Janikas (2005). These authors indicate that despite the large body of studies on inequality and convergence for single countries, very few studies compare rates of regional convergences across multiple countries. Furthermore, Rey and Janikas (2005) point out that studying the role of space in the dynamics of different continental systems is a promising research question for future studies. In terms of analytical methods, this paper uses a spatial convergence model to study the dynamics of regional inequality and spatial effects. Specifically, convergence is usually defined as a process in which initially poor regions tend to grow faster than initially rich regions. In regards to a regression model, this process implies that the initial level of a variable shows an inverse relationship with its subsequent growth rate. The role of spatial dependence in the convergence process is evaluated using spatial error and the spatial lag models (Akçagün 2017; Arbia 2006; Rey and Montouri 1999). In addition, the role of spatial heterogeneity is evaluated using a geographically weighted regression framework (Brunsdon et al. 1996; Eckey et al. 2007; Öcal and Yildirim 2010). Overall, our results indicate that for both GNI and HDI, there is an ongoing process of regional convergence; moreover, spatial effects play an important role in this process. The first set of results points to the role of spatial dependence on the speed of regional convergence. A spatial error specification indicates that spatial dependence accelerates the speed of convergence in some decades, but decelerates it in others. The second set of results points to the role of spatial heterogeneity in the convergence process. For both GNI and HDI, the speed of convergence is largely heterogeneous across space. Specifically, economic and social disparities are characterized by multi-country spatial clusters that show strongly localized converging and diverging trends. The results of this paper contribute to the literature of spatial dependence and regional convergence in South America in three fronts. First, we use a novel dataset of well-being and income to test the degree of regional convergence. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze convergence patterns across multiple countries in South America. Lastly, by dividing the sample in different sub-periods, this paper shows that the convergence process has not been smooth and the speed of convergence has significantly varied over time. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the related literature. In Sect. 3, the well-being and income data are described, and the methods of regional convergence, spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity are briefly explained. Section 4 presents the results of the spatial analysis of regional convergence. Lastly, Sect. 5 offers some concluding remarks.",2

Despite attempts to reduce political influence, policymakers cannot completely ignore the political consequences of their policies. These consequences are particularly important in the democratic context, with the presence of political competition and constitutional protections (Burrier 2018). The political connections of firms are well documented in the literature. However, the specific impact of political patronage on banks is less studied. In fact, this phenomenon can affect non-financial firms as well as banks. But unlike other firms, banks play an essential role in the overall economy. In emerging markets, banks play a crucial role as a major source of financing, and even more so in the economy as a whole, by establishing the stability of the financial system as a whole (Omran et al. 2008). In addition, banks earn higher profits and are implicitly supported by the state in case of failure. Thus, banks invest in political connections because the benefits that these connections would bring them are higher than the cost they would bear. It is important to note, then, that a strong political connection can be seen as an important intangible asset for extracting more direct rents from government. These rents would not otherwise be available to the bank. On the other hand, the incursion of politics can be detrimental to firm performance according to Dong et al. (2014). Thus, politically backed banks could be viewed as vehicles for financing high-risk, low-return social projects. A handful of recent studies recognize the value of a political presence on bank boards and its impact on bank performance (Braun and Raddatz 2010; Micco et al. 2007), lending and business (Nys et al. 2015). But little attention has been paid to the relationship between political patronage and bank financing decisions (Braham et al. 2019). Conflicting evidence may be related to different contexts and the extent of political influence. Moreover, the reported results are valid depending on the definition of political connection and the nature of the relationship. Indeed, political influence is defined, in its general meanings, as the ability to directly or indirectly convert political power into economic benefits (Shen 2018). Recent studies have used Faccio’s (2006)Footnote 1 definition to measure political connections, which may not capture the extent to which it might affect firms (Braham et al. 2019, 2020; Dang et al. 2018; Maaloul et al. 2016; Hung et al. 2017; Deng et al. 2018). Nevertheless, using a binary variable to identify political connections lacks important information and may not reflect the strength of political connections. That said, measuring political connections is an important challenge. Therefore, we argue that the effect of political connections on banks is more complicated than reported in previous studies in the literature. It is clear that a stronger political connection can have a larger impact on firms, whether positive or negative. In this paper, we propose an alternative measure that reflects the different political connections instead of using a simple binary variable. We then examine its effect on bank behavior. Here, we attempt to create a new political connection measure to examine the extent to which political patronage affects banks in the MENA region. We then assess the explanatory power of this political connection measure. For this purpose, a data set of banks is used for the period 2003–2017. Principal component analysis is performed to create an appropriate measure of political connections. Panel regressions are performed to test the appropriateness of this political connections index by examining its impact on leverage and bank risk. The newly constructed political connections index improves the estimation results compared to those obtained with the simple binary variable. Moreover, our results for the MENA region are different from previous ones. This may be due to the inability of the binary variables to capture the true impact of political connections. Overall, a particular feature of research in the literature is the choice of context. Studies on individual countries, such as Malaysia and China, are more popular. In fact, few recent papers compare the effect of political connectedness across countries because of the heterogeneity of countries and different political scenarios. Moreover, the MENA region may be an interesting platform to examine the effect of political connections for several reasons. First, many countries in this region are known for the significant influence of controlling families, regimes and powerful politicians on the business community. The political economy of the MENA region allows corporate owners and managers to dominate the business sector in exchange for support from certain regimes. Second, discussion of the institutional environment leads to the expectation that politically connected firms in MENA countries will behave differently from those that are not. Third, like emerging economies, financial markets in MENA are dominated by banks (Hamadi and Bassil 2015). Clearly, the impact of political connections would be more prevalent in banks. Its consequences would then be more pronounced at the bank level. In addition, data on the types of political connections are collected manually, which has not been explored in this region before. We manually identify politically supported executives and shareholders by collecting information on their profiles from company and bank websites. Finally, the existing literature shows that few studies focus on measuring political connections. The design of these studies has primarily used binary variables. Therefore, we extend the work of Braham et al. (2019) by using a different measure of political connections instead of the general binary measures. Due to the lack of information provided by binary variables, we attempt to provide a more informative measure of political connections by considering other forms and aspects. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine this issue in the MENA region. The remainder of this article is structured as follows: “Literature review” section presents the literature review. In “Methodology” section describes the data and methodology. In “Results and discussion” section presents and discusses the results of the statistical analysis and panel estimates. Finally, “Conclusions” section concludes the article and “Implications and future research” section provides suggestions for future policy and research.",1
64,4,Comparative Economic Studies,18 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-021-00182-z,The Devil is in the Details: On the Robust Determinants of Development Aid in G5 Sahel Countries,December 2022,Nimonka Bayale,Brigitte Kanga Kouassi,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"For several decades, developing countries have benefited from an important flow of international aid whose objective responds to a conventional dichotomous view: (i) the promotion of economic growth and (ii) the reduction of poverty and social exclusion (Bayale 2020; Bayale, 2018; Sachs 2016; Deaton 2013; Burnside and Dollar 2000). Nowadays, these international aid flows are consistent with multiple policy considerations that are often dictated by the political, institutional and socioeconomic atmosphere (Kaufmann et al. 2019; Findley 2018; Brown 2005). In the economic literature, it appeared that the theoretical determinants of development aid allocation are truly complex and difficult to clarify. As such, they range from donor generosity to selfish interests (Bayale, 2020; Bandyopadhyay and Vermann 2013; Bandyopadhyay and Wall 2007; Berthélemy 2006; Neumayer 2003). Indeed, some empirical studies found that the volumes of foreign aid or international aid to a recipient country depend on the intensity with which it supports the interests of its donors, perhaps in the area of international politics or the strengthening of economic interests through trade (Bayale, 2020; Dollar and Levin 2006; Alesina and Dollar 2000). Other empirical findings argued that according to the logic of need, international aid toward developing countries aims at improving the standard of living of residents of these countries (Gamso and Yuldashev, 2018; Cardwell and Ghazalian 2018; Page and Shimeles 2015; Bandyopadhyay and Vermann 2013; Collier and Dollar 2002). Nevertheless, with the reshaping of foreign aid over the last decade and the taking into account of some strategic and geopolitical considerations, other determinants have emerged in the literature. They are, among other factors, (i) the increase in the migration flows and (ii) the preservation of global public services or goods (Bayale, 2020). Some studies highlight the fact that an increase in the emigration rate is likely to increase aid to migrants' countries of origin (Dreher et al., 2019; Clemens and Postel 2018; Sachs 2016). Therefore, increasing rural development aid, for instance, could reduce international migration (Gamso and Yuldashev, 2018). Other studies show that international aid is moving toward the preservation of global public services or goods (Sullivan et al. 2020; Bayale 2020; Marniesse 2005; Severino 2001). These global public services or goods mentioned above are shared by both developed and developing countries. These include peace and security, stability environment, health, and education. As such, developed countries cannot expect tangible results in these areas without collaboration with developing countries. With regard to stability, peace and security in particular, it should be noted that the G5 SahelFootnote 1 region is one of the regions facing major challenges, the most important of which are terrorism, violence and transnational organized crime. Additionally, there is the resurgence of armed rebellions and inter-communal conflicts. These two threats are intertwined and create a context of recurring instability in this specific zone (Sullivan et al. 2020; Bayale 2020; Pannier and Schmitt 2019). Relaying on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), in 2010, six (6) international and domestic terrorist attacks have occurred in G5 Sahel zone. This number increased to eighty-three (83) in 2015, and two hundred eighteen (218) in 2018 (GTD 2020). This overwhelming situation requires new institutional responses, not only from the concerned countries, but also from the international community. The involvement of the states concerned to stem the phenomenon necessitates the definition of a solid institutional framework whose objective will be to provide a regional and coordinated response to the security and violence challenges as well as the threats posed to them by armed terrorism and violence groups in the region. It has also been expressed by a significant increase in the defense and security forces, and military spending in these countries (Laville, 2016). Regarding the support of the international community, they manifested themselves through international aid flows. For instance, according to the World Bank database, foreign aid flows to the G5 Sahel countries have experienced unprecedented growth in recent decades. From US$ 289.85 million in 2000, it rose to US$ 414.22 million in 2005 and then to US$ 748.24 million in 2010. In 2018, the total foreign aid flows in Sahel were US$ 1322.47 million (WDI 2020). When considering the average aid flows in sub-Saharan Africa, it was US$ 205.273 million in 2000; US$ 478.694 million in 2005; US$ 643.871 million in 2010; and US$ 698.385 million in 2017 (OECD, 2020). Hence, international aid toward this region has risen almost fivefold in less than twenty years and remained above the average for sub-Saharan African countries. Obviously, international aid seems to be a direct, important and remarkable source of income for these countries, specifically in recent years. Given these stylized facts on one hand and the current security and peace situation in the G5 Sahel region on the other, there are legitimate and relevant concerns about knowing holistically the main drivers of foreign aid flows toward G5 Sahel countries. This is exactly the subject matter of this paper. The motivation for this study is the quest to make a significant contribution to the literature in two ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, an empirical analysis of the subject seems to be non-existent in the G5 region, facing unprecedented security, violence, socioeconomic, and environmental challenges. Most of the studies mentioned have focused on developing countries. This study seeks to fill this gap in existing empirical knowledge by examining the effects and relationships between several socioeconomic and institutional characteristics of countries and foreign aid in the G5 Sahel region over the years from 1980 to 2018. Second, it contributes to a better and more precise understanding of factors shaping international aid increasing in this specific region, by offering novel quantitative evidence on the issue. Previous studies have used haphazard approaches in analyzing the determinants of foreign aid; however, the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach improves on the earlier approaches by sequentially selecting key determinants based on posterior inclusion probabilities. This is a key methodological contribution of the study. Therefore, findings from the study enable policymakers of the region and donors to make more informed decisions related to the conduct of international cooperation. By applying a panel BMA approach, those reflecting terrorist attacks, trade stakes including military expenditure, socioeconomic prospects and institutional conditions tend to receive high posterior inclusion probabilities. Moreover, by exploring the relationship between these regressors and international aid using the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), the continuously updated fully modified (CUP-FM) and the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) long-run estimators, the BMA results approach are confirmed and valid. Finally, the Dumitrescu and Hurlin’s (2012) panel causality test, results of these approaches highlight three concerns that may justify aid flows toward G5 Sahel countries: (a) peace and security purposes, (b) interest of donors (self-interest) and (c) recipient economic needs. Based on the results, appropriate policy recommendations are proffered. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Literature Review” section presents the background and a brief literature review. In “Materials and Methods” section , we present the empirical strategy adopted, data sources and variables. Results from our empirical analysis are presented in “Empirical Results” section. Finally, “Conclusion and Policy Implication” section concludes and establishes policy implications.",2
64,4,Comparative Economic Studies,03 March 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-022-00186-3,Discretionary Grants and Distributive Politics: Evidence from Spain,December 2022,Elena Jarocinska,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Do political considerations affect the allocation of public funds across geographic regions and, if yes, how? Dominant theories of distributive politics predict that politicians favor either loyal voters (Cox and McCubbins 1986) or swing voters (Linbeck and Weibull 1987; Dixit and Londregan 1996). We test these theories using Spanish data. We study how the allocation of discretionary grants across Spanish regions relates to the number of loyal voters and swing voters in the region. To construct our proxies for the number of loyal and swing voters, we use data from sixteen public opinion surveys and estimate the evolution of voters’ ideological preferences over time in each region. The fact that we proxy for the number of loyal and swing voters using information on ideological preferences, and not on actual votes, is a new and important feature of our study. Most empirical studies of distributive politics use proxies based on actual votes (e.g., Wright 1974; Levitt and Potterba 1999; Case 2001; Stromberg 2004 and others). However, as these studies acknowledge, proxies based on actual votes have two shortcomings. First, they are valid only under restrictive assumptions: single peaked and symmetric distribution of preferences, and two-party competition. Second, in the models of distributive politics, voting decisions are—by assumption—endogenous to the distribution of public funds. This endogeneity complicates the interpretation of regressions that include proxies based on actual votes. Proxies based on survey data, that we use, while not perfect, are arguably more exogenous (see Larcinese et al. 2012).
 Proxying swing and loyal voters using survey data is important in the Spanish case. First, we find that the distributions of political preferences within Spanish regions are likely to be multi-peaked and asymmetric, so the assumptions of single-peakedness and symmetry would have been inappropriate. Second, in some Spanish regions regional parties play an important role in addition to the two main countrywide parties (Colomer 2003), so the assumption of two-party competition would have been inappropriate as well. Third, our survey data allow us to take into account a distinguishing feature of Spanish politics: in some regions the ideological space is two-dimensional. In addition to the standard left–right dimension, in these regions there is a prominent second ideological dimension related to the support for the regional/national aspirations (Colomer 2003). To our knowledge, our paper is the first one in the literature to estimate the number of swing voters from survey data in a two-dimensional ideological space, taking into account more than two major parties. Is it reasonable to assume that politicians use swing and loyal voters measures that we construct when making their decisions? First, we know that politicians extensively use surveys (as well as focus groups and meetings with important stakeholders) to learn about the public opinion. These surveys and focus groups are frequent and custom-made for the salient issues. However, they are not publicly available. The measures we construct from publicly available surveys aim to approximate as well as possible the sophisticated knowledge of the public opinion that the politicians have. Second, we do not think that Spanish politicians literally base their decisions on our (or similar) constructed measures of swing and loyal voters. Instead, we think that our constructed measures are a simple (and probably imperfect) way to capture the politicians’ complex decision making process, based on their sophisticated knowledge of the public opinion. Our empirical analysis proceeds in two steps. First, we compute our proxies for the number of loyal and swing voters. Second, we regress discretionary grants on these proxies and other controls in a panel of 15 regions observed annually between 1987 and 2007. We compute the following proxies for the number of loyal and swing voters. We use survey data where respondents locate themselves as well as political parties on the ideological scale. Our proxy for the number of loyal voters of the ruling party is the share of respondents who locate themselves much closer to the ruling party than to any other party. We experiment with different quantitative definitions of “much closer.” Our proxies for the number of swing voters are obtained using two approaches. In the first approach we compute the share of respondents who locate themselves at a similar distance to the ruling party and to another party. We experiment with different quantitative definitions of “similar distance.” In the second approach we estimate densities at the critical value or “cutpoint” that divides the voters of the ruling party from the voters of another party. The higher the density at the cutpoint, the more swing voters there are in a region (Dixit and Londregan 1996). In the second stage of the analysis, we run a panel regression of discretionary grants per capita on the proxies for swing and loyal voters, as well as other controls. The discretionary grants that we use as the left-hand side variable are appropriate for testing theories of distributive politics, because their allocation is controlled by the federal government and no prescribed formula for their allocation exists. The political determinants of a subset of these grants have been studied only by Simon-Cosano et al. (2013). We find robust evidence for the loyal voter hypothesis (the hypothesis that the ruling party favors loyal voters). The proxies for the number of loyal voters enter significantly into the regressions for the allocation of discretionary grants, and the magnitude of the effect is large. We do not find robust evidence for the swing voter hypothesis. In addition, we find support for the partisan alignment hypothesis during the years of the PSOE rule (the hypothesis that grants are biased in favor of the regions where there is partisan alignment between the central and regional layers of government). To our knowledge, there are only three previous studies that use survey data for testing theories of distributive politics. Larcinese et al. (2012) use survey data from exit polls in their study of the allocation of federal spending across US states. They do not find evidence for the strategic use of federal spending by the incumbent party. Dahlberg and Johansson (2002) and Johansson (2003) use the Swedish election study to construct a proxy for the number of swing voters and find support for the swing voter hypothesis in the allocation of Swedish ecological grants. Larcinese et al. (2012) also discuss extensively the possible endogeneity of voters’ ideological positions to the distribution of public funds (Larcinese et al. 2012). In particular, they argue that first, ideological preferences evolve slowly over time, while the empirical analysis typically focuses on short-term changes. Second, when ideological preferences do slowly change over time, none of the factors that lead to those changes (e.g., major changes in the parties’ issue positions) are clearly related to the dependent variable of interest.Footnote 1 Larcinese et al. (2012) conclude that the use of survey data, even if not a definitive solution to the endogeneity problem, is a step in the right direction. We contribute to the literature on the Spanish distributive politics in two principal ways. First, we estimate the distributions of ideological preferences in Spanish regions. The estimation of these distributions is nontrivial because each respondent perceives the scale of the ideological space differently. We use the procedure of Aldrich and McKelvey to deal with this problem (Aldrich and McKelvey 1977; Poole et al. 2011). We find that the distributions of ideological preferences appear asymmetric, multi-peaked and quite stable over time. Second, we complement the existing studies by providing evidence that the loyal voter hypothesis can explain the allocation of public monies in Spain. Our study is complementary to the literature since we use a very different empirical strategy than the previous studies of Spain.Footnote 2 The paper is organized as follows. Section “Hypotheses and their Previous Empirical Tests” discusses hypotheses of distributive politics and relates our paper to the existing literature. Section “Proxies for the Number of Loyal and Swing Voters” explains our proxies for the number of loyal and swing voters based on survey data. Section “Empirical Analysis of the Determinants of Discretionary Grants” presents regression results. Section “Conclusion” concludes.",3
64,4,Comparative Economic Studies,28 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-022-00183-6,"Fiscal Consolidation, Social Sector Expenditures and Twin Deficit Hypothesis: Evidence from Emerging and Middle-Income Countries",December 2022,Amine Lahiani,Ameni Mtibaa,Foued Gabsi,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The 2009 global financial and economic great recession has struck the global economic activity. This crisis built-up historically high levels of public debt at a scale hardly ever seen before. Given the extreme severity of the crisis, many countries have been forced to adopt fiscal austerity programs. While debt ratios have generally declined in developed countries since that crisis, they still remain at very high levels in emerging countries. Recently, in early 2020, emerging market economies have faced a more dramatic economic and financial shock following the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Public debt ratio has been strongly hit by discretionary fiscal measures and has become increasingly immense. As shown in Fig. 1, public debt-to-GDP ratio across the word’s emerging market and middle-income economies rose from 40% of GDP in 2009 to 62% of GDP in 2020. Source: Authors’ compilation from IMF Fiscal Monitor (October 2021) Public debt in percentage of GDP (1990–2025). Assessing the impact of public finances consolidation on output and other macroeconomic fundamentals such as consumption, investment and employment has been the main focus of the existing Fiscal consolidation literature. A large number of empirical studies have investigated the demand-side effects trying to identify the determinants, impact, timing and the length of fiscal consolidations (Alesina et al. 2008, 2019; Alesina and Ardagna 2010; Barrios et al. 2010; Cimadomo et al. 2010, 2012a, b; Sanz 2011; Agnello et al. 2013, 2015, 2016; Ball et al. 2013; Bi et al. 2013; Afonso and Jalles 2014, 2016; Agnello and Sousa 2014; Cugnasca and Rother 2015). Research has focused on several aspects of this relationship including the impact of fiscal consolidation on economic growth (Alesina et al. 2019), on income distribution (Agnello and Sousa 2014), or on governments ’chances of re-election (Hübscher 2016). Some studies show unambiguously that fiscal consolidation is costly. The cost of austerity is then amplified and the effectiveness of consolidation to achieve fiscal sustainability and economic growth is reduced. Alesina et al. (2015) confirm the absence of ‘non-Keynesian’ effects applying a seemingly unrelated regression model (SUR). The authors emphasize a milder negative effect of fiscal adjustments that are based on spending cuts rather than on revenue increases. Furthermore, Hernández de Cos and Moral-Benito (2013) employ a panel IV estimator and find a negative impact of fiscal adjustments on short-run economic growth regardless of the employed definition for fiscal adjustments. If countries had the opportunity to delay austerity measures, they would benefit from higher growth, but what would be the consequences on debt? (Blot et al. 2014). Contrary to the conventional Keynesian wisdom which predicts negative short-run economic effects, fiscal consolidation is found to be expansionary with reference to output (Giavazzi and Pagano 1990). In literature, two types of consolidation (spending and tax-driven) have been taken into account (Alesina and Ardagna 1998, 2010; Alesina and Perotti 1995, 1997a, b, 1998; Gupta et al. 2005; McDermott and Wescott 1996; Afonso and Jalles 2012b, a; Heylen et al. 2013; Alesina and Ardagna 2013; Alesina et al. 2015, 2018). The fundamental result claims that fiscal consolidations led by spending cuts are more likely to generate growth than by tax increases. Nevertheless, using a narrative dataset of fiscal consolidation episodes in the Latin America and the Caribbean countries elaborated by David and Leight (2018), Carrière-Swallow et al. (2018) find that, contrary to the evidence obtained in advanced economies, the tax-based and spending-based fiscal multipliers are not significantly different one from another. The authors present further evidence indicating that the tax-based fiscal multiplier in Latin America and the Caribbean could be smaller in absolute value and less recessionary, than in OECD countries. However, cutting crucial social spending on health and education should be carefully designed. By taking advantage of social expenditure allocation, it would be possible to optimize the effectiveness of fiscal consolidation, in order to avoid governments missing their fiscal targets. Indeed, it is crucial to combine the fiscal adjustment with structural reforms aimed to boost growth. Reductions in current spending in social sectors may have a larger negative effect on lower-income households and could adversely impact longer-term development prospects. It is apprehended that investment in education and health makes the labor force more productive and efficient, contributing therefore, to higher economic growth. Giving this context, a more disaggregated analysis proves that any economic reform especially linked to compression in public expenditure will adversely affect the vulnerable sections of the society. The very first question related to budgetary allocations of social sectors during the period of reforms have been widely discussed (Gupta and Sarkar 1994; Prabhu 1994; Panchamukhi 2000; Dev and Mooij. 2002; Sanz 2011). Nevertheless, one under-appreciated angle is the effect of fiscal adjustments periods which remains a widespread subject. The related literature shows that few studies have analyzed how fiscal consolidation affects expenditure composition which have given little attention to social costs during fiscal consolidation episodes (Castro 2017; Bamba et al. 2019). This has brought to the forefront the issue of transitional social costs during fiscal consolidation episodes. Social expenditures are negatively affected by fiscal consolidation. The basic theoretical Ricardian equivalence hypothesis states that an increase in taxes leads to a reduction in budget deficit and subsequently not affect current accounts. This is because a decline in government savings does not affect consumption due to the fact that people tend to prefer hoarding, thus, private savings increase (Barro 1989). However, several studies have proven that fiscal consolidation through cutting expenditure or increasing taxes would be accompanied by an improvement in the current account (Bluedorn and Leigh 2011; Breuer and Nam 2020). Such predictions are in line with the so-called twin deficits hypothesis, which posits that fiscal consolidation can reduce external imbalances (Marinheiro 2008). Governments emphasize the importance of fiscal consolidations as a requirement for two purposes. The first is to boot economic growth through its main determinants such as human capital. The second is to stabilize and bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio via current account increase. Given the large impact of the connection between social expenditure and current account on the economy, the contribution of this paper is threefold. First, to our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to empirically estimate the social expenditure effect of fiscal consolidations for emerging and middle-income countries. Our study attempts to specifically focus on the government expenditure and particularly social expenditure during fiscal consolidation episodes, a subject that has indeed received little attention in Castro (2017) and Bamba et al. (2019). Total expenditures are negatively affected by fiscal consolidation. Beyond the fact that, conceptually, the distinction between education and health sectors is actually needed, this is a notable innovation compared to most previous studies on the effect of fiscal consolidation. Second, in case of fiscal consolidation episodes, we employ Alesina and Ardagna (2013)’s novel measure which has the advantage of considering the size and persistence of fiscal adjustment instead of a dummy variable (De Haan et al. 1996). Then, we use panel data techniques and apply modern system-GMM estimations of Blundell and Bond (1998) due to the inherent limitation of the fixed-effect model. This rigorous approach properly takes into account the observed and unobserved heterogeneity of countries and tackles endogeneity problems of some variables. Appreciably, compared with Castro (2017) and Bamba et al. (2019), we cover a longer sample size for the conventional method to the observations of fiscal adjustment periods that goes beyond 2010–2011, as we are able to include data on the global crisis years 2010–2013. Covering a more extensive time period is vital, since that fiscal consolidation measures have been a central feature of the global crisis management in several emerging countries in order to cut fiscal deficits and bring down public debt. Finally, there is little available evidence analyzing how social expenditure and current account are both affected by fiscal consolidations. This paper attempts to fill in this gap and link insights from the literature on the effects of fiscal consolidations on social expenditure with the evolution of the current account. Therefore, we conduct an empirical analysis of fiscal adjustment effect on the current account. Current account deficit is positively affected by fiscal consolidation. The paper employs evidence from a sample of 23 emerging and middle-income countries over the period 2009–2018. Our findings reveal that fiscal consolidation strongly reduces social expenditure and simultaneously improves the current account. The effect also remains robust and relevant when taking into account alternative instruments and data restrictions. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. “Literature Review” section reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on the effects of fiscal adjustments. “Data and Methodology” section introduces the data and empirical methodology. “Empirical Results” section discusses the empirical findings. “Robustness Check” section reports a robustness check of the results. Finally, “Conclusion” section concludes and presents useful policy recommendations.",2

However, evidence has demonstrated that women entrepreneurs suffer from lower access to finance than male entrepreneurs (Asiedu et al. 2012; IFC 2011). This lower access to finance reduces the opportunities of women entrepreneurs to grow their businesses, thereby affecting their contributions to the economy such as job creation, poverty reduction, and economic growth, and hampers their income, constituting an impediment to gender equality. Several explanations have been proposed to explain this gender gap in access to finance. The gap might be due to supply-side discrimination such that female-managed firms are less likely to obtain credit than those managed by men (Muravyev et al. 2009). The gap can also result from the demand side: women entrepreneurs can self-refrain from applying for a credit because they anticipate rejection from the bank (Moro et al. 2017; Ongena and Popov 2016). The demand-side mechanism raises questions on what shapes the perceptions of women entrepreneurs to expect higher rates of loan rejection. The objective of this paper is to investigate whether corruption has a different impact on borrower discouragement for men and women. We test the hypothesis that corruption discourages more female borrowers than male borrowers and therefore that a greater degree of corruption results in a higher gender gap in access to finance. This hypothesis is based on the results in the literature on behavior differences between men and women. In the presence of greater corruption, women would apply less for credit than men because women are more risk averse (Byrnes et al. 1999; Croson and Gneezy 2009) and tend to be more honest (Grosch and Rau 2017; Muehlheusser et al. 2015) than men and have less experience in managing corrupt practices than men (Rheinby and Chene 2016; Swamy et al. 2001). To investigate this hypothesis, we use the Enterprise Surveys data on access to credit and corruption at the firm level on a large dataset of firms from 68 countries. Each country participates in the survey once during the research period 2011–2018. We first examine whether corruption exerts a different influence on borrower discouragement for male and female entrepreneurs. We further test two explanations for why corruption can have a gendered impact on borrower discouragement. First, we consider the possible impact of experience: the higher impact of corruption on discouraging female borrowers might be due to their having less experience in managing corruption than men. Second, we investigate the influence of culture in terms of gender equality. Lower gender equality can enhance the differences in behavior between men and women and as such can increase the differences in terms of reaction in borrower discouragement to the degree of corruption. We perform ordinary least squares (OLS) and logit regressions to examine the gendered impact of corruption on discouraged borrowers. To manage potential endogeneity, we perform a two-stage least squares regression using instrumental variables. We additionally perform a set of OLS regressions to investigate the relevance of the explanations for this gendered impact. Finally, we apply random effects regression for a smaller sample on which we have panel data to confirm the results. Our primary finding is that female entrepreneurs are more discouraged than male in the presence of high corruption. Further, we find evidence for the two tested explanations of this higher discouragement. First, women have less experience in management than men, which can affect their experience in managing corruption. Second, lower gender equality favors higher discouragement for female entrepreneurs than for male entrepreneurs. Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we contribute to the nascent strand of literature on the influence of institutions on the gender gap in access to finance. Galli et al. (2018) and Wellalage et al. (2019) have investigated the influence of corruption on the gender gap in access to finance. Using data for 11 European countries, Galli et al. (2018) find no impact of corruption on the gender gap, while Wellalage et al. (2019) show that corruption reduces the gender gap in a dataset from five South Asia countries. By analyzing a large dataset of 19,366 firms from 68 countries, and so by not restricting to a single geographical area, our work provides a much broader investigation of the gendered impact of corruption on borrower discouragement. Moreover, our results focus only on discouragement and thus complement the ones obtained by Wellalage et al. (2019) on access to credit. Our framework allows us to investigate the different channels through which corruption can differentially affect the borrower behavior of men and women. Our analysis is thus not limited to testing the existence of the gendered impact of corruption but also considers in depth the underlying mechanisms. Through this analysis, our work contributes to a better understanding of the gender gap in access to finance. Second, we contribute to the literature on the effects of corruption. These effects have been widely studied, and the evidence demonstrates that corruption affects growth, productivity, and foreign direct investment (Mauro 1995; Méon and Weill 2010) at the macroeconomic level and bank lending decisions (Fungáčová et al. 2015) at the microeconomic level. Our work presents a new perspective of the impact of corruption by showing its detrimental effects on gender equality in economic life. The paper is structured as follows: “Literature Review” section presents the literature review, “Hypotheses Development” section develops the hypotheses, “Data and methodology” section describes the data and econometric methodology, “Results” section reports the results, and “Conclusion” section concludes the paper.",2

With the global average surface temperature rising by 1.1 degrees Celsius (°C) compared to the preindustrial average, the frequency and severity of climate shocks have intensified across the world (Fig. 1), and these extreme weather events are projected to worsen as the global annual mean temperatures increase by as much as 4°C over the next century (IPCC, 2007; IPCC, 2014; IPCC, 2021; Stern, 2007).The socioeconomic consequences of climate change will be felt across the world, but potential vulnerability to weather anomalies depends on the size and composition of economies, the resilience of institutions and physical infrastructure, and the capacity for climate change mitigation and adaption. Weather anomalies across the world There is growing evidence that climate-related shifts in the physical environment have significant macroeconomic consequences (Gallup et al., 1999; Nordhaus, 2006; Dell et al., 2012), but research on the firm-level impact of climate change is scarce. Conceptually, there are multiple channels of transmission through which climate change can influence firm performance across different sectors and countries, including economic and financial effects of climate change, economic and financial consequences of climate change adaptation and mitigation policies, as well as effects on political stability. These transmission channels are not necessarily independent of each other, as the impact of climate change may amplify the transmission of risks across all channels. Furthermore, the extent of these effects varies from country to country, depending on the policies implemented—or not taken at all—for climate change adaptation and mitigation. This paper focuses on countries' exposure to physical risks that correspond to the potential macro-financial losses caused by climate change. However, it should be noted that transition risks related to the process of adjusting toward a low-carbon economy, such as stranded financial asset exposures, can also amount to a sizable burden. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing the effects of climate change vulnerability on firm performance in a large panel of more than 3.3 million nonfinancial companies from 24 countries during the period 1997–2019. We take advantage of a new dataset of climate change vulnerability developed by the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Institute (ND-GAIN), while taking into account a broad range of firm characteristics and macroeconomic factors. The empirical results show that climate change vulnerability has a statistically and economically significant impact on various measures of firm performance, including leverage, interest burden, profitability, and total factor productivity (TFP). We find that nonfinancial firms operating in countries with greater vulnerability to climate change tend to experience difficulty in access to debt financing even at higher interest rates, while being less productive and profitable relative to firms in countries with lower vulnerability to climate change. We confirm these findings with alternative measures of climate change vulnerability. Furthermore, partitioning the sample reveals that these effects are significantly greater for smaller firms, especially in high-risk sectors and countries with weaker capacity to adapt to and mitigate the consequences of climate change. The key policy takeaway from this paper is that while climate change is inevitable, policymakers can still strengthen structural and financial resilience to absorb shocks to economic activity and help reduce the financial burden on private firms and create growth opportunities. At the same time, however, it is important to acknowledge the private sector’s critical role in building resilience against and adapting to climate change as well as in efforts aimed at climate change mitigation. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the related literature. Section 3 describes the data used in the analysis. Section 4 introduces the salient features of our econometric strategy and presents the empirical results, including a series of robustness checks. Finally, Section 5 offers concluding remarks with policy implications.",1

It is difficult to explain Argentina’s economic downfall. Rich in natural resources and recipient of large numbers of European immigrants, Argentina’s failure to fully develop and achieve sustainable economic growth and political stability puzzles economists and development scholars. A probable apocryphal quote attributed to Nobel laureate Simon Kuznets states that “in the world there are four sorts of countries: developed, underdeveloped, Japan and Argentina”. The former is a success story against all odds, the latter a failure against all predictions (Campos et al. 2022). During the twentieth century, Argentina’s economic growth decelerated, while poverty and political and financial instability increased. The recent COVID-19 global pandemic negatively impacted the country’s economy at a higher rate than those of other countries in the region (in the second half of 2020, 42% of the Argentinean population was below the poverty line while, before the pandemic outbreak, this figure was 35.5%). Inflation has also been endemic in Argentina. The annual inflation rate in 2021, as measured by the official statistics agency (INDEC), was 50.9%. Rich with one of the best educational systems in Latin America (Mariscal and Sokoloff 2000), Argentina’s failure to fully develop and achieve sustainable economic growth and political stability seems puzzling to most economists, development scholars and legal scientists. Argentina had not participated in any significant war until the war with the United Kingdom in 1982 and did not suffer serious cataclysms or natural disasters. The most economically impactful events had been political and internal. During the twentieth century, many Latin American countries experienced coups, military dictatorships, and populist leaders. However, no other populist leader would have the long-lasting effects that Perón had on Argentina. We take the ascent of Perón and Peronism in Argentina as a salient event. We do not find Argentina’s economic decay either paradoxical or puzzling but a mere consequence of continuous institutional degradation. In our analytical framework, Argentina’s unfortunate transition to underdevelopment can be explained, inter alia, by looking at institutional and legal reforms that eroded the rule of law, increased state intervention in the economy, constrained the economic freedom of entrepreneurs through a variety of means such as state-mandated modification of the contractual relationship, and weakened property rights enforcement. To break up with the path dependency of its Spanish colonial past, after a long period of violence and instability that followed its independence (1810 to 1852), Argentina finally adopted a constitution modeled after the USA in 1853. The 1853 Argentinean Constitution, the brainchild of Juan Bautista Alberdi, incorporated inclusive institutions such as the rule of law, checks and balances, and economic freedom. The Alberdian constitutional blueprint may be considered a critical institutional factor for Argentina’s golden years, owing particularly to two distinctive layers of institutions embedded therein, namely, the rule of law and economic freedom. From 1880 to 1910, Argentinean economic growth seemed unstoppable and developed as rival to the USA. However, a series of cultural and institutional changes have gradually weakened the original Alberdian blueprint for growth including the severe break beginning in 1930 when the first coup d’etat took place. The ascendancy and political rule of Juan Péron and his Peronist movement further accelerated the downward trend. Since 1943, the Argentinean decline has also been unstoppable. Argentina may thus be the only developing country whose past was more prosperous than its present through an unfortunate detour from riches to rags. Importantly, we do not claim to be original in stating that the abandonment of the rule of law is one of the factors behind the long-term decline. The pivotal importance of the disregard of the rule of law in Argentina’s economic decline has been emphasized by Gallo and Alston (2008) whilst Campos and Karanasos (2008) underline the importance of political instability in causing Argentina’s decline. The main innovation of our study is to provide a counterfactual estimate of Argentina’s long-term trajectory of growth and development had Péron never came to power. In this paper, we estimate the counterfactual scenario in response to two major institutional changes in Argentina’s post-independence history, namely, the 1853 Constitution and the Peronist takeover that began in full force in 1946. Estimating an appropriate counterfactual scenario allows us to better understand the prospective long-term effects of the liberal constitution, as opposed to the actual populist government, on the trajectory of Argentina’s economic growth and development. Whilst the 1853 Constitution established important institutions such as the rule of law, economic freedom and political stability, the Peronist takeover implemented a large-scale populist redistribution that took place through social and labor legislation, widespread state interference in the economy, and highly protectionist trade policies alongside inward-looking industrialization policies. To this end, we employ the synthetic control methodology to build a demonstrative long-running counterfactual. Our results highlight a stark contrast in the long-term effect of the Peronist takeover. Whilst the 1853 Constitution appears to have triggered a large-scale acceleration of Argentina’s economic growth beyond its counterfactual trajectory, the Peronist takeover has eliminated the entire realm of economic growth advantages of the Alberdian constitution and triggered a pervasive and permanent growth breakdown. Our estimates invariably suggest that, down to the present day, Argentina’s per capita GDP is about one third lower than its implied counterfactual in the hypothetical absence of the Peronist takeover. Subsequent unstable government administrations and endemic political instability after the ousting of Péron from power seem to have only widened the economic gap between Argentina and the rest of the world. Our identification strategy establishes a building block showing that Argentina’s pre-Péron economic growth had been entirely comparable with the Western Offshoots and its European peers. Our analysis is also able to show that populist government proves to be costly in the long-term perspective as it may undermine the sources of comparative advantages through distortionary economic policies that entail high productivity losses in the long run. The intriguing case of Argentina under Peronist government provides an exemplary case of en masse redistribution of income from the source of Argentina’s comparative advantage to rent-seeking coalitions. Coupled with legal reforms that undermine the low-cost enforcement of contracts and the security of property rights, such an expansive nexus between deep and abrupt changes perhaps may be the key institutional trigger of the economic growth slowdown where the implications appear to be clearly permanent. Our paper contributes to the scholarly debate on the economic decline of Argentina (Díaz-Alejandro 1970; Taylor 1992, 1994; Della Paolera and Taylor 1999; Spiller and Tommasi 2003; Prados de la Escosura and Sanz-Villarroya 2009; Alston and Gallo 2010; Campos et al. 2012, 2016; Spruk 2019) by seeking and empirically estimating the counterfactual scenario in order to examine the long-term economic effects of persistent populist government. It should be noted that our study is not the first one to explore the long-term effects of Peronism on Argentinean economy (Ertola Navajas 2020) but it provides several additions to the existing body of knowledge. First, our analysis explicitly incorporates the missing counterfactual analysis into the discussion of the economic decline using a rigorous comparative data-driven investigation where parallel trend assumption is seldom necessary. Second, we expand the time span of the analysis and compare Argentina with a donor pool of 58 countries for the period 1860–2015. And third, compared to earlier studies, we construct an expansive set of time-varying and time-invariant covariates used to synthetically match Argentina with the rest of the world which allows us to address a sizeable portion of the omitted variable bias that cannot be address solely through the comparison based on past outcomes and few auxiliary covariates. Moreover, we highlight the importance of the comprehensive and gradual legal reforms and their impact on long-term development. Under populist government, such reforms are oftentimes radical, take place without consensus-based institutionalized policymaking, invoke numerous distortions, and are based on short-term opportunistic behavior, that undermine both institutional quality and productivity growth. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: “Historical Background” provides an overview of the historical context; “Identification Strategy” section presents the identification strategy; “Data” section discusses the data and sample; and “Results” section provides our results and robustness checks. “Conclusion” section concludes.",
65,1,Comparative Economic Studies,28 March 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-022-00187-2,Drivers of the Tax Effort: Evidence from a Large Panel,March 2023,Victor Barros,Joao Tovar Jalles,Joaquim Miranda Sarmento,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"There is a longstanding debate regarding the drivers of tax revenues and tax effort (Gupta 2007). Tax effort can be defined as an index of the ratio between the share of actual tax collection in gross domestic product and taxable capacity—with tax capacity being “the predicted tax-to-gross domestic product ratio that can be estimated empirically, taking into account a country’s specific macroeconomic, demographic, and institutional features, which all change through time” (Le et al. 2012). Countries worldwide have been concerned with tax revenues and fiscal constraints (Arellano and Bai 2017). On the one hand, strong pressure exists on government spending, both for social expenditure on services such as education, health, and pensions (Jimenez 2017) and for public investment, with particular emphasis on addressing infrastructure gaps (Bacchiocchi et al. 2011; Sarmento and Renneboog 2016). On the other hand, increasing attention is being paid to the sustainability of public finances, particularly in contexts of low economic growth (Afonso and Jalles 2012). All this has led to governments attaching increased importance to raising revenues. Nevertheless, a high fiscal burden can be perceived as an obstacle to economic development and growth (Afonso and Jalles 2014). Accordingly, increasing tax revenues without a high level of tax effort is considered an essential element of fiscal policy. As a result, understanding the drivers of tax effort is of great relevance, particularly for policy makers. The literature on the drivers of tax effort has focused mainly on the economic and demographic aspects. However, other blocks of drivers should also be given due weight. The issue of the determinants of a country’s tax effort are not well-understood in the extant literature—in particular, which determinants prevail in a large panel covering numerous countries over an extended period. Most studies have concentrated on the economic determinants (Frank 1959; Bird 1964; Lotz and Morss 1967; Balh 1971; Chelliah et al. 1975; Berry and Fording 1997; Piancastelli 2001; Rivero 2001; Gupta 2007; Bird et al. 2008; Fenochietto and Pessino 2013) while giving only scant attention to the role of other blocks of determinants. Our specific aim is to clarify these issues and close the knowledge gap. As in previous studies, we use a comprehensive list of determinants of tax efforts (Balh 1971; Chelliah et al. 1975; Mertens 2003; Balh 2004; Gupta 2007; Grigorian and Davoodi 2007; Bird et al. 2008; Pessino and Fenochietto 2010; Fenochietto and Pessino 2013; Akitoby et al. 2020). Unlike prior studies, we allow the five blocks of drivers to operate simultaneously in explaining tax effort, and our sample setting is unique; in that we cover a large panel of 122 countries over a 38-year period. From an economic point of view, the main drivers of tax effort are GDP growth and GDP per capita (Frank 1959; Bird 1964; Rivero et al. 2001; Gupta 2007), although gross domestic income is also perceived as relevant (Lortz and Morss 1967; Chelliah et al. 1975; Piancastelli 2001). In both the economic and demographic cases, countries with a higher level of development tend to have higher taxation and tax effort levels. Furthermore, a higher contribution of agriculture to GDP tends to reduce the tax capacity (Balh 1971; Chelliah et al. 1975; Piancastelli 2001). Economies with a higher level of openness—that is, with more trade—tend to have lower levels of tax effort (Gupta 2007; Pessino and Fenochietto 2010; Fenochietto and Pessino 2013). In addition, a better institutional environment, such as low corruption and adherence to the rule of law, tends to improve tax performance and reduce the tax burden (Bird and Martinez-Vasquez 2008). Our data covers a large panel of 122 countries from 1980 to 2017 and is sourced from the OECD database, the World Economic Forum, the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO), and the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI). Unlike other studies (Bahl 1971; Piancastelli 2001; Mertens 2003; Gupta 2007), a key feature of our research is the inclusion of two alternative measures of tax effort (the Frank and Bird indices) that correct for purchasing power and disposable income, for the largest available number of countries (122) and years (38). Our focus is on five blocks of determinants—namely economic, fiscal, openness, structural, and political. We constructed our baseline specification by using the standard fixed-effects model for each block of determinants from which we later dropped any insignificant variables from the full specification of determinants. This parsimonious process set our benchmark specification, which was narrowed down to geographical region (Latin America, Africa, Europe, and Asia), income group (advanced economies, and developing economies), and time period (1980 to 1998, and 1999 to 2017). Overall, tax effort is influenced by all groups of determinants, although the results differ per income group. Tax effort in advanced economies is driven by all blocks of drivers, with the exception of political variables, which are not relevant. However, the three blocks of openness, structural, and political issues prevail in developing economies. Consistency is also absent from the drivers of tax effort across the four regions. Conversely, and in contrast to all other regions, tax effort in Africa is not associated with the economic, fiscal, and openness drivers. Over the period from 1980 to 1998, the level of tax effort is mainly associated with higher levels of a country’s tax revenues and the contribution of the agricultural sector to GDP. In the period after that the determinants of tax effort are mainly driven by left-wing governments and by the economic and fiscal blocks of determinants. The results are robust to a large number of robustness checks. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review. Section 3 develops the conceptual framework underlying the empirical model. Section 4 discusses the data and presents some stylized facts, and Sect. 5 discusses the econometric results. The last section concludes and earmarks a number of critical policy implications.",1

We inferred that advances in education at all levels, good governance, and institutional reforms played a more significant role in raising economic output and efficiency in Estonia and Latvia than in Georgia and Croatia, emphasizing the importance of the EU perspective, that is, the need for timely, market-friendly economic and political reforms aimed at strengthening the candidacies of the Baltic countries for quick EU membership after their release from the Soviet Union. Against the background of the literature on the transition from plan to market (see, e.g., Wachtel 2021 for a thoughtful retrospective, or Campos and Coricelli 2002), this paper aims to extend our comparative approach to the case of Lithuania vs. Belarus, a starker contrast than those offered in the earlier papers because, unlike Georgia and Croatia, Belarus remains under an autocratic ruler with strong ties to Russia and no interest in having anything to do with European integration or markets. Comparing Belarus and Lithuania is warranted by their long, intertwined history and, in some sense, their comparable starting positions when communism collapsed, even if Lithuania, unlike Belarus, was briefly democratic in the 1920s. Whether the two countries ever were on an even keel depends on one´s point of view. Later, within the Soviet Union, both the Belarusian and Lithuanian SSRs enjoyed above average income, and both had a focus on industry. In addition, they declared independence in quick succession in 1990. Further, both countries, after declaring independence, had the opportunity to follow the same political and economic path or model. Both were in a formal position to do so. Insofar they enjoyed similar starting conditions. Belarus chose to remain integrated with Russia of her own independent political will just as Lithuania was determined to integrate with “the West” as far as possible. These opposing political decisions, which led to different endogenous economic processes, help to explain our choice of country pair for comparison. We also want to assess the importance of institutional reform for economic growth. In contrast to Belarus, Lithuania joined the EU in 2004, Croatia joined in 2013, and Georgia expects to apply for EU membership in 2024.",

Euro Area Countries After the Sovereign Debt Crisis,June 2023,Massimo Bordignon,Nicolò Gatti,Massimiliano Gaetano Onorato,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The formation of the European Union (EU) and of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was predicated on increasing convergence among member countries. Economic convergence first, but also political convergence in terms of quality of institutions, respect of rule of law, transparency in governance, reduction in corruption and tax evasion, and so on. As for the EMU, while it was obvious that the introduction of the common currency did not initially satisfy the criteria of an Optimal Currency Area, the expectation was that this problem would have been gradually solved over time. Increased economic convergence would have also made it easier to introduce institutional reforms further strengthening the euro area (Junker et al. 2015); for some European federalists such as Jean Monnet, increased economic convergence would have also made it possible to converge eventually to a fully fledged political union (Gros and Thygesen 1998). The euro was to become the common currency of the EU and, indeed, all EU countries—except Denmark and the UK—had legally committed to adopt it (Spolaore 2013). Observing the situation 22 years after the launch of the euro in 1999 and 17 years after the EU enlargement in 2004, it is tempting to conclude that European policy makers could not have been more wrong. The second largest European economy, the United Kingdom, decided to leave the EU. Economic convergence between countries in the west and the east of the EU has been strong, but political models have diverged so much that membership in the EU of countries such as Poland and Hungary cannot be taken for granted in the long run. In the euro area, the initial convergence in per capita GDP turned into divergence after the sovereign debt crisis (European Central Bank 2015).Footnote 1 Source: Penn World Tables). In Panels (c) and (d), the value of GDP per capita is set equal to 100 in 1990 GDP per capita (1990–2019). Panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 1 display the evolution over time of GDP per capita for selected euro area countries, as well as the population-weighted average value of the real GDP per capita for the EA-12 countries (i.e., Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain). The value of the real GDP per capita reported in this Figure is obtained by taking the ratio of the expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs (in 2017 US Dollars) and a country’s total population ( However, this pessimistic assessment is too one-sided. Following the sovereign debt crisis, the functioning of many euro area institutions was revamped and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) was established. For instance, fiscal policies are now better coordinated through the so-called European Semester procedure and fiscal rules in the Growth and Stability Pact (GSP) were tightened.Footnote 2 In view of these institutional reforms, one could reasonably expect that the economic divergence in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis would be reversed and the convergence would resume in the medium term. To address these issues properly, however, one needs to go beyond the simple evolution of GDP or GDP per capita and look instead at factors that might affect the potential future growth of a country, such as the accumulation of human capital (e.g., health and education), the competitiveness of markets (e.g., civil justice, labor and product market regulations, tax system), and the quality of political and social institutions. If, despite the sovereign debt crisis, convergence has continued across euro area countries with respect to these fundamental factors, economic convergence might also be expected to resume after the crisis. To be crystal clear; we do not claim, and we do not know of any theory claiming, that the adoption of the common currency per se should have led to increasing convergence either in policies concerning the accumulation of human capital or in the quality of institutions. Rather, the question addressed here is whether the euro area countries that were relatively more affected by the sovereign debt crisis—and therefore had to implement stronger fiscal adjustments—have nevertheless managed to maintain convergence in these public sector variables essential for economic growth. To perform this systematic analysis of convergence/divergence patterns among euro area countries along all these dimensions, we collect a vast array of comparable data from several sources concerning public services, product and labor markets regulation, and quality of institutions for the period 1990–2019. In the case of public services, we collect indicators regarding not only expenditure, but also internal organization and output. We complement the descriptive analysis based on convergence trends with difference-in-differences and event-study estimates. First, we test whether participation at the monetary union had any impact on the performance of the EA-12 countries which first adopted the euro compared to other OECD economies with similar market and political institutions.Footnote 3 Second, we test whether euro area countries hit by the sovereign debt crisis experienced different patterns of economic and institutional performance with respect to those which were not affected. We report both good and bad news. Using standard measures of convergence (i.e., sigma- and beta-convergence), it does not seem that in the period 1990–2019 EA-12 countries were on a diverging path with respect to the economic indicators more strictly connected to efficiency and economic growth. Although the countries more stricken by the great financial crisis in 2008 and by the subsequent euro area sovereign debt crisis had to reduce public expenditure in many fundamental services, the process of convergence in the main output indicators related to the accumulation of human capital was not affected by this. For example, there was still convergence in the share of graduates in the population. Concerning civil justice (e.g., number of procedures), competitiveness, regulation of labor and product markets, and female participation to the labor market, there was actually a strong evidence of convergence, as many euro area countries implemented massive reforms to improve the functioning of the public sector and make their markets more flexible and competitive. Our evidence from difference-in-differences estimates broadly confirms these results. While many of the estimated effects of participation at the EMU turn out to be not significant, for the sovereign debt crisis, there is instead evidence of a reduction in public expenditure. However, reforms were introduced which somewhat compensated for this. For example, expenditure in civil justice declined, but regulatory reforms led to a reduction in the number of procedures needed for a trial, thus generally improving the efficiency of the sector. We also observe a greater liberalization of the labor markets in euro area countries hit by the crisis. However, this comforting picture changes when we look at institutional, political and social indicators. Our econometric analysis suggests that euro area countries affected by the sovereign debt crisis experienced a collapse in terms of citizens’ perceptions about quality of governance, trust in national and European institutions, as well as turnout at national elections, with an increasing share of votes for populist parties. Perhaps surprisingly, a divergent trend among EA-12 countries with respect to some of these variables (e.g., corruption and perceptions about the quality of governance) appears even before the great financial crisis of 2008, as perceptions were already deteriorating in countries such as Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain in the first part of the 2000’s. Moreover, as our difference-in-differences estimates confirm, also social trust collapsed in the countries hit by the euro area sovereign debt crisis. Summing up, our results suggest that, despite an increased process of convergence in terms of economic indicators concerning the quality of fundamental public services, after the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis EA-12 were characterized by a strong trend of divergence in both institutional variables (e.g., governance quality) and political variables (e.g., share of votes for populist parties). Paradoxically, when considering political variables, a pattern of convergence emerges for citizens’ trust in institutions. However, this trend is driven by the collapsing trust in core countries less affected by the crisis, which became closer to periphery countries that were already exhibiting lower levels of trust. Considering these results, the viability of the EMU project (and probably, consequently, of the entire EU project) after the euro area sovereign debt crisis was more in trouble on political rather than economic grounds. Even if the fiscal consolidation and the economic reforms implemented in the euro countries more hit by the economic crisis were necessary and useful to the future growth of these countries, in democracies citizens’ perceptions matter. The fall of trust in national institutions and politicians, as well as the deterioration of the perceived quality of governance in several euro area countries affected by the crisis, led to a political backlash against the political parties that introduced the reforms. This happened for example in Italy in 2018, when populist parties gained power on an anti-Europe and anti-fiscal austerity agenda. And at the European elections of 2019, if populist parties did not manage to win a majority, they however substantially increased their voting shares and were the most voted in several countries both belonging (France, Italy, Austria) and not belonging (Poland) to the euro area.Footnote 4 Our work is related to several strands of literature. An extensive macro-econometric literature has already discussed convergence or divergence trends among EMU countries, particularly questioning the benefits of the monetary union (e.g., Campos et al. 2016) and whether symmetric or asymmetric shocks have become more likely after its establishment (e.g., Eichengreen et al. 2007; Alesina et al. 2017; Campos et al. 2019a). Bargain et al. (2013) study asymmetric shocks, fiscal systems, and debt crises in the euro area. Campos et al. (2021), moreover, explore the relationship between core and periphery countries in the single currency area, while Gros (2018) compares the convergence between Eastern and Western European countries with the divergence between Northern and Southern ones, focusing on macroeconomic variables such as wages, investment, and consumption. Mihaljek (2018) analyzes income convergence in Central and Eastern Europe, shedding light on the methodological issues related to the choice of meaningful benchmarks to evaluate catching-up processes in convergence studies. Finally, in another contribution, Campos et al. (2019b) provide a meta-analysis that summarizes this literature. Our analysis, however, differs from these studies not only in terms of methodology, but also because our focus is on the evolution of fundamental factors, including political institutions, which lie behind economic developments. A more micro-founded economic literature, instead, has examined the effects of the introduction of the euro on some specific sectors and markets. An example is the work of Alesina et al. (2010) that documents how the EMU triggered a deregulation process in the product markets, while labor markets reforms lagged behind. More generally, several authors have used the indicators of reforms, productivity and growth in the OECD area developed by Nicoletti et al. (2003), which we also rely on in this paper, to discuss comparable issues. A novelty of our approach, nevertheless, is that we consider also institutional and political variables, because of their relevance for the sustainability of economic convergence. Our work is also related to the literature that investigates the effects of economic and financial crises on the adoption of economic reforms (Alesina et al. 2006; Mian et al. 2014; Gokmen et al. 2021). This literature typically analyzes the characteristics of the crisis or of the political system that favor or impede reforms. Abstaining from these issues, we limit our research to study the effect of crises on reforms in EMU countries. We are certainly not the first to document the fall in the level of trust in political institutions in euro area countries hit by the sovereign debt crisis, although other authors do not offer a similar detailed convergence analysis. For example, Dustmann et al. (2017) document empirically the effects of the economic crisis and increased immigration in Europe. Algan et al. (2017) study the political consequences of the great financial crisis in Europe, documenting that in post-2008 elections, EU regions with higher unemployment experienced the sharpest decline in trust in institutions and traditional politics. Rodrik (2018) traces back the rise of populism to globalization, also distinguishing between a “left” and a “right” populism in Europe based on the characteristics of the immigrated population. Guiso et al. (2017) discuss the emergence of populist parties in Europe, distinguishing more carefully between supply and demand factors. They suggest that the rise of populism is linked not only to truly declining economic conditions, such as for example an increase in unemployment, but more generally to the feeling of insecurity that economic phenomena such as globalization, reforms, and digitalization might have created in vast segments of the population. In an extension and in line with our findings, Guiso et al. (2019) argue that populist movements gained more consensus in euro countries because the institutional constraints imposed by participation at the EMU (common monetary policy and the European fiscal rules) limited the possible actions that mainstream parties could take in the face of shocks. Noury and Roland (2020) also offer a comprehensive review of the literature on populism in Europe and argue that the “economic anxiety” produced by the 2008 great financial crisis helped the “cultural backlash” championed by populist parties to gain electoral support among voters. Inequality can also affect citizens’ perceptions about the quality of governance, their level of trust in institutions, and the support for populist parties. Several authors have examined empirically the relationship between inequality and the establishment of the European Monetary Union or the occurrence of the great financial crisis. Bertola (2010) suggests the existence of a U-shaped relationship between the establishment of the euro area and income inequality. Inequality in EMU countries diminished until 1999, remained constant in 2000–2001 and grew during the subsequent years. Atkinson et al. (2011) explore the relationship between inequality and the economic crisis: they do not find any empirical evidence that rising inequality leads to crises, but they document that inequality increases after a large crisis. Initially, a financial crisis mainly affects the richest individuals, while the subsequent recession hits more the poorest groups of the population. Finally, Alesina et al. (2017), in another contribution closely related to ours, ask whether the EMU is an optimal “political” area by studying the cultural, political, and social divergence across EA-12 countries over time using social surveys. Their answer is broadly positive, as the cultural variance inside EA-12 countries is much larger than that across EA-12 countries, and the US, despite being a consolidated political union, do not exhibit a lower level of cultural variance with respect to the euro area. However, they also note that several indicators, including perceptions of quality of governance and corruption, were on a diverging path in the euro area even before the advent of the sovereign debt crisis. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section ""Data set"" details the characteristics of our data set, specifying the collected variables and their sources. Section ""An overview of convergence/divergence trends"" presents a convergence analysis, looking at indicators of convergence for all our variables in the EMU context. Section ""Empirical analysis"" describes how we code membership to the euro area and the occurrence of the sovereign debt crisis, discussing the econometric evidence. Section ""Concluding remarks"" concludes. Some appendices are available online. Appendix 1 describes in detail our data sources. Appendix 2 and Appendix 3 present the graphical analysis relative to sigma-convergence. Appendix 4 shows the graphs of the event studies for all the variables included in our data set. Appendix 5 reports additional tables which display the results of further robustness checks for our econometric analysis.",3

Such opportunistic exploitation of fiscal policy could manifest itself as deteriorated budgetary balances before elections, through either higher aggregate spending or lower revenues, or both, which then could (sometimes) reverse after elections. Over the last three decades, there have been many empirical studies of PBCs. Nowadays, empirical tests on the hypothetical presence of PBCs in instruments and targeted variables (parameters) of fiscal policy are regarded as more convincing than tests in relation to macroeconomic outcomes (i.e. unemployment, inflation, growth), which have thus become less common (Dubois, 2016). Empirical research on monetary policy (political monetary cycles) have also been common in this branch of political economy, albeit with more ambiguous findings as conditioned by a number of factors, most notably the institutional independence of the central banks. Empirical research has been focused both in developed and developing or transition countries. The evidence on different manifestations of PBCs has been clearly stronger in the latter cluster of countries, whose emerging economies, institutions and societies (i.e. voting culture and context) vary significantly from those of developed countries, as well as among each other (e.g. see Brender and Drazen, 2005; Shi and Svensson, 2006; Alt and Lassen, 2006a, 2006b; Kyriacou et al., 2021). In this paper, we empirically investigate political budget cycles in Albania, a post-communist transition democracy, prone to opportunistic political (electoral) manipulation of economic policies and outcomes. We analyse the general government budget (fiscal) balance (i.e. the headline deficit). The budget balance is usually one of the main targeted parameters of fiscal policy conducted by a government. That is certainly the case in Albania. We analyse monthly data on the fiscal balance. Most studies in this field of research rely on annual data which have been considered a serious drawback (Streb et al., 2012; Akhmedov and Zhuravskaya 2004). Empirical analysis based on annual data could mask intra-year variation. Accordingly, studies using annual data could miss important electoral related dynamics in the analysed variables and thus underestimate the presence of political budgetary cycles, especially when elections fall in the middle of the (fiscal) year, which is the case in Albania. Indeed, our findings show a strong difference in deficits during pre- and post-election intra-annual time intervals, which does not appear when the econometric analysis is replicated on annually collapsed data. Previous research on Albania found evidence of significant expansion of public expenditures (Imami and Lami, 2006) as well as a deteriorating tax collection performance before elections (Lami et al., 2021), which—especially when the two combined—can result in higher deficits. This paper completes a trilogy of papers that all point to the same conclusion. Any of these papers is suggestive, but all three together more conclusively point to “the habit” of political budget cycles in Albanian as a sub-optimal way of conducting fiscal policy. During early transition, income from privatization may sustain increased expenditure prior to elections (as highlighted by Lami et al., 2016), in the long run, as most (large) privatizations have been concluded, income from taxation and borrowing are the key sources of financing governmental spending. We investigate also how PBCs are affected by “electoral competitiveness”, which is a germane dimension of analysis in the case of Albania, following the conceptualization of this aspect by Eibl and Lynge-Mangueira (2017) as explained in the third section below. The empirical approach we follow to test for this dimension of PBCs in Albania is the same as in Lami et al. (2021) who make an outcome-wise categorization of elections (i.e. elections that yield a change of political power and those that do not) and test for electoral cycles in tax collection performance around each category. They find that fiscal performance deteriorates substantially more intensively before elections that result in a change of political power than before those elections that reaffirm the incumbent. This paper presents further corroborating evidence that incumbents engage in much stronger PBC behaviour, manifested in budget balance, around those elections which result in a change of the political power. Hence, in the light of the argument developed by Eibl and Lynge-Mangueira (2017), incumbents behave as such when they face higher “electoral competiveness”, or, more bluntly, when they feel the fear of loss. Another institutional aspect in relation to PBC behaviour that we empirically look into is how the constitutional changes introduced in Albania in 2008, which affected the strength of political coalitions, have impacted the intensity of political budget cycles. In contrast to Lami et al. (2021), who do not find a significant impact of these constitutional amendments on the electoral cycle intensity of tax collection performance in Albania, we find that these changes do have a statistically significant intensifying impact on electoral cycles in the budget balance (deficit). The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section provides theoretical background and reviews the main conditional factors influencing PBC behaviour. The third section depicts the Albanian context by presenting an overview of the Albanian economy, politics, elections and related fiscal policy patterns. The fourth section sets out the methodology and the fifth section the findings. The last section concludes.",2

For the RMB, this is due to a major policy change that occurred in 2009; for the Euro, this is due to the establishment as a new currency formed by initially eleven Euro Area countries that in the meantime have grown to include 19 members. Do these two currencies have a common geographical dispersion pattern across offshore trading centres? Are there common determinants, and do policies matter for their relative position vis-à-vis other currencies? In this paper, we address these questions by analysing the BIS triennial survey on currency trading that covers a cross section of up to 39 non-Euro-Area countries. In the literature, the currency trading of the RMB has already received quite a bit of attention. In particular, Cheung et al. (2017, 2019, 2021) have used the same dataset to report the evolution of RMB dispersion across trading centres for the 2013–2016 and 2016–2019 periods, respectivelyFootnote 1. The empirical approach used in these papers will also be pursued in the present article. In the papers by Cheung et al., it is postulated that in the longer term the share of RMB trading will converge to a steady state value. This steady state is reached when the share of RMB traded in a given market is proportional to the relative size of that market in the global foreign exchange market. In all periods, though with different external control variables, there is overwhelming evidence that this convergency hypothesis is supported by the data. Also, for the Euro, the internationalization debate has been accompanying the currency since its establishment. In an early contribution, Portes and Rey (1998) have argued that the Euro is “expected to challenge the Dollar supremacy”, based on its GDP size and role in international tradeFootnote 2. After 20 years of existence, these expectations have not materialized and the debate is more focused on the question of why the Euro has not achieved a more prominent stance. Ilzetzki, Reinhart and Rogoff (2020) put it aptly when they argue that the Euro is still “punching below its weight”Footnote 3. These studies are considering for instance the bid-ask spreads, reserve holdings, or discuss the political dimensions of monetary policy and the slow steps forward towards a banking unionFootnote 4. The strong position of the Dollar vis-à-vis the Euro, based on data by the BIS triennial survey, has been highlighted by Kenen (2011) and a comprehensive overview of the Euro’s evolution is given in ECB (2021). Hudecz et al. (2021) discuss possible policies that would further strengthen the role of the Euro on international capital markets and refer to the RMB experience in their analysis. Earlier econometric research on Euro trading has been focusing on higher frequencies. Using data from a major electronic brokerage platform Brzeszczynski and Melvin (2006) have analysed the rise and fall of Euro trading from 1999 to 2003. The authors use daily, weekly and intra-daily data to illustrate that momentum and carry-trade motives have been driving factors during this period. However, a longer-term analysis of turnover data, analogous to the RMB trading analysis of Cheung et al. (2019), has so far not been conducted yet. The core of the empirical analysis is the link between the change in currency trading of the Euro/RMB and a gap-variable, which covers the difference between the levels of Euro/RMB and all currencies traded in that market. Suppose for instance an offshore trading centre has a 5% share of all currencies traded on the global foreign exchange market, but the share of Euros traded is only 2%. The prediction would be that the Euro-trading share over the following 3-year period would go up, such that the gap between all currencies traded and the Euro trading would be closed over time on that offshore trading centre. A second key explanatory variable is the change in all currencies traded. If the change in Euro/RMB trading has reached a more mature stage, i.e. it is closer to its long-term equilibrium, the convergence process is expected to come to halt, and the change in all currencies is expected to be the most relevant determining factor for the change in either Euro, RMB or indeed any other currency. While a significant gap-variable is a well-established result in the literature for the RMB, we do not find a robust comparable counterpart in the Euro data, except for the initial period of 2001–2004, right after the introduction of the Euro. Instead, the second variable, the change in the share of all currencies, dominates the regression. This is true for the size of the coefficient, its statistical significance, and its contribution to the R-square of the regression. Economically, we attribute this central result to the fact that the Euro, while new on the global foreign exchange market, is the successor of more established currencies, such as the D-Mark, Lira, or Peseta. In particular, the D-Mark has been widely used as an international currency, but due to the uncertainty about the modalities of the changeover, it lost popularity in many countries during the 1990s. Thus, the initial strong evidence on convergence for the Euro is likely to be a rebound effect from the D-Mark losing ground in currency trading during the previous decade. Several further exercises shed light on the Euro-trading pattern and its geographical dispersion across trading centres. For instance, we analyse several sets of control variables that include the links to the Euro Area and economic and institutional characteristics of offshore trading centres. In the most recent 2016–2019 period, a dummy variable for the existence of a bilateral swap-line and a dummy variable for Eastern Europe (where some countries expect to introduce the Euro in the future), are significantly positive determinants. There is also some limited evidence that institutional characteristics, such as the distinction between a banks-based vs. market-based financial system, the colonial history, and legal origin play a role. Our overall conclusion regarding the control variables, however, is that they are neither stable over time, nor have a sizeable impact on the overall fit of the regression. This contrasts with earlier results for the RMB in Cheung et al. (2021), who document that the bilateral trade with offshore centres, as well as trade dispute episodes and their interaction with the bilateral trading volume, play an important role for the RMB. A second striking difference between the two currencies is the initial conditions at the beginning of the sample period. While the RMB was overrepresented, i.e. the “gap” to the share of all currencies was positive, not negative, in only 3 out of 51 offshore trading centres (Hong Kong, Korea, and Singapore), this was the case in 14 of out 37 offshore financial centres in the Euro benchmark regression. We therefore analyse whether these initial conditions matter, and indeed find that there is substantially more evidence of convergence for the Euro as well, when over- and underrepresented markets are distinguished. Again, the evidence is not stable over time, but generally, there is more convergence from below the equilibrium share than from above. This distinction also matters for the pre-Euro D-Mark period, where we find that in the 1990s, the D-Mark was losing ground in both types of centres. In those markets where the D-Mark was overrepresented, it was losing ground, and in the market where it was initially underrepresented, it was falling behind even further in some of the sub-periods. Finally, we also analyse other currencies that from an institutional and economic perspective might be more similar to the Euro than the Renminbi, i.e. the US Dollar, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Swiss Franc, the Japanese Yen, and the Australian Dollar. These currencies—except for the Canadian Dollar—do not show any sign of convergence at all. The Australian Dollar was even diverging from the equilibrium most recently, possibly due to the popularity of the currency during the most recent global financial crisis in 2007/2008. In earlier sub-periods, there are—similar to the Euro—occasional periods with significant convergence terms. But unlike the RMB and the early period of the Euro, the marginal R-square of the gap-variable is almost always practically zero. Also, the change in the share of all currencies, the second main variable in the regression, explains close to 100% of the variance in most of these other countries. This is a remarkable difference to the RMB, where the marginal R-square of the gap-variable alone is about 20%.Footnote 5 Summing up, in the comparison of the Euro and the RMB, there are both similarities and differences. The similarity is the convergence phenomenon at the beginning of the period. Here the dynamics of the Euro trading are reminiscent of those experienced by the RMB. Another common observation is the time-varying nature of determining factors. In this perspective, the results blend into earlier findings reported in Cheung and Yiu (2017), Cheung et al. (2019) and Cheung et al. (2021). The differences can be found in the patterns after the initial convergence period, as well as with regard to policy variables. While Euro-trading appears to be largely driven by market forces, the RMB-trading has been shown to react to policies and episodes of trade disputes. Overall, in our regressions, the Euro displays a more similar behaviour to established currencies on international markets, like the Swiss Franc, the Canadian Dollar or the Australian Dollar. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In “The Evolution of Euro and Renminbi Currency Trading” section, we start by eyeballing the data and discussing the historical evolution of Euro and RMB trading. Empirical Analyses starts with a benchmark regression for the period 2016–2019, then adds control variables and traces the evolution of the convergence term over time. It also compares the Euro findings to those earlier reported on the RMB. Finally, in the extended analysis in “Extended Analysis” section, we distinguish between the pattern from above/below the equilibrium, present the results for the earlier D-Mark period and draw the analogies to other countries.",
65,2,Comparative Economic Studies,07 March 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-022-00185-4,From the British to the Chinese Periphery: Capital Accumulation Through Primary-Commodity Production in Australia and Argentina,June 2023,Nicolas Grinberg,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"One of the classical discussions in development economics relates to the long-term potentials of national economies that participate in global markets as suppliers of raw or semi-processed materials. Though different theories have been proposed to account for the development and growth of this type of national economy, the mainstream position on the topic has recently settled on the agreement that whatever limitations prevail in such societies they are nothing other than self-inflicted. For that, it seems, one only needs to find a case that shows a national economy thus structured which behaves just like the most advanced national economies and compare it with one national economy that once did that but no longer does it thanks to its own policy mistakes. Australia and Argentina offer such pair. Unsurprisingly, these contrasting cases help build the argument presented in a path-setting work in the field of political economy of development: Why Nations Fail by Acemoglu and Robinson (2012). Appearances, however, can be misleading. The exercise of comparing the Australian and Argentinian economies, however, is not new. In fact, the Australian experience has long been considered as the standard against which to compare Argentina’s process of economic development while the Argentinian economy once figured as a warning in mainstream studies of Australian economic development (see, respectively, Dieguez 1969; Duncan and Fogarty 1984). Both national economies had in common a form of original incorporation in the international division of labour based on the production for British markets of temperate-weather primary commodities by white European settlers and a pattern of industrialisation based on production for protected domestic markets. Moreover, they have both recently undergone a process of deindustrialisation and increasing commercial integration with China. Notwithstanding the common long-term trends, Australian society has enjoyed higher living standards and more stable political trajectories. It is because of these differences in economic and political performance, despite the seemingly similar initial conditions, that the comparison of Argentina’s and Australia’s economic development has been a fertile ground to test contrasting theories. Despite differences, mainly because of the period when they arose, these theories have shared one specific point of the departure: they all focus on deep-seated, national-level institutional variables as the main force accounting for economic and political differentiation. The goal of the present paper is to advance an account of the comparative economic development of Argentina and Australia alternative to mainstream institutionalist narratives which serves to highlight the specificities of national processes of capital accumulation (i.e. capitalist reproduction/development) structured around the production of raw materials for world markets as well as the conditions leading to differentiation. This comparison should appeal not only to those interested in the two countries, but also to those interested in the political economy of development in general. For, Australia, together with its New Zealander appendix, offer the only ‘successful’ post-colonial experiences based on Anglo-Saxon political traditions of representative democracy and ‘rule of law’ outside the United States (and its Canadian appendix). Without the antipodean cases supporting mainstream new institutional theories, the US ‘exceptionality’ (i.e. being the only ex-colonial economy that became a science-based technologically vanguard industrial economy as the one that engendered it) and the British ‘singularity’ (i.e. the first industrialised national economy) would need to be explained on different grounds. For that purpose, the paper is organised as follows. The next section reviews the central stages of academic and political debates on the comparative economic development of Argentina and Australia, uncovering their shared theoretical perspective and pointing at their main weakness. Section three offers a methodological critique of mainstream theories. Section fourth proposes the general guidelines of an alternative approach based on four insights drawn from Marx’s critique of political economy. First, that the contemporary process of social reproduction is organised autonomously as the boundless self-expansion of the objectified capacity to set in motion the private organs of social labour; i.e. as a process of capital accumulation. Second, that, as an expression of this historical potentiality, the process of social reproduction through capital accumulation is structured on a global scale; i.e. capital is a universal social relationship. Third, that the process of capital accumulation, though autonomously regulated, comes about through different direct relations amongst social labour’s independent organs, some of which transcend the private sphere to became politico-institutional relations; i.e. that economic-type (indirect) social relations realise through institutionalised (direct) social relationships. Fourth, that national processes of capitalist development are state-mediated, specifically structured particularisations of global-scale accumulation dynamics; i.e. that capital’s valorisation on a global scale takes form in the international division of labour and the specific determination of national processes of surplus-value production (Marx 1976; Iñigo-Carrera 2014a, 2016). Building on these insights, section five presents an overview of the three main historical stages of Australian and Argentinian economic development: the formation of the national economy based on primary-commodity exports; the process of import-substitution industrialisation (ISI); the neoliberal deindustrialising period. Section six advances an analysis of the main determinants of differentiation in the process of economic development in both countries and section seven compares their manifestation in the processes of economic growth. Section eight closes the paper summarising its main points and conclusions. The appendix at the end presents the main quantitative evidence supporting the historical and theoretical analyses.",1

Informal Connections and Beliefs About Prospects of Upward Mobility in Transition Economies,September 2023,Alexandru Cojocaru,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The principle of non-discrimination, or the belief that in the competition for positions in society all individuals with relevant attributes for the performance of duty should be included in the pool of eligible candidates, is an important tenet of equality of opportunity in Western democracies (Roemer 2000). Yet, according to the data from the latest round of the life in transition (LiTS) survey, three-quarters of adults across the sample of all transition economies and several Western European countries report that having informal connections who can influence decisions in their favor is at least moderately important (more than half think it very important or essential) to get a good job in the government sector. More than two-thirds think connections are at least moderately important to get a good job in the private sector (EBRD 2017). If socio-economic mobility is a universal human aspiration, of parents hoping for a better life for their children (Narayan et al. 2018), then these subjective assessments, based on nationally representative data covering a region with a population of about 500 million adults, present a very bleak picture of the perceived equality of opportunity for success in life. Does this ubiquitous perception of the necessity of informal connections for key opportunities in life actually contribute to beliefs about one’s prospects of upward mobility (POUM)? This question, examined in this study, is important for several reasons. First, expectations of upward mobility have been shown to be important determinants of current policy preferences, in particular with respect to redistribution (Benabou and Ok 2001; Ravallion and Lokshin 2000; Checchi and Filippin 2004; Alesina and La Ferrara 2005; Alesina and Giuliano 2009; Cojocaru 2014a, b; Dorsch 2010), policy preferences which also shape ones future opportunities. Second, beliefs about future mobility may affect current investments in human capital for self and children, which will then affect actual mobility (Hoff 2012; Genicot and Ray 2017). If chances for success are not equal, and the extent of one’s future mobility depends on access to informal connections, then one may under invest in human capital, if such connections are not available. The Great Gatsby Curve (Corak 2017) provides a prominent illustration of the link between inequality and inter-generational mobility. The goal of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the links between beliefs about the importance of connections to access key opportunities and expectations of future mobility. To do so, I take advantage of the LiTS survey, which provides harmonized, comparable, and nationally representative attitudinal data for 35 countries in the Europe and Central Asia region. The LiTS survey offers a number of distinct advantages. First, it offers an unambiguous assessment of the respondent’s own expectations of future mobility. Second, the LiTS questionnaire provide information on the perceived importance of personal connections for access to key opportunities, such as a good job or university education. Third, in addition to beliefs about the importance of connections, the survey also has responses on whether respondents have access to personal connections that can facilitate access to opportunities. Finally, it makes it possible to examine the link between inequality of access to opportunities and expectations of future mobility based on comparable data from a large set of countries; it also allows for comparisons between countries in Western and Eastern Europe. By examining, empirically, the links between beliefs about the importance of informal connections and expectations of future mobility, the paper aims to contribute to the literature that examines how expectations of future mobility are formed. While many factors can be at play, as shown both in the theoretical and empirical studies reviewed in “Introduction” section, the focus of this paper is on the institutional dimensions of expectations/aspirations, namely on the extent to which the existence of an uneven playing field dampens such expectations, particularly for the disadvantaged groups. The subject of inquiry is related to the studies that show that inequality of opportunity may elicit behavioral responses such as resignation and reduced ambition, which can lead to inequality traps (Bourguignon et al. 2006; World Bank 2005; Piketty 1995).Footnote 1 The estimates presented in this paper suggest that: (i) lack of informal connections is indeed associated with expectations of a lower position on the future social ladder; and (ii) when informal connections are unavailable, it matters for your future expectations whether you perceive connections to be vital or not. These links are also economically meaningful—in the pooled sample, lack of connections, when these are important is associated with a 40% lower expected future upward mobility. There is also some evidence that in the European Union countries, where formal institutions are stronger, individuals are less likely to resort to informal institutions such as personal connections, even when these are available. Finally, those who perceive access to key opportunities to be mediated by personal connections are found to demand greater levels of redistribution, unless connections are available to access those opportunities. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. “Beliefs About Future Social Mobility: Theory and Evidence” reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on the determinants of mobility expectations, and of experienced mobility. “Data Description” section provides a description of the key variables used in the paper as well as key descriptive statistics. “Empirical Strategy” outlines the empirical setup, including ways of addressing endogeneity concerns associated with cross-sectional analysis, as well as the key hypotheses to be tested. Key results are presented in “Results” section, for the pooled sample and separately for EU and non-EU groups of countries. The section also discusses the differences between EU and non-EU results. Some alternative specifications are considered in “Robustness Analysis” section as part of robustness analysis. “Unfairness and Redistributive Preferences” examines how beliefs about the importance of connections and the availability of connections are related to current individual preferences for redistribution. “Concluding Remarks” section provides some concluding remarks.",1

The Creation of Powerful Presidential Families in Central Asia,September 2023,Richard Pomfret,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The sudden end of central planning in 1989 in Central and Eastern Europe and in 1991 in the Soviet Union and the ensuing transition to market-based economies was largely unexpected. Piecemeal reforms had taken place, but the total collapse of central planning mechanisms was unanticipated. Policymakers unfamiliar with market economies and in many countries with few domestic advisers to fill the knowledge gap turned to foreign economists, especially those in institutions such as the IMF and World Bank whose technical advice came with financial assistance. Oleh Havrylyshyn was exceptional in playing the three roles of independent academic adviser, senior member of a transition-economy government, and IMF official. Despite debates over speed and sequencing, external economic advice to policymakers in transition economies was generally consistent, captured in the “Washington Consensus” and favouring rapid reform. Sequencing was determined by practical considerations; liberalization of prices and privatization of small enterprises were quicker than privatization or restructuring of large enterprise, or than creating a tax, financial or legal system suitable for a market-based economy. In Present at the Transition, Havrylyshyn argued that the advice was sound. Countries pursuing a “Big Bang” strategy reaped economic and political benefits; they became more prosperous and democratic after communism than countries adopting gradual or partial reform. The key elements of transition were price liberalization and privatization or restructuring of state enterprises. For a successful transition, as Havrylyshyn (2020) repeatedly emphasized, in both cases the “how” was at least as important as the “how much”. Liberalized prices must be competitively determined. Changes in ownership structure must result in owners who respond to prices to minimize costs and maximize profits. The outcome is a matter of degree; all market-based economies have areas of monopoly power and state-regulated prices, and all capitalist economies have inefficient state-owned or private enterprises, but even a cursory comparison between high-income and poor economies shows that the degree matters. A striking feature of Havrylyshyn’s book is the space and emphasis that he gives to elites. As extremes, he contrasts the new rich in Central European Big Bang countries (such as the Czech Republic and Poland), who formed a new capitalist class that supported further reforms and consolidation of the new economic system, with the new rich in countries with gradual reforms or where an early Big Bang was aborted. In the latter, communist-era elites were able to short-circuit the reform process to their own economic benefit. Oligarchs in Russia and Ukraine were also directly involved in politics, in Russia sometimes losing out and in Ukraine even rising to the presidency. Although we know the starting point for the transition from central planning, the destination on the spectrum from more to less well-functioning market-based economies is less clear. Havrylyshyn’s emphasized elites because of their key role in determining the country-specific variety of capitalism that will ensue. Havrylyshyn focused on the oligarchs in the two largest Soviet successor states, Russia and Ukraine. However, they were not typical of the non-Baltic former Soviet republics (FSU), despite the generalization that the old guard’s “success was considerable in the FSU, culminating in the creation of an enormously wealthy group of oligarchs” (Havrylyshyn 2020, 279). In the Central Asian countries and Azerbaijan, power and wealth became concentrated in presidential families and their associates, and this has consequences for the type of market-based economies created in these countries. This paper considers the five Central Asian republics as a natural experiment of countries with similar cultural, geographical, and historical background in a region that experienced no interstate wars and only one violent post-independence political transition (Tajikistan 1992-7). Transition strategies covered the full spectrum from rapid reform (Kyrgyzstan) to minimal change (Turkmenistan). By the turn of the century, economic output performance varied but showed little relation to transition strategies. In contrast to the variety of economic transition strategies, all five political systems gave overwhelming power to the president. In four countries, former Soviet First Secretaries cemented their power as presidents. Until 1997, Tajikistan suffered through a civil war during which the old guard lost power and a regional warlord became president; once the war was over, he strengthened presidential powers. Twenty-first century economic performance was dominated by the 1999–2014 global resource boom, which enabled presidents to deliver economic improvements as well as strengthening their own image and security services. Protests occurred, but were localized and quelled, or pre-empted, with varying degrees of violence. Only in Kyrgyzstan were protesters able to bring about change in leadership, although by the early 2020s presidential powers had been restored and the super-presidential regime resembled that of the other four countries. This paper argues that the nature of the regimes in Central Asia differs fundamentally from those of Russia and Ukraine. A model for Central Asian countries was established by Azerbaijan, a country with similarities to Central Asia. Wealth and power are clearly concentrated in the hands of the president and are shared primarily with his family and close associates. Although economic transition strategies in Central Asia varied greatly, the power of presidents and their family have led to similar characteristics of the economic systems.",1

Almost every parliament in Europe currently has a seat occupied by a populist party, with representants of these party getting re-elected, and even leading governments in places. Viktor Orbán and Fidesz have ruled Hungary since 2010, Jarosław Kaczyński and Law and Justice—since 2015, while Marine le Pen reached the second round of the French presidential election in 2017 and 2022. For many, the key triggers were: the economic crisis of 2008 and the refugee crisis of 2015 as exogenous shocks in the economic sphere (Guriev 2018; Stankov 2018; Margalit 2019; Guiso et al. 2020; Rodrik 2021) and in the cultural sphere (Norris and Inglehart 2019). But now that these crises have abated, one can wonder why populism remains a potent political force. New explanations are needed to understand why successful populist politicians continue to lead governments or have parliamentary representations across Europe. Here, we contend that what is missing from the extent of scholarship is a discussion of the possible moderating role of trust in national and supranational institutions on voters’ economic circumstances when deciding to support a specific party. Institutional quality might have a protective effect, even in times of hardship. Institutional trust can either amplify or dampen the impact of an individual’s socioeconomic situation on their political decision. Strong institutions create trust, demonstrate legitimacy, and prompt polity to protect them (Greif and Laitin 2004). This becomes especially important in times of crisis, when a high level of confidence that strong established institutions of government will solve one’s economic hardship could protect one from susceptibility to anti-establishment and populist rhetoric. Institutions can thus have a protective effect that would allow voters not to turn to populism if they have enough faith that institutions are set up to protect them. The European Union provides a unique example in this regard. In some parts of the EU, citizens with historically low levels of trust levels toward their local government could trust the European Parliament as an anchor for national legitimacy, in hope that further economic and institutional convergence in the bloc might raise their economic well-being (Mihaljek 2018). At the same time, citizens who are susceptible to the anti-Brussels rhetoric of politicians might be looking at their national institutions as superior to the supranational ones (van Bohemen et al. 2019). European populists often blame the EU for mishaps at the national level, resulting in a decrease in trust in supranational institutions. This has been especially the case for the populist parties in government for a long period of time, such as Hungary and Poland, and thus the difference in trust into national institutions versus supranational ones would provide insight on the extent the anti-Brussels rhetoric is effective in the context when populists represent the government itself. The moderating effect of institutions and trust in them in the context of populist voting seems to be understudied, even when it is linked to populism indirectly through institutional environments (Devinney and Hartwell 2020) and successful transition (Havrylyshyn 2001; Havrylyshyn and Van Rooden 2003). Indeed, both Norris and Inglehart (2016) and Guiso et al. (2020) use some form of institutional trust as controls in their models, but do not analyze their moderating role. Other studies have illustrated interesting links between trust and populist support. For example, Geurkink et al. (2020) find that political trust mainly reflects the antielitism of populism, Algan et al. (2017) crisis-driven economic insecurity is a substantial determinant of populism and political distrust, while Dustmann et al. (2017) illustrate the correlations between dissatisfaction toward the prevailing political establishment and the rise of populist parties in Europe. Here, we contend, however, that not enough attention has been given to trust in institutions as a key moderator. The joint effect of institutional mistrust and economic insecurity is at the core of what populism means in terms of ideology. In its minimal definition, populism is thin—besides the ideological divide between us versus them, it is not a full ideology, such as communism or liberalism (Mudde 2017). Instead, the economic and trust dimensions could become additional ‘thickening’ factors that a party or politician could use for greater appeal. In fact, economic insecurity issues have been heavily emphasized in the political programs of the radical left parties, while the sense of mistrust of the local and supranational establishment as well as the lack of representation of 'the left behind', is the key salient issue for Eurosceptic and populist far right. The electorate that bases its decision on these prompting factors on the demand side of populism meets the supply through party cues and ideological shifts on economic and cultural dimensions. The main contribution of this paper is a deliberate focus on investigating whether institutional trust helps or hinders the chances of populists being elected under particular socioeconomic conditions. In other words, differences among voting patterns could depend not only on the level of trust in the government or the economic conditions of the voter, but would depend on the interaction between trust in the government and the degree of economic insecurity of the voter. For some socioeconomic groups, their level of trust in institutions may not be a determinant of who to vote for, as their primary concern might be purely economic. Others might feel loyal to a party as well as to the government system under which they prosper and which they associate with the improvement in their personal economic conditions in the past. In EU countries, and as mentioned above, the moderation effect can come from two sources independently: the national sources (politicians, political parties, parliament, or the legal system), and the European sources, such as the EU parliament, and this can play differently in different countries. Methodologically, our paper constructs a novel index of economic insecurity (a build-up on Guiso et al. 2017) and uses multilevel modeling to conduct a more fine-grained analysis that goes beyond the individual, as group, regional, and country differences are considered in the study. The article is structured as follows. The next section introduces the theory used to motivate the hypotheses. The following section presents the methodology and results. The final section then discusses the results and concludes.",2

Since the publication of the seminal paper of Nordhaus (1975), there has been a growing body of empirical research on this topic. Traditional Political Business Cycle theory characterizes politicians as opportunistic. The driving force incentivizing both the incumbent’s behaviour and their economic policies is to remain in power. Voters are assumed to be both myopic and naive and as such prone to vote for incumbents when times are good prior to the election. Hibbs (1977) provided an alternative view incorporating partisan preferences over policy outcomes, arguing that left-wing parties tend to prefer low unemployment at the expense of higher inflation, while right-wing parties have the opposite preferences. While a partisan approach can fit well to (many) western countries or industrial democracies, there is a common understanding that the opportunistic model best describes (some) developing countries, where elections are often considered referenda on specific rulers and recent economic conditions (Block 2002). The incumbent government may use monetary as well as fiscal policies/instruments to stimulate the economy in conjunction with elections. In the case of monetary instruments, the incumbent can persuade the central bank to engage in expansionary monetary policies prior to elections, known also as political monetary cycle (PMC). While the occurrence of PMC requires that the incumbent has certain levels of control over the central bank (which is not always the case), the alternative economic policy instrument which is under direct control/domain of the incumbent government is fiscal policy. The government can engage in expansionary fiscal policies, which can take the form of lower taxation and/increased spending prior to elections, which eventually results in increased debt—this phenomenon is known as Political Budget Cycle (PBC) (Lami and Imami 2019). PBCs are more pronounced in emerging economies or new democracies. Brender and Drazen (2005), analysing 68 low- and high-income democracies, demonstrate that new democracies are more vulnerable to PBCs, resulting in higher public spending and larger deficits before elections. Klomp and de Haan (2013a, b), based on panel data analysis, confirm the existence of PBCs being reflected in fiscal balances (as well as public sending) both in young and old democracies. They find far stronger political cycles in the latter category. Lack of (or limited) voter experience can explain why voters in new democracies do not behave rationally or punish such incumbent behaviour (Praščević 2020; Hanusch and Keefer 2014; Rose 2006; Shi and Svensson 2006; Brender and Drazen 2005). On the other hand, this is more likely to be the case in developed economies where voters have experience and understanding of the costs of PBC. Thus, in this context, fiscal manipulation in advanced democracies may be punished rather than rewarded (Brender and Drazen 2005). Differences in a PBC pattern or its magnitude between developing and developed countries may be due to differences in institutional environments, which are related to corruption, rent-seeking activities, and access to free media (Shi and Svensson 2006). Alt and Lassen (2006a, b) highlight the importance of transparency—the higher the degree of fiscal transparency the lower are public debt and deficits during electoral periods. In this context, the media play a crucial role in providing trustworthy and accurate information to citizens (Hong 2016). New democracies are often characterized by an underdeveloped media sector which is under the strong influence of the government and characterized by non-transparent media ownership and money flows associated with high levels of corruption. These are the characteristics of the media market in Serbia (see Kisić 2015). PBC patterns may be influenced by the timing of elections, e.g. whether elections are called earlier than it has been scheduled (snap/early elections) or on time (scheduled regular elections). In some countries (e.g. the USA), election timing is imposed constitutionally. In many countries early elections are possible and often common. If election timing is not set for a fixed date by the constitution, the incumbent can call early elections for political or economic reasons (Lächler 1982). This implies that the incumbent, instead of engaging in expansionary economic (e.g. fiscal) policies, may use a positive (external) sector supply shock (e.g. high growth, low unemployment, and inflation) as an opportunity to call an early election (Ito and Park 1988), whereas when early elections are called for other reasons (e.g. loss of confidence or a coalition breaks down), the incumbent may not have sufficient time to plan and implement expansionary polices—vice versa, if elections take place as planned (the case of regular elections), the incumbent government has more (sufficient) time to plan and execute expansionary policies with the aim that they will yield the expected “positive effect” in the economy prior to electionsFootnote 1. Thus, it is very important to distinguish between regular (scheduled) and early (snap) elections when analysing PBCs (Imami et al. 2020). In our paper, we empirically investigate PBCs in Serbia, a post-communist economy, characterized by a limited democratic history and voter experience, a weak institutional framework, and a high level of corruption, as explained in the following section. This paper adds value to the literature from several perspectives. First, this is the first paper to target PBC phenomena in Serbia. Until now, Serbia was rather part of a broader analysis of transition countries (see Pavlović and Bešić 2019) but previous studies do not provide insight on the occurrence of PBC. The case of Serbia is of interest also because it is one of the last countries embracing transition from a planned economy and dictatorship to market economy and democracy. Second, the analysis puts an emphasis on distinguishing between early/snap elections and regular elections in conjunction with PBC, which is relevant and of interest for other countries too. Even in the context of a relaxed/weak institutional environment, which characterizes Serbia (see more details later in the paper), the incumbent faces limitations on the timely execution of fiscal expansionary policies. It is even more important, since the changes in the institutional framework for conducting monetary policy considerably reduce the possibility of monetary policy misuse, also in transition economies (Praščević 2020). The findings suggest that the elections-related deterioration of the fiscal balance is clearly present in Serbia—this phenomenon is driven by regular (scheduled) elections, while there is no significant increase in the deficit prior to early (snap) elections. Our findings are in line with previous research dealing with PBC in context of weak institutions and now democracies (see, for example, Hallerberg et al. 2002; Brender and Drazen 2005; Block 2002). Moreover, the use of recent monthly data provides more accurate insight into the PBC dynamics. The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section describes the country context by presenting an extensive analysis, which is important to understand the political, institutional, and economic context, and also provides useful information per se, given the scarcity of such insights about Serbia in the academic literature. The third section describes the methodology, the fourth section provides the findings while in the last section concluding remarks are presented.",2

Macroprudential policy has the task of tracking and monitoring the financial cycle for the sake of the calibration of important policy instruments. The GFC (Global Financial Crisis) prompted policymakers to make more active use of macroprudential policy instruments, including the CCyB (Countercyclical Capital Buffer), to increase the financial system's resilience and reduce the build-up of imbalances. In good times, capital requirements increase, and credit institutions build up their resilience. When the financial cycle enters the downward phase, buffers such as CCyB can be released. This additional capital can be used to facilitate credit activity in the face of a downturn. The calibration of capital requirements such as the CCyB is based on forward-looking indicators that reflect the current phase of the financial cycle. Therefore, it is crucial to have indicators of the financial cycle that can be used regularly.Footnote 1 Policymakers need valid and robust indicators to give them a sound foundation for any tightening or loosening of macroprudential policy. The desirable properties of credit and financial cycle indicators were discussed in Önkal et al. (2002), Lawrence et al. (2006), Kauko (2012), and Drehmann and Tsatsaronis (2014), among others. These papers identify the two most important properties of a reliable financial cycle indicator: good future crisis signaling properties in terms of minimizing type I and II errors, and stability and stationarity of the indicator. It should have cyclical movements that match the financial cycle, with some mean reverting property. If the indicator is stable or stationary, it is easier to predict, which facilitates CCyB calibration and other empirical uses. As a starting point in financial cycle tracking, the Basel credit gap is a standardized indicator in the current BIS (2010) and ESRB (2014) regulations. It is defined as the difference between the ratio of credit to GDP and its long-term trend estimated with a one-sided Hodrick–Prescott filter (HP 1997) with the smoothing parameter set to 400,000. Earlier literature often finds that this gap has good signaling properties for future crises (e.g., Drehmann et al. 2010, 2014; Borio and Lowe 2002; Borio and Drehmann 2009; Galán, 2019; Detken et al. 2014; Schularick and Taylor 2012; Dell Ariccia et al. 2012). Typically, macroprudential authorities utilize a one-sidedFootnote 2 HP filter to track credit dynamics. However, the Basel gap obtained with the HP filter has many shortcomings (see Cogley and Nason 1995; Kamber et al. 2018; Hamilton 2018; or Škrinjarić and Bukovšak 2022 for an exhaustive list). Basel gap performs poorly in some cases; for example, carrying a “memory” of the massive credit boom of the early 2000s forward to give misleadingly low values during the 2010s. The most commonly discussed problem with the HP filter is the end-point problem. Due to the nature of the optimization process of the HP filter, the last few data points (the latest added data) have different (greater) weights in the trend estimation than earlier values of the series. Macroprudential decisions are affected by this because the most recent data are usually the most relevant when making such decisions. Another issue with real-time estimates is examined by Edge and Meisenzahl (2011) who find that the final revisions to GDP effect the credit-to-GDP ratio. The HP filter was found to have extensive ex-post revisions due to significant revisions to GDP in data. All in all, macroprudential decision-making in real time is challenging. This research focuses on how to fix the end-point problem of the HP filter in a systematic way. Although studies that find better approaches to gap estimation than the HP filter do exist (Hamilton 2018; Beutel et al. 2018; Lang et al. 2019, etc.), we stay within the HP approach. This is because there are empirical studies by central banks that found the HP approach to be the best in financial crisis signaling (Drehmann et al. 2010; Galán 2019; Valinskytė and Rupeika 2015; the Croatian case in Škrinjarić and Bukovšak 2022a, 2022b).Footnote 3 Related research recommends solving the end-point bias problem by extending the series with forecasts (see Kaiser and Maravall 1999; or Mise et al. 2005). This paper follows a retrofitting approach by comparing different models across different forecast horizons and several measures of performance. As the two-sided HP gap is considered the ""true""Footnote 4 gap, the one-sided gaps are compared to the dynamics of the two-sided one. Moreover, each approach's OOS (out-of-sample) performance is considered an essential factor. Unlike the previous literature, which compares forecasts to HP trend values, we compare the forecasts of credit and GDP values to the subsequent realizations of both series. Previous papers compare the OOS forecasted gap series with the subsequent actual gap values. However, the gap series by itself contains estimation errors. In order to reduce such errors, instead of comparing gap series, this paper first forecasts the credit and GDP series, and compares their OOS forecasts with the subsequent actual values of both series.Footnote 5 Moreover, the stability of the resulting indicators will be considered. A basic decision-making utility function will be used to make the comparisons. The utility function summarizes many criteria into a single number, so that it is easier to compare different alternatives, rank them and make a final decision. This helps in macroprudential decision-making, and can be used in real-time decision-making, as they are relatively simple to estimate and communicate. Using OOS forecasting as an additional step in the HP filter as done in this paper, policymakers can obtain a more stable indicator that facilitates CCyB decision-making. For the empirical part of the analysis, Croatian data for the period 4Q 1999–4Q 2021 are used. A couple of words should be said about our single-country analysis. Although it is only compelling to some readers, there are reasons why this research should be focused on one country. The causes of banking crises are heterogeneous, as shown in Klomp (2010) who looked at 110 countries. Panel analysis might provide better results in some cases, but due to the heterogeneity of country characteristics, not all measures and instruments can be copied from one country to another. Next, Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) show that threshold values of the credit-to-GDP gap that minimized the noise-to-signal ratios when used to signal a future crisis are country-specific. Another interesting result is found in Davis and Karim (2008), who estimated significant differences between the country-specific and global thresholds in the early warning signaling model approach to banking crises. The authors concluded that generalized global models do not substitute for country-specific macroprudential modeling and surveillance. This study shows that it is challenging to choose the best model and fit it for all observed series uniformly. This is particularly problematic when the forecaster and the decision-maker have different preferences. For example, shorter time horizons have more minor OOS errors, but longer horizons have smaller revisions toward the two-sided ""true"" gap. Moreover, the random walk and autoregression models have, on average, the best performance for credit and GDP series. Thus, simulations of CCyB values are based on these results and show a promising potential for use in practice. The paper is structured as follows. In the second section, we provide a review of the related literature and show how it relates to our research. A description of the credit gap estimation and the OOS augmentations is given in the third section. An empirical analysis of the gap estimates from the previous section is provided in the fourth section. The final section concludes the paper.",1
