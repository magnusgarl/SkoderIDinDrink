32,2,Review of Regional Research,31 January 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-012-0064-3,Identifying spatial nonstationarity in German regional firm start-up data,September 2012,Sven Müller,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The past decades have shown a growing literature both on identifying the determinants of new business start-ups on a regional basis (see Fritsch 1992; Audretsch and Fritsch 1994; Audretsch and Jin 1994; Audretsch and Fritsch 1999 and Audretsch and Dohse 2007 for example) and on identifying spatial nonstationarity in economic structures and processes (see Mittal et al. 2004; Patridge and Rickman 2007; Meurs and Edon 2007; Bitter et al. 2007 and Yu 2006 for example). Spatial nonstationarity appears if the impact of an exogenous variable on the endogenous variable depends on the location. However, it is astounding that there is a lack of literature combining these two strands of research (Breitenecker and Harms 2010). In order to close this gap we have to discuss two questions: First, do start-up rates vary spatially and what is the underlying relationship? And second, is there spatial nonstationarity in this relationship? Krugman (1991) states that the most striking feature of the geography of economic activity is the concentration of production in space. He focuses on convexities in production arising from spillovers from a pooled labor market; pecuniary externalities enabling the provision of nontraded inputs specific to an industry in a greater variety and at a lower cost; and information or technological spillovers. Here, we link characteristics reflecting these three sources of convexities at a spatial level in Germany to one aspect of the process of the concentration of economic activity: the rate at which new firms are being established (Audretsch and Fritsch 1994). We assume that it is actually the interaction of increasing returns and uncertainty that bestows advantages to the pooling of labor markets associated with agglomerations. Moreover, we expect that agglomerations are also conducive to a greater provision of non-traded inputs. Such inputs (public transport for example) are provided at both a greater variety and a lower cost. Finally, we presume that technological spillovers are more beneficial to new small businesses than to incumbent large enterprises. These spillovers are expected to be more likely in agglomerations. According to this, we assume a higher rate of start-ups in agglomerated regions. In a given study area we will find agglomerated regions and other regions (rural areas for example). Therefore we assume that the start-up rate varies spatially. Let us say we find a formal link between the rate of start-ups and characteristics reflecting the three sources of convexities mentioned in Sect. 1.1. Then, would it be likely that this relationship is constant over the whole study area? The answer might be “no” since there are reasons why this formal link could be different in different regions. Generally, we could argue that agglomeration affects the establishment of new firms differently in distinct regions. To be precise: Let us consider two regions A and B with nearly the same characteristics reflecting agglomerations. The situation may occur that the effect of the unemployment rate is positive in region A and negative in region B. The negative effect in region B could be due to the fact that most of the businesses are sensitive to slack growth which in turn is indicated by high regional unemployment rates. In contrast the positive effect in region A might occur because firms located here are less sensitive to slack growth but more sensitive to potential labor resources. These resources are higher as unemployment rises. Please note that this effect does not have to be necessarily within the fashion of positive-negative. A spatial variation between less negative (positive) and more negative (positive) is imaginable as well. In general, there exist several explanations why relationships may vary over space and thus generate spatial nonstationarity. For more details on this issue see Fotheringham (1997). Concerning the case of firm birth rates the literature on spatial nonstationarity is scarce. However, there are some studies that shed some light on this issue. Scorsone et al. (2006) raise suspicion that one has to explicitly account for spatial nonstationarity in firm start-up data. They have witnessed spatial heterogeneity for firm start-up data in Kentucky, USA. In order to identify model coefficients that vary across regions they employ a global regression model that is similar to Seemingly Unrelated Regression. Calay et al. (2007) have pointed out that institutional factors like economic policies and social climate may lead to spatial heterogeneity. However, they do not explicitly account for spatial nonstationarity in their principal component analysis. More evidence for the existence of spatial nonstationarity in firm birth-rates give Cattani et al. (2003). Using conditional fixed-effects negative binomial regression models they explored organizational foundings as a function of spatial density, showing that local, more than national, density-dependence processes help explain industry evolution. Based on their results they conclude that local entrepreneurial deeds have repercussions beyond the boundaries of the geographical area in which a given start-up enterprise is residing. However, the overall spectrum of firm start-ups cannot be fully captured simply by looking at the region of the start-up rate itself but to consider neighboring areas as well. Most recently, Breitenecker and Schwarz (2011) are the first who report spatial nonstationarity in predictors of firm start-up activity of Austria using geographically weighted regression. However, they do not provide a theoretical underpinning of their findings. Now, if we accept that there might be spatial nonstationarity in firm start-up data, then we have to figure out how to measure this phenomenon. Methods for measuring spatial nonstationarity have been severally proposed in the literature. These methods include the expansion method (Casetti 1972), the method of adaptive filtering (Foster and Gorr 1986), the random coefficients model (Aitken 1996), the multilevel modeling (Goldstein 1987), the moving window approach and geographically weighted regression analysis (Fotheringham et al. 1997). However, geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a relatively simple, but effective technique for exploring spatial nonstationarity. Moreover, it is an important part of the trend towards local analysis and by this it is a truly spatial technique. Roughly speaking, it allows different relationships to exist at different points in space. This in turn is not provided in such an elaborated way by the methods mentioned before. The capabilities of modern software systems like geographic information systems ease the presentation of the results and their further processing and interpretation (Fotheringham 1997). There are well known shortcomings of the GWR as stated by Wheeler and Paez (2010) for example. One point of critique is that it is in essence an ensemble of local geographical regressions where the dependence between regression coefficients at different data locations is not specified in the model. A second issue is related to the repeated use of data to estimate model parameters at different model calibration locations, which causes a multiple comparisons situation. With an increasing number of local models estimated, the probability that some individual tests will appear significant, even if only by chance, will also increase. The problem in this case is related to the trade-off between the amount of information and confidence, since the usual confidence intervals for regression coefficients are no longer reliable. Another issue with GWR that is directly related to the selection of the kernel bandwidth involves high levels of spatial variation and smoothness of estimated regression coefficients. A natural concern emerges that some variation or smoothness in the pattern of estimated coefficients may be artificially introduced by the technique and may not represent true regression effects. However, we like to use GWR in order to analyze whether there is spatial nonstationarity in German start-up data, because GWR is an accepted method for this issue. In the next section a discussion of the geographically weighted regression can be found. Section 3 comprehends the description of the data and some issues related to measurement and operationalization. In Sect. 4 we discuss the results of our analysis followed by a short conclusion (Sect. 5).",4
32,2,Review of Regional Research,23 May 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-012-0067-0,Bivariate K functions as instruments to analyze inter-industrial concentration processes,September 2012,Hans-Friedrich Eckey,Reinhold Kosfeld,Alexander Werner,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Study of the concentration of economic activities in space and time has a long tradition and even today has lost none of its relevance. The literature on concentration measurement begins with Marshall (1920). For the explanation of spatial agglomeration of economic activities it is well known that a distinction is made between the advantages of industrial mass production (internal) and the advantages of location and urbanization (external). Location advantages, also known as MAR spillovers, describe the external savings that result from the spatial concentration of several companies in the same sector. The reasons for this lie in the common use of specific regional labor supply and information markets. If the MAR spillovers prevail, the positive effects lead to a strong concentration within an economic sector. Compared with them the negative effects of spatial agglomeration are a sort of reciprocal competition and lead to deconcentration of an economic sector. The savings made from the spatial concentration of companies from different industries is known as urbanization advantages (Jacobs spillovers). Proximity to pre-suppliers and customers, banks, insurance companies and other production-oriented services as well as training (primary and further) and research institutes also have an improving effect on the location. If the positive effects between two economic sectors prevail, this leads to co-agglomeration. If, however, spatial proximity between two economic sectors has rather negative effects, it results in repulsion. The main focus of the following remarks is, particularly with reference to Jacobs spillovers, the determination of co-agglomeration and repulsion effects between individual sectors of industry. The bivariate K functions are used to present a procedure that, in the opinion of the writers, is superior to the statistical methods so far used in concentration research and usefully supplements them. Traditional procedures mostly use correlation coefficients to investigate spatial dependencies, and more recently these have been supplemented by the investigation of the spatial spillover effects (Anselin 1993). These algorithms are based on the characteristics of the regions, i.e. they are spatially related. Characteristics in bivariate K functions, however, are marked by their coordinates; this form of analysis is thus not spatially but punctually related. Let us consider two variables that may be distributed spatially as in Fig. 1.  Basic possibilities of the positioning of observation units in the area. (x) spatial distribution of observations of variable 1; (o) spatial distribution of observations of variable 2 With the help of bivariate K functions it is possible to distinguish the cases of spatial attraction, repulsion and random distribution and establish the extent of the relevant spatial context. They can be traced back to Ripley (1977, 1981) who discussed univariate K functions which are first used in biology and geography, e.g. in the spatial distribution of plants and trees. The basic theory of K-functions is outlined by Cressie (1993) and a standard textbook dealing with spatial point patterns analysis is Diggle (2003). Geographical concentration of industrial companies has been investigated with the aid of spatial point processes by various authors. K functions first entered the subject with Barff (1987), who analyzed the industrial concentration in the Cincinnati urban region. Sweeny and Feser (1998) draw on D-functions developed by Diggle and Chetwynd (1991) to analyze the connection between plant size and clustering. Feser and Sweeny (2000) provide a test for the coincident of economic and spatial clustering of firms. Later, Sweeny and Feser (2004) compare different methodologies to analyze spatial concentration. There are a few more studies, such as those of Arbia and Espa (1996), Marcon and Puech (2003), Quah and Simpson (2003), Duranton and Overman (2005) and Kosfeld et al. (2011), which refer to regional concentration of economic sectors. The location of patents in different economic sectors of Italy has been analyzed by Arbia et al. (2008). The next section contains a short review of the theory of regional clustering of industries. A description of the procedure of the bivariate K functions and the explanation of the advantages associated with them compared with the use of traditional methods is followed by the application of them to the spatial distribution of companies in the industrial sector in Germany. The results then form the basis of subsequent cluster analyses that is meant to show spatial concentration and regional clustering of economic sectors.",1

From it, as argued by Castells (1983), any spatial phenomenon (from the processes of economic development to relations among classes or ethnic groups, from public action to capital accumulation) takes its greatest strength. Moreover, just in the “urban arena”, to borrow from Kirby (1995), the more polarized spatial transformations are concentrated, and, for this reason, the city increases its importance because its success becomes the success of the territory around it. The transformations of the international economic sphere after the collapse of the Iron Curtain have caused substantial changes in the relations between institutional actors. The focus has shifted from the leading role of national states to new actors which are characterized by concerted actions and partnerships; the latter having assumed an important role in various economic processes (Sassen 1997; Jacobs 2003). The expansion of free trade and the support of new communication technologies have accelerated the trend towards greater deregulation and have thus led to a new geo-economic order where the centrality of the States is strongly contested (Hill and Fujita 2003). This new geography—and the resulting new form of the global economy—has created a global network based primarily (but not exclusively) on economic exchanges and focused on global cities (Friedmann 1998; Castells 1997; Sassen 1997), places with the highest concentration of specific urban poles, such as the ability to manage and control the production processes. This repositioning was also helped by the desire of the States to increase the competitiveness of their cities (Brenner 1999). Obviously, all cities are not equal, due mainly to both physical size and functional dimension. Moreover, every innovation adds to and alters the previously established relationships within a system, thus redefining a moment in their history. This paper will attempt to analyze the impact of the expansion of High-Speed networks on the hierarchy of European cities. It is organized as follows: In Sect. 1 a review is conducted on a series of studies carried out on the established hierarchy of several European cities; Sect. 2 analyzes the role of communication infrastructures in the building of urban hierarchies; Sect. 3 demonstrates the impact of the European High-Speed network on the fluctuations in the hierarchy of individual cities. Finally, Sect. 4 provides topic discussion and a future research agenda.",3

It is also becoming increasingly popular in environmental and ecological economics (Los 2011). Naturally, some ecological economists are also interested in conducting environmental impact studies for individual regions. Therefore, it is likely that regional input-output models will frequently be used for environmental impact studies in the future. When studying a particular region, analysts often have to construct a regional input-output table (RIOT), since many statistical offices provide only national input-output tables (NIOTs). Fortunately, there are established methods for regionalising a NIOT and adapting it to regional characteristics (nonsurvey methods). Numerous methods have been suggested; the most recent ones are the FLQ (Flegg and Webber 1997, 2000; Flegg et al. 1995) and CHARM (Kronenberg 2009). A large and growing literature discusses the strengths and weaknesses of these methods (Bonfiglio and Chelli 2008; Morrison and Smith 1974; Richardson 1985; Schaffer and Chu 1969; Tohmo 2004).Footnote 1 However, the focus of the present paper is a different one. This paper aims at drawing attention to a crucial issue whose importance has not yet been fully realised in the literature on nonsurvey regionalisation methods: there are different variants of the symmetric input-output table (SIOT), and the choice of nonsurvey method should depend on the type of SIOT that is to be regionalised. The most important difference between the SIOT variants lies in the treatment of imported products. The United Nations handbook on input-output analysis identified four different variants, labelled alphabetically from “A” to “D” (United Nations 1973). This convention is also adopted in the present paper, and an additional variant “E” (for “Eurostat”) is introduced to describe the tables based on the European System of Accounts (ESA 95). A crucial finding of this paper is that location quotient (LQ) methods are suitable for variant B tables, whereas commodity balance (CB) methods are suitable for variant A and E tables. The existing literature has not paid much attention to this issue because regional economists mostly use variant B tables. Ecological economists, by contrast, are more likely to use variant A or E tables. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces definitions of variables and conventions on mathematical notation. Section 3 explains the different variants of the SIOT, largely following the exposition in the UN manual (United Nations 1973). Section 4 describes the interpretation of the coefficients derived from different tables. Section 5 identifies the implications that follow for those who want to construct a RIOT using nonsurvey methods. Finally, Sect. 6 provides some concluding remarks and suggests avenues for future research.",19

Bohl,Winfried Michels,Jens Oelgemöller,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Die Wohnimmobilie ist ein heterogenes Gut, das eine Fülle von Eigenschaften mit unterschiedlichen Ausprägungen besitzt. Nutzer und Käufer von Wohnimmobilien fragen folglich ein ganzes Güterbündel nach. Dementsprechend setzt sich der Wert einer Wohnimmobilie aus dem Nutzen der einzelnen Eigenschaften zusammen. Es ist deshalb naheliegend, für die Wertermittlung von Wohnimmobilien und die Konstruktion von Immobilienpreisindizes ein Verfahren anzuwenden, das diese Besonderheit berücksichtigt. Die Methode der hedonischen Preise ist ein solches Verfahren. Es ist in der Lage, die preisbestimmenden Merkmale des heterogenen Gutes Wohnimmobilie zu identifizieren und deren Beitrag zum Gesamtpreis zu quantifizieren.Footnote 1
 Hedonische Berechnungen von Immobilienpreisindizes besitzen eine lange Tradition. In den USA wurden bereits in den sechziger Jahren Hauspreisindizes mit hedonischen Verfahren ermittelt (Bailey et al. 1963). 1968 begann das Bureau of the Census als erste statistische Behörde der USA, hedonische Methoden zur Schätzung der Preisentwicklung von Einfamilienhäusern einzusetzen. In jüngster Zeit werden auch in Europa und speziell in Deutschland verstärkt hedonische Verfahren zur Preisindexerstellung bei Immobilien verwendet.Footnote 2 So hat beispielsweise das Statistische Bundesamt – initiiert vom Statistischen Amt der Europäischen Gemeinschaften (Eurostat) – ein Pilotprojekt gestartet, das einen hedonischen Hauspreisindex für Deutschland ermittelt (Dechent 2004, 2008). Ein weiterer hedonischer Immobilienpreisindex wird von Dübel und Iden (2008) für das Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung erstellt. Ferner werden hedonische Verfahren auch zur Immobilienpreisermittlung bzw. Immobilienpreiskalkulation herangezogen.Footnote 3
 Der Ausgangspunkt des hedonischen Modells beruht auf der Feststellung, dass ein Gut aus einem Bündel von Eigenschaften besteht. Der Preis dieses Gutes ist folglich eine Funktion seiner einzelnen Charakteristika. Ziel des hedonischen Verfahrens ist es, das Bündel an Gütereigenschaften aufzuspüren und jeder Eigenschaft einen hedonischen Preis zuzuordnen. Dies wird möglich durch die Betrachtung und Analyse der verschiedenen Ausprägungen des Gutes. Die Schätzung eines Regressionsmodells liefert Parameter, die die Bedeutung und die Wirkungsrichtung der Eigenschaften des Gutes auf seinen Preis quantifizieren. Damit besitzen hedonische Verfahren zur Charakterisierung von Immobilienpreisen den Vorteil, dass auf der Basis von tatsächlichen Transaktionen der Preis von Immobilien durch die Eigenschaften der Immobilien beschreibbar ist und eine Qualitätsbereinigung vorgenommen werden kann. Im Hinblick auf die Analyse von Wohnimmobilien erfordert das Verfahren zunächst die Identifikation aller potentiell preisbestimmenden Merkmale wie beispielsweise Größe, Alter, Ausstattung, Haustyp und Lage, bevor mit regressionsanalytischen Verfahren der Zusammenhang zwischen der Qualität dieser Merkmale und dem Immobilienpreis geschätzt wird. Der Preis der Wohnimmobilie ist dann die Summe der Zahlungsbereitschaften für alle erfassten Eigenschaften. Grundsätzlich sind bei der Analyse von Immobilienpreisen mithilfe der hedonischen Methode zwei Anwendungsgebiete zu unterscheiden: Zum einen werden Immobilienpreisindizes konstruiert, die Qualitätsänderungen und deren Einfluss auf den Preis im Zeitverlauf berücksichtigen und damit reine Preisänderungen widerspiegeln (Brachinger 2002). Zum anderen werden durch eine Quantifizierung der preisbestimmenden Eigenschaften Immobilienbewertungen möglich. Beide Anwendungsgebiete fußen auf der Bestimmung der Preisdeterminanten. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es, ein Modell zur Bestimmung der Preisdeterminanten von Wohnimmobilien (Einfamilienhäuser, Doppelhaushälften, Reihenendhäuser, Reihenhäuser und Eigentumswohnungen) für die Stadt Münster zu entwickeln, das auf tatsächlich beobachteten Transaktionspreisen basiert. Als Datensatz stehen uns Daten der Kaufpreissammlung des Gutachterausschusses der Stadt Münster und damit eine neue, bisher nicht erschlossene Datenquelle von hoher Qualität zur Verfügung. Mit einem Regressionsmodell werden für die Ausprägungen der Wohnimmobilieneigenschaften hedonische Preise geschätzt, aus denen die Höhe ihres Beitrags zum Gesamtimmobilienpreis ersichtlich wird. Damit ist gleichzeitig der Übergang für eine Bewertung von Immobilien geschaffen. Die Preise für Wohnimmobilien lassen sich nun nicht nur aus ihren Eigenschaften erklären, sondern mit vorgegebenen Immobilieneigenschaften können auch die Immobilienpreise bzw. Immobilienwerte erzeugt werden.Footnote 4 Der Vorteil des hier angewandten hedonischen Verfahrens besteht darin, dass auch die Werte von fiktiven Wohnimmobilien in unterschiedlichen Lagen und mit unterschiedlichen Eigenschaften bestimmbar sind.",3

In Sweden, prices for agricultural land have been steadily increasing during the last decade and explanations are likely to be related to both agricultural and urbanising factors. Since the accession to the EU and the European common agricultural policy, specific attention has been paid to institutional factors that influence the structure and profitability of the agricultural sector. Especially after the common agricultural policy reform in 2003, and subsequent decoupling of agricultural support payments. However, explanations are also found in factors that are often focal points in studies of urban growth such as regional variations in accessibility to urban and rural amenities (Oltmer and Florax 2001). During the last decades, countries throughout Europe have witnessed a growth in non-agricultural markets in the rural part of the economy, e.g. markets related to tourism, culinary experiences, horse breeding, fishing and hunting activities (Busby and Rendle 2000; Sharpley and Vass 2006). Recent figures show that, in Sweden, rural tourism in combination with farming turns over about 1 billion SEK each year. The growing tourist industry in rural areas suggest that the agricultural landscape is an important prerequisite for nature-based tourism and that owners of agricultural land are faced with a growing set of opportunities for its alternative use. However, not all rural areas are equally attractive. As noted by Walford (2001) and Gannon (1994) location is an important prerequisite for the potential of diversification and non-agricultural use of land. Overall, this suggests that besides traditional agricultural land price determinants that relate to land fertility and income support to farmers, non-agricultural factors such as accessibility to customers, services, employment opportunities and rural amenities are likely to be important determinants of the price of agricultural land. A large number of papers have empirically explored the importance of various factors determining land prices such as net returns from agriculture (Melichar 1979; Alston 1986; Gardner 1987), payments to support farmers’ incomes (Shaik et al. 2005), urbanising influences and site characteristics (Xu et al. 1993; Cavailhès and Wavresky 2003; Bell and Irwin 2002; Irwin and Bockstael 2004; Wu 2001). However, comparatively few papers have combined these approaches and examined agricultural land prices as a function of both agricultural and non-agricultural factors including the effects of decoupled income support to farmers. Moreover, while most of the studies that estimate capitalisation of farm support programs conclude that income support do affect agricultural land prices, there is still no consensus on the extent to which capitalisation occur, neither is there sufficient knowledge concerning the regional distributional effects of rural policy. For the purpose of analysing regional variations in agricultural land price determinants, we estimate an asset-pricing model in which the price of agricultural land is a function of the expected returns from its current agricultural use and its potential future use (Capozza and Helsley 1989; Plantinga et al. 2002). In our application of this model, expected returns from the agricultural use of land is explained by regional variations in land fertility, average size of farms, availability of land and income support to farmers. Spatial characteristics that influence the potential use of agricultural land are related to access to urban and rural amenities. Considering that the potential to find an alternative use for agricultural land is likely to increase with the density of economic activities, we use a measure of population accessibility, designed to reflect the influence of urbanity on agricultural land prices.Footnote 1
 Returns from agricultural land are strongly related to locational factors, such as regional variations in the quality and structure of the local agricultural sector, agricultural support payments and the density and structure of other activities in the local economy. Therefore, price determinants are expected to vary significantly across space. In order to identify the underlying factors explaining agricultural land prices we estimate a cross-regional regression model on municipality data. While long time-series data would be preferable for analysing how price determinants evolve over time, cross-section regional data is interesting for assessing the impacts of regional heterogeneity and explore segments in the agricultural land market. The estimations are conducted using quantile regressions which enable us to examine the influence of price determinants across the distribution of the dependent variable. This is a desirable feature since the natural conditions for agriculture vary significantly across Sweden and the price of agricultural land is highly skewed across municipalities. Our results show that when we estimate our land price equation conditional on the median; expected returns from both the agricultural and potential non-agricultural use of land are influential determinants of agricultural land prices. However, when we estimate the equation conditional on different quantiles across the dependent variable, the results indicate differences between municipalities with high and low agricultural land prices, respectively. In line with other recent work, the paper find evidence that urban influences are the primary factor inflating land prices at the urban fringe. Results also indicate that the influence of population accessibility and rural amenities are larger in municipalities that have high agricultural land prices. The analytical approach to geographical distances used in most previous studies is relevant only for land located at the urban fringe. This study contributes to previous research in this area by providing empirical estimates based on a spatial index showing the spatial relation of each location to all urban centra across the country. The paper is organised in the following way. Section 2 summarises some of the most relevant literature and present the theoretical framework of the paper. Section 3 describes the data used in the empirical analysis followed by a description of empirical methodology and estimation procedure. The analysis is presented in Sects. 4 and 5 concludes the paper.",22

Therefore, not only national economies, but also smaller regional units find themselves in an intensive competition to provide attractive location conditions for companies and their employees. Firms’ decisions about location and investment as well as their decisions to establish additional workplaces or to diminish employment are influenced by a lot of potential regional conditions. Already traditional economic location theories (see e.g., Launhardt 1882; Weber 1929; and Hotelling 1929) have stressed the special importance of the regional surroundings for firm strategies and performance. Moreover, the importance of regional conditions for the settlement and development of firms has been confirmed in empirical studies for a wide range of countries and time periods.Footnote 1
 The aim of this paper is twofold: At first, based on firm-level panel data of manufacturing establishments in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, which are aggregated to regional panel data for forty-four counties, the impact of regional conditions on county-level manufacturing employment growth is empirically analysed. There is a special focus on the relative role of various regional location factors for regional manufacturing employment growth. Second, while the vast majority of existing studies only evaluates the determinants of regional net employment growth, this paper adds to the literature and takes a closer look behind the scenes of aggregate employment change. This is done by investigating employment changes at the establishment-level and thereby allowing for the decomposition of regional net employment change into the gross components of regional job creation and regional job destruction. Thereby, the question is analysed whether the impact of different regional location factors on employment growth is caused by either affecting gross job creation and/or gross job destruction.",5

Fraglich dabei ist aber das Ausmaß dieser Steigerung. Konkret wird der jährliche Zuwachs der Entlohnung von Individuen mit einem höheren Bildungsjahr im Vergleich zu den anderen Individuen untersucht. Diese sogenannte Bildungsrendite definiert Weber (2003), S. 406, als „inwieweit der zu erwartende Nutzen einer Bildungsinvestition die Kosten zu kompensieren vermag.“ Um aber den reinen Bildungseffekt zu identifizieren, müssen Unterschiedlichkeiten berücksichtigt werden. Dabei gilt es zum Einen die Verschiedenartigkeit der Individuen an sich zu betrachten, zum Anderen können aber ebenso unterschiedliche regionale Aspekte beeinflussend wirken. Die Heterogenität von Bildungsrenditen wird im internationalen Vergleich in einer Studie von Mendolicchio und Rhein (2012) herausgearbeitet. Sie berechnen unterschiedliche Höhen der jährlichen Verzinsung von Humankapital für westeuropäische Staaten. Diese aktuelle Studie und der Blick auf diverse regionale Disparitäten wirft für den innerdeutschen Vergleich die Frage der Konstanz in den regionalen Bildungsrenditen auf. In Deutschland ist aufgrund der historischen und geographischen Gegebenheiten keine Homogenität in den Bildungsrenditen zu erwarten. Reilich (2012) zeigt, dass insbesondere im Ost-West-Vergleich die möglichen Bildungsrenditen unterschiedlich hoch sind. In weiteren Studien wird über generelle regionale Disparitäten in Deutschland diskutiert. So werden von Berthold und Müller (2010) die Angleichungsprozesse über die Jahre in Bezug auf die Lebensverhältnisse in den Regionen Deutschlands thematisiert. Auch Tarazona (2010) betrachtet die interregionalen Unterschiede und zeigt in diesem Zusammenhang verschiedene Beschäftigungsentwicklungen auf. Demzufolge ist nicht nur die monetäre Entlohnung regional verschieden, auch weitere makroökonomische Größen zeigen Heterogenitäten. Fraglich ist, ob es dazwischen signifikante Zusammenhänge gibt.

The main policy instrument of the EU to do so is their regional policy, which is mainly implemented by the so-called structural funds. These include the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Cohesion Fund (ECF).Footnote 2 All three of them transfer financial means payed by richer regions belonging to the European single market to regions lagging behind in their economic development in order to actively improve the living and working conditions of EU citizens. Therewith, the EU takes another way than the United States (US) where regional policy plays a rather subordinate role (Pierdzioch 2007, p. 1). However, in the US the economic gap between the 50 federal states is not as large as in the 27 member states of the EU. While in the US only three federal states including only 2.5 % of the US total population, namely Arkansas, West Virginia and Mississippi, are lagging behind the other federal states, in the EU approximately 34 % of the total population lives in regions with less than 75 % of the average GDP per-capita making them eligible for structural funding under the convergence objective.Footnote 3 Thus, executing a regional policy to assure a harmonic economic developmentFootnote 4 in the US would be virtually redundant. From an economic point of view, it is noticeable, that given the inequality in the economic geography in the two markets, internal migration rates are significantly different. US citizens are much more internally mobile (5.9 % of the people changed their residence in 1999) than citizens in the EU (only 0.1 % of the people changed their residence in 2000) (Heinz and Ward-Warmedinger 2006, p. 7f.; Martin 2003, p. 1f.). Hence, the question comes up if the lower degree of economic cohesion in the EU has something to do with the lower mobility of EU citizens and a higher degree of structural intervention of the EU regional policy?Footnote 5 This question can be splitted into two subquestions that should be dealt with in this paper. First, is migration or regional policy more suitable to achieve a harmonic economic development in the internal market of the EU? Second, how are migration and the structural funds related with each other? To answer these two questions, in the first part of the paper I shortly analyse the theoretical implications concerning migration and regional policy against the background of a cohesive economic development within the common market of the EU. To get a deeper understanding of the current situation concerning regional policy and (internal) migration in the EU, I discuss these two issues in the second part of the paper. Before the conclusion is presented, I analyse in the third part why internal European migration is quiet low and how internal migration and the structural funds payments are interrelated. I will find that the structural operations hamper internal migration in the EU and thus, by inhibiting market forces, work counterproductive to their own goals of harmonising and improving the living and working conditions of EU citizens. I argue that the strategy followed by the European regional policy is inconsistent if the structural funds are inhibiting internal migration, which is one of the key measures in achieving economic convergence among the nations in the single European market and an important adjustment mechanism within the European Monetary Union (EMU).",4

33,2,Review of Regional Research,08 August 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-013-0076-7,Marshall or Jacobs? New insights from an interaction model,October 2013,Jan Kluge,Robert Lehmann,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Knowledge is one of the major driving forces of economic growth (see, e.g., Romer 1986). The social interaction of workers leads to the free circulation of knowledge and makes this knowledge available to other firms. This process has a clear impact on regional growth. Krugman (2011) even suggests placing more emphasis on such intangible factors when seeking explanations for the spatial distribution of economic activity. Knowledge spillovers have been examined in a large number of studies. The literature explores where knowledge spillovers occur (within or between industries) and what the consequences of such spillovers are (specialization or diversification of industries). In particular, there are two major opposing concepts that describe how spillovers are responsible for the creation or diffusion of knowledge and thus foster economic growth: localization and urbanization economies.Footnote 1 Both concepts emphasize knowledge (besides other advantages that come with spatial proximity) as an important growth driver. Marshall (1890) argues that companies surrounded by other companies in the same industry will grow faster, making the assumption that knowledge circulates primarily within industries. According to this viewpoint, companies benefit from being located closely to each other because they gain from localization economies. Arrow (1962) and Romer (1986) provide a formalized theory, leading Glaeser et al. (1992) to refer to localization economies as MAR externalities. The empirical literature finds mixed results for localization economies (see, e.g., Henderson et al. (1995); Combes (2000); de Lucio et al. (2002); Dekle (2002); Blien and Suedekum (2005) or Dauth (2013) for different countries). An opposing opinion was advanced by Jacobs (1970), who rejects the notion that knowledge flows within industries. According to her, companies gain from a diverse environment consisting of different types of industries. New ideas come not from within but from outside a firm’s sector. The mechanisms by which diversity leads to economic growth are usually called urbanization economies. Empirical evidence for this type of externality is provided by Glaeser et al. (1992), Lee et al. (2005), Blien et al. (2006), Fuchs (2011) or Illy et al. (2011). In spite of the rich body of literature, one must clearly state that there is no consensus about the effects of knowledge spillovers and in particular about the correctness of any of the two above mentioned concepts (Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009). This paper is aiming at finding reasons for this ambiguity and introducing new insights into the Marshall (1890) vs. Jacobs (1970) debate. Most of the above-mentioned and prominent studies do not take into account two relevant issues, which we directly address in our paper. First, these studies assume that localization and urbanization economies work independently of one another. Many studies find effects for both economies, but interaction effects are neglected.Footnote 2 Second, most of the literature does not consider non-linear effects of localization and urbanization economies. A few studies show U- or inverse U-relationships for these two externalities (see de Lucio et al. 2002; Illy et al. 2011). Additionally, Martin et al. (2011) argues that, e.g., congestion effects might foil the positive impacts of localization or urbanization economies. This leads to a threshold interpretation of agglomeration economies, where the effects of those two externalities may harm regional productivity.Footnote 3
 In our paper, we add to the existing literature by making the argument that localization and urbanization economies occur simultaneously and interact with each other. For example, a company can benefit from a more specialized environment (e.g., customers, suppliers, competitors) if enough service providers from other sectors (e.g., universities and research facilities) are available. Fahrhauer and Kröll (2012) argue that firms simply profit from a common pool of knowledge, which is why new ideas can come from both within and outside the specific sector and are combined with each other, e.g., via cross-fertilization. This leads to an improvement of own ideas. Therefore, localization and urbanization economies can be even more pronounced when they interact with each other.Footnote 4 Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge there is not much evidence, neither theoretical nor empirical, how interactions between local actors (e.g., firms, persons or institutions) work and what the mechanisms behind such interactions are. Additionally, a rethinking on economic geography is observable in the academic literature (see, e.g., Bathelt and Glückler 2003). We therefore state that it is not possible for us to theoretically predict how interactions between localization and urbanization economies behave. Whereas the first argument implies a positive sign, an interaction could possibly have negative impacts. We therefore do not expect a specific sign of the interaction between localization and urbanization economies and leave this as an empirical matter. Furthermore, our contribution accounts for non-linearities of localization and urbanization economies. We argue that the two externalities only occur if a sufficient number of knowledge carriers has assembled. Cities with few firms in a certain industry might therefore benefit more from further specialization than a city without any at all. However, there may also be disadvantages of further specialization, e.g., due to extensive competition or congestion costs. With interaction models, we are able to analyze non-linear and interaction effects graphically and give a threshold interpretation. This goes beyond the usual way of analyzing or interpreting point estimates or average effects instead of varying the variables of interest within their range of observations. When we present our empirical model, we elaborate more on this point. Since existing studies, e.g., Blien et al. (2006), imply that the results of such analyses might differ between industries, we consider four different sectors at the 1-digit level using administrative German data. Another contribution of our paper is to study gross value added (GVA) per employee for different sectors. We find negative interactions between localization and urbanization economies in most sectors. Furthermore, the effects often have a U-shaped form, meaning that localization (urbanization) economies become stronger with higher levels of specialization (diversification). We find some evidence for localization economies in some sectors. Urbanization economies do not play a major role for economic development in our sample. Besides searching for evidence of realized effects, we are also able to describe hypothetical constellations under which localization and urbanization economies could effectively be observed. The paper is organized as follows. In section two, the estimation approach and data are described. Section three presents sector-specific regression results. The last section concludes.",5
33,2,Review of Regional Research,03 October 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-013-0078-5,The ADETON method,October 2013,Uwe Blien,Friedrich Graef,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Flow analyses are important to understand what is going on in the labour market. Therefore, the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) developed two mighty tools, the Educational Accounting System (Bildungsgesamtrechnung) and the Labour Market Accounting System (Arbeitskräftegesamtrechnung) to analyse stocks and flows on the labour market (Reinberg and Hummel 2006). To extend these tools and to cover regional labour markets the Multi-Accounting System (MAS—Mehrkontenmodell) was designed. Its purpose was to provide a comprehensive survey of the stocks (states) and flows of people in education and training, in employment, unemployment, and household activities. The flows between the stocks were represented by transition matrices. These data were used for theory-based analyses concerning the relationship between the labour market and adjacent statuses (Haas and Rothe 2007). It was intended to use the results for the design of regional labour market policy. In the present paper not the construction principles of the MAS are of the main interest but the method applied for estimating the transition matrices involved. For these purposes a special procedure called Adeton has been developed, which can be used for many purposes due to its flexibility, e.g. to estimate contingency tables or input-output and other flow matrices. This makes it in particular valuable for the purposes of regional analyses. In the case of input-output matrices, for example, often only national tables are available, whereas at the regional level incomplete pieces of information are given (see Roy and Hewings 2009). Then, it is possible to estimate a complete regional input-output table by using the Adeton procedure. This method could also be regarded as a general tool for downscaling data from an aggregate level to the desired granularity. In this paper the example used is the case of the Multi-Accounting System MAS, since this system focuses on regional flow data of the labour market, which are in general not completely available at the required level of disaggregation. This data have to be recovered from multiple sources providing heterogeneous, incomplete and contradictory information at different aggregation levels. Since transition matrices are not uniquely determined by information of this type the true matrix cannot be recovered but only estimated. 
Adeton is the implementation of a Bayesian inference model which uses a prior probability distribution on the set of possible transition matrices and the available information about the true matrix to compute the matrix with highest posterior probability as an estimate. Given a base matrix and row and column sums of the target matrix to be estimated, there are other and simpler estimation methods in supply as for example the well known Iterative Proportional Fitting Algorithm (IPF, used in log-linear models) or of the equivalent RAS method (used in input-output analysis). In fact the Adeton method is an extension of the IPF/RAS-method. Compared to the latter it has two essential advantages. The first one is that whereas with the IPF only equations could be used to prescribe a target matrix, in the case of Adeton also inequalities may be included. The second advantage of Adeton is, that the information about the matrix to be estimated can be of a “soft” character, which means that they are not required to be exactly met. The degree of accuracy to which the constraint is met can be controlled by a set of weights. Therefore it is possible to include information about sampling errors or about standard errors of multivariate models. In addition—if required—rather weak expert judgements could be included in the estimation process, all with the appropriate weights. Because of the great flexibility of the method it is possible to estimate matrices based on heterogeneous pieces of information of very different kind. For a flow matrix of the Multi-Accounting System it may e.g. be the case that parts of the matrix cells are known for a different year. In addition some of the row and the column sums of the target matrix might be known from official statistics. For them equality constraints could be specified that are required to be exactly met. In addition there might be information about flows in the target matrix coming from different survey samples. Because there is a sampling error there could be contradictions between different surveys’ results. In these cases soft constraints could be specified. Then there might be relatively vague expert judgements formulating the expectation that the aggregate of some flows is between so and so. Again this could be included into the estimation procedure as a soft constraint with a low weight. Finally there might be flows that are not admissible because they are ruled out by institutional provisions. This can be modeled by hard constraints. To summarize, the Adeton method can be applied to many problems, since it works under very general conditions. The method may be applied wherever information about the structure of the matrix to be estimated is given by a set of linear equations and/or inequalities with respect to the matrix entries. The result, i.e. the structure of the estimated table, is as close as possible to a reference matrix. Typical tasks within the range of applicability of Adeton are:  the disaggregation of data available only in a summarized form the estimation of tables from heterogeneous, incompatible and incomplete data the computation of transition matrices in Markov processes the construction of forecasts (e.g. when the joint distribution of some variables has to be estimated after computing univariate distributions in a first step, see Blien and Tassinopoulos 2001). The Adeton procedure is designed to calculate matrices in a way which makes optimal use of the given information and avoids biases. The result can be interpreted according to criteria from statistics and from formal information theory (Shannon and Weaver 1949; Kullback 1968; Judge and Mittelhammer 2011). The work on the method presented here is based on the previous development of the Entrop procedure used in the Educational Accounting System (Blien and Graef 1998; Reinberg and Hummel 2006). An explanation of the name Adeton is in place: It has been proposed by A. Tassinopoulos, a former member of the IAB. In ancient Greece the “Adyton” was the inner part of a temple hiding in general the statue of a god from the public. Adeton aims to find out the hidden structure of a table using peripheral information. In the following Sect. 2 of the paper we will show some of the basic principles of Adeton. In Sect. 3 we will present a formal description of the method. Section 4 shows some simple numerical examples. Section 5 gives an application example from MAS and Sect. 6 concludes.",

Brunauer,Stefan Lang,Wolfgang Feilmayr,Male,Male,Male,Male,"As increasingly more data become available for statistical modeling of house prices, the question arises how to exploit these data in an efficient way. In our case, we have house purchase prices from the Austrian land register as well as a detailed data set carefully collected for mortgage purposes at our disposal. The first data set contains more than 30000 observations, but only the time of sale and the plot size are available as building characteristics—a long data set. The second data set contains a large number of attributes, including size, age and equipment of the building. Yet, it only includes roughly 2000 observations, which is few for stable spatial predictions all over Austria—we call this a wide data set. The goal of this research is to benefit from the advantages of each of these data sets, while we want to circumvent their disadvantages. Specifically, we use the spatial prediction from the long data as an explanatory covariate in the model for the wide data. In hedonic regression models, structural variables (attributes of the house itself) and neighborhood variables (attributes describing the neighborhood and location) serve as explanatory covariates for modeling house prices. The foundations of hedonic price theory have been developed by Lancaster (1966), focusing on the demand side of the market, and Rosen (1974), focusing on the interaction of bid and offer functions. Reviews of hedonic price theory and applications in a real estate context are provided e.g. in Follain und Jimenez (1985), Sheppard (1999) and Malpezzi (2003). Recently, Herath und Maier (2010) classify real estate and housing studies that use the hedonic price method and find that only few studies take into account property attributes, while most empirical work deals with neighborhood characteristics. Hedonic price equations are usually estimated by multiple regression. However, as economic theory does not provide clear guidance concerning the functional form of the dependence of price on characteristics, hedonic price models should allow for nonlinearity in covariate effects, otherwise potentially yielding biased results. Furthermore, the spatial fixation of real estate demands dealing with spatial variation and correlation in house prices. Very popular in this context is the spatial regression family, which was popularized by Anselin (1988), see also Basu und Thibodeau (1998), LeSage (1999) or Anselin (2003). Yet, McMillen (2003) points out that spatial dependence is often caused by unmodeled spatial heterogeneity. There is a wide range of semiparametric and nonparametric spatial approaches for modeling spatial heterogeneity, e.g. Kriging (2007), geographically weighted least squares (Fotheringham et al. 2002) or approaches based on spatial penalization (Besag und Kooperberg 1995). A particularly broad and rich framework for semiparametric modeling accounting both for nonlinear covariate effects and spatial heterogeneity is provided by structured additive regression (STAR) models introduced in Fahrmeir et al. (2004) and Brezger und Lang (2006). In STAR-models, continuous covariates are modeled as P(enalized)-splines as introduced by Eilers und Marx (1996), see also Wood (2006). As residential properties belong to several levels of spatial (e.g. administrative) units, the hedonic pricing model can be considered as a multilevel or hierarchical regression problem (see e.g. Goldstein 2003; Gelman und Hill 2007). Therefore, we apply multilevel versions of STAR models recently developed in Lang et al. (2010) and first applied on real estate data in Brunauer et al. (2012). In multilevel STAR models the regression coefficients of nonlinear terms may themselves obey another regression model with structured additive predictor. Available neighborhood covariates can be incorporated on either of the spatial resolutions as nonlinear covariate effects using P-splines (we call this explained spatial heterogeneity), while also unmeasured or unexplained spatial heterogeneity is modeled using hierarchical random effects. A detailed description of the model will be given in Sects. 2 and 3. Using this methodology, the questions remains how to use the data available in a way to circumvent the problems associated with them: We want to estimate unbiased covariate effects from the wide data set, gaining precision in spatial prediction from the long data set. Thus, we proceed as follows:  In a first step, we set up a hierarchical STAR model for the long data set, including all available neighborhood characteristics that add to predictive quality. At this stage, we are aware that the effects of house characteristics may be biased due to ommitted variables, and there may also be a bias in the spatial effects, as the level of omitted characteristics may itself vary over space. We evaluate this model over census tracts in order to derive the spatial prediction or a spatial index—an average price level for each census tract. The spatial index is used in the second step as an explanatory covariate for the wide data set. However, the model structure allows for implicit correction of this spatial index: Deviations from that spatial index are modeled by unexplained spatial heterogeneity in a hierarchical way. Therefore, we obtain unbiased covariate effects for house attributes from the wide data set, while gaining stability in regions where we have only few observations from the long data. In order to gain insight into how this approach affects the results, we compare the estimated effects from this hybrid multilevel STAR model to a reference model that does not take the long data set into account. The remainder of this article is structured as follows: In the next Sect. 2 the working data set is described. Section 3 presents multilevel STAR models in the context of hedonic regression for house prices. Results are presented in Sect. 5, and the final section draws some conclusions.",2

Many studies point out that a significant proportion of university-based entrepreneurs tend to act across a substantial geographical distance when they intend to become involved in new firms.Footnote 1 Knowing who can be attracted and why seems to be extremely relevant for adopting new knowledge and thus, developing a knowledge based regional cluster.Footnote 2 In fact, new industries are characterized by a fast growing number of start-ups within a few years (see Klepper 1996) and regional clustering of new firms in these industries (e.g., Stuart and Sorenson 2003). Hence, the time period to attract mobile entrepreneurs from new industries is limited. This paper addresses the spatial distribution of mobile entrepreneurs and seeks to examine the role of regions’ knowledge base to attract these entrepreneurs. The empirical analysis is prepared for the example of Germany’s biotechnology industry. Germany is a leading country regarding the economic importance of the biotechnology industry. After the kick-off period of Germany’s biotechnology industry in 1990s, Germany has 496 dedicated biotechnology companies in 2006 which is synonymous with number one in Europe and number three of the world (OECD 2009, p. 17). Related to the biotechnology R&D expenditures Germany is number four of the world (OECD 2009, p. 25). Following earlier research to analyze migration pattern, we apply a gravity model and estimate a count data model on the level of 97 German planning regions (‘Raumordnungsregionen’). Recent studies focus mainly on the description of migration flows of high-skilled labor or inventors (e.g., Maier et al. 2007, 2010; Schiller and Diez 2010). We contribute to the literature by focusing on intra-country flows and its determinants for the specific group of entrepreneurs for the first time. By considering the factors explaining the number of immigrated entrepreneurs, we provide further insights into the general question of whether local externalities really work to attract these people. Our paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we briefly discuss the theoretical background to develop our testable hypothesis. The empirical methodology is presented in Sect. 3. Here we describe the econometric approach, inform about the approach to classify various groups of bio-entrepreneurs and discuss the set of explanatory variables. Section 4 contains the estimation results, and Sect. 5 discusses their implications. Section 6 concludes.",1

Evidence from coagglomeration patterns between new and incumbent firms in Germany,February 2014,Oliver Falck,Michael Fritsch,Stephan Heblich,Male,Male,Male,Male,"It is well-known at least since Alfred Marshall’s Principles of Economics (1920) that a number of industries tend to cluster in space. It is also a general wisdom that industry locations are very persistent over time. The latter implies that new firms cluster in the same locations as incumbents, they coagglomerate. Indeed, Duranton and Overman (2008) find for the UK that entrants are not located differently from the incumbents in about two thirds of the industries. By contrast, Dumais et al. (2002) document high spatial mobility of industries in the US. Such different results may have many reasons (Faggio et al. 2013). One of the possible explanations is diverging conditions of the economic and institutional environment. In this paper, we analyze coagglomeration patterns in German manufacturing industries. We perform this analysis for East and West Germany separately because the two parts of the country may be characterized by different economic and institutional conditions. These differences are likely caused by the shock transformation of the East German economy from a socialist regime to a market economic system that began in late 1989 (see Brezinski and Fritsch 1995, and Fritsch 2004 for details). We find remarkable differences between the two parts of Germany. While our analysis indicates coagglomeration of new and incumbent firms for about 40 percent of West German manufacturing industries, this figure drops to only 5 percent in East Germany. Considering that the spatial distribution of incumbent firms in East Germany is to some extent an outcome of former socialist planning, this finding holds an interesting implication. If socialist planners chose for political reasons locations that did not provide suitable location factors a low degree of coagglomeration can be the outcome of a revision of these choices that accounts more for economic factors. To analyze coagglomeration patterns within industries we apply point pattern statistics and analyze the distance of new firms to incumbent firms in the same industry. Precisely, we compare the actual distribution of distances between new and incumbent firms to a counterfactual distribution of distances where new firms’ location decisions are based merely on basic suitability of a location for an industry. We define basic suitability by the presence of at least one incumbent firm in a location. Thereby, suitability arises among others from exogenous natural advantages (Ellison and Glaeser 1997, 1999). In the counterfactual situations, new firms are equally distributed across counties with at least one incumbent firm in the respective industry (Klier and McMillen 2008). This paper suggests a way to identify industry coagglomeration patterns in Germany. Beyond that, we do not attempt to answer the question why coagglomeration occurs. Instead, we refer to the broad existing literature on the micro-foundations of firm agglomeration patterns (Duranton and Puga 2004) and contributions on firm coagglomeration patterns across industries like Ellison et al. (2010). Papers that consider Marshallian agglomeration forces separately include Fallick et al. (2006) on job hopping, Holmes (1999) on input sharing, Breschi and Lissoni (2001) on patents and knowledge and Klepper (2009) and Buenstorf and Klepper (2010) on spinoffs. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the empirical methodology and Sect. 3 describes the data. The results of the analysis are presented in Sect. 4; Sect. 5 concludes and explores possible explanations for the different coagglomeration patterns observed between East and West Germany.",1
34,1,Review of Regional Research,26 November 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-013-0079-4,Do eco-innovations need specific regional characteristics? An econometric analysis for Germany,February 2014,Jens Horbach,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Eco-Innovations lead to less environmental impacts or to a reduction of energy use and are therefore crucial for climate protection. They help to remedy negative external environmental effects of economic activities. In many cases, these negative external effects have to be internalized by regulation measures so that the corresponding eco-innovation activities are not realized because of market opportunities. On the other side, especially young and dynamic eco-innovation fields such as the development of renewable energies are also economically benign because these eco-innovations may lead to cost-savings. Recently, the determinants of eco-innovation activities have been widely explored (Demirel and Kesidou 2012; de Marchi 2012; Horbach 2008; Horbach et al. 2012). The analyses show that, compared to other, non-environmentally related innovations, regulations and cost-savings as motivations are more important for eco-innovations. At the latest since the seminal works of Krugman (1991) the relevance of spatial characteristics for innovation activities has been recognized. Innovation activities are not equally distributed in space because agglomeration effects caused by many firms of the same sector in a region, labor market pooling, other location factors and regional clusters (Blien and Maier 2008) play a crucial role. The empirical innovation literature strongly includes these effects (e.g. Broekel and Brenner 2011; Bellmann et al. 2013), but, mainly because of the lack of adequate data, analyses of regional and location characteristics as determinants of eco-innovations (see Cainelli et al. 2011 as an exception) are still very rare. The analysis of regional characteristics and location conditions may be especially important for young and emerging eco-innovation fields because they are more dependent on external information sources such as public research institutions and local cooperation networks. Furthermore, eco-innovations may be one (among other) chances for under-developed regions because new innovation fields are often shaped by young and small firms without “tradition” in a certain region. This paper tries to explore the specificities of eco-innovation concerning location and regional factors for Germany using the establishment panel of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in Nuremberg. Do eco-innovations need another regional background, factor endowment and location conditions compared to other innovations? The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 summarizes the existing literature on the role of location and regional factors for the innovation behavior of firms from a theoretical background summarized by Porter’s diamond model (Porter 2000) and shows some empirical, stylized facts from the literature. Hypotheses are developed to which extent eco-innovations need specific regional and location characteristics. Section 3 analyzes the role of regional characteristics for general and eco-innovations from an empirical perspective. Section 4 summarizes and concludes.",49
34,1,Review of Regional Research,24 December 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-013-0082-9,Knowledge-intensive employment change in the Dutch Randstad and the German Rhine-Ruhr area: comparable patterns of growth and decline in two metropolitan regions?,February 2014,Kristin Kronenberg,Kati Volgmann,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In current metropolitan regions, processes of inwards-orientated re-urbanization as well as outwards-orientated regionalization can be observed (Scott 2001; Brenner 2004). These spatial transformations are characterized by multi-centric structures and networks as well as a spatial division of labor (Knapp and Volgmann 2011; Anas et al. 1998; Kloosterman and Musterd 2001; Parr 2004). The development of metropolitan regions towards multi-core territories is no longer characterized by a steady outward expansion as it was the case for Fordist industrial cities. Instead, we find current city regions to develop specialized centers of employment, bringing about or reinforcing polycentric urban structures (Hesse 2010). Due to the fact that knowledge can be transmitted more easily between actors who are concentrated in space (e.g. Van Oort et al. 2009), the knowledge economy has been claimed to be inherently urban (e.g. Glaeser et al. 1992; Van Oort et al. 2009). In this context, it has been argued that the ‘development chances of urban regions today are determined in particular by their potential and capacities in the field of knowledge-intensive economic activities’ (Krätke 2007, p. 4). Knowledge-intensive activities have been argued to foster innovative activity, productivity and growth (e.g. Chadwick et al. 2008; Raspe and van Oort 2006; Van Oort et al. 2009), therefore having an impact on regional prosperity (Stein 2003) and competitiveness (Chadwick et al. 2008). Yet, it should be considered that neither metropolitan regions, nor the knowledge economy are homogeneous in nature. Instead, specific locations within a metropolitan region are likely to possess certain characteristics which will be especially conducive to particular subsectors of the knowledge economy (e.g. Kujath 2010; Kujath and Schmidt 2010). In this study, we therefore analyze spatial patterns of employment change in different sectors of the knowledge economy in two metropolitan regions. We zoom in on the Dutch Randstad and the German Rhine-Ruhr region, studying the employment dynamics which could be observed for the years 2000 until 2005. Both the Randstad and the Rhine-Ruhr area are multi-core or polycentric metropolitan areas. Among all metropolitan regions in Europe, these two are most comparable regarding their morphological and functional structures, yet at the same time exhibit differences regarding overall growth respectively decline. The focus of our investigation lies on the interplay of the features characterizing the position of a municipality within a metropolitan region, sectoral characteristics, the regional economic climate, and municipal knowledge-intensive employment change. This paper contributes to the existing body of literature in several ways. Firstly, it investigates the relationship between settlement structure and employment dynamics, focusing on the location of a municipality relative to the entire urban region it is situated in. While various studies have used settlement structure as an explanatory variable when investigating employment dynamics on a more aggregated level (e.g. Kowalewski 2011), to our knowledge, only Van der Laan et al. (2005) have yet addressed the relationship between settlement structure and employment growth on the detailed level of the municipality. Our analysis therefore benefits from the fact that the data at hand are available on the detailed municipal level. Furthermore, we specifically focus on the knowledge economy and its subsectors, thereby identifying areas which are conducive to growth in this increasingly important sector of the economy respectively its different subsectors. Thirdly, this study compares employment dynamics taking place in a growing (Randstad) and a declining (Rhine-Ruhr) urban region, hence investigating whether employment growth or decline in knowledge-intensive sectors follows a generalizable pattern, or is dependent upon the general economic conditions in the respective region. This leads us to the questions of  whether the features characterizing the location of a municipality within the metropolitan region have an impact on municipal employment change, whether the different subsectors of the knowledge economy are subject to sector-specific spatial patterns of employment dynamics, and whether these patterns are conditional upon the general economic conditions present in a particular region. The paper is structured as follows: In Sect. 2, we discuss the relevance of the knowledge economy in a spatial context, focusing on the significance of geographical proximity and transaction costs for different sectors, and derive the hypotheses which guide the empirical research. Section 3 introduces the regions of study and presents the data used in the empirical investigations. In Sect. 4, we investigate patterns of municipal employment change between the years 2000 and 2005 in the four subsectors of the knowledge economy, both in the Dutch Randstad and in the German Rhine-Ruhr area. In Sect. 5, a model of municipal employment change is specified, and the results of the empirical analysis are discussed. In Sect. 6, we indicate the limitations of this study, and Sect. 7 concludes.",1
34,1,Review of Regional Research,11 January 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-013-0083-8,Forecasting gross value-added at the regional level: are sectoral disaggregated predictions superior to direct ones?,February 2014,Robert Lehmann,Klaus Wohlrabe,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Fiscal policy at the sub-national level is one of the major fields in the decision-making of policy makers. For this purpose, reliable forecasts of economic aggregates (as gross domestic product or gross value-added) are necessary. At the regional level, e.g. states or counties, data limitations or a low publication frequency of national accounts make it difficult to predict macroeconomic aggregates and may cause higher forecast errors in comparison to countries’ aggregate, e.g., total German gross domestic product (GDP). Additionally, the forecast for Germany may not be a good approximation for the economic development of sub-national (e.g., states) aggregates. The reasons are a high heterogeneity in regional economic structures and different regional business cycles. Whenever a shock such as the economic crisis of 2009 hits the German economy, not all states have to develop in the same way. Therefore, separate regional forecasts are needed. Only few attempts have been made to forecast regional macroeconomic aggregates. Bandholz and Funke (2003) predict turning points for the German stateFootnote 1 Hamburg with a newly constructed leading indicator. The study by Dreger and Kholodilin (2007) employs a set of regional indicators to forecast the GDP of the German state Berlin. Kholodilin et al. (2008) predict the GDP of all German states simultaneously and account for spatial effects in a dynamic panel setup. Lehmann and Wohlrabe (2013) showed for three different regional units in Germany (the Free State of Saxony, Baden-Württemberg and Eastern GermanyFootnote 2) that forecast accuracy of GDP at the regional level can be improved with a huge data set of indicators in comparison to simple benchmark models. At the level of Canadian provinces, Kopoin et al. (2013) evaluate the forecasting information of national (Canadian) and international indicators. While these few prominent studies focus on the prediction of aggregated GDP directly, this paper mainly concentrates, from a regional point of view, on the question whether it is possible to forecast gross value-added (GVA) for different sectors (e.g., manufacturing, construction etc.). Regional policy makers or credit institutes (e.g., for granting of credits) are not only interested in the development of the economy as a whole but also in forecasts for different branches of the economy. From a practioners point of view it is necessary to know which branches or aggregates drive future economic development, so that predicting sub-components makes the state of the economy more tangible. Another important point for disaggregated forecasts is the consideration that several indicators (e.g., the EU business survey for manufacturing) might be linked to sub-components even stronger than to macroeconomic aggregates (e.g., GDP or total GVA). As mentioned above, missing quarterly sectoral GVA data at the regional level makes such an analysis impossible until yet. But our data set enables us to carry out such an analysis, since we have quarterly GVA data for one German state (Free State of Saxony). To the best of our knowledge, this is the only German state where quarterly GVA data for different sectors is available. Additionally, this paper evaluates whether it is preferable to forecast an aggregate directly (total GVA) or to sum up its weighted sub-components (sectoral GVA) at the regional level. Recently, this question has become more and more attractive in the field of economic forecasting. For the Euro Area as a whole, forecast performance for different sub-somponents of GDP is analyzed by Hahn and Skudelny (2008) and Angelini et al. (2010). Barhoumi et al. (2008) and Barhoumi et al. (2012) study this question for the French economy. A comparison of forecast accuracy of sub-components for Germany is made by Cors and Kuzin (2003) or Drechsel and Scheufele (2012a). Whereas the first article only studies the production side (aggregation of sectoral GVA) of the German economy, the second study compares the different outcomes from the demand (e.g., private consumption, exports etc.) and supply side with those of aggregated German GDP. For the German labor market, the study by Weber and Zika (2013) finds an improvement of forecast accuracy for employment figures through disaggregation in the short term. They show that the aggregation of forecasts for different branches of the economy can produce lower forecast errors in comparison to the prediction of total employment. Studies for regional units, which evaluate aggregate vs. disaggregate forecasts, are missing. The contribution of our paper is manifold. First, we evaluate forecast accuracy of different indicators for several branches of the economy and forecast horizons (one up to four quarters). With such an analysis we make the state of the economy more tangible and can clearly specify what drives future economic development. Second, we apply different pooling strategies. It is well-known in the forecasting literature that the combination of forecasting output from competing models can yield lower forecast errors (Stock and Watson 2006; Timmermann 2006). In numerous studies, the advantage of pooling was confirmed (e.g. Drechsel and Maurin, 2011; Eickmeier and Ziegler, 2008). For three German regions, Lehmann and Wohlrabe (2013) find that pooling significantly produces lower forecast errors for regional GDP than an univariate benchmark model. Sub-national studies for different sectors are still missing. Third, this paper applies factor models as well. Several studies at the national level find significant improvements of forcast accuracy for this class of models (see, e.g., Schumacher, 2007 and Schumacher, 2010 for Germany, or Stock and Watson, 2002 for the US). At the regional level, Lehmann and Wohlrabe (2013) find that factor models show no significant improvement for regional GDP in Germany. Finally, we compare direct and disaggregated forecasts of gross value-added with each other and ask whether there is an information gain when predicting sub-components. To carry out this analysis we use a huge data set at the regional level which incorporates quarterly national accounts for one German state (Saxony). We have information on GDP, total GVA and its sub-components as well as 317 different indicators from the international (USA, EU etc.), national (Germany) and regional level (Saxony). This study is closely linked to the one by Lehmann and Wohlrabe (2013), since it focuses on regional forecasts. But in contrast, it studies sectoral forecasts instead of GDP and additionally asks whether it is preferable to predict sub-components instead of aggregates. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our data, the aggregation method and our empirical setup. The results are discussed in Sect. 3. The last section concludes our main findings.",8

Generally, institutions of higher education are expected to be a key competitive advantage for the regions in which they are located. On the one hand regions benefit from HEIs expenditures and from the consumption and spending of students and staff (expenditure-based effects). On the other hand there is a wide variety of other impacts stemming from HEIs: Well-educated university graduates can help to improve the regional human capital endowment and can transfer knowledge and innovation into the regional economy. Regions may profit from the HEIs’ research efforts, from their international network connections and from public funding of research projects. HEIs may foster a rise of entrepreneurial activity leading to a higher rate of business start-ups in the region. Furthermore, there are socio-cultural impacts resulting in a change of urban atmosphere. These effects are summarized as knowledge-based impacts and benefit the population, the general economic development and innovation systems in their regional environment to a high extent. To give a platform for discussing all kinds of HEI’s regional effects was the intention of the 3rd ERSA International Workshop on “Higher Education Institutions and Regional Development” which took place in Mönchengladbach (Germany) at 14.–15. October 2013. The workshop was organized and hosted by the Niederrhein Institute for Regional and Structural Research (NIERS) which is part of Hochschule Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences. The event was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), for which NIERS was conducting a research project on “Regional Transfer Effects from different Types of Higher Education Institutions”. The European Regional Science Association (ERSA) and its German Speaking Section (Gesellschaft für Regionalforschung GfR) have been key supporters of the workshop. Nearly 50 participants from 15 countries met there to listen to 30 presentations all related to the impacts of HEIs on regional development. This special issue of the “Review of Regional Research” collects four papers from this workshop giving a partial impression of the topics discussed during the two-day meeting. There are several connecting links between these articles. Of course the most important connecting element of all four papers is the investigation of economic effects of HEIs, their focus on knowledge-based economic impacts and the special attention paid to the regional dimension. Two articles analyze basic knowledge transfer effects resulting from cooperative research – Falk Strotebeck’s (Ruhr University Bochum) paper “Running with the pack? The role of Universities of Applied Science in a German research network” and the paper “Regional and Global Collaborations for Knowledge in German Academia” written by Mirja Meyborg (Fraunhofer-ISI, Karlsruhe) and Axel Johannes Schaffer (Universität der Bundeswehr, München). Two articles focus on knowledge transfer via heads. While the paper of Nicola Francesco Dotti (Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels), Ugo Fratesi (ABC, Politecnico di Milano), Camilla Lenzi (ABC, Politecnico di Milano) and Marco Percoco (DAIMAP and CERTeT, Università Bocconi, Milano) analyses the question whether the labor market situation of a university region is already a criterion for the future students’ choice, Johannes Kopper and Angelika Jäger (Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences, NIERS) examine a necessary condition for the transfer from university to region via graduates – the structural fit of types of graduations and regional employment by profession. Two of the articles are result of a common research project done by Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences and Ruhr University Bochum. Aim of this project had been to compare the regional effects of the two most important types of HEIs in the German system of academic education, namely traditional universities and universities of applied sciences. While the paper by Johannes Kopper and Angelika Jäger tries to estimate the “Third Mission Potential in Higher Education” for both types of universities, the article of Falk Strotebeck compares the research network of traditional universities with that of universities of applied sciences.",

The role of Universities of applied science in a German research network,October 2014,Falk Strotebeck,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Overall there is wide agreement in the literature about the importance of higher education institutions (HEIs) for knowledge-based economies (Charles 2006; Bramwell and Wolfe 2008). The role of HEIs developed from “knowledge storehouses” to “knowledge factories” to “knowledge hubs” (Youtie and Shapira 2008; Uyarra 2008) as they create new knowledge and transfer that knowledge into the economy, thereby enhancing innovation activities by fostering the combination of research and commercialization by playing an active role in national and regional innovation systems (Fritsch and Slavtchev 2011). And the importance of higher education institutions in the context of the transfer of knowledge actually increases (Cooke et al. 2007). Academia is therefore considered as a crucial backbone of growth oriented innovation policy because (1) the public education system can be influenced by politics and (2) the public research institutions have what is needed to innovate: knowledge (Fritsch et al. 2007). The transfer of that knowledge takes place via different mechanisms (e.g. graduates, foundation of enterprises, publications, research cooperation), which are broadly discussed in the literature (e.g. Rosenfeld et al. 2004; Hamm et al. 2012; Fritsch et al. 2007). One very important channel through which knowledge is transferred is cooperative research (Perkman and Walsh 2007; Meyer-Krahmer and Schmoch 1998). This channel offers a chance for the involved actors to adjust routines and refresh their knowledge base by frequent knowledge exchange (see e.g. Hamm et al. 2012). And whereas spillovers from university research (or other research institutes) and from the private sector positively affect the performance of regional innovation systems on their own, in particular the interaction between these two different actors has positive impacts (Fritsch and Slavtchev 2011). In a study by Mansfield and Lee (1996) about the contribution of Universities to industrial innovation, the authors find a complementary function of differently oriented Universities, regarding their focus on applied or basic research. “Here, as in many areas, the diversity of US universities has its advantages. To promote technological change and industrial innovation, a mix of fundamental and applied research, as well as a variety of technical activities aimed at the diffusion and commercialization of new knowledge, must be carried out. The major research universities have formidable capacities and strengths, but at the stage where firms need to interact with university personnel who are willing to focus on their immediate problems and help them apply new knowledge, less prestigious universities may have a comparative (indeed, an absolute) advantage.” (Mansfield and Lee 1996, p. 1057) In Germany a distinctive feature of the system of higher education is the strict differentiation between Universities on the one hand and Universities of Applied Science on the other hand. Whereas Universities focus on basic research to a great extent, the Universities of Applied Science focus on application oriented research, even though teaching—not research—has been considered their main task for a long time, a view that has changed in the recent past. Additionally the generally smaller Universities of Applied Science are often said to be more locally oriented regarding their cooperative activities with small and medium sized enterprises (Kroll et al. 2012). In contrast Universities “tend to focus on R&D co-operations with larger, technologically more ambitious firms.” (Kroll et al. 2012, p. 10) The characteristics of Universities and Universities of Applied Science should therefore affect their position within the German research network. Regarding the stated differences the HEIs might have complementary rather than substitutional roles: Universities, conducting resource intensive basic research and cooperating with large firms on an interregional level on the one hand and Universities of Applied Science, conducting applied research in smaller projects in cooperation with local firms on the other hand. To discover (potential) differences regarding their role within the network, an exploratory social network analysis with focus on three centrality measures covering the aspects of cooperation activity, knowledge control function and efficient knowledge distribution is conducted in the study. A change of positions in time is of particular interest, because public funding for research activities at Universities of Applied Science increased in the last 10 years as well as the self-image of Universities of Applied Science shifted towards more research oriented institutions. Using data of more than a decade, potential changes in the positioning of the different HEIs can be uncovered. The paper is organized as follows: In the next section (2.) the conceptual framework is presented. Based on the integration of HEIs as actors within systems of innovation, the potential differences between Universities and Universities of Applied Science regarding their role as knowledge creators and contributors are stressed. The subsequent section (3.) is a description of the data, followed by a section (4.) containing a description of methods, particularly the used network centrality measures. The fifth section (5.) contains a discussion of the results and the last section (6.) eventually summarizes main aspects touched by the paper.",

35,1,Review of Regional Research,08 January 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-014-0094-0,The publication and citation behaviour of economic geographers and geographical economists compared,February 2015,Rolf Sternberg,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Relations between economic geography proper (a sub-discipline of geography) and geographical economics (a sub-discipline of economics) have been the subject of discipline-centred debate (see, e.g. Clark 1998; Marchioni 2004; Martin and Sunley 2001; Overman 2004; Rodríguez-Posé 2011), all the more since the self-proclaimed “economic geographer” Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize (Krugman o. J.; Sternberg 2009). Content-based cooperation makes sense in view of the variety of subject-related references; nevertheless, economists (“lions” according to Duranton and Rodríguez-Posé 2005) and geographers (“butterflies”) cooperate relatively rarely in the possible arenas of literature, methodologies, joint publications, or conferences. And that, despite the fact that many books as well as new and successful journals (such as the Journal of Economic Geography; see Wrigley and Overman 2010; Puga and Wrigley 2006) are explicitly dedicated to precisely this cooperation between the two disciplines. One of the most significant expressions of cooperation in research takes the form of publications and citations. When geographical economists (hereinafter referred to as GEs) publish articles together with economic geographers (EGs) or respectively cite authors of the other discipline in publications, this can be taken as the best evidence of mutual acknowledgement between the disciplines, since citations are the currency used for payment in the academic community (Laband and Piette 1994). The strategic significance of publications in highly-respected journals and the number of citations has long been acknowledged in economics, but also in economic geography for some years now (Yeung 2002). This paper compares the publication and citation behaviour of EGs and GEs based on a unique data set. The analysis is consciously limited to researchers in the German-speaking world (covering Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Luxembourg), but incorporates all articles indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) databases SSCI and SCI and published by all of these researchers, provided they were employed at a university on the cut-off date of August 1, 2010. 772 SSCI or SCI papers and 4,266 associated citations of 178 EGs and GEs are included. The analysis therefore goes deeper for the countries covered than a recent approach on the dialogue between both disciplines by Brakman et al. (2011), which represents an important step in the right direction, but is limited to the data of only one (albeit very important) journal. The focus on the German-speaking world is not motivated by the fact that some German geographical economists like Alfred Weber and Johann Heinrich von Thünen or some economic geographers like Walter Christaller have become renowned in mainstay Anglo-American research. This focus is motivated by two assumptions: that the German-speaking world is representative for other languages/worlds outside the Anglo-American one and that the differences between the German-speaking world and the Anglo-American one are significant when it comes to publication and citation behaviour. The paper aims to answer the following research questions: Do the two disciplines differ in terms of the frequency of publication and citation? Can differences be established in the frequency of joint publications with co-authors outside the German-speaking world? What marks out the journals in which GEs and EGs publish? How frequently and with what effects are there joint publications, i.e., is there “mutual neglect” and “non-debate” (Brakman et al. 2011, Duranton and Rodríguez-Posé 2005) outside the Anglo-American world, too? How have these aspects changed over time? The analysis therefore complements more recent studies of the publication and citation behaviour of scholars from both disciplines who concentrate explicitly or implicitly on the Anglo-American world (e.g., Brakman et al. 2011; Bodman 2010). Such analyses of countries where a language other than English is spoken have so far been rare (e.g., Rodríguez-Posé 2006) and might be useful given the increasing share of authors from non-English speaking countries in SSCI-journals of the named disciplines. In addition to differences in the publication and citation behaviour, our empirical analyses show some parallels between the two disciplines. The differences in terms of the frequency of publication and citation are slight. A convergence of scholars from both disciplines over time can be observed, as younger scholars are more similar to each other in this respect than those of the older generation for whom journal articles were/are less important than other forms of publication. Publication together with foreign scholars (of the same discipline or not) becomes more frequent. Equally, more and more German-speaking EGs are trying to have their articles published in high-calibre international journals (of both disciplines)—and with increasing success. Joint publications of both disciplines are still a rare, but increasing phenomenon. Such joint publications show higher citation values on average and are more often published in journals with higher impact factors. There seems to be a cooperation dividend if a “lion and a butterfly” (Duranton and Rodríguez-Posé 2005) write a joint article. The rest of the article is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the debate about the dialogue between GEs and EGs and summarises empirical studies performed to date on the publication and citation behaviour of scholars of both disciplines. Section 3 presents the data and bibliometric indicators. Section 4 explores the publication output, the citation behaviour and the joint publications of EGs and GEs in the German-speaking countries both from a static as well as a dynamic perspective. Section 5 discusses the empirical results, draws conclusions and develops some recommendations for further research.",4
35,1,Review of Regional Research,13 May 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-014-0084-2,Inward FDI and local innovative performance. An empirical investigation on Italian provinces,February 2015,Andrea Ascani,Luisa Gagliardi,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In the current wave of globalisation of the world economy it is widely acknowledged that foreign direct investment (FDI) plays a growing and primary role (WTO 1996; Dicken 2007). UNCTAD (2012) shows that the volume of FDI has dramatically risen in the last 20 years, with an increase in world FDI inward stock of about 2 millions of dollars to more than 20 millions. Not surprisingly, policy makers in most countries place great emphasis on the potential benefits that may stem from the attraction of FDI. The view that attracting foreign subsidiaries of multinational enterprises (MNEs) will yield great advantages to recipient economies is grounded in the belief that some positive knowledge externalities arise from foreign activities and spread to domestic firms. Beside of several potential benefits, the increase of domestic productivity and the transfer of more advanced technology are frequently considered as the main rationale for integrating measures of attraction of FDI in local economic development policies. In this respect, the idea that knowledge plays a fundamental role in the process of growth is deeply rooted in economic theory, which assigns a crucial role to innovation and its diffusion in the economic performance of nations (Grossman and Helpman 1991). Nevertheless, it is not entirely clear whether FDI concretely benefits recipient economies. Despite the large amount of studies in this field and its relevance for public policies, evidence on FDI-induced knowledge externalities remains inconclusive and empirical exercises frequently offer mixed suggestions (Smeets 2008). By employing Italian manufacturing data to answer the question whether inward FDI benefit the innovative performance of recipient economies, this paper will attempt to add some new evidence to the literature on the impact of FDI. There are a number of elements that make this empirical exercise different from the bulk of previous research. Firstly, the impact of knowledge externalities associated to FDI is investigated on direct measure of innovation, namely, patent data. To the best of our knowledge, few papers adopt such an indicator (Cheung and Lin 2004) while the literature is dominated by studies based on broader measures of economic performance such as total factor productivity (TFP) of domestic firms, labour productivity or growth rate. Secondly, FDI are also measured with a direct indicator. Indeed, while most studies use several proxies for the presence of foreign firms into the host economy, this paper employs the real inflow of foreign capital in Italy. This provides a more detailed measure of the actual magnitude of the activities carried out by foreign enterprises. Thirdly, FDI-induced knowledge externalities are underexplored in the case of Italy, with few notable exceptions represented by recent contributions (Castellani and Zanfei 2003, 2007; Benfratello and Sembenelli 2006). The Italian case is instead very interesting for the well-known geographical dualism of the Italian economy. Finally, the occurrence of knowledge spillovers is investigated along provincial lines (NUTS-3), that is, at a geographical scale that is rarely adopted in the literature mainly due to lack of data. This allows estimating a more precise effect by reducing the potential ecological fallacyFootnote 1 and also taking into appropriate consideration the existence of spatial disparities in both inward FDI and innovation performance. Results reveal that local production systems do benefit from knowledge externalities generated by FDI in Italy. Our finding also passes a fair number of checks suggesting that local innovative performance relies on both internal and external sources of knowledge. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the existent literature devoted to the economic rationale of the impact of FDI on innovation. Section 3 describes data while Sect. 4 introduces the main methodological challenges associated to the estimation of the causal effect of FDI on innovation and presents in detail the identification strategy adopted. Section 5 discusses the main findings while in Sect. 6 the robustness of results is checked. Finally, concluding remarks and policy considerations are developed in Sect. 7.",22
35,1,Review of Regional Research,25 September 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-014-0089-x,The capitalization of non-market attributes into regional housing rents and wages: evidence on German functional labor market areas,February 2015,Norbert Hiller,Oliver Lerbs,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The concept of the German social market economy not only aims at reducing social disadvantages among individuals, but also at creating “equivalent living conditions” among regions (Benz 1999).Footnote 1 As a main instrument of German regional policy, the Joint Task (“Gemeinschaftsaufgabe”) “Improvement of Regional Economic Structure” is targeted at narrowing economic disparities among regions (Blume and Döring 2009). Major instruments of European regional policy, such as the European Regional Development Fund, are also designed to reduce the gap between economically leading and lagging areas (Mohl and Hagen 2010; Eggert et al. 2007). The alignment of structural funding towards economic indicators (such as GDP per capita or unemployment) yet might take too narrow a view, given that it is not automatically the case that the most productive regions are also the best places to live. Better access to highly-paid jobs and physical, social or cultural infrastructure has to be traded off against higher costs of housing, higher levels of congestion, pollution, crime, and other disadvantages of density. Even under a more comprehensive approach to measuring regional quality of life, the questions arise of how to appropriately weight and combine different indicators (Eckey et al. 2009; Uhde 2008). The starting point of the present paper is that regions, such as functional labor market areas, are characterized by specific combinations of housing costs, wage earnings, and non-market attributes which together affect total household utility. In order to comprehensively assess regional living conditions, these region-specific combinations must be analyzed within the integrated framework of cross-region spatial equilibrium. Popular regional quality-of-life rankings in Germany (and elsewhere) typically ignore that regional housing and labor markets closely interact. That is why analyzing inter-regional disparities in housing costs or wages alone is generally not sufficient for quality-of-life comparisons (Glaeser 2008; Blomquist 2008). The paper extends existing research on the quality of life in Germany by providing new estimates for the role of non-market attributes in the determination of regional housing costs and wages. By using the hedonic pricing approach developed by Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982), the paper is related to the work of Buettner and Ebertz (2009), who investigate land price and wage differentials across Germany’s (at then) 438 counties and cities. This study adds three important innovations: first, instead of using data for administrative areas, the estimation of implicit prices for non-market attributes draws on 141 functional labor market area delineations recently provided by Kosfeld and Werner (2012)Footnote 2. Testing for spatial autocorrelation in the estimated equations’ residuals supports work by Rusche (2010), who suggests that using functional areas in regional quality-of-life research reduces the likelihood of parameter bias that is associated with the disregard of spatial interaction processes across administrative areas (such as commuting between the place of work, where wages are usually observed, and the place of residence, where housing costs are observed).Footnote 3 Second, information on regional housing rents is used instead of regional prices for buildable land. Rents yield a more representative measure of housing costs for a country where nearly sixty per cent of households are tenants, and where annual construction is much less than one per cent of the existing housing stock. As we use rent data for new leases only, we circumvent problems of price stickiness in the market for in-place leases, which is related to rental housing market regulation and the presence of incomplete contracts in rental markets.Footnote 4 Third, the estimations are based on workers’ wages instead of households’ disposable incomes. This avoids possible distortion of the regional wage measure by non-labor earnings and public transfers. In order to further improve the consistency of the regional wage measure, workers’ gross wages are corrected for tax and social security contributions to arrive at regional net wages. According to our estimates in Sect. 5, the German labor market area with the highest regional quality-of-life estimate is Munich, followed by geographically adjacent areas of Weilheim-Schongau and Traunstein. Labor market areas in the post-industrial Ruhr-Area rank at the lower end. The estimates reveal that high quality-of-life areas according to our concept are predominantly located in the south and the north-east of Germany. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews essential strands of the literature on regional quality of life, placing particular emphasis on the case of Germany. Estimable regional rent and wage equations are derived from spatial equilibrium theory in Sect. 3, while Sect. 4 serves to describe the data set. Empirical results on the capitalization of non-market attributes are discussed in Sect. 5. Based on a computation of the revealed total willingness to pay for a parsimonious set of regional (dis-)amenities, a comprehensive ranking of regional quality of life is presented that can be directly compared to findings of previous studies. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",4
35,1,Review of Regional Research,27 August 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-014-0086-0,The relative importance of structural and locational effects on apartment price variations in a medium-sized German city,February 2015,Norbert Hiller,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"As the role of structural qualities for real estate prices is well known, the role of location quality is object of a lot of research discussions today. Generally, the locational quality of an apartment can be valued by its amenities, such as noise-level, restaurants or a nearby lake. Primarily amenities determine where people want to live. At the macro level, researchers underline their positive consumption effect, which increases the demand to live in cities with generous amenities. Particularly the role of restaurants, museums, movie theaters, bowling alleys and hotels are compared between metropolitan areas (Glaeser et al. 2001). At an urban micro level, the role of these amenities has partly been investigated. For example, Noonan (2007), and Ahlfeldt and Maennig (2010) highlight the positive price effects of famous landmarks on house prices. Furthermore, a high level of road noise (Ball 1973 and Andersson et al. 2009; Nelson 2008) or a large distance to green space and body of water have a significant negative impact on residential property prices (Brandt and Maennig 2011). Ahlfeldt (2011a) and Ahlfeldt (2011b) investigate the positive effect of accessibility on real estate prices. Sirmans et al. (2005) provide a broad overview of potential determinants of hedonic pricing models in different studies. So far, extensive research has been done to explain the role—in view of significant coefficients—of location for real estate prices. In this paper we analyze the relative importance of structural and locational attributes in hedonic models. Comparing to significant coefficients, the relative importance describes the explanatory power of variables in a regression. Our hypothesis is that the locational quality of an apartment has more explanatory power than the structural quality. In this case the share of locational quality in consideration of the coefficient of determination R2 is higher than the share of structural quality. To prove the share of determination, we use a computer-intensive algorithm, which is based on the work of Lindeman et al. (1980) and Grömping (2009). By our knowledge, there exists no study, which discusses this issue. To determine the relative importance of structural and locational quality, we use data for the medium-sized German city of Münster (Westphalia). Until now, the role of amenities in major German cities (with less than 300,000 inhabitants) is unexplored at a micro level. The statistical office of Münster provides a big data set of (dis-)amenities, which allows a broad analysis of pricing effects of different amenity types which are discussed by many authors before. In the following Sections, we give a short overview of the data. To measure the micro level impact of amenities on apartment prices, we construct a basic hedonic regression model, which is described in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we measure the relative importance of the variables to determine the strength of dimensions leading to apartment price variations in Münster while the final section concludes.",4
35,1,Review of Regional Research,14 June 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-014-0085-1,Akzeptanz der Förderung gleichwertiger Lebensverhältnisse und Arbeitsbedingungen,February 2015,Matthias Wrede,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Nicht nur im europäischen, sondern auch im nationalen und subnationalen Maßstab lassen sich erhebliche Unterschiede in den Lebens- und Arbeitsbedingungen verschiedener Regionen feststellen, die sich in der Zukunft mit hoher Sicherheit verstärken werden (Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung 2012; Gregory und Patuelli 2013). Disparitäten bestehen vorrangig zwischen den Kern- und Peripherieregionen, zwischen den vormalig plan- und marktwirtschaftlich gelenkten Gebieten sowie zwischen städtischen und ländlichen Regionen. Die Unterschiede sind vielfältig, umfassen sowohl Bevölkerungsstruktur, Beschäftigung, Wertschöpfung, Einkommen und Preisniveaus als auch die soziale und technische Infrastruktur der Daseinsvorsorge und spiegeln sich wider in heterogener subjektiver Lebenszufriedenheit und Wanderung in prosperierende Regionen (Kawka und Sturm 2006; Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung 2012; Böhme et al. 2012). Sowohl eine negative Wahrnehmung der Lebensbedingungen als auch Unternehmensschließungen und fehlende Unternehmensgründungen sowie Abwanderung vornehmlich Leistungsfähiger (siehe Arntz et al. 2011) senken die regionale Produktivität und erhöhen die Kosten der Bereitstellung der Infrastruktur und wirken somit disparitätsverstärkend (Gregory und Patuelli 2013). Der durch die niedrigen Geburtenraten ausgelöste Bevölkerungsrückgang erschwert in den von Abwanderung betroffenen Regionen die Anpassung noch zusätzlich. Dem Staat obliegt in Deutschland die aus Sozialstaats-, Bundesstaats- und Rechtsstaatsprinzip ableitbare Verpflichtung, gleichwertige Lebensverhältnisse herzustellen (vgl. zur Gleichwertigkeit der Lebensverhältnisse im Verfassungs- und Raumordnungsrecht Reichel 2009). Gleichwertige Lebensverhältnisse sind allerdings nicht mit gleichen Lebensverhältnissen gleichzusetzen. Sie lassen sehr wohl Vielfalt und Unterschiedlichkeit zu, setzen aber einen Mindeststandard an Leistungen und angemessene Chancen zur Entfaltung der Persönlichkeit voraus. Erhebliche Ungleichgewichte und Beeinträchtigungen des Sozialgefüges sind vom Staat abzuwenden. Die Förderung der Gleichwertigkeit der Lebensverhältnisse ist nicht nur auf Bundesebene, sondern auch auf Länderebene rechtlich verankert. Sie findet vorrangig ihren Ausdruck in der direkten finanziellen Förderung von Regionen, in Verkehrsinfrastrukturprojekten, in Standortentscheidungen bei öffentlich finanzierten Einrichtungen und im Finanzausgleich zwischen Gebietskörperschaften. In einer demokratisch verfassten Gesellschaft ist die Legitimität der Politik Voraussetzung für deren Durchsetzbarkeit. Die mit hohen Ausgaben verbundene Politik der Förderung gleichwertiger Lebensverhältnisse kann nur dann dauerhaft Bestand haben, wenn sie von der Bevölkerung akzeptiert und als gerecht empfunden wird. Das vorrangige Ziel dieses Artikels ist es, zu überprüfen, ob und inwieweit die Akzeptanz von dem jeweiligen materiellen Eigeninteresse getrieben wird. Obwohl Ausgleichsmechanismen ein zentraler Baustein föderaler Systeme sind, gibt es nur wenige wissenschaftliche Arbeiten zur Akzeptanz des interregionalen Ausgleichs in der Bevölkerung. Eine Ausnahme für Deutschland ist Heinemann et al. (2014), die zeigen, dass die Abgeordneten der Länderparlamente dem Länderfinanzausgleich in hohem Maße zustimmen, diesen im Durchschnitt aber als zu weitgehend ansehen. Heinemann et al. (2014) stellen zudem für die Abgeordneten fest, dass deren Zustimmung mit dem Eigeninteresse positiv korreliert ist. Einerseits ist die Zustimmung in Länderparlamenten der Nehmerländer stärker ausgeprägt als in den Geberländern, andererseits ist auch ein Bezug zur Zugehörigkeit zu Regierung bzw. Opposition festzustellen. Die ökonomische Wissenschaft hat sich in der Vergangenheit auf die Analyse der Ursachen regionaler Disparitäten konzentriert, um auf deren Basis den ökonomischen und sozialen Nutzen ausgleichender Regionalpolitik zu beurteilen: Unterschiedliche Lebensverhältnisse sind die Folge des Zusammenwirkens von natürlichen Unterschieden (Lage, Klima, Bodenbeschaffenheit usw.) und heterogenen Institutionen (Marktregulierung, Steuern etc.) mit den Kräften des Marktes. Vorteilen der zentralen Lage und der Agglomeration stehen Überfüllungskosten gegenüber. Während die Nähe zu anderen Betrieben der gleichen Branche den Wissensaustausch erleichtert, den Pool an verfügbaren fachlich geeigneten Arbeitskräften und Arbeitsstellen vergrößert, den Zugang zu spezialisierten Vorprodukten und Absatzmärkten vereinfacht und damit höhere Produktivität und Löhne ermöglicht, sind in Ballungsräumen die Wettbewerbsintensität größer, Boden und Immobilien knapper und folglich teurer sowie Überfüllungen der Verkehrsinfrastruktur gängiger (von Thünen 1826; Marshall 1890; Krugman 1991). Insbesondere die Qualität des Matchings von Arbeitskräften und -stellen sowie die Wissensspillover spielen in den humankapitalintensiven und innovativen Branchen eine herausragende Rolle (Moretti 2011). In der Regel handelt es sich bei diesen Phänomenen um technologische oder pekuniäre Externalitäten, d. h., um Interdependenzen, die vom Verursacher aufgrund fehlender Preissignale nicht vollständig berücksichtigt werden. Folglich können Marktgleichgewichte nur in Ausnahmesituationen ohne korrigierende Eingriffe in das Preisgefüge effiziente Allokationen der Ressourcen hervorbringen. Da sowohl positive als auch negative Externalitäten auftreten, können Marktgleichgewichte durch Über- und Unteragglomeration gekennzeichnet sein (Pflüger und Südekum 2008). Größere, dicht besiedelte Agglomerationen weisen aber in der Regel eine vergleichsweise hohe Produktivität auf (Rosenthal und Strange 2004; Strange 2009). Fehlerhaft gestaltete Regionalpolitik kann das gesamtwirtschaftliche Wachstum reduzieren, falls sie eine effiziente Nutzung der Ballungsvorteile verhindert (Glaeser und Gottlieb 2008), und sie kann unerwünschte regionale Verteilungseffekte haben, beispielsweise in dem die Verbesserung der Anbindung peripherer Räume an die Zentren die Kosten der Belieferung der Peripherie und des Pendelns in die Zentren senkt und damit die Attraktivität zentraler Regionen noch erhöht (Martin und Rogers 1995). Darüber hinaus wird eine auf die peripheren Regionen fokussierte Ansiedlungspolitik den Flächenverbrauch vergrößern und kann durch induzierten Verkehr Lärm- und Abgasbelastungen erhöhen. Kline und Moretti (2013) verdeutlichen einerseits zwar, dass angesichts von Arbeitsmarktunvollkommenheiten regional differenzierte Politiken der Begünstigung von Neuanstellungen positive Effekte haben können; ihre Analyse zeigt andererseits aber auch die Hürden auf, die einem Erfolg im Weg stehen, da dazu detailliertes Wissen über die regionale Produktivität vorhanden sein muss. Bei der Beurteilung von horizontalen und vertikalen Finanzzuweisungen muss zudem der Einfluss auf die Anreize der politischen Akteure berücksichtigt werden. Soweit diskretionär nutzbare Spielräume bestehen, werden die Repräsentanten der Regionen Rent-Seeking betreiben, um in den Genuss von Zuweisungen zu gelangen (Sato 2009). Rent-Seeking ist einerseits mit Ressourcenaufwand verbunden und kann andererseits Entscheidungen in gesellschaftlich nicht wünschenswerter Weise verzerren. Das gilt um so mehr, als dass exemplarisch für die Europäische Regionalpolitik gezeigt wurde, dass regionale Transfers der zahlenden Einrichtung Zustimmung bei den Bürgern verschaffen können (Osterloh 2011). Staatliche Umverteilung zur Herstellung gleichwertiger Lebensverhältnisse sollte vornehmlich auf die räumlich immobilen Gesellschaftsschichten begrenzt werden, da Individuen mit geringen Kosten räumlicher Mobilität sich durch Abwanderung ungünstigen Verhältnissen entziehen können. Wenn die Lebens- und Produktionsbedingungen in einer Region unterdurchschnittlich gut sind, dann werden Menschen und Firmen abwandern, so dass die Preise für Immobilien und nicht handelbare Dienstleistungen nachgeben. Unter Einschluss von Unterschieden in Preisen, Löhnen und Arbeitslosigkeitsrisiken wird es interregional zu einer weitgehenden Angleichung der Lebensverhältnisse für hochgradig mobile, nicht aber für immobile Akteure kommen (Roback 1982; Albouy 2009; Wrede 2013). Allerdings müssen staatliche Eingriffe zur Herstellung gleichwertiger Lebensverhältnisse nicht nur unter Effizienz- und Wachstumsgesichtspunkten, sondern auch mit Blick auf soziale Gerechtigkeit bewertet werden (Storper 2011). Effiziente, aber als ungerecht empfundene Politiken lassen sich nicht dauerhaft durchsetzen. Der Zusammenhang zwischen der Förderung gleichwertiger Lebensverhältnisse in Stadt und Land bzw. Kern und Peripherie und sozialer Gerechtigkeit ist keineswegs trivial. Wirtschaftlich starke Kernregionen ziehen sowohl die Leistungsfähigsten als auch leistungsschwächere von sozialen Notlagen stärker Bedrohte an (Bacolod et al. 2009; Combes et al. 2012). So weisen in Deutschland kreisfreie Städte beispielsweise einen höheren Anteil geringqualifizierter Beschäftigter und eine höhere Quote an Empfängern von Hilfeleistungen nach SGB II als ländliche periphere Landkreise auf (Wrede 2012). Andererseits sind die Kosten der öffentlichen Daseinsvorsorge in ländlichen, dünn-besiedelten und von Abwanderung betroffenen Regionen offensichtlich höher. Neben einer detaillierten empirischen Wirkungsanalyse staatlicher Förderung gleichwertiger Lebensverhältnisse vor dem Hintergrund von Effizienz- und Gerechtigkeitsaspekten bedarf es aber angesichts der Notwendigkeit demokratischer Legitimation einer gründlichen Untersuchung der Akzeptanz dieser Politik. Die im Jahr 2013 in Bayern durchgeführten Volksentscheide bieten eine weite Teile der Bevölkerung erfassende Datengrundlage für eine solche Akzeptanzanalyse für einen großen deutschen Flächenstaat. Dieser Artikel untersucht die Ergebnisse der Volksentscheide in den Stimmbezirken, um Faktoren zu bestimmen, welche die Akzeptanz der Förderung gleichwertiger Lebensverhältnisse und Arbeitsbedingungen in Stadt und Land beeinflussen. Die Untersuchung macht sich zunutze, dass zeitgleich fünf Volksentscheide zu unterschiedlichen Verfassungsänderungen stattfanden. Damit ist es möglich, mit einer Panel-Analyse für unbeobachtbare Heterogenität der Stimmbezirke zu kontrollieren. Zudem werden einerseits für die Gemeindeverbände in Bayern und andererseits für die Stimmbezirke in der Stadt Nürnberg sozio-demografische Daten zugespielt. Die zentrale Identifikationsstrategie ist, die Zustimmung zur Förderung gleichwertiger Lebensverhältnisse der Zustimmung zu den anderen Verfassungsänderungen gegenüberzustellen. In der Untersuchung erweist sich, dass die Zustimmung fast ausschließlich mit der Betroffenheit der jeweiligen Region variiert. Zentrale Lage, Bevölkerungswachstum und gute Arbeitsmarktbedingungen wirken sich negativ auf die Zustimmung zur staatlichen Förderung gleichwertiger Lebensverhältnisse aus. Darüber hinaus scheinen sozio-demografische Faktoren nahezu keinen direkten Einfluss auf das Abstimmungsverhalten zu haben.",

35,2,Review of Regional Research,17 April 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-014-0096-y,The influence of estate agencies’ location and time on Internet,October 2015,David Koch,Gunther Maier,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Real estate markets are often characterized as intransparent and heterogeneous. Selling a property requires market knowledge. The seller may merchandise his property himself and advertise on an appropriate platform or he may choose to engage an estate agent. The estate agent is consigned to achieve the highest price and limit the time on the market. Analyses show that time on the market and price are influenced by building characteristics, the market-situation, and the characteristics of the estate agents. This study aims to reveal the influence of the real estate agent’s location on the offer. To be more specific, we aim to see whether the estate agency’s location has an influence on the online period and if there are relevant price differences. We use data from the Viennese housing market and concentrate on two aspects adding value to the customer: First, the object might be marketed more efficiently if the estate agent was based within the same district as the dwelling offered. Second, a Vienna-based agent might be more acquainted with the local market than agents from outside the capital. We assume differences between local and remote agents because of two main reasons. First, a local agent will have lower transaction costs. For example on-site inspections will cause less effort and costs. Second, local agents are acquainted with the district’s market conditions. This may offer advantages when setting offer prices and the like. In contrast to the current TOM analyses, which analyse the actual marketing period from starting the marketing to eventually selling the property, this study is focused on the online marketing. It is widely recognized that home buyers and renters rely more and more on the Internet to pre-search for homes. This has been shown in several studies (e.g. Seiler et al. 2012; Benjamin et al. 2005; Tse and Webb 2002; Bond et al. 2000). With the introduction of the Web in the early 1990s and the increased use, it is likely that the cost of information has fallen. For apartment seekers, the web provides lower-cost access to high-quality information such as maps, property overviews, photos, and floor plans. Cheaper and better market information serves to reduce the number of units that need to be physically inspected by apartment seekers, leading to a reduced duration of search (Hagen and Hansen 2010). Zumpano et al. (2003) examines the factors that influence the use of the Internet as part of the home buying process and the resulting effect on the efficacy of the buyer search. One of their main results is that the use of the Internet as a search tool does not reduce the buyer’s search time, but it encourages the buyer to search more intensively. Besides duration, they focus on the intensity—how many properties are visited within a given period. Therefore, this study differs from the current time on the market analyses and the marketing period is measured in TOI—time on the Internet. We use data on real estate offers of apartments in Vienna, which are published in the largest real estate platform of Austria (www.immobilien.net). To model TOI we use established methods from the TOM literature—OLS and hazard models. Our findings point towards an added value if the estate agent is located within Vienna whereas no significant difference is observed for agents based in different districts of the city. The next section introduces the relevant literature for our study of TOM. Then we introduce the methodology for TOM analyses, before analysing the data used. In the subsequent section we present the findings of our study. The final section summarizes and briefly discusses the results.",3
35,2,Review of Regional Research,27 March 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-014-0095-z,Optimal Fuel Taxes and Heterogeneity of Cities,October 2015,Georg Hirte,Stefan Tscharaktschiew,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The regulation of a city’s power to tax varies across countries from the case of Belgium where cities could potentially levy a wide range of differentiated taxes or Finland where a large share of tax revenue is collected at the local level to countries like Germany where cities can only levy some minor taxes (dog taxes, tourist taxes) or are allowed only to impose a small supplement on federal tax rates (property tax, business tax). In this respect fuel taxes are usually not associated with local tax jurisdiction. But even these taxes may be subject to the power of all levels of jurisdictions as is the case of the United States where states, counties or cities contribute to the aggregate effective fuel tax rate, e.g. through levying their own fuel tax supplement (excise tax).Footnote 1 This generates considerable differences in effective fuel tax rates across U.S. states or counties. In July 2014 the lowest gasolineFootnote 2 tax was levied in the state of Alaska with on average 30.8 $-cents/gallon (\(\textrm{c}\!\!\!/\) pg) while New York had the highest rate with 68.9 \(\text{c}\!\!\!/\) pg closely followed by California and Connecticut. This implies a fuel tax differential of 38.1 \(\text{c}\!\!\!/\) pg. For comparison, the nationwide average tax on gasoline amounted to 49.62 \(\text{c}\!\!\!/\) pg (API 2014).Footnote 3 There is also intra-state variation, but to a much smaller extent. For example, in Florida the county supplement on gasoline taxes ranges from 5–12 \(\text{c}\!\!\!/\) pg (Florida Department of Revenue 2013). In contrast, fuel tax differentiation at the city level is relatively small compared with the state and county level. For example, in the state of Alabama the city differential amounts to 1–6 \(\text{c}\!\!\!/\) pg with e.g. a 4 \(\text{c}\!\!\!/\) pg supplement in Montgomery city. In general differences across states are much larger than within states. The relatively small differentiation at the city level is surprising when taking into account that traffic related externalities, in particular congestion, mainly occur in urban areas and that the magnitude of congestion is quite heterogeneous especially across U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSA). In 2011 congestion costs in the most congested Washington MSA were estimated at 1398 $/year per commuter (Schrank et al. 2012) whereas in the San Diego MSA – the less congested very large MSA according to the classification of the 2012 Urban Mobility Report – they amounted to ‘only’ 774 $/year (ranked 41 of all MSAs). In smaller MSAs congestion costs per commuter are usually lower, e.g. 287 $/year in the Corpus Christi MSA in 2011, ranked 100 in national congestion tables (Schrank et al. 2012). These figures seem not to match: the differences in local tax rates are very small particularly in comparison to the heterogeneity of congestion costs. Against this background, the objective of the present paper is to analyze (1) whether or not current local gasoline taxes rates are too low, (2) whether the current small level of tax differentiation across heterogeneous MSAs is justified on efficiency grounds, and (3) what would be the welfare loss if tax differentiation is restricted, e.g., by levying uniform gasoline tax rates across cities.Footnote 4
 There are some studies calculating nationwide (Parry 2011; Parry and Small 2005; West and Williams 2007) or statewide (Lin and Prince (2009) for California) optimal fuel taxes concerning passenger transport in the U.S. The analyses systematically reveal the rational for fuel tax adjustments and clearly suggest that current fuel taxes in the U.S. are too low, implying that higher tax rates would raise social welfare.Footnote 5
 This paper extends the literature on efficient fuel taxation by calculating and comparing optimal local gasoline taxes for heterogeneous cities within the same unified framework.Footnote 6 In our study heterogeneity refers to differences in city size, travel distances, congestion and further traffic related externalities, public transit shares, economic figures such as wages and rents etc. We (endogenously) generate these differences by creating cities that differ with respect to their spatial distribution of employment. According to Kneebone (2009) U.S. metropolitan areas are quite heterogeneous concerning the spatial distribution of jobs. On average in the largest 98 metropolitan areas only 21 % of employees work within three miles of downtown, while over twice that share (45 %) work more than 10 miles away from the city center (date refer to 2006).Footnote 7 However, while for example in the New York MSA 35 % of all jobs are located within 3 miles of the CBD, this share amounts to only 8 % in the Los Angeles MSA. In order to calculate optimal local gasoline tax rates, we employ a spatial urban computable general equilibrium approach in the tradition of Anas and Rhee (2006) where interactions between spatially differentiated markets, households and firms are explicitly taken into account (see also Anas and Xu 1999; Tscharaktschiew and Hirte 2010a). Households decide where to reside, where to work, where and how much to shop, how much labor to supply and, thus, how often to commute, how much leisure to enjoy at home and outdoor, thus, how often to travel to leisure locations, how much land to rent, and which travel mode to use. All theses interdependent location, quantity and travel decisions are endogenous and determine trip distances, trip frequencies, congestion, fuel consumption, and CO\(_{2}\) emissions. Because we take different distortionary taxes into account, fuel tax policy may erode different tax bases and thus may cause efficiency losses to the broader fiscal system (tax interaction effects). Our main technical innovation is the choice of spatially differentiated leisure activities and, thus, leisure trips. This allows us to account for almost all trips made by a typical U.S. resident (see U.S. Department of Transportation 2011) and to accommodate to the increasing role of non-work related trips in the U.S. (see Anas 2007). The model is calibrated to a U.S. prototype MSA characterized by a medium spatial distribution of jobs and, associated with it, a medium city size, a medium level of traffic related external costs etc. Based on this benchmark we compute the optimal (local) gasoline tax rate. Subsequently, we consider alternative urban areas differing with respect to significant characteristics (see above) and recalculate optimal gasoline tax levels. We find that in our prototype benchmark urban economy the optimal local gasoline tax rate amounts to 1.80 $/gallon. Given the benchmark gasoline tax of 0.41 $/gallon, the present tax is therefore too low, as suggested by previous studies (see above). The main driver for the higher optimal gasoline tax is the capability of the tax to reduce the large urban traffic externalities. However, the optimal tax is below the urban marginal external costs of car driving and also below an approximated (first-best) corrective Pigouvian tax. On the one hand, according to our assumption, additional fuel tax revenue finances transfer spending and thus recycling fuel tax revenue does not produce efficiency gains.Footnote 8 On the other hand, there are negative interactions of the gasoline tax with the other distortive taxes in the economy (in particular the labor tax) which causes efficiency losses on the economy. Moreover, we also find that increasing the gasoline tax causes redistribution effects via the land market. Then we perform our experiment to examine the spatial differentiation of optimal gasoline taxes. By systematically varying the degree of job decentralization, ceteris paribus, we, first, find that for all cities under consideration, the optimal gasoline tax is higher than the (current) benchmark level of 0.41 $/gallon. Second, optimal local tax levels vary considerably across heterogeneous cities, much more than actual tax rates. In our specific case this means that the optimal gasoline tax rate of a city with a low degree of centrality (associated with e.g. a large spatial expansion of the urban area, long travel distances, high congestion costs, high fuel consumption, low public transit share) is more than 4 times as large as the optimal tax rate in a city with a high degree of centrality. This implies that stronger spatial fuel tax differentiation across cities could raise social welfare. For example, in our setting levying the optimal prototype city tax uniformly in all cities considered allows to realize about 2/3 of the maximum aggregate efficiency gain achievable under spatially efficient fuel tax differentiation. As a consequence, the premium of spatial fuel tax differentiation is around 1/3. Interestingly, we also find that from the perspective of a higher level jurisdiction which is interested in maximizing the sum of the benefits generated in all cities but forced to levy a uniform tax (e.g. due to local regulation), deviating from all local city specific optimal fuel tax levels might be optimal. Setting such an optimal spatially uniform tax is capable to generate a significant fraction of the maximum achievable welfare gain under optimal city specific locally differentiated gasoline taxes (the efficiency premium is less than 1/3). This suggests that the additional benefit from spatial tax differentiation might be relatively small so that an appropriately set uniform (nationwide) gasoline tax likely elicits a large part of the efficiency gains achievable under spatially efficient taxation. The paper proceeds as follows: In Section 2 we present the spatial CGE model. Subsequently, in Section 3 we generate our benchmark prototype urban economy reflecting an urban area with an average degree of job dispersion, discuss parameter values, describe main characteristics of this prototype city and sketch how these characteristics fit to real data. Section 4 then presents the simulation results regarding optimal fuel tax differentiation. Section 5 provides conclusions and implications of the results.",7

Dies begründet sich in der Finanzierung der Personalausgaben über Steuereinnahmen und den mitunter nicht direkt wahrnehmbaren Verwaltungsleistungen. Allerdings sind viele Aufgaben der Verwaltung dem Bereich der Daseinsvorsorge zuzuordnen und stellen daher Pflichtaufgaben dar. Durch das Recht auf Selbstverwaltung können zusätzlich weitere Aufgaben freiwilliger Natur durchgeführt werden. Angesichts der fehlenden Gewinnorientierung, der Finanzierung über Steuereinnahmen sowie der nach außen fehlenden Wahrnehmung stehen Verwaltungen unter einem sehr spezifischen Effizienzdruck. Zumeist wird die Verwaltungseffizienz als einwohnerbereinigter Personalbestand (Stellenintensität) bzw. als einwohnerbereinigte Personalausgaben (Ausgabenintensität) abgebildet. Diese Intensitäten unterscheiden sich regional, was – oberflächlich betrachtet – auf Verwaltungsineffizienzen deutet. Doch stellt sich diesbezüglich die grundlegende Frage, inwiefern eine rein einwohnerbereinigte Stellenintensität bzw. Ausgabenintensität einen geeigneten Vergleichsmaßstab darstellt. Verschiedene Untersuchungen bewerten den Personalbedarf mittels betriebswirtschaftlicher sowie volkswirtschaftlicher Instrumente und ermitteln Stellenintensitäten, die unter anderem von der Einwohnerzahl der betreffenden Regionen abhängig sind.Footnote 1 Daher könnten sowohl permanente als auch temporäre Mehrbedarfe auftreten, die unter Beibehalt der Verwaltungseffizienz einen höheren Personalbestand erforderlich machen. Dies sollte in entsprechenden Kontroversen um den Personalbedarf Berücksichtigung finden. Eine weitere Bedeutung genießen die Mehrbedarfe auf Ebene der Finanzausgleichssysteme. So stellt ein wesentliches Ziel der Finanzausgleichssysteme der Bundesrepublik Deutschland die Wahrung der Einheitlichkeit der Lebensverhältnisse dar.Footnote 2 Dies betrifft insbesondere Pflichtaufgaben, die dem Bereich der öffentlichen Daseinsvorsorge zuzuordnen sind. Somit enthält das Grundgesetz ein zentrales Solidaritätselement, dem unter anderem der Länderfinanzausgleich aber auch die kommunalen Finanzausgleichssysteme unterstehen.Footnote 3 Während der Länderfinanzausgleich für einen Ausgleich der unterschiedlichen Finanzkraft zwischen den Bundesländern sorgt, gleichen die kommunalen Finanzausgleichssysteme die finanzielle Situation der Gemeinden in den jeweiligen Bundesländern an. Über diese zwei Elemente wird eine überregionale Wahrnehmung der Bedarfe bis hin zur kommunalen Ebene gewährleistet und somit den Vorgaben von Art. 107 Abs. 2 GG entsprochen. Gemeinhin sollte unterstellt werden, dass die Ansprüche zur Wahrung einheitlicher Lebensverhältnisse an die notwendigen Ausgaben gekoppelt sind. Die Finanzausgleichssysteme nivellieren jedoch die Steuereinnahmen der Länder bzw. Gemeinden durch die Gegenüberstellung der individuellen Finanzkraft. Dies stellt eine Vereinfachung dar, um die unterschiedlichen Bedürfnisse an die jeweilige Einnahmensituation anzupassen. Dementsprechend wird ein Ausgleich der Einnahmen einem Ausgleich der öffentlichen Ausgaben gleichgestellt. Allerdings steht die Wahrung der Einheitlichkeit der Lebensverhältnisse interregional vor Herausforderungen. So sorgt die zum Teil sehr disperse Siedlungsstruktur Deutschlands für differenzierte Ansprüche an den jeweiligen Ausgleichsbedarf, der eine Einheitlichkeit umzusetzen vermag.Footnote 4 Aus diesem Grund implementieren die Finanzausgleichssysteme die sogenannte Einwohnerveredelung als Instrument zur Internalisierung differenzierter Mehrbedarfe in den Ausgleichsanspruch. Jedoch ist die Anwendung der Einwohnerveredelung höchst umstritten, da zum Teil empirische Grundlagen zur Bemessung der Mehrbedarfe fehlen. Ferner legitimiert das Bundesverfassungsgericht ausgleichsrelevante Mehrbedarfe ausschließlich im Bereich der Pflichtaufgaben.Footnote 5 Der Personalbedarf öffentlicher Verwaltungen genießt jedoch bei der Bestimmung dieser finanzausgleichsrelevanten Mehrbedarfe bisher keine Bedeutung, obgleich durchschnittlich 25 % der kommunalen Ausgaben im Gemeindehaushalt Personalaufwendungen darstellen.Footnote 6 Aus diesem Grund prüft dieser Beitrag die Existenz möglicher Bestimmungsfaktoren, die einen permanenten oder zumindest temporären Mehrbedarf rechtfertigen und somit in die Kontroversen um Effizienzmessungen sowie Finanzausgleichssysteme einfließen sollten. In einem ersten Schritt beinhaltet Kap. 2 wesentliche Vorbetrachtungen, die für die Unterscheidung zwischen kommunalem Kernhaushalt und kommunaler Kernverwaltung notwendig sind. Das Recht auf kommunale Selbstverwaltung bündelt im Kernhaushalt das sowohl mit Pflichtaufgaben als auch mit freiwilligen Aufgaben betraute Personal. Allerdings konzentriert sich dieser Beitrag insbesondere auf finanzausgleichsrelevante Mehrbedarfe und untersucht diesbezüglich den Kernverwaltungsbereich mit der Wahrnehmung zentraler Kerntätigkeiten. Aufgrund des unterschiedlichen Definitionsumfangs sowie der mangelnden Datenverfügbarkeit für die Kernverwaltungen ist eine eigenständige Datenerhebung erarbeitet worden. Hierfür wurden 184 kommunale Stellenpläne von Gemeinden mit bis zu 30.000 Einwohnern analysiert, um den Personalbestand der Kernverwaltung zu selektieren. Die detaillierte Vorgehensweise bei der Erstellung der Datenerhebung erfolgt ebenfalls in Kap. 2. Im anschließenden Kap. 3 wird nochmals konkret auf die Bedeutung der Personalbedarfsermittlung verwiesen. Neben der grundsätzlichen Haushaltsrelevanz der Personalausgaben spielen mögliche Mehrbedarfe insbesondere in den Finanzausgleichssystemen eine wesentliche Rolle. Einen weiteren wichtigen Aspekt stellen temporäre Mehrbedarfe durch Sondereffekte eines überdurchschnittlichen demografischen Wandels dar. Diese unter dem Begriff Demografiesensitivität zusammengefassten Entwicklungen insbesondere strukturschwacher Regionen sind im Bereich des Personalbestandes ebenfalls von Bedeutung. So sind Verwaltungsstellen nur bedingt parallel an die Einwohnerverluste zu koppeln, so dass hierbei das Phänomen von Kostenremanenzen auftreten könnte. Die empirischen Untersuchungen zum Personalbestand der selektierten kommunalen Kernverwaltungen erfolgen in Kap. 4. Diesbezüglich werden verschiedene Bestimmungsfaktoren definiert, die einen möglichen Einfluss auf den mit Pflichtaufgaben betrauten Personalbestand der Kernverwaltung ausüben. Diese Bestimmungsfaktoren umfassen neben regionalen Siedlungsstrukturen weitere kommunale Parameter. Im Anschluss erfolgt eine analoge Untersuchung zur Ausgabenintensität, um den Personalbestand sowohl quantitativ über die Stellenanzahl (Stellenintensität) als auch qualitativ über die Personalausgaben (Ausgabenintensität) zu bewerten. Die Ergebnisse für die Ausgabenintensität werden im Anschluss mittels des Best-Practice Ansatzes einer Effizienzmessung unterzogen. Kap. 5 fasst die wesentlichen Resultate und Schlussfolgerungen des Beitrags kompakt zusammen.",

36,1,Review of Regional Research,13 August 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-015-0102-z,Locations of labor market entry by German university graduates: is (regional) beauty in the eye of the beholder?,February 2016,Guido Buenstorf,Matthias Geissler,Stefan Krabel,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In the 2008 French blockbuster movie Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis, a postal clerk from southern Provence is forced to move to the northernmost part of the country. To him, his new home is not only unbearably cold. It is also inhabited by an uncultivated tribe speaking an incomprehensible idiom. The plot of the movie illustrates a phenomenon found in many countries: natural and (perceived or real) cultural differences restrict inter-regional mobility, allowing economic disparities and labor market imbalances to persist over time. In the present paper, we assess the relevance of several types of regional differences in the location choices made by highly skilled young Germans. Controlling for labor market prospects, graduates’ geographic roots as well as objective differences in natural and economic characteristics, we focus on the similarity of potential destinations to an individual’s home and university regions in terms of cultural boundaries as well as urbanization. The underlying conjecture is that how individuals evaluate regional features depends on the type of region where they were socialized. In this sense, then, regional attractiveness may be in the eye of the beholder, and perceived (un-) attractiveness may reduce inter-regional mobility. Limited inter-regional mobility has substantial economic consequences, which is reflected in substantial economic disparities. For instance, in southern Germany unemployment rates are generally lower, and average wages higher, than in the north. An even more drastic east-west divide is present long after Germany’s reunification. To illustrate: in February 2014 the northeastern region of Vorpommern-Greifswald had an official unemployment rate of 16.1 %, whereas the southern (but also rural) Hohenlohekreis had an unemployment rate of 3.1 % (source: Federal Employment Agency). Regional differences in real wages are likewise substantial. At the level of districts (Landkreise), hourly real wage averages (including social security payments) in 2009 varied from a low of € 17.30 to a high of € 40.60 (Ragnitz 2012).Footnote 1
 Less than perfect mobility is a mixed blessing for regional policy makers. On the one hand it may lead to inefficiencies in the allocation of labor across regions, as individuals do not exploit all opportunities for efficiency-enhancing moves. Attracting human capital from other regions is considerably more complicated if individuals put more weight on non-monetary considerations. On the other hand limited mobility also reduces the outflow of indigenous population members, thus increasing the regional payoff from human capital formation (Justman and Thisse 1997). Put more simply: depending on how mobile workers are, policy makers seeking to enlarge the regional stock of human capital may want to focus more on attracting workers from other regions or on educating indigenous students (e.g., by subsidizing regional universities or handing out scholarships to students who attend a university in their home region). The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of location decisions made by highly skilled individuals. To this purpose, we study geographic patterns of labor market entry (at the level of German planning regions or Raumordnungsregionen (ROR)) for graduates of German universities who start their first job. We focus on this group of individuals for four reasons. First, based on prior findings from several countries (e.g., Bound et al. 2004; Groen 2004; Arntz 2010; Abel and Deitz 2012; Venhorst 2013), we expect these young and highly educated people to be among the most geographically mobile members of the labor force. Second, university graduates are required to make a decision as to whether and, most importantly for our purposes, where to enter into employment. Since all graduates have to make this decision, self-selection into job mobility is less concerning for this group than for alternative samples such as employees who voluntarily choose (not) to switch between jobs (Dahl and Sorenson 2010). Third, labor market entry of university graduates is considered a relevant channel of knowledge transfer from public research to the private sector (Cohen et al. 2002). Mobility of university graduates is therefore of substantial economic relevance. Fourth, unusually rich information is available from graduate surveys. For the present paper, we utilize information for over 27,000 graduates leaving 44 German universities in the time period 2007–2009. We find that roughly half of the graduates enter the labor market in the university region or return to their home region. Controlling for employment prospects and other regional characteristics, graduates locating outside these two regions are more likely to move to regions resembling their home region in terms of settlement structure and dialect zone. We interpret this as evidence that graduates have a strong desire to work in regions similar to those where they originally grew up. In contrast, cultural similarity to the university region is apparently less relevant to graduates, suggesting that different factors influence temporary (university region) vs. more long-term (employment region) location choices. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we present earlier findings on individual mobility and motivate our own empirical analysis. Section 3 develops the conceptual framework underlying the study. Section 4 introduces the data, and Section 5 presents the empirical results. Section 6 concludes with a discussion of findings.",29

Jones,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"With local budget constraints in the United States becoming politically tighter and constituent opposition to property tax increases, state and local governments are considering alternative methods to raise revenues. These alternatives include various fees, grants, sales taxes, public/private partnerships, and special taxing districts; gasoline taxes, development impact fees, and sales taxes are often given special consideration for infrastructure funding. This paper compares household welfare under different financing regimes, for infrastructure required to support commercial development, in the context of Salop’s (1979) circular city model. Currently, only a small number of US jurisdictions have local fuel taxes but political pressure for state legislatures to expand the options available to local governments is growing (Barnett 2012; Brunori 2009; Wear 2009). Development impact fees are also increasing in popularity with over half the states having adopted impact fee enabling legislation specifically authorizing local governments to use fees and providing legal guidelines for structuring the fee system. Local sales tax authority varies across states but it is not hard to imagine a local sales tax earmarked for infrastructure construction. Many states already allow similar taxes including Georgia, Missouri, Colorado, etc. Despite the popularity of these alternatives with policy makers, the literature examining their effects and comparing alternatives is relatively thin. A development impact fee is a one time fee charged to a developer, usually at the time of building permit issuance, with revenues earmarked to construct infrastructure needed to offset the development’s impact on existing levels of service. The fees generally cannot be used for operational expenditures and can only be used to construct new infrastructure. Fees evolved from a politically controversial and inherently uncertain system of exactions, donations of land or on-site improvements from a developer to a jurisdiction in exchange for development approval. However, the system of exactions left local political leaders exposed to criticism of insufficient extractions from developers and left developers with highly uncertain permit costs. Exactions are also limited in that land donated by the developer is often not where the improvements need to be made, i.e. an adversely affected intersection may not be adjacent to a development. For these reasons, a fixed system of predetermined fees evolved (Altshuler et al. 1993). Theoretical work such as Anderson (2004) examines fees as a pigouvian tax on congestion and open-space reduction and Brueckner (1997), using a monocentric model, compares fees to sharing the costs among land owners; both find fees to be an efficient way to finance infrastructure. Jones and Snow (2015) find a system of fees to be preferable to a property tax but do not consider other alterntives. Early empirical work on fees often viewed fees as a tax on development. Ihlanfeldt and Shaughnessy (2004) considered a “new view” of fees suggesting that fees provide infrastructure services in return for the charge and should be considered as an input cost in development models. Their view also suggested fees could have a positive effect on price, possibly larger than the fee as additional infrastructure services are priced in by the demand side. This paper compares household welfare under a system of property taxes to pay for commercial infrastructure to other financing options available to local governments: mileage taxes, impact fees, and sales taxes.Footnote 1
 Gasoline taxes are often described as Pigouvian taxes and politically justified as a way to pay for infrastructure and force drivers to internalize externalities such as congestion and pollution. Furthermore, discussion about increasing fuel taxes is a constant, albeit politically unpopular, topic of discussion in state capitals, county seats, and mayoral offices around the country. While a gas tax may be an appropriate and efficient financing mechanism for the maintenance of existing infrastructure, the mileage tax model in this analysis suggests a similar gas tax may not be the most economically efficient policy for financing the construction of new infrastructure. In the environmental literature there are several effects of a Pigouvian tax, a welfare gain from increased environmental quality, a welfare gain from revenue recycling—typically a reduction in labor taxes—and a welfare loss due to the reduced real wage resulting from taxes being passed along as higher prices (Parry and Oates 2000). The model used in this analysis includes two potentially opposing effects as well, changes in the price level and changes in transportation costs due to congestion or travel distance. Much of the existing economics literature focuses on the appropriate size of a Pigouvian gas tax for congestion, pollution, and accidents including Bento et al. (2005) and Parry and Small (2005). Work such as Verhoef’s (2005) using a monocentric model with endogenous household distributions and land markets finds congestion pricing schemes to be second-best efficient and other studies, such as Tscharaktschiew’s (2010) examining German gasoline taxes, Parry and Timilsina’s (2010) for Mexico City, or Parry’s (2011) for the US, find an optimal gasoline tax considerably larger than existing taxes. Similar studies assume that revenues are rebated to households through a reduction in income taxes, lump sum rebates, or another rebate mechanism. Revenues in the model presented below are assumed to be rebated in the form of additional infrastructure. As demonstrated by the fiscal effects considered in the papers mentioned earlier, an examination of revenue mechanism efficiency requires consideration of revenue expenditures in conjunction with the revenue source. For example, spending mileage tax revenue on infrastructure to serve commercial development subsidizes firms by assigning infrastructure costs directly to households. Furthermore, the tax also increases firms’ revenues by increasing transport costs captured by the firms in the form of higher prices. The mileage tax acts to reduce competition between firms. In a market with no barrier to entry and zero profits, increases in firm revenue cause additional firms to enter the market increasing total social costs. The importance of considering revenue recycling mechanisms has been well documented in the economics literature including Parry and Oates (2000), Bento et al. (2005), Snow and Warren (1996) and several others. Other topics in the literature include the incidence of the gasoline tax including Poterba’s (1991) finding that the gas tax is less regressive than previously thought and Newbery’s (1990) suggestion that commercial transport, an intermediate input, should be charged under a system analogous to a user fee instead of taxing criteria. The model presented in this paper focuses on the efficiency of financing infrastructure to serve commercial development under various systems including property taxes, mileage taxes, impact fees, and sales taxes. The model suggests the use of a development impact fee system is preferable to the alternatives, a result consistent with Bento et al.’s (2006) result that development taxes are the most efficient and effective anti-sprawl policies. In addition, the analysis below supports the Lipsey and Lancaster (1956) result that removing a market distortion can be detrimental to welfare by increasing other distortions. For example, a mileage tax used to fund infrastructure improvements for commercial firms: increases the cost of driving, the number and dispersion of firms, and subsequent social costs. One social cost has been removed while others increased. The following section presents the structure of the model under property tax financing and subsequent subsections analyze the alternatives, while the final section provides some conclusions.",

The key elements of the NGT (i.e. human capital and innovation) and the NEG theory (i.e. agglomeration economies) integrate traditional Barro-type empirical models of regional growth (Barro 1991) in which a large amount of regional growth was left unexplained by the estimated 2 % speed of convergence (Martin and Sunley 1998). The endogenous potential of regional development has also been the subject of focus in academic and policy debates regarding regional intervention (Barca et al. 2012). Such debates have been shaped by a set of influential reports, the most important of which include: the World Bank’s 2009 World Development Report (WDR), where traditional spatially-blinded policies are advocated; two OECD reports (OECD 2009a, 2009b); and the Barca Report (Barca 2009), which suggests the importance of place-based approaches to regional development. According to Barca et al. (2012), development policies have been primarily aimed at the provision of important infrastructures, regardless of their effective impact on territorial development. While such spatially-blinded policies have, in fact, promoted agglomeration and development in their respective regions; at the same time, they have caused marginalisation in more peripheral areas. Conversely, a place-based approach to regional policy is based on careful consideration of territory-specific resources and needs and focuses on the interaction between geography and institutions. Advocates of the place-based approach argue that agglomeration per se is neither necessary nor sufficient for growth (Garcilazo et al. (2010), and growth based on agglomeration is most likely unsustainable in the long run (Thissen and Van Oort 2010). Thus, regional policy should work to exploit the endogenous potential by unveiling local externalities such as those related to local human capital and local innovation. The reduction of economic and social disparities within the European Union (EU) was explicitly set as a goal in the European Treaty (Article 174). However, there has been widespread agreement among academics that policies aimed at reducing inequalities may hamper efficiency and ultimately, economic growth (Thissen and Van Oort 2010). The WDR (World Bank 2009) substantially shares this view, arguing that economic development will naturally be spatially unbalanced and that policies should not influence the relocation of firms in less developed areas, but should promote integration (Gill 2010). In fact, the aim of the EU regional policy is not that of reducing disparities by re-equilibrating production and income but that of providing place-specific answers to place-specific problems. In particular, this is achieved by removing the obstacles and creating favourable conditions for smart growth (European Commission 2010). In regard to this objective, the successful implementation of the EU regional policy requires careful consideration of two specific issues. First, the origins of spatial externalities and their contributions to economic development at the EU regional level need to be identified to determine the precise role of agglomeration economies in relation to other endogenous growth factors. According to the view expressed in the WDR (World Bank 2009), agglomeration is, in fact, the primary driver of economic development, triggered by urbanisation economies in large and diversified cities and by localisation economies in small- and medium-sized specialised cities (Gill 2010). Therefore, spatially blinded institutions and spatially connective infrastructures might help spread externalities to the benefit of all people (Deichmann et al. 2011). Second, concerning externalities not related to agglomeration, it is crucial to target regions where policy support is most needed due to structural barriers preventing and possibly impeding the genesis and propagation of such externalities. Despite the numerous discussions involved in this policy debate, which is evidenced by the considerable number of journal articles published after the WDR, the OECD publications and the Barca Report (Buckley and Buckley 2009; Farole et al. 2011; Harvey 2009; Maringanti et al. 2009; Rigg et al. 2009; Rodríguez-Pose 2010), minimal attention has been given to related empirical analyses. Therefore, this study analyses the origins of EU regional growth between 1995 and 2007 and emphasises the role of externalities mediated by agglomeration economies in addition to human capital and innovative activities. This study aims to ascertain the real contributions of agglomeration to overall regional growth by considering the varying nature of endogenous growth. For this purpose, a standard cross-regional Barro-type regression is extended by including proxy variables that are expected to indicate the contributions of agglomeration, innovation and human capital. As the primary goal is to study regional growth, the year 2007 (which marks the beginning of the financial crisis and the subsequent recession in many countries and regions) is selected as the last year of observation. Following a consolidated literature in regional growth, spatial externalities and spillovers are properly considered in the empirical model. Finally, semi-parametric estimators are employed to disentangle non-linear and threshold effects that characterise the relationship between growth on the one hand, and agglomeration, knowledge in the economy and innovation on the other hand. The results can be summarised in the following three points. First, the evidence corroborates previous empirical results, indicating that regional growth in Europe is characterised by a convergence process. However, various regions converge at different speeds and toward different steady states. For example, a faster speed of convergence is generally found in less-developed regions. Second, the growth-agglomeration relationship displays an inverse U-shaped curve, which indicates that the effect of agglomeration on regional development is not always positive and, in some circumstances, agglomeration might even be undesirable. Conversely, the effect of human capital on regional growth exhibits quasi-linear effects as it becomes considerably larger after a given threshold. Third, in the case of innovation, the findings suggest that investments in regional innovative capacity translate into either beneficial growth when a region’s technological gap is high or uncertainty in regions that are already leaders in innovation. These results have important policy implications. Beyond empirically demonstrating that agglomeration per se is neither necessary nor sufficient for regional growth, at least when accounting for other potential endogenous factors of regional growth, the evidence suggests that regional policy intervention might be crucial in helping the least-developed regions technologically catch up with other regions. In absence of such regional intervention, these regions will most likely remain marginalised by the smart development process that wealthier EU regions are already experiencing. The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. The next section examines the theoretical and empirical literature related to externalities in regional growth. The third section describes the dataset while the fourth section discusses the empirical specifications of the model in detail and summarises the results. The final section concludes the paper and provides several policy implications.",14
36,2,Review of Regional Research,06 April 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-016-0106-3,Unemployment decline in East Germany: the role of demography,October 2016,Michaela Fuchs,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Many European regions are challenged by profound demographic changes that manifest themselves in the decline and aging of the population (Giannakouris 2010; Rees et al. 2012). East Germany is among those regions that have been most severely hit by these processes. Major reasons are the drop in the East German fertility rates by about half directly after German reunification in 1990 (Goldstein and Kreyenfeld 2011) and the large migration flows mainly to West Germany. Since population aging is likely to exacerbate in the next decades throughout Europe, East Germany can be regarded as a forerunner in how to cope with the implications of demographic change in many socioeconomic respects. As concerns the implications for the labor market, demographic change foremost alters labor supply via the decline and the aging of the population of working age, i. e., between 15 and 64 years. In East Germany, the working-age population declined from 12.1 million in the year 1996 to 10.3 million in 2014. This implies a decrease of 14.9%, whereas at the same time West Germany experienced a decrease of only 1.0%. The vastly reduced number of young people has contributed much to this development. From 2005 on, the small cohorts born around 1990 entered working age, which lead to a drop in the youth share that relates the number of inhabitants aged 15–24 years to those aged 15–64 years from 18.9% in 2004 to 12.4% in 2014. The aging process of the workforce intensified at around the same time when unemployment in East Germany started declining. After many years with severe problems on the labor market, the unemployment rate more than halved from 20% in 2005 to 8% in 2014. During this period, the labor force participation increased. Moreover, substantial labor market reforms were started in Germany that have further spurred employment. Given these divergent developments, the question arises if and to what extent demographic change has contributed to the declining unemployment rate in East Germany. An answer to this question is of high relevance not only for science but also for politics. This paper scrutinizes the role of demography for the decline of unemployment in East Germany and to this end draws on the concepts of the cohort crowding literature. As to the central cohort crowding hypothesis, Easterlin 1961 argues that workers are worse off on the labor market if they belong to larger cohorts. In particular, members of baby-boom cohorts have a higher risk of becoming unemployed after labor market entry if labor demand does not rise in the same amount as labor supply. Shimer 2001, on the other hand, makes an argument against this mechanism by modelling how enterprises have an incentive to create even more jobs in regions with large labor market entry cohorts. Since empirical evidence does not provide a clear answer to the theoretical dispute (Biagi and Lucifora 2008), the relation between demography and unemployment remains open a priori. Applying Easterlin’s cohort crowding argument to the case of East Germany gives rise to the hypothesis that shrinking cohort sizes lead to a decrease in unemployment. I analyze this relation by adopting both a direct and an indirect approach for the years from 1996 to 2014. The direct approach statistically answers the question to which extent changes in the unemployment rate can be ascribed to changes in the composition of the work force. To this, the unemployment rate is decomposed into three components considering changes in the workforce’s age structure, labor market participation and age-specific unemployment rates (Flaim 1979). The indirect approach to the impact of a declining youth share on unemployment, in contrast, involves econometric methods in order to estimate the partial correlation between indicators of demography and labor market performance over time (Shimer 2001). The analysis contributes to the existing literature on the impact of demographic change on unemployment in three ways. First, I explicitly incorporate spatial dimensions in demographic processes, as postulated by Matthews and Parker 2013. I apply advanced spatial panel model techniques that allow for interactions between regions with respect to their demographic and labor market situation. This way, the large disparities between the single regions within East Germany are explicitly taken into account. Second, I take a broad view on the impact of aging on unemployment by capturing both ends of the population aging process. As argued by Easterlin 1961, when the size of labor market entry cohorts decreases, enterprises will have to increasingly recruit among the unemployed in order to meet a constant labor demand. Another adjustment mechanism might well work through the recruitment of older workers, whose share of the total population as well as whose labor force participation has moreover risen over time. Hence, I not only consider the relation between the youth share and unemployment as usually done in the literature, but also the link between the old-age share and unemployment. Third, to the best of the author’s knowledge this is the first comprehensive study on the link between aging and unemployment for East Germany. Studies on Germany have so far mainly dealt with West Germany (Zimmermann 1991; Garloff et al. 2013), where the demographic and labor market developments have remained far beyond those in East Germany. Since East and West Germany share the same legal and political institutions, a comparison of both parts of the country can prove very instructive as to the consequences of population processes for the labor market. The central findings confirm the existence of close ties between demography and unemployment, working through both the decreasing youth share and the increasing old-age share. The results provide sound evidence for a negative cohort crowding process in East Germany in that aging is closely associated with unemployment decline. I furthermore find distinct spatial interdependencies within East Germany that have changed profoundly over time. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Chapter 2 gives an overview of theoretical approaches on the influence of demographic change on unemployment and summarizes central empirical findings. In chapter 3, the data and variables used for the empirical analyses are presented, and chapter 4 provides descriptive evidence on the East German case. The direct approach to aging on unemployment is at the center of chapter 5. I discuss the regression results of the indirect approach in chapter 6, and chapter 7 concludes.",6
36,2,Review of Regional Research,07 March 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-016-0105-4,Regional industrial diversification: evidence from German gross value added,October 2016,Kurt A. Hafner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It is widely believed that the enlargement of the EU to 28 countries through integration of Central and Eastern European countries in May 2004, Bulgaria and Rumania in January 2007 and Croatia in January 2013 is likely to increase the degree of specialization by country and therefore the heterogeneity within the EU. Industry portfolios of individual European countries will become more specialized and production will move to countries with a comparative advantage in the production of certain goods and services. EU member countries—especially those joining the European monetary union—have become less alike in their reaction to asymmetric shocks. While many countries of the EU-periphery have had to face remarkable macroeconomic turbulence since the Eurozone crisis in 2009, recent economic growth rates in EU-core countries like Germany have been relatively high. Consequently, the volatility of economic growth rates for the EU and across EU countries has grown in recent years.Footnote 1 In pursuit of economic growth and stability, regional industrial diversification within the EU raise the region’s income and stabilization potential from gross value added shares of economic activities of its industry mix. The idea of this paper is to apply modern portfolio theory to gross value added shares of different economic activities, using the example of Germany’s federal states to determine whether their industry portfolios are efficient. Footnote 2 The objective is not to produce a set of policy recommendations for adjusting industrial portfolios or weighing the social costs of structural changes against the potential gains based on any long-term forecasts. Instead, the paper focuses on the methodology for showing how combinations of economic activities lead to efficient industry portfolios regardless of the country’s current state or path dependency. If current industry portfolios turn out to be inefficient, states could be able to increase their total gross value added and decrease the risk by rearranging the shares of economic activities and thus their industry structure. Referring to the modern portfolio theory developed by Markowitz (1952) and Sharpe (1963), efficient portfolios are usually obtained by asset diversification. Efficient portfolios then define the efficient frontier according to which investors can choose their optimal positions. Non-efficient portfolios below the efficient frontier, however, can be rearranged by shifting investments to a lower risk with the same yield or to a higher yield with the same risk, and therefore to the efficient frontier. Accordingly, the systematic risk of a portfolio can be minimized and its yield maximized through strategic selection of different types of assets in various industries, regions and currencies. Hence, modern portfolio theory, when applied to economic activities and their gross value added shares, should be able to determine whether the industry portfolios of German federal states are efficient. The early works of Conroy (1974, 1975) followed by Barth et al. (1975) were the first to apply financial portfolio theory to a regional economic context and to address the relationship between industrial portfolio and regional stability in pursuit of economic growth. According to Conroy (1974), industrial diversification is generally approached in terms of employment stability across industries, where regional instability in aggregate income can be reduced by forming optimal industrial portfolios if one accepts portfolio variance as a measure of instability. By defining upper and lower bounds for industries’ employment share, Conroy (1974) discusses efficiency gains associated with reduced instability through diversification. Barth et al. (1975) focus on how to attract new industries or expand existing ones to reduce regional fluctuation in the context of an optimal industrial mix. They conclude that some industries may bring negative externalities and are thus less suitable for regions, so these should not be part of the industrial portfolio despite the potential gains from reducing its employment risk. Subsequent works by Board and Sutcliffe (1991) and Lande (1994), among others, choose a more policy-oriented context for regional industrial diversification. Specifically, Board and Sutcliffe (1991) argue that resources available to policy makers are limited and thus restructuring industrial portfolios is costly (and limited as well). They assume a cost function for the expansion (or contraction) of economic activities to account for limited resources and follow Conroy (1974) by setting upper and lower bounds on the level of operation of economic activity. Using the example of tourist industry in six regions in Spain, they find that the lower the restrictions on the efficiency frontier, the greater the efficiency gains in terms of increasing income. Lande (1994) measures regional industrial diversification with respect to employment data for the US economy and selected states, and identifies stabilizing sectors with the potential to reduce employment volatility and to increase employment growth. Siegel et al. (1995) shift the focus to the interdependence between sectors of an economy and their impact on growth and instability. Predictions from the portfolio theory if applied to regional industrial diversification indicate the existence of a convex growth-instability frontier. Chandra (2002, 2003) tests the growth-instability frontier by using US state data and regional growth data from Europe. Both papers confirm the existence of a convex growth-instability frontier in the regional context, at least at a more aggregated level of regions. While Chandra (2002) provides evidence for the portfolio approach to economic growth as economic instability correlates negatively with measures of economic diversity for the US-states, Chandra (2003) shows that large European economies have a convex growth-instability frontier and can be modeled as portfolios. Bigerna (2013) finds similar relationships of a growth-instability frontier at a regional level for Italy. Ramey and Ramey (1995) and Ezcurra and Rios (2015), among others, have debated whether output volatility and growth correlate negatively and therefore whether industrial diversification in fact leads to higher income and greater stability. Ramey and Ramey (1995) present cross-country evidence on the negative link between output volatility and growth for 90 countries from 1960 to 1985, where countries with higher volatility have lower growth rates. Using a sample of 272 European regions from 1991 to 2011, the analysis by Ezcurra and Rios (2015) shows the same negative correlation using spatial econometric techniques. In a previous work, Ezcurra (2011) concludes that higher (employment) volatility correlates positively to regional specialization in the EU during 1980–2004. By the use of stochastic frontier estimation, Kluge (2015) finds that more diversified German regions/districts are closer to their efficient frontier—i.e. that gross value added growth rates relates closely to greater stability. In applying modern portfolio theory to regional industrial diversification in Germany, I use the gross value added shares from the national accounts (Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnung) of the federal states of Germany. I run numerical simulations of the economic activity gross value added shares and their risk-return characteristics to determine a set of theoretically possible industry portfolios, where only “efficient mean-variance combinations” of economic activities according to Markowitz (1952) qualify for the efficient frontiers for the federal states’ industry structure. I define economic activities’ return and risk by the mean of price-adjusted growth rates in 1992–2013 and their standard deviation. Using economic activities’ 2011 gross valued added shares, I analyze first whether the 2011 industry structure of Germany’s federal states is efficient according to modern portfolio theory. Finding that it is not, I then investigate how inefficient industry portfolios can be shifted to the efficient frontier by rearranging the shares of their economic activities and what the optimal portfolios look like. As mean growth rates and standard deviations are sensitive to the sample and its period, I validate the numerical results by using different sample periods of Germany’s national accounts. Finally, I use a sample of EU-countries within the last 20 years to confirm the assumptions underlying the numerical simulations and to underscore the main results of the paper. Hence, this paper’s contribution to the literature is that it shows how combinations of economic activities lead to efficient industry portfolios for German federal states and discusses their efficiency gains in terms of higher income and stability gains. Testing the robustness of numerical results, this study underlines the usefulness of the modern portfolio approach to regional industrial diversification not just as a theoretical framework (see Chandra 2003). The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 outlines the theoretical framework of modern portfolio theory and its limitations when applied to regional industrial diversification. Descriptive statistics on 2011 gross value added among German federal states and their industry portfolios are given in Sect. 3. Section 4 discusses the findings of numerical simulations. Section 5 validates the robustness of the numerical results with a critical analysis of the underlying assumptions. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Sect. 5.",6

37,1,Review of Regional Research,03 January 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-016-0111-6,The emergence of entrepreneurial ideas at universities in times of demographic change: evidence from Germany,February 2017,Matthias Piontek,Michael Wyrwich,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The importance of technology transfer within universities has risen significantly in recent decades and is now an essential part of the university task profile (e. g., Etzkowitz 2003; Jaeger and Kopper 2014; Kalar and Antoncic 2015). There is a growing body of literature on entrepreneurship and research commercialization at institutions of higher education. We know from this research that several structural characteristics of universities and regional economic conditions determine the emergence of spin-off companies (Rothaermel et al. 2007; Astebro and Bazzazian 2011 for reviews). Furthermore, the fact that start-ups often settle in close proximity to the university (e. g., Heblich and Slavtchev 2014) makes these institutions important actors in regional development. Knowledge intensive start-ups, in particular, have the capability to create jobs and enhance the potential for regional innovation (e. g., Segal 1986; Feldman and Francis 2003). There is no previous work on the role of demographic change for university entrepreneurship. This is quite surprising since regions are confronted with different challenges caused by demographic change, and since both entrepreneurship (Fritsch 2013) and local age structure (Brunow and Hirte 2006) can be crucial drivers of regional growth. The regional context and its influence on entrepreneurship had been analyzed for both urban and rural regions (e. g., Babb and Babb 1992; Malecki 2003; Ragnitz 2009; Smallbone 2009; Delfmann et al. 2014; Freire-Gibb and Nielsen 2014; Hesse 2014, 2015; Bergmann et al. 2016) and for small and large communities (Bauernschuster et al. 2010). Most of these studies discuss demographic change by distinguishing between urban and rural regions only. Fritsch and Piontek (2015, p. 359) found that, on average, the population in urban regions increased and in rural regions decreased, but outliers can be found in either region. This suggests that demographic change should be analyzed separately while accounting for the general urban and rural context as well. Therefore, this paper examines the role of an aging regional population for university entrepreneurship. We think that it is important to understand whether and how demographic challenges faced by many developed countries impacts on knowledge-intensive start-up activities such as university spin-offs. We begin by assuming that there are less university start-ups in regions that struggle with demographic change. Ragnitz (2009, p. 20) offers several reasons for why demographic change influences the economic development of a region. He cites reduced regional demand for goods, diminished supply of labor, and an ageing workforce. All of these factors may cause a decrease in productivity. Furthermore, communities with a high population share of older people tend to be less attractive for new companies. He concludes that a shrinking and ageing population can affect the number of business start-ups in a region. We also analyze and discuss the question of whether or not demographic change might have a positive effect on university start-ups. We are interested in discovering how university research and technology transfer offices perceive the impact of demographic change on founding activities. Are these offices aware of the change at all? If so, do they perceive the change negatively or positively? It is our belief that the nature of the perception of a region’s demographic situation could have a significantly positive influence on the recognition of business ideas, e. g. a growing market of older customers (Ragnitz 2009; Delfmann et al. 2014; Gregory and Patuelli 2015). To the best of our knowledge, there is only sparse research on how demographic change impacts university entrepreneurship and the emergence of entrepreneurial ideas. In a recent paper, Kohlbacher et al. (2014) investigate the recognition and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities related to the growing share of the “silver” market (i. e. the market targeting older people). The authors analyze six case studies mainly based on qualitative interviews with entrepreneurs and managers from well established companies introducing new products and services. They show the crucial role of context for the recognition and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities. A paper, by Gregory and Patuelli (2015), shows a strong connection between the location of innovation hubs and local age structure. The authors analyze the how the age structure of the workforce affects innovation output for specific regions in Germany by conducting an exploratory space-time data analysis. They conclude that innovation hubs tend to be located in areas with favorable demographic age structures. Bergmann et al. (2016) analyze the contextual relevance of universities and specific regions for student start-ups. Using micro data developed from business and economics students at 41 European universities, they differentiate between new entrepreneurs and nascent entrepreneurs. Their results suggest that nascent entrepreneurs are affected by the university context, at least to some extent, by the regional context. In contrast to Kohlbacher et al. (2014), we focus on a quantitative approach and underpin our findings with insights from expert interviews with university staff responsible for promoting technology transfer. In contrast to Bergmann et al. (2016), who analyze only business and economics students, we include staff, students, and alumni drawn from a variety of academic disciplines. In the quantitative analysis, we investigate the relationship between the regional age structure and the regional distribution of EXIST Business start-up grants at German institutions of higher education. We differentiate between grants obtained for a business idea based on demographic change and other grants. In the second part, we discuss the results of our interviews conducted in six German case study regions. Our interview subjects are university members responsible for technology transfer and entrepreneurial activities at their universities. The interviews were designed to provide us with a general overview of the university’s founding activities, and personal opinions about the influence of demographic change on the university’s assisted projects, in particular. The results of the quantitative assessment show that, in general, the number of start-ups, and in particular, those start-ups not related to demographic change are negatively influenced by high shares of older people in the region where the university is located. There is, furthermore, no positive relationship between demographic change and the number of start-ups with a business idea based on demographic change. The results of the quantitative analysis indicate that the potential for developing ideas based on demographic changes is not utilized, or perhaps not even noticed, in demographically challenged regions. The results of the quantitative assessment are confirmed by the content of our interviews. Demographic change is neither noticed as a potential driver for business ideas, nor as a problem. The remainder of this paper is as follows: In Chapter 2 we develop a conceptual framework before introducing the empirical data set and quantitative analysis in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 presents and examines the expert interviews. The final chapter summarizes the fundamental results and discusses policy recommendations.",5

The high increase in unemployment during the recent economic downturn is a clear example of the great variability of the unemployment rate. Since 2008, in just six years the unemployment rate has more than tripled, accounting in 2013 for 26% of the active population. However, this phenomenon is not confined to recession periods. Before this economic crisis, the Spanish economy experienced a continuous growth from middle nineties, reducing unemployment rates from 20% of the labour force to levels slightly above the European average, which was around 7% of the active population. Thus, as Fig. 1 shows, the economic cycles in Spain have their counterpart in the unemployment rate. In Fig. 1b, it is clearly observed the opposite pattern for first differenced GDP and unemployment rate whereas labour force participation remains much more stable to economic fluctuations. This indicates that unemployment rate mostly absorbs the effect of GDP variations. Descriptives Nevertheless, the sensitivity of unemployment rates to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shifts is not the same for all regions. Villaverde and Maza (2009) found that while a great unemployment response to changes in the economic cycle is observed in some autonomous communities (NUTS 2), in others the unemployment rate varies to a much lesser extent. However, the analysis for autonomous communities could be hiding certain patterns due to the great internal heterogeneity they show. Autonomous communities internally differ in their levels of economic activity, labour force participation and industrial structure which may result in unemployment response disparities. In this regard, the provincial approach (NUTS 3) implies a more thorough and rigorous analysis that clarifies the patterns and differences in unemployment sensitivity to economic variations. Besides, it is important to consider provinces because they prove to be the regional units that are closer to the concept of local labour markets and this is the territorial dimension that really matters to firms and workers. The aim of this paper is to analyse the provincial differences in the response of unemployment rates to economic variations. In order to do so, we resort to the commonly known Okun’s law, which is an empirical relationship relating unemployment to GDP. The initial statement of this law (Okun 1962) supposes that a 3% of increase in output corresponds to a 1% of decline in the rate of unemployment. However, a more recent literature review shows that authors agree to accept the negative sign of the Okun’s coefficient but it is generally obtained that the value of this coefficient varies over time and among countries. In our analysis, we aim to observe the effect of economic growth on unemployment for all Spanish provinces. In order to do so, we consider the difference version of Okun’s law and then, the analysis is complemented with the use of VAR and panel VAR models to check the robustness of the results obtained from the difference specification in a framework that takes into account the endogeneity of GDP and unemployment. Our results show that there are great differences among provinces in the sensitivity of unemployment to variations in economic conditions. The analysis of the underlying causes behind the provincial heterogeneity points towards a higher unemployment response in the provinces that show less diversified economies, a more developed services sector and higher rates of labour participation. One of the contributions of this work concerns the consideration of a provincial approach. Provincial analyses have not been carried out previously in studies examining Okun’s law for Spain and, to the best of our knowledge; we find that Spanish autonomous communities are internally heterogeneous in the unemployment response to economic variations. The second contribution is to analyse the relationship between GDP and unemployment through VAR and panel VAR techniques, which have not yet been applied at the Spanish provincial level. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we briefly gather the contributions to Okun’s law, including specific analysis for Spain. In section 3, we describe our methodology and in section 4, we present our main results. Finally, section 5 concludes.",16

However, as remarked by Hülshorst and Wellisch (1996, pp. 387–388), massive land rent taxation seems institutionally infeasible in many countries. The question therefore arises whether an efficient allocation can be achieved by taxing capital income instead of land rents. Our first result (Theorem 1 in Sect. 5) states that in general labor and capital income taxes do not suffice to achieve efficiency, but that they do suffice if the federation consists of two types of regions (e.g. large and small, or urban and rural regions) such that the regions of each type are identical to each other. Of course, many federations consist of more than two types of regions, so that according to our first result labor and capital taxes do not suffice to achieve efficiency in general. We therefore study the resulting second-best problem and obtain the following result on the second-best optimum (Theorem 2 in Sect. 6): Given the allocation of labor and capital the level of public good provision is efficient in all regions, but in general neither capital nor labor is allocated efficiently. Similar results were obtained by Hülshorst and Wellisch (1996, Proposition 4) and Wellisch and Hülshorst (2000, Proposition 4).Footnote 2 These authors assumed that regions are so small that each local government takes the federation-wide utility level as exogenously given. Since in this case utility maximization is not a sensible objective, they assumed instead that each local government maximizes the land rent in its own region. In the present paper we drop the assumption that regions are small and can therefore base our analysis on the more natural assumption that local governments maximize utility.Footnote 3

This insight is anything but new, as countless studies demonstrate the positive impact of universities on their regional environment. To some extent this is hardly surprising. For centuries governments all over Europe, and also in other parts of the world, have funded existing universities and initiated the establishment of new ones. This support was often linked to useful university outputs. For instance, educating civil servants constituted one of the earliest tasks of European universities, and 19th century technical universities were primarily established to safeguard the supply of human capital for the emerging science-based industries (Hüther and Krücken 2016). Systematic empirical research into the effects of universities on their host regions likewise has a long tradition. Initially, much of this research focused on how the expenditures of universities, faculty, staff and students affect their host regions through direct and indirect “demand-side” effects of consumption and investment. Time and again, researchers estimated these effects to be substantial (cf. Drucker and Goldstein 2007, for a survey). It is similarly well-established that universities exert “supply-side” effects through the production of graduates (Stephan 2012). More recently the scholarly interest in universities’ supply-side effects shifted from graduates to innovation and entrepreneurship. Underlying this shift are an enhanced societal interest in universities as knowledge providers as well as the observation that the impact of universities on private-sector innovation tends to be localized. Case study evidence supporting the notion of universities as important players in regional innovation systems abounds. Many observers have noted the role that Stanford University, and also UC Berkeley, played in Silicon Valley’s ascent to become the global center of the computer industry and related high-tech activities (e. g., Kenney and Mowery 2014; Klepper 2016). As documented by Powell et al. (2012), university research and academic entrepreneurship were perhaps even more decisive in the emergence and evolution of U.S. biotechnology clusters, and similar observations have been made elsewhere. Moving from individual cases to a more aggregate econometric approach, the impact of university research on regional innovation was shown in numerous empirical contexts including, e. g., the U.S. (Jaffe 1989; Acs et al. 1992), Germany (Fritsch and Slavtchev 2007; Schubert and Kroll 2014), or Italy (Cowan and Zinovyeva 2013). These findings are corroborated at a global scale by Valero and Van Reenen (2016), and many other references could be provided. Why then this special issue, if so much has already been written about the regional effects of universities? Put simply, the answer is: because new challenges to universities and society at large generate new questions for research. Particularly in continental Europe, both the university itself and societal expectations regarding its activities and outputs have changed drastically in the past decades. Whereas European universities tended to be loosely coupled assemblies of experts dominated by professorial self-governance, they increasingly have been transformed into strategically managed organizations that pursue organizational objectives and compete with one another (Hüther and Krücken 2016). This development is associated with, and reinforced by, policy makers’ quests to ensure that public universities contribute to societal goals as best they can. To this end, the efficiency of universities is targeted by New Public Management (e. g., Vogel 2006), and knowledge transfer to the private sector has been established as universities’ “third mission” (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000) besides teaching and doing research. As part of the increased scrutiny under which contemporary universities find themselves, performance rankings and performance-based funding schemes have proliferated (e. g., Welpe et al. 2015). At the same time, universities’ global competitiveness based on academic “excellence” is increasingly highlighted, and large-scale policy measures to make universities more “excellent” have diffused widely (e. g., Hazelkorn 2009; Hird and Pfotenhauer 2017). In a broader definition of the “third mission” universities are also expected to engage in their region’s social and societal deliberation and decision-making processes (Chatterton and Goddard 2000; Breznitz and Feldman 2012). In this context, sustainability has become an important issue. However, the definitions of what sustainability means are still diverse (see Pike et al. 2007, for a comprehensive discussion). Agreement exists on the belief that sustainability should encompass economic, but also social and environmental objectives (Brundtland 1987). These new demands on universities often reflect broader challenges that Western societies and states (which traditionally operate most universities in Continental Europe) have seen themselves confronted with. Challenged by tight public budgets, policy makers naturally targeted the efficiency of university operations. In light of structural change in Western economies and increased international competition to domestic producers, perceived shortcomings in private-sector innovation have gained attention, and the lack of interaction between universities and companies has been identified as one of their causes (cf., e.,g., Dosi et al. 2006, for a discussion of the alleged “European paradox”). Similar to the realm of knowledge transfer, policy makers have often perceived continental European universities as being outperformed by their U.S. and U.K. peers—hence the enhanced emphasis on academic “excellence”. A broad stream of literature in economics, education, management, sociology and other disciplines studies how these new demands have changed universities, and to what extent their interplay has resulted in conflicting objectives and unintended consequences. For instance, potentially adverse repercussions of knowledge transfer through the commercialization of university inventions have been explored widely (e. g., Murray and Stern 2007). Both performance-based funding and the shift toward academic “excellence” have remained highly controversial (Hartmann 2010; Welpe et al. 2015). However, in spite of the vivid ongoing debate about new challenges faced by universities, and how addressing these challenges changes the university, the geographic dimension of the development has gained scant attention. But if the recent challenges change the university, they also have the potential to change its impact on regional development. Therefore, the articles brought together in the present special issue explore the regional effects of universities under the new prerogatives of science policy. Specifically, Koenig et al. (2017) study whether the excellence orientation in science policy poses a hazard to regional development objectives. Brökel and Roesler (2017) investigate the contribution of universities in regional collaboration networks in biotechnology, which form part of the new “third mission” of knowledge transfer. Radinger-Peer and Pflitsch (2017) concentrate on another aspect of universities’ third mission and study the contribution of Higher Education Institutions to the regional transition towards sustainability. Brenner and Pflitsch (2017) look at the opposite causal direction and examine whether research at universities—in this case research on sustainability—is influenced by local circumstances. While sustainability was originally a rather politically developed and propagated concept, it has become a central issue in many disciplines in the meantime. The political focus on this topic—expressed for example in the Global Sustainable Development Goals—has provided new impetus and new resources to this field. In this context, sustainable regional development has become an important issue. The literature on regional sustainability transitions takes a specific perspective. In line with the concept of sustainability transitions (Geels 2004, 2011), it is argued that a systemic transition affecting various socio-technical regimes is necessary within the region (McCormick et al. 2013). Leadership plays a crucial role in such a transition (Horlings and Padt 2013). Whether local universities are able to take such a leadership role and how universities are involved in such processes at all is less researched so far and examined in the latter two papers included in this issue. This special issue has its origins in the working group Hochschulen und nachhaltige Regionalentwicklung (“universities and sustainable development”) of the German Akademie für Raumforschung und Landesplanung (ARL). Established in 2014, this working group brought together researchers from various academic disciplines. The four articles in this special issue are outcomes of the collaborative research of the working group. They were discussed in the group meetings and benefited from the helpful comments of the other group members.",12

				 Imboden published a critical review (Imboden et al. 2016) of the German
				 Exzellenzinitiative (“initiative for excellence”). Established in 2006, the Exzellenzinitiative constituted a watershed in the public funding of German universities. To
				 a hitherto unseen extent, funds were allocated on the basis of academic merit, with the explicit objective of increasing
				 the international research competitiveness of the best German universities. In contrast, only minimal attention was paid
				 to concerns of balancing the flow of money between the individual federal states and universities, or other
				 considerations of regional or institutional equity (Kehm 2006). In its
				 recommendation for a successor program, the Imboden commission wholeheartedly endorsed this exclusive focus on the
				 pursuit of academic excellence. Policy makers were admonished that the goals of world-class research and international
				 competitiveness “should not be watered down by mixing them up with other goals, however worthy and pressing they may be”
				 (Imboden et al. 2016, p. 6). The commission even proposed to further narrow
				 down the scope of the program and to discontinue the funding of graduate schools that have been part of the Exzellenzinitiative. The Exzellenzinitiative was part of a broader regime shift in the prerogatives of German science policy de-emphasizing universities’ roles in fostering regional innovation and development activities. This regime shift was and is highly controversial (cf., e. g., Münch 2006; Hartmann 2010; Vogt 2014; Arzt et al. 2016) but its regional implications have not received much attention in the debate.Footnote 1 This apparent lack of interest is surprising because the regional impact of universities has been discussed comprehensively. A sizeable literature has focused on the contributions that universities make to regional economic development (e. g., Fritsch et al. 2007; Astebro and Bazzazian 2011) as part of fulfilling their “third mission” of commercializing results (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000) and engaging with non-academic partners (Perkmann et al. 2013). This literature suggests that universities matter for their home regions beyond teaching, research, employment and multiplier effects. Frequently the regional relevance of universities is reflected in their strategies (Belenzon and Schankerman 2013). The available theoretical and empirical work indicates that the increased focus on academic excellence may not be neutral from a regional perspective. It may alter the regional distribution of university funding, which may in turn compromise the ability of the losing universities to contribute to innovation and the development of their host regions. Accordingly, changing the distribution of funding among universities can be expected to impact on the regional distribution of economic activity. In this paper we investigate the regional repercussions of the recent shift toward academic excellence in German science policy. Specifically, we trace how the regional concentration in universities’ merit-based research funding (measured by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) funds, which include Exzellenzinitiative funding after 2005) evolved over time. We also begin to identify factors that help account for which regions are among the winners and losers of the recent regime shift. We find that the already pronounced inequality of DFG research funding increased further in the years following the policy shift, which is consistent with concerns about potentially adverse regional repercussions. Regions with larger overall university size benefit more than proportionately from merit-based DFG funding, and there is some evidence suggesting that this advantage became stronger after the regime change. In contrast, our results do not suggest that more urbanized regions, or regions with stronger private-sector R&D activity, benefit disproportionately from the policy shift. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sect. 2 provides some theoretical background about the recent shift in university funding in Germany as well as the relevance of disparities in research funding. Data and empirical methods are introduced in Sect. 3. We report the results of the empirical analysis in Sect. 4 and conclude in Sect. 5.",10
37,2,Review of Regional Research,11 September 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-017-0118-7,The role of universities in a network of subsidized R&D collaboration: The case of the biotechnology-industry in Germany,October 2017,Christoph Roesler,Tom Broekel,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Firms’ competitiveness emerges from the capability to exploit, integrate, and recombine existing knowledge in order to produce new knowledge more efficiently than their competitors (Kogut and Zander 1992; Grant 1996). Knowledge acquisition and generation are thereby increasingly the result of collaborative research and development (R&D) activities. Engaging in joint R&D gives access to additional resources (Hagedoorn 2002; Powell et al. 2005a) and embeds organizations into knowledge networks granting exposure to knowledge diffusing therein (see Broekel and Graf 2012; Balland 2012; Cassi et al. 2012). In high tech industries (Hagedoorn 1993) firms particularly engage in collaboration to tap external knowledge, which is complementary to their own knowledge base. Asheim and Gertler (2004) argue that innovation processes systematically depend on industries’ knowledge bases, whereby a distinction can be made into analytical, synthetic and symbolic knowledge bases. While the synthetic knowledge bases are said to primarily consist of engineering based knowledge and the symbolic are mainly comprised of artistic and creative knowledge, the analytical knowledge base is characterized by highly codified scientific knowledge. Plum and Hassink (2011) puts forward that these differences should tend to go along with distinct knowledge network structures. It can be expected that industries building upon analytical knowledge will crucially exploit scientific knowledge inputs, which should make links to universities of vital importance (Asheim and Gertler 2004). While some studies provide some evidence for this claim (Broekel and Boschma 2011; Plum and Hassink 2011; Graf and Henning 2009), they primarily look at snapshots of knowledge networks at one moment in time. Consequently, we still know little about if and how universities contribute to the evolution of knowledge networks within industries based on analytical knowledge bases. More precisely, it is still unclear if universities contribute more strongly to the development of knowledge networks in these types of industries than other types of organizations. In addition, due to scientific knowledge’s high degree of codification, geographic proximity can be hypothesized to be less likely a restricting factor for R&D collaboration than for industries in other knowledge bases (Asheim and Coenen 2005; Plum and Hassink 2011). It is the paper’s primary aim to empirically address these questions by using the biotechnology industry as an example of an analytical knowledge base (Cockburn and Henderson 1997; Toole 2012). This industry’s knowledge networks have been intensively studied in the past (Powell et al. 1996b, 2005b; Owen-Smith et al. 2002). They have also been investigated regarding the specificities of industry-university linkages (Owen-Smith et al. 2002). However, these studies primarily relied on graphical interpretation or bivariate correlations. In contrast, the present study utilizes current methods of dynamic network analysis allowing for more comprehensive insights. In addition, we focus on a very specific type of network, namely a knowledge network emerging from the subsidization of joint R&D projects. Networks emerging from the subsidization of joint R&D projects have received some attention in the literature (Scherngell and Barber 2009; Broekel and Graf 2012). It has been shown that the evolution of such networks is driven by similar factors as the development of knowledge networks, which are not based on subsidization. In particular, different types of proximities (geographic, cognitive, social, institutional, organizational) and network structural factors (triadic closure, preferential attachment) foster the formation of knowledge links in such networks, i. e. the participation in subsidized joint R&D projects. However, the majority of existing studies concentrate on industries with synthetic knowledge bases (see Balland 2012; Buchmann and Pyka 2014). It is the second objective of the paper to study the evolution of a network emerging from the subsidization of joint R&D projects within the context of an analytical knowledge base, which has rarely been done in the past. Our results indicate that the nature of biotechnology’s knowledge bases matters for the evolution of its network of subsidized R&D collaboration. The network’s evolution shares some characteristics with other types of knowledge networks. For instance, preferential attachment and cognitive proximity explain significant portions of new link formation. However, we also identify a number of peculiarities in the development of the network, which relate to the industry’s analytical knowledge base. Universities are clearly found to be central players in the network. Institutional boundaries are frequently crossed in university-firm collaboration and are vital for interactive learning in this industry. In contrast, geographic distance is found to stimulate collaboration, as organizations need to access specific knowledge sources, which tend to be located at greater distances. The paper is structured as follows. In the first section, we briefly outline the importance of universities in terms of knowledge production and diffusion. We then discuss general network drivers and outline how they are potentially influenced by policy programs, as well as by the presence of universities. Following this, we present an empirical study on the evolution of a network of subsidized joint R&D in the German biotechnology industry. In the empirical approach, we make use of Stochastic Actor Oriented Models, which are briefly introduced. In the following section, we present the empirical findings. The paper closes with a conclusion that summarizes the results and makes some suggestions for future research.",25
37,2,Review of Regional Research,05 September 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-017-0116-9,The role of higher education institutions in regional transition paths towards sustainability,October 2017,Verena Radinger-Peer,Gesa Pflitsch,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Various political agendas, programmes and supra-national initiatives have emphasized the role of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in spurring sustainability and sustainable development throughout the last decades. In 1987 the Brundtland Report (WCED 1987) introduced sustainability as a concept which strives for a balanced social, ecological and economic development on different spatial scales. Launching several new principles such as: increasing significance of the local and regional level, public and stakeholder participation and integrative, holistic approaches to regional and local challenges (Peer and Stoeglehner 2013), the concept of sustainability confronts considerable complexity and emphasizes the need for systemic, multi-dimensional and transdisciplinary approaches. Sustainability transition research integrates technological, market and behavioural perspectives by considering the co-evolutionary development of these different elements in specific socio-technical systems (STRN 2010). The latter fulfil basic human needs such as energy supply, mobility, and housing, and are also referred to as ‘socio-technical regimes’. How to break up these path dependent structures and initiate a fundamental change in the architecture of these systems is the central question in sustainability transition research and receives increasing political attention (e. g. WBGU 2011). Cities and regions in particular have been identified as a key for sustainable development (McCormick et al. 2013). Proximity advantages at the urban and regional levels facilitate the mobilization and integration of various actor groups and initiatives (Truffer and Coenen 2012). Empirical research has shown that sustainability transitions are highly place-specific and that some regions offer a particular favourable institutional environment for such processes (Hansen and Coenen 2015). The concept of Regional Transition Paths to Sustainability (RTPS) explains how specific institutional environments develop that favour the development of sustainable innovations and pave the way for changes in multiple socio-technical regimes (Strambach and Pflitsch 2017). The changing political and scientific discourse has influenced the engagement of HEIs in regional development in general, and sustainable development in particular. HEIs have developed and continue to develop from their “traditional” role as mere educational infrastructure and research institutions, to “new” roles as drivers for innovation and as stakeholders in public and private partnerships, as well as in planning processes (Chatterton and Goddard 2000). This “3rd mission” depicts a broader and more adaptive role for HEIs, and their contribution to social, cultural and environmental development based on regional needs (Chatterton and Goddard 2000; Gunasekara 2006). Lozano et al. (2015) outline seven spheres where HEIs may engage in implementing sustainability: institutional framework, campus operations, education, research, outreach and collaboration, on-campus experience, assessment and reporting. Stephens et al. (2008) deepen the definition of sustainable development by not only focusing on the activities of universities, but also by taking the content of teaching and research activities into account. They apply the term “change agent” to describe four paths of university action supporting sustainable transitions: providing a model of sustainable practices for society; teaching students how to deal with complex problems and exercise system-thinking; performing practice based research-activities; and promoting and enhancing engagement between individuals and universities situated as transdisciplinary agents. While sustainable development related educational changes as well as HEI management and campus operations are quite prominent in the literature (Lozano et al. 2015), evidence—with few exceptions (e. g. Sedlacek 2013)—is yet rare on the role of HEIs in RTPS. The present paper aims at shedding light on the role HEIs play in the regional transformation towards sustainability using the example of Linz (Austria) and the five HEIs located therein. The two research questions of interest are: what are the contributions of HEIs to RTPS via teaching, research and outreach, and how is the role of HEIs within RTPS influenced by organisational- and field-level drivers? The paper is organized in six sections. Sect. 2 elaborates the conceptual framework on the role HEIs might be able to play in RTPS by referring to state of the art scientific literature. Sect. 3 outlines the methodology of the explorative case study. Sect. 4 presents the case study of Linz and the located HEIs, and gives a concise overview of the transition towards sustainability in the city of Linz as well as the region of Upper Austria. In Sect. 5 the results of the empirical investigations are presented and are further discussed in Sect. 6, taking into account the existing literature. The final section concludes the main findings.",48

The negative wage-unemployment nexus is observed for a large number of countries and seems to hold independently of the observation period. Blanchflower and Oswald (1994b) give rationalizations for a downward-sloping wage curve from non-competitive market behaviour. In particular, they draw on the efficiency wage model and the bargaining model (see also Card 1995). However, follow-up studies did not validate a uniform unemployment elasticity of pay the wage of about −0.1 across countries. In a meta-study, Nijkamp and Poot (2005) showed considerable heterogeneity among estimated wage curve elasticities with a mean of −0.07 after correcting for publication bias. The wage curve is typically estimated as a Mincer-type earnings function (Heckman et al. 2003) with an enriched set of control variables for individual or regional characteristics. While the use of the panel environment is meanwhile standard, present wage curve studies differ with respect to the disaggregation level, econometric modelling, the choice of estimation techniques, the set of control variables and time periods. Many studies adopt the view of a causality running from the extent of joblessness to the wage level. However, when feedback effects are at work, controlling for simultaneity may become crucial. Mostly wage curve analysis treats local labour markets as isolated economies in spite of the presence of commuter flows between the place of residence and job location. If working conditions in a neighbouring region are favourable relative to costs of commuting, workplaces outside the home region are attractive for employees. The inclusion of spatial spillovers in the wage curve is grounded in the theory of monopsonistic competition (Longhi et al. 2006; Fingleton and Palombi 2013). The application of a spatial approach to wage curve estimation is particularly found in German studies (Büttner 1999; Longhi et al. 2006; Elhorst et al. 2007; Baltagi et al. 2012; Fingleton and Palombi 2013). The discovery of the regional wage curve challenged the foundation of the macroeconomic Phillips curve (cf. Teulings and Hartog 1998, pp. 16; Blanchard and Katz 1999; Montuenga-Gómez and Ramos-Parreño 2005). Using dynamic panels, Pannenberg and Schwarze (2000) provide evidence on a West German wage curve with partial equilibrium adjustment. This finding was confirmed by Ammermüller et al. (2010) and Baltagi et al. (2012) on the basis of different panel approaches. While Pannenberg and Schwarze (2000) and Ammermüller et al. (2010) do not account for spatial interactions, Baltagi et al. (2012) adopt a spatial modelling framework. In spite of the different approaches, the estimated wage curve elasticities are distinctly lower than stated in Blanchflower and Oswald’s (1990, 1994b) empirical law. In case of a temporary phenomenon, the wage curve is not contradictory to the compensating differentials hypothesis (cf. Harris-Todaro 1970). Here, the expected utility for all regions converges to the same level in the long-run. According to the hypothesis, a compensation in wages for workers living in disadvantaged, high-unemployment areas is expected. Using a efficiency wage model with non-pecuniary benefits, Blanchflower and Oswald (1994a, 2005) show how a negatively sloped wage curve is obtained in long-run equilibrium. In high unemployment regions workers are compensated for low wages by intrinsic regional amenities. This notion considers the wage curve not as a temporary phenomenon but as an equilibrium relationship rationalized by non-competetive market theory. Blanchflower and Oswald (1995) point to the potential of error-correction models (ECM) “to distinguish between dynamics and the properties of long-run equilibrium” in the wage-unemployment nexus. This suggestion has been seized by Ammermüller et al. (2010) who specify panel error-correction models (PECM) of the wage curve for Germany and Italy. While the PECM captured equilibrium adjustment within regions, error correction between areas is neglected. On the other hand, Baltagi et al. (2012) adopt a dynamic spatial panel data approach without addressing the issue of nonstationarity. An integration of spatial econometrics and panel cointegration in empirical modelling the wage-unemployment relationship is still lacking. In this paper we adopt a global cointegration approach (Beenstock and Felsenstein 2010) to study the West German wage curve. While the need of a proper handling of nonstationary variables is by now well understood in standard econometric panel analysis (Choi 2015), aspects of spurious regression are usually ignored in spatial analysis. Global cointegration takes account of local and spatial adjustment processes between nonstationary variables. The modelling framework consists of a panel cointegrating relationship and a spatial error correction model (SpECM). The SpECM aims at merging the long- and short-run perspective in identifying co-movements of wages and unemployment within and between the cross-sections. The merit of the approach lies in the potential of revealing the consequences of spatial effects for the time series behaviour of the variables (cf. Mitze and Özyurt 2014). The results show that regional spillovers play a crucial role in establishing the equilibrium locus in West German labour markets. While standard cointegration analysis only offers weak evidence for a stable long-run wage-curve, a highly significant cointegrating relationship is obtained when spillovers from nearby regions are included. High unemployment spillovers corroborate the theory of monopsonistic competition. The existence of a regional Phillips curve is clearly rejected. The paper is structured as follows. Sect. 2 reviews the theoretical foundations of the concept of the wage curve. Sect. 3 deals with methodical issues of the global cointegration approach. In Sect. 4, variables and data are described. Empirical findings from panel analysis on the long-run relationship as well as local and spatial adjustment between regional wages and unemployment are discussed in Sect. 5. Section 6 summarizes the main results and offers some conclusions.",4
38,1,Review of Regional Research,07 March 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-017-0112-0,The innovation efficiency of German regions – a shared-input DEA approach,February 2018,Tom Broekel,Nicky Rogge,Thomas Brenner,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The innovation performance of spatial units, regions, is frequently measured quantitatively (Jaffe 1989; Audretsch 1998). The EU Regional Innovation Scoreboard is a good example of such an endeavor. However, many of the available measures can be criticized for mixing inputs and outputs of innovation processes, instead of evaluating the output based on the used inputs (Edquist and Zabala-Iturriagagoitia 2015). While characterized by severe uncertainty, innovation generation processes involve the utilization of valuable resources such as human and financial capital. Hence, from an economic standpoint it is interesting to evaluate regions’ innovation success considering the invested resources (Fritsch 2000; Fritsch and Slavtchev 2011; Brenner and Broekel 2012; Chen and Guan 2012; Bonaccorsi and Daraio 2006). A raft of empirical approaches has been put forward aiming at capturing this relation between invested resources and innovative outcomes. Popular approaches are, for instance, patents per capita (Audretsch 1998) or patents per employee (Deyle and Grupp 2005). Fritsch (2000) refines these approaches arguing in favor of measuring regional innovation efficiency whereby regions are compared with respect to their organizations’ abilities to transform knowledge input factors into innovative output. The term efficiency is used to highlight that the observed innovation output is compared to the maximal output achievable given the available inputs. Other regions serve as benchmarks in determining the maximal achievable output. While the efficiency approach can be seen as a logical extension of the widely-accepted knowledge production function approach by Griliches (1979), Brenner and Broekel (2011) argue that the empirical computation of meaningful regional innovation efficiency measures is far from being easy. The literatures on regional innovation performance and innovation efficiencies are dominated by two approaches. Most studies compare the total innovation output (usually patents) of regional economies to the total inputs, leading to an all-industries measure of innovation efficiency (e. g., Fritsch 2000; Fritsch and Slavtchev 2011). Some studies use data on one industry and compare its regional innovation output with the regional inputs related to this industry (e. g., Broekel 2012, 2015). These studies obtain an industry-specific regional innovation efficiency measure. While both approaches have their merits and problems, the latter approach might be more informative for industry representatives. In contrast, the former approach considers all regional innovation activities and therefore presents a more complete view of regions. However, considering all inputs and outputs in a region, independent of their industrial origin, implies the innovation performance becoming a measure strongly shaped by the regions’ industrial structure. The intention of this paper is to tackle this issue and provide an all-industry measure of innovation efficiency controlling for regions’ industrial structures. Innovation indicators are used in policy discussion to detect best practices for other regions to learn from. However, if innovation indicators are strongly influenced by the regions’ industry structures, those regions are chosen for orientation that happen to contain the most innovative industries, and not necessarily those facilitating innovation processes best. Of course, existing indicators and measures approximate what is politically intended: measuring how well regional institutions and circumstances support innovation activities. However, we think that there is quite some space for improvement and that the measure developed here represents a good step into this direction. It allows for a fairer – in the sense of correcting for the regional industry structure – and, thus, more adequate, identification of those regions in which the innovation process is especially efficient, so that they can be used as best practice cases. Moreover, our approach can also be applied to any level of industry aggregation to identify industries that are most efficient in a region. Our approach consists of three steps. First, we discuss the differences between all-industry and industry-specific innovation efficiency measures. Second, we propose the robust shared-input DEA-model as a new method to construct an all-industry regional innovation efficiency measure that explicitly considers inter-regional variations in regions’ industrial structures. In addition, this method also provides industry-specific innovation efficiency measures for the assessed regions. Third, we apply this method to 150 German labor market regions for which we compute innovation efficiency measures for multiple years. The paper is structured as follows. The subsequent section discusses the empirical measurement of regional innovation efficiency with a focus on all-industry and industry-specific approaches. The third section presents the used empirical data on German labor market regions, which represents data commonly used in such approaches. Section four introduces the robust shared-input DEA-model as a new method to compute regions’ innovation efficiency. The empirical results of its illustrative application to German labor market regions are presented and discussed in section five. The sixth section concludes the paper.",28

This paper aims to address a more precise delineation of natural urban and non-urban space and its change, based on a wider understanding of spatial heterogeneity in terms of Zipf’s law. Inspired by Jiang et al. (2015), dealing with spatial heterogeneity and Zipf’s law for natural cities on a global scale, it makes use of the information contained in nocturnal satellite imagery. The practical purpose is to address some of the shortcomings that administrative delineations of municipalities entail for spatial analysis of the political economy. Spatial heterogeneity is primarily related to the variation of relationships over space. It describes the uneven distribution of spatial variables. Topography, economic assets, urban and rural areas, population densities, converging and diverging regions or maritime versus continental climate are indications of spatial heterogeneity. But the wider concept of spatial heterogeneity comprises a more holistic view on spatial structures, based on fractal geometry, like the self-similar forms of coast lines, topographic reliefs, river networks or the peculiar rank-size distribution of cities. The concept of natural cities, their detection by nighttime imagery and the subsequent estimation of their characteristic distributions are closely related to this interpretation of spatial heterogeneity.Footnote 1 The Netherlands was selected as a case study because it represents a peculiarly strong urbanization history in the core zone of Europe (van der Hejde 2012; de Groot et al. 2015). It thus poses a particular challenge to delineate urban and non-urban space. A glimpse at night satellite images immediately reveals that, at night, the Netherlands not only shines remarkably brighter than areas in the European periphery, but also brighter than Germany and France. Apart from areas in the northern part of the Netherlands, the density of lights appears to define one large urban agglomeration, larger than London or Paris; by visual inspection, it is hard to identify rural areas and to distinguish urban from non-urban space. Already in the 1990s the OECD has put forward the opinion that there are no rural areas in the Netherlands (OECD 1994; Haartsen et al. 2003)Footnote 2. However, the question is whether the traditional population-based administrative segmentation of space fits with the reality of rural and urban territorial extent. It is further to be noted that various Dutch cities have undergone changes of their administrative boundaries by territorial reform, and there are also many peri-urban and rural zones affected by that. But these zones are all defined by administration and do not necessarily correspond to a natural—autonomous—path of settlement evolution. The analysis of the regional political economy can thus be largely distorted. A local territorial reform may change administrative boundaries but not the land use and its related physiognomy. The issue as such had been addressed before with different terminologies ranging from “functional urban areas” (OECD 2013) to the academic debate around the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) dating back to 1934 (Gehlke and Biehl 1934). To avoid such distortions when detecting Zipf’s law in night satellite images, Jiang et al. (2015) have adopted the concept of natural cities. Those are not defined by administrative boundaries, but rather by the autonomous evolution of settlement and economic activity. Before, Jiang and Miao (2014) had defined the term in the context of social media users’ locations that allow insights similar to those of night lights, also with respect to Zipf’s law (Wu 2015). In a wider sense, the term had been introduced long before. From an architectural perspective, Alexander (1965) discussed in a renowned essay how “natural cities” had evolved in contrast to planned artificial cities.Footnote 3 In researching on natural urban and rural evolution, the use of nocturnal satellite imagery (particularly radiance-calibrated images) appears highly appealing. Evidence suggests that change of luminosity correlates strongly with change of economic output (Henderson et al. 2011). There is likewise a strong correlation between light emission, economic activity and population density (e.g. Sutton 1998; Amaral et al. 2006; Ghosh et al. 2010; Mellander et al. 2013; Bagan and Yamagata 2015). Especially the relationship with population density suggests nocturnal luminosity to be a meaningful proxy describing “natural” size. The functional difference between urban and rural space (settlement, production, energy consumption and infrastructure) is well reflected in the distribution of light (light pixel areas side-by-side with dark ones). In this paper, the specific information content of radiance-calibrated nocturnal satellite imagery from the DMSP-OLS projectFootnote 4 is further explored for obtaining an adequate natural segmentation of the highly urbanized Dutch territory. Segmentation of space is essentially based on either an unsupervised clustering approach or supervised classification. While supervised classification (usually executed with maximum likelihood methods) requires detailed prior knowledge of space to define adequate training areas, unsupervised segmentation (K-means clustering, Isodata, head-tail indexing etc.) is an automatic statistical process to be executed by spreadsheet, statistics, GIS or image analysis software. However, apart from robustness issues, cluster analysis of geographical images always depends on the spatial reference system (world, continent, country or region); segmentation results would differ strongly. To overcome this issue of fuzziness, it was tested whether Zipf’s law on the rank-size distribution of cities can help to confirm a statistically determined natural segmentation of urban and non-urban space at a national level. With other words: If, in accordance with Zipf’s law, the exponent of rank-size distribution between the primacy city and the smallest city area of a country is close to −1, as empirically confirmed for the administrative cities in the majority of countries, it can be assumed that cities are properly separated from non-urban space. Empirically, Zipf’s law holds universally, but mostly for cities above a certain population size (e.g. Gabaix 1999a, 1999b). It is to be expected that natural cities may better represent urban space because there is no interference by discretionary territorial reforms. Natural cities thus may thus cope with “more carefully defined” metropolitan areas (Fujita et al. 1999, p. 217). Assuming that cluster analysis may potentially generate meaningful segmentation thresholds, the ensuing question is whether the rank distribution of such natural urban settlements then also behaves in accordance with a power law in terms of ZipfFootnote 5, and whether there are economic, pure statistical or other reasons explaining a possible deviation from that. Anyway, as Gabaix (1999a, p. 132) suggests: “… This law is likely to guide empirical and theoretical work in the future.” It is to be stressed that the definition of cities requires certainly more than the application of power laws as a benchmark; the clustering approach and the subsequent Zipf-related validation are deliberately chosen to obtain an understanding how natural and administrative city sizes differ. The paper is structured along six sections. In Sect. 2, Zipf’s law and its important underpinnings for the application of a spatial segmentation test are discussed. In Sect. 3, the details of statistical methodology, data, data transformation and software are described. The core analytical part is represented by Sect. 4 dealing with the empirical analysis (K-means segmentation and the regression exercises on Zipf’s law). Sect. 5 is a concluding ponderation on supporting and critical arguments on the methods and results, while Sect. 6 is a summarizing discussion.",8

38,2,Review of Regional Research,16 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-018-0123-5,Evaluation of the Brazilian regional development funds,October 2018,Guilherme Mendes Resende,Diego Firmino Costa da Silva,Luís Abel da Silva Filho,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper aims to evaluate the relationship between the Brazilian regional development funds and the GDP per capita growth on two spatial scales (municipalities and micro-regions) between 1999 and 2011. The analysis employs a municipal dataset from the Constitutional Financing Funds (CFF), divided between The Northeast Constitutional Fund (FNE), the North Constitutional Fund (FNO) and the Central-West Constitutional Fund (FCO), and their impact on an economic indicator (GDP per capita) in municipalities and micro-regions. The data are drawn from the municipal level and are then grouped to form the micro-regional scale. With regard to the Brazilian literature, studies are emerging related to CFF impact evaluation at the firm level (see Silva et al. 2009; Soares et al. 2009) and at the regional level (Resende 2014a, 2014b; Soares et al. 2014; Oliveira and Domingues 2005). For instance, Resende (2014a) formulated a framework to measure the micro- and macroimpacts of FNE using the first-differences method, which controls for observable characteristics and unobserved fixed effects. The study measured the impact of the FNE industrial loans on employment and labour productivity growth at the micro(firm) level, and on the GDP per capita growth at the macro(municipality, micro-region and spatial cluster) level. The results show a positive and statistically significant impact of the FNE industrial loans on job creation at the micro-level but no significant impacts on the GDP per capita growth at the macro-level for the 2000–2006 period. In another study, Resende (2014b) combined evaluations using different spatial scales (municipalities, micro-regions and meso-regions) to investigate the relationship between the FNE loans and GDP per capita growth between 2004 and 2010. The results show a positive and statistically significant effect of the FNE on the GDP per capita growth at the municipal and micro-regional levels. It is worth noting that the evaluation literature of CFF still suffers from some shortcomings. Most of the papers use a short time period, which may undermine the analysis due to the nature of the investments that take some time to have effects on the production. In the methodological aspect, most of the works do not investigate the possibility of spatial dependence or do not deepen in this investigation. In this sense, this work seeks to investigate the existence (and possible differences) of spatial spillover effects of the loans made in the municipalities according to the typology classification. In order to prioritize public action, the National Policy for Regional Development (PNDR) classifies municipalities and micro-regions according to income per capita level and GDP per capita growth. The combination of these criteria resulted in four types of regions: Low-income, Stagnant, High-income and Dynamic. Analyzing different effects along the different typologies, we seek to control for spatial heterogeneity that operates through the reaction of the variable of interest to the explanatory variables (Ertur et al. 2006; Ertur and Le Gallo 2009). In other words, this approach by the PNDR typologies allows different reactions of CFF investments at the municipal and micro-regional levels. In sum, this work brings to the available literature three contributions: (i) the study of a longer period (1999–2011), compared to the previous literature; (ii) the possibility of spatial interaction between the geographical units, which has the advantage of allowing an analysis of the direct and indirect effects (spillover effects); and (iii) the consideration of heterogeneity institutionalized by the PNDR through the typology defined by this policy. The paper is organized as follows. Next section describes the features of the Constitutional Financing Funds. The third section describes the framework employed to measure the impacts of the CFF loans on economic growth. The fourth section documents the database. The fifth section carries out an assessment of the impact estimates using the standard panel approach and spatial econometrics methods. The last section presents the conclusions.",4
38,2,Review of Regional Research,24 August 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-018-0125-3,Regional heterogeneity in age-related housing depreciation rates,October 2018,Sören Gröbel,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper examines the age-related depreciation of residential housing on the basis of single-family houses in Germany. In this context, age-related depreciation refers to the decreasing productivity of a building with increasing age, which is furthermore accompanied by a decline in value.Footnote 1 This reduction in value is, however, neither spatially nor temporally homogeneous, but it is rather subject to the particular regional effects of housing supply and housing demand (e.g., Clapp and Giaccotto 1998; Smith 2004). In contrast to existing literature studying age-related housing depreciation, which is at any rate mostly limited to single housing markets, we examine the aforementioned factors determining the regional variation in age-related depreciation rates. In particular, we consider differences that can be attributed to excess supply. At least in theory, these can be explained by substitution effects in housing demand and deferred maintenance: e.g., a negative demand shock might decrease absolute housing prices, leading households to demand more quality and quantity of housing. Considering the substitutability of comparable residential properties and the durability of the housing stock, this in turn will lead vacancies to be redistributed towards older houses of lower quality (e.g., Sweeney 1974; Smith and Tesarek 1991; Arnott and Braid 1997).Footnote 2 Moreover, when homeowners only invest in their property once replacement costs are below the asset value, low absolute house prices will be accompanied by low reinvestment rates (Gyourko and Saiz 2004). Deferred maintenance in turn has a distorting effect on price differences among houses at different ages. Regional variation in age-related housing depreciation is particular relevant for Germany where much of the housing stock of single-family houses stems from the post-WWII-period (see Table 1).Footnote 3 Hence, many single-family houses, notably from the 1960/70s, will reach the end of their life cycle in the current and upcoming years. At the same time, there are substantial changes in ownership due to demographic developments. The risk of increasing vacancy rates and a considerable decline in property values exists, in particular, in rural, peripheral regions, where single-family houses constitute a relatively large portion of the housing stock. Not only do these structural excess supplies have a negative impact on individual assets and in turn on old-age provision, but they can also have a negative impact on the entire municipality.  Empirical Strategy and Previous Literature: In order to empirically measure the age-related depreciation of a building, the value of the building must necessarily be separated from the value of the land over time. At the same time, one has to control for other time-varying determinants of the building value, such as maintenance (Francke and Minne 2017). For these reasons, empirical studies often make use of panel data, such as the American Housing Survey (AHS) (e.g., Chang and Chen 2011). Unfortunately, no comparable data sets are available for Germany. With this backdrop in mind, we use offering prices for single-family houses, but place a particular emphasis on the problems associated with the estimation of age-related depreciation rates on the basis of cross-sectional data.Footnote 4 As it relates to the empirical aspects, we proceed as follows: In the event of excess supply, houses of lower quality in particular should no longer be sold. For this reason, we first compare the structural characteristics of the relevant offering and sales price data to examine the extent to which possible quality selections can be observed. This is an issue that has not been taken into account in previous studies. Secondly, we estimate age-related housing depreciation rates by applying hedonic modeling separately to the various regional housing markets from the federal state of Lower Saxony, Germany. Those regional housing markets are particularly suitable when bearing in mind the great variability of housing’s demand-side and supply-side variables, e.g. the vacancy rate. Thirdly, we then analyze the regional variation in relative price differentials among houses at different ages by correlating the derived depreciation rates with regional determinants. Besides providing precise information about the housing structure (e.g., year built, building condition, or lot size), a key feature of the dataset used is that, apart from this, it provides us with information concerning the structure’s geographical location and state of modernization, which in turn permits us to address problems associated with the estimation of age-related depreciation rates in a cross-sectional setting. Those issues concern the bundled-good characteristic of housing: The first point concerns the separation of land value and building value. The age-related depreciation rates may be biased when locational effects, such as neighborhood effects, local externality effects, differences in market tension or natural amenities, are correlated with the year of construction and single-family houses at different ages are not randomly distributed over space (e.g., Harding et al. 2003; Wilhelmsson 2008; Rosenthal 2008; Caplin and Leahy 2011; Zahirovich-Herbert and Gibler 2014). It is therefore a desideratum to account for locational effects accurately. For this reason, we include neighborhood dummy variables at the postal code level and spatially-interacting variables in the hedonic specification. In the previous literature, these have proven to be suitable for taking locational effects into account (e.g., Bourassa et al. 2007). Secondly, due to innovations in construction material, technology, and design, as well as in institutional changes in the construction environment, the relation of housing quality and age is likely to be non-linear (e.g., Margolis 1981; Shilling et al. 1991; Knight and Sirmans 1996). Against this background, we use age-cohort-specific depreciation rates resulting from structural ruptures in time in construction, e.g., technical innovations or changes in regulations. Furthermore, there may be biases in the estimates should maintenance not sufficiently be taken into account or if expenditure on maintenance correlates with land values (e.g., Boehm and Ihlanfeldt 1986; Harding et al. 2007; Munneke and Womack 2015). Thus, we include the state of modernization as a single parameter, interacting with age-cohort dummies in the estimation. Thirdly, besides the depreciation in use value, age-related housing depreciation may also be distorted by a positive one-time call option that represents the opportunity to redevelop existing housing characteristics. The value of the call option therefore increases with the locational value and decreases in line with structural intensity (e.g., Clapp and Salavei 2010; Clapp et al. 2012). For this reason, we use non-linear intensity measures to control for possible redevelopment options. Fourthly, in the last decade several empirical studies have shown that marginal contributions of housing attributes differ significantly across the price distribution (e.g., Zietz et al. 2008; McMillen 2008; Zahirovich-Herbert and Gibler 2014; Thomschke 2015). Such differences can be explained, for example, with varying marginal willingnesses-to-pay caused by systematic differences in households’ disposable incomes (Bayer et al. 2016). With this in mind, we also use quantile regression methods to account for heterogeneity in implicit prices along the intraregional house price distribution. Empirical Findings: Key results from analyzing the regional variation in age-cohort depreciation rates can be summarized as follows. Firstly, estimated age-related depreciation coefficients are highly heterogeneous and often follow a strongly region-specific pattern. Furthermore, in line with previous findings, region-specific coefficients on age-cohort housing depreciation vary significantly along the intraregional price distribution. Secondly, our results reveal that a large share of the regional variation in age-cohort depreciation rates can be attributed to housing-market variables tied to excess supply, e.g. a persistent change in the number of potential consumers (the age-cohort of the 25–40 year-olds), or in the amount of newly developed land. More precisely, by using the vacancy rate of single-family houses as a proxy for local excess supply, we find that an increase of the vacancy rate by one percentage point goes in parallel with an increase in the relative price differential between the oldest and youngest age-cohort of about 11 percent. As single-family houses in regions with low land values exhibit larger lot sizes, the ratio of land value to building value remains relatively homogeneous across the regions.Footnote 5 For this reason, we cannot find any correlation between the age-cohort depreciation rates and the regional shares of land value to total value. Moreover, by additionally comparing offering and sales price data, we can observe a significant quality selection in the sales price data, which is likely to accrue from the fact that they only include properties which are ultimately sold. This confirms the described empirical results to the extent that it shows that poor quality houses are indeed in lesser demand in the case of excess supply. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides some information on recent house price dynamics in Germany as well as on the relevant institutional background, such as age-specific differences in construction. This is then followed by a discussion of the methodology used for the empirical identification of the age-related depreciation rates and for examining regional variations in Sect. 3. Moreover, the data used in this inquiry and the results arrived at in our analysis are discussed in Sect. 4, and Sect. 5, and finally a conclusion is drawn on the basis of the empirical results in Sect. 6.",

39,1,Review of Regional Research,12 September 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-018-0126-2,The price of mobility,February 2019,Reinhard A. Weisser,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since 2010, the German labour market has displayed two distinct trends which are both interrelated with its matching efficiency. On the one hand, the average ratio of registered unemployed to job vacancies, a measure of labour market tightness, is characterised by a downward trend from 3.7 at the end of 2010 to 2.4 in 2017. This is indicative of better job finding perspectives on the aggregate level. On the other hand, according to the Institute for Employment Research’s job vacancy survey (IAB 2017), the relative number of job hires associated with difficulties in the recruitment process increased from 29 to 36%. Finding a suitable employee, respectively establishing a successful job match has become more intricate. An insufficient number of applicants was mentioned in 24% of these difficult recruitment attempts in the year 2016, compared to 14% in 2010. Moreover, the share of applicants with too high salary demands rose from 10 to 14% in 2015, and then slightly declined to 12% in 2016 (IAB 2017). Ultimately, locally available labour supply was declared to be insufficient—an issue more pronounced in East Germany—or there was a substantial mismatch of salary expectations. In reality, impeded geographic job mobility may occur although workers react to regional labour demand differentials: job opportunities and local conditions are jointly relevant criteria, leading to a trade-off (Graves and Linneman 1979; Roback 1982; Clark and Cosgrove 1991; Dalenberg and Partridge 1997; Whisler et al. 2008). In this literature on compensating differentials, the level of amenities, e. g. favourable climatic conditions or cultural offers, determines the required compensating wage premium to induce labour mobility. There is another strand in the literature, estimating monetary returns to labour mobility. Interstate job-to-job changers realise a notable wage premium (Yankow 2003), as do workers moving to metropolitan areas (Glaeser and Maré 2001). In general, the most pronounced returns to geographic mobility can be reaped by the tertiary educated (Lemistre and Moreau 2009; Knapp et al. 2013). Within the wider body of the literature on mobility related wage differentials, the focus typically rests on labour market features, amenities and socio-demographic factors. Individual preferences or personality characteristics, however, have been mostly ignored. The first contribution of this research is to document that impediments to mobility differ among individuals due to heterogeneous preferences and personality in a wider sense. To this end, I first sketch a theoretical model which integrates heterogeneous individuals into a compensating differential framework. This model serves as starting point for an empirical analysis of how personality traits and preferences, such as proximity to reference persons, impact on expected mobility premiums. This research is not limited to an analysis of observed premiums of those who chose to accept, neglecting all actually occurring, yet undocumented, salary mismatches. Instead, drawing upon a detailed student mobility survey (MESARAS 2013; Weisser 2016a), the overall distribution of ex ante premiums of future university graduates is investigated. Moreover, the expected mobility premiums are analysed for two labour market scenarios (employed vs. unemployed) and two types of mobility (interstate vs. cross-border). The second contribution of this work refers to the previously described salary mismatch in the context of labour migration: I provide estimates of the minimum compensating wage premium, i. e. the price a firm had to pay, so a specific university graduate would accept an offer in a spatially distinct labour market. This work focuses on prospective university graduates, since high tertiary education participation rates (King and Ruiz-Gelices 2003) emphasise the relevance of tertiary educated workers as an integral part of the labour force. There is also evidence in favour of a strong interrelation between mobility preferences during studies and post-graduation migratory trajectories (Groen 2004; Busch and Weigert 2010; Parey and Waldinger 2011; Di Pietro 2012). This highlights that analysing mobility-related preferences of university students promises valuable insights into their prospective migration patterns, once they will have entered the labour market. Although the focus on students’ mobility premiums enables to investigate interesting research questions, it has caveats as well: the mobility premiums are, in fact, ex ante expectations. However, I can demonstrate that these ex ante expectations are in line with the literature on mobility-related wage premiums. I further address this issue in the sensitivity analysis. A first specification accounts for the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen 1991), which advocates behavioural control and strength of intentions as predictors of actual behaviour. In a second specification, I allow expectations to be influenced by labour market readiness. This accounts for the emergence of more or less realistic wage expectations, depending on individual labour market experience. The remainder of this study is organised as follows: Sect. 2 provides an overview of the literature on post-migration premiums, compensating or agglomeration premiums and individual factors shaping mobility-related decisions. In Sect. 3, the mobility premiums are derived in a theoretical framework, incorporating the concept of personality profiles and individual preferences. Sect. 4 delineates the data source and descriptive statistics. Previously derived hypotheses are tested in Sect. 5 and sensitivity checks supplement earlier results; Sect. 6 concludes.",1

Organization has become more centralized and more oriented towards efficiency and excellence. In the context of these changes, universities are nowadays expected to provide more than scientific publications and graduates. Their so-called ‘third mission’ is based on widespread interaction with the economy, policy makers, and the wider society. This also includes a stronger interaction within the region. As a consequence, an increasing contribution to innovation, economic growth, structural change, societal development, and the attraction of people is expected at the regional level. These new aspects of universities’ importance for regions implies various new research strands. While the relevance of universities for sustainable developments in regions has been addressed by a recent special issue of this journal (Koenig et al. 2017; Roesler and Brökel 2017; Radinger-Peer and Pflitsch 2017; Brenner and Pflitsch 2017), this special issue continues on the topic with contributions on two further aspects: Two of the four papers in this special issue aim at providing a more differentiated understanding of university effects and network formation. The focus of the two other papers in this special issue is on teaching-related forms of interaction and effects of universities on migration. There is a need for a more differentiated understanding of the nature and variety of innovation induced by universities with a specific focus on their degree of novelty (Edwards-Schachter 2018). The breakthrough of digitalization and the normative shift of innovation towards contributing to tackling the so-called ‘Grand Societal Challenges’ require disruptive changes in existing technological paths. Within innovation studies, this is reflected by a new interest in radical innovations (Chrstensen et al. 2015). From a conceptual perspective, it is expected that universities have the potential to serve as ‘change agents’ and are potentially well-equipped to bring forward disruptive changes (Radinger-Peer and Stoeglehner 2013). However, there is yet insufficient empirical evidence on whether collaboration with universities really has a positive impact on the degree of novelty of innovations. This issue is addressed by the first paper by Arant et al. (2019, in this issue). The properties of networks formed by universities and individual academics have been studied widely in the literature (Perkmann et al. 2013) with a particular focus on their spatial dimension (e.g. Schiller and Revilla Diez 2010; Trippl 2013). However, the processes and motivations underlying the formation of networks of academics have not yet been fully understood. More recently, Kroll et al. (2016) provided evidence for Germany on academics’ objectives for regional engagement. Based on a paper by Engel et al. (2017), the formation of networks is now also understood as an entrepreneurial activity by academics. These notions are starting point for more in-depth investigation into the characteristics of this activity. Understanding the processes of network formation on different spatial scales from an individual perspective—as it is done in the second paper by Ahoba-Sam and Charles (2019, in this issue)—is of high relevance, because it will inform policy makers about meaningful designs of measures to promote regional engagement of academics. Teaching-related collaboration modes of universities have been underrepresented in the literature if compared to research-related and entrepreneurial modes, even though studies in different contexts have shown that they are at least of similar importance (e.g. Koschatzky (2014) for Germany or Schiller and Brimble (2009) for Thailand). In the context of the increasing lack of qualified labor, the impact of the university options on the decision to study is of specific interest—a topic addressed in the third paper by Wessling (2019, in this issue). A related issue is the question of whether universities are able to attract people who remain in the region afterwards and increase the availability of qualified labor. Many studies have already analyzed the migration behavior of graduates (e.g. Busch and Weigert 2010; Abreu et al. 2014; Buenstorf et al. 2016; von Proff et al. 2016). The fourth paper by Oggenfuss (2019, in this issue) adds an analysis of Switzerland to this research. This special issue originated from sessions on Universities and their Contribution to Innovation, Growth and Development at the Regional Level that were organized by the editors at the Global Conference of Economic Geography 2018 in Cologne.",

The impact of socio-spatial indicators on transitions from secondary school to university,October 2019,Katarina Weßling,Nora Bechler,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Research reveals that regions benefit from the presence of universities within the region (e.g., Blume et al. 2017; Drucker and Goldstein 2007; Koenig et al. 2017). The production of graduates through educating high skilled individuals improves the overall regional conditions (Horlings and Padt 2013). Beyond that, strong universities promote the entrepreneurial and technological innovation potential of a region (Schubert and Kroll 2014). The present contribution draws attention to an individualistic aspect of the impact of the regional presence of universities by investigating the influence that living in a region with a more or less strong university orientation has on young adults. We hereby focus on a crucial threshold in the individual life courses—the transition from secondary school to university. Much examined explanatory factors in sociological research for unequal chances to enroll in university education—versus participating in alternatives such as vocational education and training (VET)—are students’ previous educational performance (Heine and Lörz 2007; Müller et al. 2009). Beyond that, factors such as parental occupation, income, or education (e.g., Müller et al. 2009) as well as ethnic and gender differences play a role (e.g., Kristen et al. 2008; Lörz and Schindler 2011). Research on contextual conditions most often refers to factors such as academic reputation, distance from home and location (Simões and Soares 2010; Weiß et al. 2015). Explanatory factors that explicitly consider socio-spatial aspects have only recently been given more attention (for an overview see Sect. 3). We aim to bridge the sociological and the regional research literature by assessing the relevance and the spatial extent of regional indicators on school graduates’ transitions to university in and outside their home region. We concentrate on two aspects of the transition from school to study—(1) the chance to enter university compared to alternatives such as VET and (2) the place of study. We include the choice of place of study in a second step because certain study programs are not available everywhere (Haussen and Übelmesser 2017). Hence, school graduates are either forced to move, or to adjust their study intentions. In addition, causes such as the quality of universities, as well as economic and cultural offerings in a region can be expected to be important when choosing a place to live (Greenwood 1973; von Proff et al. 2017). We aim at contributing to the literature in three ways: First, we include not only study opportunities as relevant regional factor, but we focus on three distinct factors; namely, the regional economic situation, the university orientation of a region as well as study opportunities. Second, we aim to illustrate and quantify the spatial radius in which the three regional factors affect individuals’ transition to university. We apply geographic travel-time information, which allows us to aggregate the regional indicators within travel-time radii. Thus, we can describe the most significant spatial extent of the three regional factors. Third, our analyses cover West Germany over a period of 26 years to infer on developments in the relevance of regional factors over time. We are linking regional information from various sources with retrospective survey data from the Starting Cohort 6 of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS).",7

40,1,Review of Regional Research,06 June 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-019-00130-6,The community reinvestment act and real municipal bond interest rate yields in the united states: evidence from the municipal bond market,April 2020,Richard J. Cebula,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Revenue Act of 1913 legally codified the exemption of interest paid on municipal bonds from federal income taxation. Cecchetti (2006, p. 159) observes that as a consequence of this statute, “The general rule in the U.S. is that the interest income from bonds issued by one [level of] government is not taxed by another [level of] government, although the issuing government may tax it.” Hence, Cecchetti (2006, p. 159) notes “… the federal government is precluded from taxing interest on [qualified] municipal bonds.” Accordingly, across the U.S., cities, counties, and states have long found the existence of tax-free status on qualified bond issues, which enables these governmental units to borrow at a lower cost in the financial markets (Madura 2008, pp. 45–46), to be a key consideration in the financing of a wide variety of capital improvement projects. Such public investment endeavors range from highway, bridge, and tunnel construction to public school, seaport, airports, and water and sewerage system construction. It is important to stress, however, that, in theory, the form of the tax-exempt interest rate measure that is likely to be the most relevant to these public investments is actually the ex post real interest rate yield on municipal bonds because, by its very nature, it adjusts for future inflation (Cecchetti and Schoenholtz 2014, p. 597; Madura 2008, pp. 45–46). Within this context, the present study investigates empirically the potential interest rate effects of The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. This statute has been revised and/or updated a number of times, including revisions in 1995 and updates in 2005. The objective of this legislation ostensibly was to stop the practice of “redlining” as well as to encourage banks and related institutions (although not, e.g., credit unions) to act in ways that would help to meet the credit needs of all dimensions of their communities and neighborhoods (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 2014, p. 1). Moreover, this statute has been characterized as encouraging “… banks to open new branches, provide expanded services, and make a variety of community development loans and investments” (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 2014, p. 1). Furthermore, the statute has been depicted as encouraging “… banks to provide substantial commitments to state and local governments and community development organizations to increase lending to underserved segments of local economies …” (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 2014, p. 1). Indeed, it is argued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2014, pp. 1–3) that to the extent that loans granted under provisions of this statute reduced the issuance of tax-exempt bonds by cities, towns, counties, and/or states, tax-exempt bond prices have been higher and their interest rate yields lower, ceteris paribus. The principal objective of this study is to investigate empirically whether there is evidence that The Community Reinvestment Act may have, as argued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2014), acted to reduce the interest rate yield on high grade municipal bonds. The focus in this study is on the ex post real interest rate yield on municipal bonds, which is the most meaningful measure of this interest rate (Cecchetti and Schoenholtz 2014, p. 297). This measure of the real yield rather than the nominal yield is adopted because it accounts expressly for inflation. In the interest of relevance, a secondary objective of this brief study is to inquire whether the federal budget, which has risen in the past decade to levels as high as 9.8% of GDP (Council of Economic Advisors 2018, Table B‑17), also may have influenced the real interest yield on municipal bonds; inclusion of the budget deficit helps to assure against omitted variable bias, as suggested in studies such as Cebula (2014, 2017), Hoelscher (1986), Tanzi (1985), and Zahid (1988), as well as by Madura (2008, pp. 34–35). The study uses data for the period 1973–2016 so as to provide contemporary insights into this possible federal borrowing impact during the post-Bretton Woods era. The second section of this study provides the framework/model adopted, whereas Sect. 3 defines and describes the variables in the empirical model as well as the data. Subsequently, the empirical estimation results predicated on the model are provided. Concluding observations are found in the final section of the study.",2

40,2,Review of Regional Research,24 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-020-00140-9,"Climate change, catastrophes and Dismal Theorem: a critical review",October 2020,Andrea Rampa,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In the last few decades, literature on climate change risk, and generally on environmental policy, has grown significantly. This has been the case, since the Kyoto Agreement; in fact, starting from the 1990s, a general consensus about the issue of climate change has been established, which had not always been a given. Along with increases in the policymakers’ efforts to face the problem, this has called greater attention to this topic and to studies on extreme case scenarios. Such growing interest has been caused by a number of historical reasons, first of all by the fact that it is now possible to realise the severity of the issue, by observing melting glaciers or the increased frequency of extreme events causing damage to inland regions and developing countries in contrast to Western ones (as examples). In fact, developing countries, especially (but not only) those that rely on agriculture, are more vulnerable to climate change and extreme events. For example, loss of vital river flowsFootnote 1 is likely to damage mostly mountain or remote regions, while land use and urban sprawl could damage and indirectly cause floods or landslides in rural areas rather than urban areas. Overall, climate change is one of the historical reasons behind the lack of territorial cohesion and not just in a rural-urban perspective. Natural hazard and vulnerability are not homogeneous among geography (Marin et al. 2019; Graziano and Rizzi 2020, see, e.g.), causing a inherent costs in enduring damages due to exogenous shocks. This is a crucial finding of regional science, already stressed and debated in the literature (Fröhlich and Hassink 2018, among others). So, this nonuniformity is a source of unequal natural resource distribution: the evidence that there are regions suffering more than others from natural hazard and climate change has instigated an increasing interest upon in literature inspired by on the issue. Castells-Quintana et al. (2017), study the impact of climate change and weather events on long-run growth and Institution development, finding that “the role of geography as a fundamental determinant of relative prosperity”, and it exists hetereogenity even among the same area: Utaminingsih (2017) analyse resilience of children in West Lampung coastal area in Indonesia. Overall, any regions have their resilience (Faggian et al. 2018; van Bergeijk et al. 2017, see, e.g.), and each region has to react to hazard and climate issues, coherently to its own unique characteristics (Cutter et al. 2016, see, e.g.). This is the ground of analysis (obviously, not the only one), where regional science and urban panning have to play an important role; this is so, because improving regional resilience will be fundamental in the future, even more than in this age. Moreover, rises in temperatures and increased weather variability are not uniform across the planet, and this heterogeneity may cause major issues also in terms of climate justice. Fig. 1 presents a few features of this regional heterogeneity, based on how it was reported by the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (UNFCCC 2014).  UNFCCC (2014): Change in temperature and precipitation. Change in average surface temperature (a) and change in average precipitation (b) based on multi-model mean projections for 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005 under the left and right scenarios. The number of models used to calculate the multi-model mean is indicated in the upper right corner of each panel. Stippling (i.e., dots) shows regions where the projected change is large compared to natural internal variability and where at least 90% of models agree on the sign of change. Hatching (i.e., diagonal lines) shows regions where the projected change is less than one standard deviation of the natural internal variability Thus, climate change and natural disasters are causing also a change in allocation of natural and physical resource among the planet. How is reacting each economy (or agglomeration of economies) to a different set of resource in its endowment? In order to better understand how regional resilience is facing the issue, and how it will face these shocks in the next decades, many papers and others kinds of studies are stressing many aspects of regional specialization and trade networks among different areas. Pudelko et al. (2018) investigates the economic resilience of some German regions after 2008 crisis, focusing on the reaction of agglomeration economies analysing (deeply) the regional resilience, through a strong distinction between sensitivity and recovery from an external shock. Bondonio and Greenbaum (2018) study the local economy resilience to rare natural disasters of U.S. counties between 1989 and 1999, using a propensity score matching approach. Moreover, a difference-in-difference estimator compares trends of affected counties’ post-disaster business establishments, employment, and payroll to counterfactual trends in the matched counties. Findings of this paper could be extremely useful for a policymakers, in order to better prepare responses for future disasters. Thus, a novel and interdisciplinary way to analysis is crucial also for urban resilience. Borsekova and Nijkamp (2019) respond to this need, collecting the more important quantitative and qualitative tools for impact analysis and disaster management. In their review, the authors included environmental catastrophes, political turbulence and economic shocks. The main issues that the literature is engaging with are both theoretical and technical. On the theoretical side, it is not straightforward to justify the political cost of an environmental policy; on a more technical level, the probability structure to be used in modelling future catastrophic scenarios is controversial. Thus, assumptions and postulations about the future cost of climate change as well as assumptions and postulations about the present cost of environmental policy have become crucial. Regarding the political cost, there are two main debatable points: intergenerational equity, and so the opportunity to engage in policies increasing the well-being of future generations (Stern 2006; Weitzman 2009); and social equity, meaning whether policy costs should be imposed only on developed countries or also on the developing ones (Dasgupta 2007). On the first issue, every paper or report investigating catastrophic scenarios linked to climate change has to provide an analysis that assumes or recommends politically viable intergenerational policies (Stern 2006; Tol and Yohe 2006, 2007; Dietz et al. 2007; Ackerman et al. 2009; Sterner and Persson 2008; Weitzman 2009). Consequently, a very controversial issue in the literature regards the value of the discount factor between present and future utility (often present and future generations), together with the assumption of a stochastic discount factor (Weitzman 2009). These unresolved problems are due to the existence of more than one source of uncertainty: future preferences (future utility), potential for environmental damages due to climate change, probability of extreme events, and severity of such extreme events. The pure rate of time preference, and so the discount factor, has been one of the most debated questions over the last decade. This is so because the discount factor involves a few theoretically disputable points, which will be investigated here. Thus, we will analyse how the approach to modelling discounting in the climate change literature has been modelled on the Stern Review (Stern 2006) and we will then explore the debate around the Dismal Theorem (hereby, DT) (Weitzman 2009) . Stern Review (Stern 2006) is the most influential report on climate change. This document was released for the UK Government and published as a volume in January 2007 by Cambridge University Press. The 700-page handbook presented a wide range of evidence on the impact of climate change and on its economic costs. A very beneficial aspect of the Stern Review is that it used a large number of different techniques to assess the costs and risks of climate change, claiming that “there is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change if we take strong action now”. According to some authors, these convincing conclusions resulted from some assumptions that are common to all the scenarios considered in Stern (2006). The debatable assumptions are those connected to the discount factor. Thus, Weitzman (2009) used a fat-tailed function in order to estimate the risk of a climate catastrophe, leading to the result that it is necessary to implement extremely expensive environmental policies in order to be “safe”. The effect on literature has been shattering, and his paper has attracted much criticism, mainly from a technical standpoint but also regarding the conclusions and policy recommendations provided. Using the DT, Weitzman designed a consumption trajectory that is also subject to a stock of “random risk” of suffering damages resulting in the loss of human lifeFootnote 2. In so doing, the author postulated a negative coefficient or relative risk aversion that is a function of the utility of consumption, thus obtaining a stochastic discount factor. Weitzman introduced other sources of uncertainty, one being the logarithmic consumption growth that is postulated as a Probability Density Function (from now on, PDF), depending on the GDP and its relation to some generic structural parameter (that can be interpreted as sensitivity to climate change, exogenous shock, etc.). Finally, also the GDP was adopted as a random variable given by an \(n\) finite number of independent observations. The following sections of this study each centre on a landmark paper and discuss the debate around that paper. They are organised as follows: in Sect. 2, we discuss the Stern Review (Stern 2006), regarded by most scholars as a sort of handbook of the economics of climate change; in Sect. 3 we present the DT (Weitzman 2009) commenting on the technical choices made by the author; Sect. 4 is focused on criticism of the DT and the debate around this; in Sect. 5 we explore the most recent works paying attention to current (and future) debate, stressing the Expected Utility theory (from now on, EU theory) and the assumption of rationality; Sect. 6 provides some concluding remarks and suggestions for future research.",1

40,2,Review of Regional Research,17 August 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-020-00143-6,Economic landslide susceptibility under a socio-economic perspective: an application to Umbria Region (Central Italy),October 2020,Marco Donnini,Marco Modica,Roberto Zoboli,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Landslides are a widespread hazard, causing human fatalities in urban settlements, along transport corridors and at sites of rural industry (Froude and Petley 2018), representing the 7th worldwide largest killer among natural disasters and producing heavy economic damages in many countries (Herath and Wang 2009). However, in the evaluation of landslide hazards the degree of tolerance of landslides risk by people, policy makers and stakeholders in general, turns out to be surprisingly high (Hungr et al. 2016). To develop more refined landslide risk management, mitigation strategies and land use policies, an accurate understanding of the triggering factors and of the physical and economic effects is fundamental (Field et al. 2012; Meyer et al. 2013; Paleari 2018). To produce effective results in reducing the risk of losses due to landslides and designing effective mitigation measures and land use planning it is necessary an interdisciplinary approach taking together physical and economic aspects (De Graff 2012; Prenger-Berninghoff and Greiving 2015). Assessing landslide risk is a complex and uncertain operation, and it needs information regarding (i) the hazard (H), expressed as the probability that a landslide of given magnitude (e.g. area or volume) will occur in a given area (susceptibility) in a given period, (ii) the vulnerability (V), the potential damage or losses that a landslide could cause (Guzzetti et al. 1999; Alexander 2005; Ardizzone et al. 2008; Merz et al. 2010), and (iii) the number and the type of the elements at risk (E) (Glade and Crozier 2005). Finally, the risk assessment can be used for the quantification of the potential economic losses due to landslide occurrence. Nevertheless, this goal might result hard to reach because the estimation of the possible losses due to landslides is a difficult task for the variety of potentially exposed elements (e.g. UNISDR et al. 2009), particularly important when looking at the urban context. The widespread presence of man and his activities has often led to an uncontrolled urban sprawl that exacerbates the effect of natural hazards (Geneletti et al. 2007). For the complexity of this multi-level analysis, studies that include more than one type of exposed element are scarce (e.g. Michael-Leiba et al. 2003; Keiler 2004; Marin and Modica 2017; Promper and Glade 2016) and exhaustive landslide risk evaluations can be performed at local scale (site specific) (e.g. Cardinali et al. 2002). For wider areas, simplified approaches are preferred as a trade-off between the need to provide quantitative, reliable and reproducible estimations and the scarce and heterogeneous data available over wide areas. In this paper, we defined an easy to understand and replicable measure for recognizing the propensity of a large area to suffer landslide damage and consequently for estimating the related potential economic losses. For this purpose, we proposed a simplified method that combines the landslide susceptibility (i.e. the probability of landslide occurrence in an area due to local conditions, see Brabb 1984; Guzzetti et al. 2005, 31,32,a, b) with the potential economic losses in terms of real-estate market values that turn to be a proxy for the overall economic exposure. We therefore are able to define a measure of the economic landslide susceptibility capable of capturing the probability of landslide occurrence in an area weighted for its socio-economic exposure. This measure is able to provide a proxy of the relative potential socio-economic costs due to landslides of the area under analysis. Therefore, the economic landslide susceptibility might be thought as a synthetic indicator that captures the combined effects of the physical and the socio-economic aspects of an anthropized territory subject to landslide. The method is tested in a risky landslide prone region, Umbria (Central Italy), for the abundance of landslides both in rural and urban areas (Guzzetti et al. 2003) and for the availability of reliable landslide susceptibility models (Mateos et al. 2014). Overall, our approach provides the economic values of areas that are susceptible to landslides. Therefore, we get closer to the potential losses (in relative terms) of an area considering the potential occurrence of landslides, at regional scale that is not common in this kind of literature. Aim of this study is to provide the propensity of an area in suffering a damage as input for land planning, providing the ground for enhanced decisions both in risk management and in land use planning, by means of an interdisciplinary approach. Defining the potential losses in relative terms (and not in absolute ones), two main issues might arise. Firstly, the replicability of the work is not guaranteed per se because it depends on the availability of homogeneous and standardized data. Secondly, defining the potential economic losses in terms of real-estate market values as a proxy for the overall economic exposure might lead to underestimated results in countries where informal or illicit settlements have relevantly high numbers. This might be particularly true in some cities around the world where informal settlements are located in places that are prone to disasters (see e.g. Berdegué et al. 2015; Iovino et al. 2020; Marx et al. 2013; and Pelling 2003). Thus, the evidence provided in this work does not allow a blind replication of the method without a preliminary adaptation that takes into consideration all these relevant issues, even though the relative interpretation of the results of our research might allow, in principle, an overall generalized application of the method presented in this paper. Other important points to take into consideration are that: (i) the scarcity of economic performance data at urban or even sub-urban scale—that might be common in many countries—is in contrast with the detailed resolution of susceptibility maps; (ii) the direct estimate of potential economic costs caused by landslides should be done in an ex ante perspective as to better provide planning solutions for the policy makers; (iii) results should be replicable to other regions, and the choice of economic variables must be therefore beyond the local specialties. For all these reasons, we used the market value of buildings (price of property per m2), grouped by the typologies provided by the ‘Osservatorio del Mercato Immobiliare’ (OMI) of the Italian Revenue Agency in order to approach the socio-economic values of the area under analysis and to provide, in relative terms, a good proxy for potential losses caused by landslides in an ex ante perspective. The reasons for this choice are several and in line with the concept of spatial equilibrium (see Takayama and Judge 1970; and Wieand 1987): (i) houses and lands are much more expensive in more amenable areas and cheaper in less favourable sites. This is true both considering the so-called natural amenities (e.g. pleasant climatic conditions), and the socio-economic benefit (e.g. proximity to the workplace, Di Pasquale and Wheaton 1996); (ii) population growth, income, wages, services, construction costs and taxes influence the market value of housing (Ozanne and Thibodeau 1983); (iii) empirical studies have shown a positive relationship between housing values and consumption (Haurin and Rosenthal 2006); (iv) changes in the economic value of houses have effects on income (Engelhardt 1994; Sheiner 1995); (v) the permanent income hypothesis of Friedman (Friedman 1957) seems to provide the first theoretical understanding regarding the wealth effect of housing prices. The intuition is simple: since housing is an important component of wealth of people, a (unexpected) higher or lower housing value affects the “expected lifetime wealth” of households (Miller et al. 2009); (vi) localization factors related to climate and socio-economic aspects are much more influential than the damage risk caused by natural disasters (Benson and Clay 2004). Therefore, the link between property value and economic performance, though not quite explicit, is in any case very robust. For this reason, the analysis of economic landslide susceptibility is based on the mapping of the market value of real estate weighted for the ‘physical’ susceptibility of an area subject to landslides. One might observe that the economic susceptibility of different types of housing might change according to the type of buildings under consideration (e.g. residential buildings are different from productive buildings both in terms of exposure and vulnerability). However, we would like to stress that our value of exposure is a weighted value that takes into account the different types of buildings and it has to be read in relative terms according to the area under analysis. In fact, this is a synthetic relative value of an exposed area aggregated for all the types of housing values. However, this proxy can be disaggregated in the different components of property price buildings as to take into account the peculiarities of the area (e.g. we could define economic landslide susceptibility maps that show only the productive buildings). Overall, this work defines a methodology that can be adapted and modelled considering the socio-economic peculiarities of the different areas. We organized the paper pointing out to the difficulties to combine the risk analysis and the economic evaluation in the land planning contest (Sect. 2), then we introduced the study area, i.e. Umbria Region (Central Italy) (Sect. 3). The input data and the method used are illustrated in Sect. 4 and in Sect. 5 respectively. In Sect. 6 our results are presented and finally, in Sect. 7 we discussed the method and in Sect. 8 we gave the main conclusions.",6

Short-term emergency reactions in a cross-country perspective. Cases from Chile, Ecuador, Italy",October 2020,César Andrés Mendoza,Giulio Breglia,Benjamín Jara,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Humans have lived in contact with potential harmful natural phenomena since the beginning of history (Pelling 2003), but events such as earthquakes rarely release their force over human settlements so strongly, that end up reshaping their social order in what we call a disaster. We can firmly assess that “a natural disaster is not a natural event” (Hallegatte 2014, p. 9), because nature forces can be followed and even the strongest event can cause very few casualties. Moreover, in many cases that qualify as a disaster, the hardest time was the medium-term after the tragedy, when institutions were not always able to rearrange a new harmonic situation and many conflicts arose (Alexander 2000). For these reasons, many scholars consider it more appropriate to consider the human perspective and define such disasters as “socio-natural” (Arteaga and Ugarte 2015). From an economic point of view, these events cause disruption to the functioning of an economic system, with significant negative impacts on well-being, assets, production factors, output, employment, and/or consumption (Hallegatte 2014). When an earthquake or any other natural disaster occurs, there are direct and indirect costs a region should bear. Direct costs are the ones showing an effect on the physical environment, labor and housing markets in the affected areas, while indirect costs are the ones that slow productive systems and lower purchasing power, with potential negative spillover effects. One of the most relevant markets influenced both by indirect and direct costs is the labor market (Meyer et al. 2013). We know that many countries are heterogeneous (economically, culturally and institutionally), so in order to have a broader vision on how local labor markets change after these events, we explore short-term changes across three countries in this study: Italy (European high income), Chile (South American high income) and Ecuador (South American upper middle income). To obtain a broader perspective of the post-disaster labor market adjustment mechanisms, we develop a comparative analysis between these countries in order to understand and systematize the main differences and similarities of their labor market dynamics. Disasters can generate ambiguous economic effects in the short and long run (Skidmore and Toya 2002; Rampa 2020), but specific economic effects will depend on the context and region in which the event occurs. Earthquakes often destroy local productive infrastructure in the affected areas and cause severe damage to dwellings, private and public infrastructure, e.g.: schools, hospitals, buildings, machinery, equipment, roads, electric transmission lines, among others (Committee for Reconstruction and Productive Reactivation 2016). Therefore, it is reasonable to think that labor markets dynamics within the seismic zones will be affected. Research in this area has documented increases in unemployment (Xiao and Feser 2014) and shifts towards informality (Mendoza and Jara 2020), how job seekers change their behavior (Ohtake et al. 2012) and mismatches between job offers and demand (Higuchi et al. 2012; Ohtake et al. 2012). Earthquakes could also cause structural changes in the medium or long run (Belasen and Polachek 2008; Mehregan et al. 2012). Some economic sectors linked to the reconstruction will experience a boom during the reconstruction period (Chang and Rose 2012); new industries could be born and replace inefficient infrastructure (Ohtake et al. 2012; Xiao and Nilawar 2013). In order to understand how local labor markets change in the aftermath of an earthquake we use individual labor surveys for each country, focusing in three specific ways local labor markets adapt to new scenarios: (1) employment, (2) wage, and (3) worked hours. Our research objective is to find out whether individuals located within the most seismic regions in each country had a positive or negative likelihood of being employed, increase their wages or change their worked hours. Our empirical strategy consists in a descriptive analysis that compares post-disaster dynamics of labor markets in each country. Firstly, we present descriptive comparisons of labor income differences for affected and unaffected areas between pre and post disaster periods in each country. Second, we perform Mincerian regressions and double difference (DD) estimations, for labor income and worked hours in order to find out if there was an earthquake effect in regional labor markets. Third, we estimate the likelihood of being employed using logistic regressions using a nonlinear DD approach. To compare countries appropriately, we choose specific regions as areas affected by the corresponding earthquakes: (i) the provinces of Manabí and Esmeraldas for Ecuador, (ii) the region of Maule and Biobío for Chile, and (iii) the Abruzzo region for Italy. We found significant associations between the earthquakes and labor market dynamics in the short term. Distributional differences showed that the earthquakes probably had heterogeneous effects on wages (depending on the labor income quintile). Mincerian wage regressions and DD estimates found higher labor income and worked hours for males and females in Ecuador. In Chile no effect was found, and in Italy we found a positive (significant) effect only for females, who increased their working hours. Finally, we did not find a short run association between the earthquakes and the probability of being employed for individuals located in seismic areas. This article is divided in six sections, the next section introduces the relevant literature of regional labor markets after a disaster, Sect. 3 describes our empirical cross-country comparison methodology and dataset, Sect. 4 presents information of the three case studies and the dataset that we used in our analysis, Sect. 5 shows the results, and Sect. 6 discusses and concludes.",5

C. Teixeira,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Regional income inequality is an important social, political and economic issue that has gained considerable attention in the last few years (Abdullah et al. 2015; Marchand et al. 2020). The geography of within-region income inequality (inequality in household income distribution in a region) (Gbohoui et al. 2019),Footnote 1 as well as the determinants of these distributional differences remain essentially a ‘black box’, to echo the words of Rodríguez-Pose and Tselios (2009b). Researchers have long established that there is no general theory or conceptual framework of income distribution that can help us understand the causes of regional inequality, which is somewhat surprising due to the proclaimed concern of rising income inequality—former President Obama has even called it the “defining challenge of our time” (Wei 2015; Martinus 2018; Capello 2019). Rather, several competing explanations have been offered, being tied to changes in economic conditions, socio-demographic characteristics of regions, spatial characteristics of labour markets and institutional factors (Breau 2007, 2015; Castells-Quintana et al. 2015; Afandi et al. 2017). The relevant empirical literature has evaluated the impact of one or few determinants on regional income inequality, but produced ambiguous results (MacPhail 2000; Jung et al. 2018; Odoardi et al. 2020). Given that those studies differ considerably in their characteristics, namely the countries and time span considered, structure of the data, estimation techniques and measurement of income inequality, it is likely such differences be important factors explaining the diversity in the studies’ findings. The ambiguity and heterogeneity of results of the extant empirical literature calls for further investigation through a systematic literature review involving a meta-analysis. This method is specifically designed to integrate and evaluate econometric estimates of different studies on a given topic (Forza and Di Nuzzo 1998; Stanley and Doucouliagos 2012), in order to scrutinize patterns among the determinants of regional income inequality and identify, discuss, and quantify the sources of heterogeneity (Stanley 2001; Greenland and O’Rourke 2008). There are a few meta-analyses dealing with the issue of income inequality, but they focus on mainly a country level perspective, not on regions. Some meta-analyses scrutinize the impact of FDI (Huang et al. 2020), financial liberalization (Ni and Liu 2019), and education (Abdullah et al. 2015) on countries’ income inequality. Other meta-analyses examine the reverse perspective, assessing the impact of a country’s income inequality on economic growth (de Dominicis et al. 2008; Neves et al. 2016), collective action (Rosenbaum et al. 2016), depression (Patel et al. 2018), subject well-being (Ngamaba et al. 2018) and crime (Kim et al. 2020). Our paper contributes to the literature on income inequality at regional level by performing a systematic literature review resorting to meta-analysis involving the examination of a large set of determinants of within-region income inequality. It constitutes a novel contribution to this literature by permitting not only to uncover the most frequently referred within-region income inequality determinants, but also to reveal which of these determinants most impact on within-region income inequality. Using 33 comparable empirical studies spanning 29 years of research, we address three interrelated research questions: (1) Which are the most frequently mentioned determinants of within-region income inequality? (2) Which are the determinants that most impact on within-region income inequality? and (3) What factors explain the variation in the reported average effect size estimates? Hence, we have attempted to unlock the ‘black box’ of the determinants of regional income inequality and suggest potentially fruitful lines for future inquiry of the phenomenon under analysis. After adjusting for publication bias and heterogeneity in the results reported by the primary studies, we find that: (i) the rather unexplored institutional related determinants (financial development, fiscal policies and public sector size), substantially contribute to reduce within-region income inequality, particularly in lower-income settings; (ii) technological intensity and, predominantly, region level of development and urbanization exacerbates within-region income inequality; and (iii) the variation in the reported average effect size estimates is mainly explained by countries’ income level, geographical location, and sample size. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 presents a brief review of the theoretical literature on the main determinants explaining regional income inequality. Sect. 3 provides a description of the studies used in the meta-analysis and a detailed explanation of the criteria for their selection. Sect. 4 employs meta-analytical techniques to estimate the average size effect of the different income inequality determinants and test for the presence of publication bias. Sect. 5 employs multivariate meta-regression analysis to explain the heterogeneity in the studies’ findings. Sect. 6 concludes.",3

Conceptual thoughts and evidence from the Ruhr,October 2021,Robert Hassink,Matthias Kiese,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"We live in times of increasing economic and political instability in large parts of the world. Politically, we can observe a surge of populism in many Western countries (Trump, Brexit, France), with ever-louder anti-establishment, nationalistic voices, particularly from (former) old industrial regions, such as the Rust Belt in the USA and Northern England (Rodrik 2018; Hobor 2013). Media reports show that deindustrialization and uneven development have been recently clearly linked to current times of economic and political instability, both between countries but certainly also between regions within countries (see for instance, Economist 2016). It has certainly led to a reviving interest in the Rust Belt, deindustrialization and its long-term consequences and the geographies of discontent both in the US (see for instance McQuarrie 2017; Trubek 2018) and Europe (Dijkstra et al. 2018; Rodríguez-Pose 2018). Part of the problem, however, also lies in perceptions: “what arouses popular opposition is not inequality per se, but perceived unfairness” (Rodrik 2018, p. 18). Moreover, Rodríguez-Pose (2018, p. 204, 205) recently stated in this context: “… local inhabitants … want opportunities rather than assistance and aid; they want a future rather than permanent support. It is in these circumstances when they feel at their most vulnerable …” and went on that “territorial inequality, persistent lack of opportunities and incapacity and/or unwillingness to move are at the root of a resentment that is lightning the fire of territorially based populism. Withdrawing intervention in these areas will inevitably add fuel to the fire” (ibid., 204). The restructuring of these (former) old industrial areas/regions and ‘Rust Belt’ economies, as a particular kind of lagging regions, have, in fact, generated much attention in economic geography (Hu and Hassink 2016; Bluestone and Harrison 1982; Martin and Rowthorn 1986). Studying the fall and necessary restructuring and adaptability of regional economies obviously has not only a long tradition in Europe and North America; more recently, we see also more and more studies in East Asia (see Hassink et al. 2018). Old industrial regions can be regarded as geographically concentrated mono-structural agglomerations dominated by either heavy and natural resource-based or light industries that structurally suffer from deindustrialization and high unemployment (Hu and Hassink 2016). The problems and legacies caused by old industrial regions in industrialized countries are persistent and can have long-term effects, even after the industries have largely disappeared, when they could be regarded as former old industrial regions. Some of the latter still suffer from the problems and legacies of the past, illustrated by for instance the impact of Rust Belt voters in the USA on the outcome of the 2017 presidential election, and of voters in former old industrial regions in Northern England on the Brexit referendum (Economist 2016). This voting behavior reflects the variety of economic trajectories that (former) rustbelt regions have taken in different dimensions: the shift of output and employment from mining and manufacturing to services, the transformation into innovation-driven knowledge economies (“structural change 2.0” according to Kiese 2019), and the resulting restoration of prosperity and employment opportunities for broad constituencies. Former rustbelt regions have progressed very differently along these axes. Where regions are situated on this continuum between old industrial regions, still having a strong but declining old industrial base, and former old industrial regions, which have gone through a successful restructuring process, is thus an empirical question. By using (former) old industrial regions, we indicate that we are dealing with a broad category of regions, of which some can be seen as lagging regions, that is regions with below average economic and innovation indicators. Although the outcomes of restructuring processes in (former) old industrial regions differ strongly from case to case due to spatially specific preconditions, heterogeneous actions of agents and the different historically conditioned national political structures and varieties of capitalism in which these agents are embedded (Hassink 2010), some general theoretical concepts have been developed. In one way or another, many of the recent studies on (former) old industrial regions and their adaptability (for an overview, see Hu and Hassink 2016) point at the evolutionary terms path dependence and lock-ins as the main internal barriers to industrial restructuring (Grabher 1993; Hassink 2010). Path dependence refers to a process or system “whose outcome evolves as a consequence of the process’s or system’s own history” (Martin and Sunley 2006, p. 399). The related lock-ins are defined as the “… the idea that the combination of historical contingency and the emergence of self-reinforcing effects steers a technology, industry or regional economy along one ‘path’ rather than another” (Martin 2010, p. 3). Although these definitions are open-ended, as is also indicated by so-called positive and negative path dependence and lock-ins, most studies on old industrial regions and their adaptability refer to the negative ones, stressing lacking capacity of adaptability in regional economies due to their specific history (Hassink 2010). Recently, Blažek et al. (2020) shed new light on path decline by classifying this process according to the main underlying causes into three partly interrelated and overlapping types: path contraction, path downgrading and path delocalization. Particularly path contraction can be observed in deindustrializing old industrial regions. Path creation, as another evolutionary concept used in relation to regional economic adaptability, can be an option to transform regional economies from a negative path into related but newly created paths (Martin 2010; Hassink et al. 2019). Most recently, path transformation is discussed in the context of old industrial regions and mature clusters (Chaminade et al. 2019; Baumgartinger-Seiringer et al. 2021). Baumgartinger-Seiringer et al. (2021, p. 161) define it as “radical, innovation-based forms of path development, where an established path and the regional support structures it is embedded in are undergoing major change”. Whereas path dependence, path creation, lock-in, often focus on those parts of a regional economy with a strong industrial specialization, such as clusters or industrial districts, related and unrelated variety is a concept stressing the advantages of specialization vs. diversity for the adaptability of a regional economy as a whole. On the one hand, variety is seen as a source of regional knowledge spillovers, measured by related variety (a high degree of technologically related sectors in a region). On the other hand, in the case of unrelated variety, variety is regarded as a portfolio protecting a region from external shocks (Frenken et al. 2007). Given the recently changing circumstances, which policy solutions can be thought of to solve the specific problems of this kind of lagging regions and to what theories are they linked? On the one hand, theories stemming from geographical economics are oriented towards equilibrium-thinking, and develop one-size-fits all, place-neutral (or spatially-blind) policy solutions (Barca et al. 2012). These theories have been criticized for not being sensitive to geographical differences (Martin 2011). Moreover, since they are strongly linked to the neoliberal capitalism that is in crisis, they are not considered to be in a good position to provide alternative models of development (Economist 2016). On the other hand, the above-mentioned evolutionary theories in economic geography, which are often based on heterodox economics, are arguably stronger, leading to tailor-made, place-based policy solutions (Barca et al. 2012; Barca 2019). Smart specialization can be clearly seen as the most recent place-based regional policy strategy that has been popular in Europe. However, apart from some recent papers on old industrial regions and smart specialization in Ukraine or other Eastern European cases without an EU policy (see Amosha et al. 2018; Shevtsova et al. 2020), so far little literature has been published on evaluating the potential impact of this policy strategy on the restructuring of (former) old industrial regions. One clear exception is the Basque Country, which is arguably the best-researched former old industrial region regarding both cluster and smart specialization policy. Following its successful transformation, the Basque Country is now one of the wealthiest regions with above-average innovation performance in Spain (European Commission 2021). Aranguren and Wilson (2013), for instance, focus on learning processes from clusters for the development of regional smart specialization in the Basque Country, whereas Estensoro and Larrea (2016) deal with the implementation of smart specialization. For other work on this region, see Morgan (2016) and Valdaliso et al. (2014), and for a broader discussion on lagging regions and smart specialization, see Barzotto et al. (2020). Surprisingly little has been written on smart specialization in the Ruhr, the largest former old industrial region in Western Europe. In this paper, we therefore critically discuss the potential of smart specialization to solve restructuring problems of (former) old industrial regions. In Section 2, we will introduce the smart specialization policy strategy further and will also discuss on a conceptual level whether it can tackle the specific problems and issues in (former) old industrial regions. In Section 3, we will elaborate on a typical example of a former old industrial region, namely the Ruhr in Germany, and critically reflect on the contribution of smart specialization to structural change in that region. Section 4 will provide some conclusions and outlook on further research.",14

The European Union (EU) ambition is to be among the most competitive and innovative regions globally, and this ambition is reflected in national and regional “smart specialisations” and place-based development strategies. Also, the geographical co-location of innovative actors has been acknowledged as a key driver of regional competitiveness, and the phenomenon of localised knowledge spillovers is considered an explanation for the spatial concentration of innovative activities (Guastella and Van Oort 2015). So, it is clear that the evaluation of innovation performance at the regional level has become essential. However, there are many problems with measuring innovation at the regional level, mainly due to the scarcity of regional innovation data. As one of the few options, the Regional Innovation Scoreboard (RIS) can be used as a data source, containing statistical facts on regions’ innovation performance. For the comparative assessment of the performance of innovation systems at the regional level, a composite indicator—the Regional Innovation Index (RII) or its components can be applied. The RIS 2019 provides a comparative assessment of the performance of innovation systems across 238 regions of 23 EUFootnote 1 Member States, Norway, Serbia, and Switzerland. The RII is limited to using regional data for 17 indicators (for more details, see Hollanders et al. 2019), and according to RII, Europe’s regions have been classified into four innovation performance groups: Innovation Leaders (38 regions), Strong Innovators (73 regions), Moderate Innovators (97 regions), and Modest Innovators (30 regions). Fig. 1 presents these regional performance groups, and, in addition, each performance group is split into a top one-third (assigned with a ‘+’), middle one-third, and bottom one third (assigned with a ‘−’) regions (Hollanders et al. 2019; Furková 2020). Regional innovation performance groups. (Source: author’s elaboration based on the RIS 2019 (Hollanders et al. 2019)) Following Fig. 1, mainly the regions of Switzerland, Germany, Finland, and Sweden, are among the top one-third high performing groups. On the other hand, most Eastern European regions, regions of Spain and the South of Italy, perform relatively low on the RII indicator. Innovation among the European regions is not uniformly distributed, but innovation tends to be spatially correlated. Geographical concentration and localisation into clusters of innovative companies or research centres enable exploiting technological development and sharing experiences with similar technologies, knowledge, and so forth. Although knowledge and innovation are difficult to measure, their production often generates unintended benefits for other agents. These spillover benefits are perceived as “localised” and, hence, supposed to cause of the geographical co-location of innovative activities (Guastella and Van Oort 2015). The short discussion above suggests that spatial aspects may significantly influence European innovation activities. Firstly, we assume that there are innovation spillover effects across European regions, i.e., spatial autocorrelation. Secondly, at the same time, we assume an uneven distribution of innovation activities across the European regions, i.e., spatial heterogeneity. Spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity represent two cornerstones of spatial econometrics. Spatial heterogeneity is frequently introduced simultaneously with spatial autocorrelation, and, in practice, the two can be difficult to take apart from each other (Pace and LeSage 2004; Geniaux and Martinetti 2018). However, with few exceptions, spatial econometric tools to address both of these problems at the same time are considerably rare. For instance, the study of Geniaux and Martinetti (2018) suggests a new method in which the regression parameters and the spatial autocorrelation parameter can vary over space. In the EU context, regional development investments (according to a new EU cohesion policy for 2021–2027) strongly focus on one of the main objectives, “Smarter Europe”, through innovation, digitisation, economic transformation and support to small and medium-sized businesses. Similarly, as in a previous cohesion period, a cohesion policy keeps on investing in all regions, still based on three categories of the regions (less-developed; transition; more-developed). The allocation of funds is still largely based on GDP per capita. However, a more tailored approach to regional development is applied. For instance, new criteria for funds allocations are added to better reflect the reality on the ground, and locally-led development strategies are supported. This seems to be very important in terms of the regions’ strengths and an efficient spending of financial funds. In the context of the European innovation problem, likely, heterogeneous effects of research and development (R&D) on innovation can be expected within different groups of regions. The great challenge for the EU regional policies seems to be that financial funds should be transferred to those locations or regions where their usage will be effective. In addition, a new EU cohesion policy emphasises cross-border cooperation across the EU regions and cooperation outside the EU with a specific strand for outermost regions. Through various policy instruments and programmes supporting such cooperation, regional performance can be significantly positively influenced. In addition, spillover effects can spread beyond the supported regions. It is clear that one of the main aims of the R&D or innovation policies is an increase of innovation outputs. Our analysis provides evidence on heterogenous effects of R&D inputs on innovation output of regions. We differentiate between advanced and lagging regions, rural and non-rural regions, and finally, the effect of post-socialist history of the regions was also examined. The results suggest that the effectiveness of policies that aim at increasing specific R&D inputs might differ significantly across region types. Concerning the discussion above, the paper aims to consider both spatial effects simultaneously (spatial heterogeneity and autocorrelation) in European innovation modelling. A new class of data generating processes (DGP), called MGWR-SAR (Mixed Geographically Weighted Regression—Spatial Autoregressive), was the main methodological tool of the analysis. Within the MGWR-SAR, the regression parameters can vary over the space and a spatial autocorrelation term is added to the model. We apply the Regional Knowledge Production Function (RKPF) concept to analyse regional innovation determinants. The regions presented in Fig. 1 form the base for our analysis. As an innovation output, we choose Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications. As innovation inputs we consider Scientific publications among the top-10% most cited publications worldwide; R&D expenditure in the business sector; Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME) introducing product or process innovations; and Human resources in science and technology (in an interactive form with dummy variables reflecting rural regions and regions of post-socialist countries). The empirical part of the paper focuses on the following main hypotheses. We assume that there is a global level of spillover effects among the European regions, i.e., changes in innovation inputs in a specific region affect the number of patent applications not only the region itself, but these changes also have significant impacts on neighbouring regions. At the same time, we dealt with the question of spatial differentiation of the model parameters. We assume that the effects of innovation inputs on innovation output differ across regions, mainly between regions among the top innovators and lagging regions. Therefore, heterogeneous responses to regional policy measures should be considered, and it is necessary to apply a more individual approach to the regional development of innovation activities. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 1.1 provides a literature review; Sect. 2 includes the main theoretical backgrounds of the study. The data and empirical results are presented and interpreted in Sect. 3. The main concluding remarks and discussion can be found in Sect. 4, and the paper closes with references. So far, empirical studies on regional innovation provide these main findings (Hollanders et al. 2019): first, innovation is not uniformly distributed across the regions; secondly, innovation tends to be spatially concentrated over time; and finally, even regions with similar innovation capacity have different economic growth patterns. However, the fact that spatial aspects strongly influence innovation has been neglected for a relatively long time. One of the reasons may be the lack of specialised technologies, geographic systems, and software. These specialised tools allow access to geocoded data, which significantly impact using models and spatial econometrics methods. Consequently, spatial effects—spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity, could be considered within the context of econometric modelling of innovation activities. The term spatial autocorrelation is a measure of similarity (correlation) between nearby observations, and the term spatial heterogeneity pertains to the variation in relationships in space. There are two distinct aspects of spatial heterogeneity, namely structural instability and heteroscedasticity. Structural instability refers to varying structural parameters over space, and heteroscedasticity stands for different error variances of the spatial units. Among the first studies where spatial interactions and aspects have already been considered (not only in the field of modelling of innovation activities) can be mentioned: Jaffe et al. (1993), Feldman (1994), Feldman and Florida (1994), Audretsch and Feldman (1996), Anselin and Varga (1997), Anselin et al. (2000a), Anselin et al. (2000b) or Acs et al. (2002). The concept of Knowledge Production Function (KPF) represents a fundamental approach to analyse determinants of innovation. The estimation of KPF dates back to Griliches (Griliches 1979; Pake and Griliches 1980), who also proposed to analyse regional innovation activities based on the Regional Knowledge Production Function (RKPF). Audretsch and Feldman (2004) state that knowledge can be local, and knowledge can also spread in space because there is no reason why the dissemination of knowledge should stop, e.g., at a region’s border. The knowledge that is generated in one region can spread to other regions, influencing their innovation activities. Geographical proximity allows knowledge to spread more quickly. Such spatial interconnection motivated a modified specification of the RKPF model to capture external regional innovation activities that could potentially affect neighbouring regions’ innovation process. Jaffe (1989) was the first who introduced the RKPF model, which considered the spatial context. Studies that dealt with the analysis of innovative activities in the spatial context and considered so-called spillover effects of knowledge, include Audretsch and Feldman (1996), Moreno et al. (2005a), Moreno et al. (2005b), Kumar (2008), Khan (2012), Charlot et al. (2015), Guastella and van Oort (2015) or Furková (2019). In particular, apart from the standard Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method used by, e.g., Audretsch and Feldman (1996), regional innovation analyses of spillover effects were performed mainly using spatial autoregressive models, which account for spatial dependence through spatially lagged variables. This spatial econometric approach was the basis of the RKPF estimation in the studies of Moreno et al. (2005a), Moreno et al. (2005b) or Khan (2012). Furková (2019) provides a quantification and statistical verification of direct, indirect and total impacts of innovation inputs. In addition, spatial partitioning of innovation impacts was examined. Charlot et al. (2015) propose a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) framework to model the complex relationship between innovation output (patents applications) and observable and unobservable determinants of new knowledge at the regional level. They investigate that the European Union (EU) RKPF shows heterogeneous effects of research and development (R&D) on innovation. They researched whether the regions that are eligible for the highest level of support from the EU structural funds show heterogeneous dynamics compared to the other, historically more prosperous, and more developed regions. Spatial heterogeneity and interregional research spillovers in European innovation were also of interest in a study by Guastella and van Oort (2015). As in the previous case, the GAM model was estimated, but compared to Charlot et al. (2015), a non-parametric trend based on geographical coordinates was added to a parametric specification of GAM to deal with the spatial heterogeneity. Generally, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is a popular spatial regression technique to deal with spatial heterogeneity. This approach was used by Furková (2016) to handle the problem of spatial heterogeneity of innovative activity across NUTS 2 European Union regions. However, the problem of spatial heterogeneity is an often-neglected issue. In addition, spatial heterogeneity rarely explored simultaneously with spatial autocorrelation, not only when regional innovation is concerned. Spatial econometric models and methods for dealing at the same time with both issues can rarely be found in the theoretical literature. However, some exceptions are emerging. For instance, Geniaux and Martinetti (2018) introduced a new class of data generating processes (DGP), called MGWR-SAR, in which the regression parameters and the spatial autocorrelation parameter can vary over space.",3

Nevertheless, many employers encounter problems with recruiting employees, which constitutes an obstacle to the growth or even the survival of their ventures. In the Swedish context, approximately 1/3 of businesses perceive access to suitable labour and skills as an obstacle to growth, and this obstacle is regarded as a more important obstacle to growth than, for example, rules and regulations or access to finance (Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth 2020a). In addition to being an obstacle to firm growth, recruitment problems may lead to skill mismatches. According to the OECD (2016), approximately 40% of Swedish employees are mismatched in terms of qualifications, while approximately 10% are mismatched in terms of skills. At the aggregate level, skill mismatch implies a less efficient allocation of resources, and hence, skill mismatch will have negative effects on labour productivity (Adalet McGowan and Andrews 2015). Furthermore, skill mismatch is shown to have negative effects on, for example, earnings, job satisfaction and human capital accumulation (see, e.g., Mavromaras et al. 2013). Overall, recruitment problems and skill mismatches are identified as some of the main challenges facing the Swedish economy and have the potential to negatively influence economic growth (see, e.g., World Bank 2014). Recruitment problems and skill mismatches are expected to be particularly pronounced in small and remote rural regions. For many job applicants, peripheral areas are perceived to be less attractive than metropolitan areas and urban agglomerations (Buenstorf et al. 2018). According to the previous literature, workers in rural regions face a number of issues, including a lack of professional job opportunities; limited opportunities to gain and broaden their work experience and problems with accessibility, such as limited transport and mobility (De Hoyos and Green 2011). However, the problems that employers in rural regions face have received less attention in the literature (De Hoyos and Green 2011). The successful attraction and retention of employees in rural regions calls for thinking outside the box from the employer’s perspective. Are you someone who is looking to live a simpler life, close to nature, in an area that still believes in community meals and weekly jam sessions? We can’t give you big money, but we can give you an awesome life. (CBC News 2016a). A small family-owned business in the small village of Whycocomagh in Nova Scotia, Canada tried to recruit employees to this beautiful but less populated region using the above arguments in a Facebook ad. In addition to securing a job, employees willing to relocate would receive two acres of land (CBC News 2016a). This serves as one example of how employers use innovative initiatives to recruit employees to rural regions. Recruitment problems in rural regions have also been acknowledged by policymakers at both the regional and government levels. Policy efforts aimed at strengthening competencies are often appreciated and serve as a lever for company development (Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth 2016). However, as emphasized even by Swedish government authorities, knowledge of scarce competencies and recruitment in a regional context remains limited (Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth 2020b). This paper aims to contribute to knowledge on the recruitment of scarce competencies to rural regions. In the discussion of skills shortages in rural areas, attention has often been paid to recruitment problems and scarce competencies in the public sector, such as shortages of nurses and physicians (see, e.g., Jones et al. 2019), and the WHO (2010) has raised concerns about health worker shortages in rural areas of high-income countries. However, less attention has been given to such shortages in the business sector. Accordingly, to fill this research gap, this paper examines perceived shortages of scarce competencies and recruitment problems faced in both the public and business sectors. Are there differences in the severity of recruitment problems found in rural and nonrural municipalities? Employers’ recruitment to and retention of employees in rural areas cannot be studied in isolation. It is crucial to also consider demographic, economic, and political contexts (De Hoyos and Green 2011). Hence, this paper also aims to address policy perspectives and to discuss policies that can enhance the recruitment of scarce competencies. Which policies are perceived to be plausible and effective in enhancing the recruitment of scarce competencies to rural regions? The study’s empirical context focuses on a survey of representatives from 290 Swedish municipalities, 130 of which are defined as rural. This paper is organized into five sections. Sect. 2 discusses the theoretical arguments and previous empirical research regarding recruitment to rural regions. Furthermore, an overview of policy measures aimed at enhancing recruitment and retention to rural regions and of how they have been evaluated is provided. Section three describes the empirical and data collection approaches adopted. The empirical results are provided in section five. Finally, section five provides a concluding discussion.",3

Based on the empirical results of Hoekman et al. (2009), Morescalchi et al. (2015), Maggioni and Uberti (2007), Lata et al. (2015) and Lata et al. (2018), one can assume that co-patenting is highly distance sensitive and that (co-)patents are an expression of interactive innovation processes. The likelihood of interactive innovation processes and, in particular, co-patent activities occurring potentially decreases with increasing spatial distance between the involved parties (which can include firms, universities and individuals). Actors in cross-border regions are consequently more dependent on foreign actors than their domestic counterparts with regard to accessing complementary knowledge assets (Agostini and Caviggioli 2015; Arndt and Sternberg 2000). It is widely acknowledged that interactive (cross-border) innovation processes, for example those manifested in co-patents, are essential for firms and (cross-border) regions to achieve economic growth and competitiveness in the long term (Trippl 2010; Asheim and Isaksen 1997; Cooke et al. 1997). In addition, cross-border collaborations hold creative potentials as knowledge embedded in different (national) innovation systems is combined in such ventures (Fromhold-Eisebith 2007). However, cross-border regions are characterised by heterogeneous institutional settings (e.g., in terms of language, culture and formal regulations). Thus, interactive innovation processes are less likely to occur in cross-border regions when compared to relations within regions that are not separated by linguistic and/or country borders (Lundquist and Trippl 2013; Koschatzky 2000; Javidan et al. 2005). As one form of interactive innovation processes, co-patents in cross-border regions (i.e., patents developed in cooperation between actors from different countries and/or language areas) are of particular importance to the European Commission for two reasons: First, patent-related measures were an integral part of the Innovation Union, which was the core of the Europe 2020 strategy (European Commission 2011). These measures especially refer to the establishment of the interdependent ‘European Unitary patent’ and the ‘Unified Patent Court’. The inauguration of the former will enable patent applicants to obtain patent protection in all EU member states (with the exceptions of Croatia and Spain) by submitting a single patent (European Patent Office n.d.). Due to the elimination of national validation procedures, the costs (especially legal and translation fees) for patent protection in all 25 participating EU member states will be reduced by approximately 78% (European Commission 2015a). Furthermore, the ‘Unified Patent Court’ will, with the exceptions of Spain and Poland, eliminate cost- and time-intensive court procedures in all ‘Contracting Member States’ (Unified Patent Court n.d.). Second, the fact that the vast majority of the European Territorial Cooperation goal’s budget (around 78.4% of €9.6 billion) has been allocated to the explicit promotion of relatively small (Interreg A) cross-border regions highlights the relevance of these regions to the EU (European Commission 2015b; Interreg 2019). By exploring the determinants of cross-border co-patents as a proxy for interactive innovation processes and confining the analysis to relatively small cross-border regions, more specific implications for the EU’s Territorial Cooperation policy can be deduced. Cross-border co-patent activities in this paper are limited to ‘Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques’ (NUTS) 3 regions belonging to different sub-regions within one cross-border region (Sect. 3). More specifically, this paper aims to answer the following research question: Which determinants explain the magnitude of co-patents in European cross-border regions? The negative effect of spatial distance, technological (cognitive) distance and linguistic borders on co-patenting as well as research and development (R&D) collaboration between European NUTS 2 and 3 regions while controlling for country borders has been verified in multiple econometric studies (Lata et al. 2018, 2015; Scherngell and Barber 2009). By simultaneously investigating European integration effects (i.e., length of EU border, involvement of ‘Central and Eastern European Countries’ that joined the EU in 2004 or later), this paper further enriches the literature. Furthermore, the impact of sharing the same official language (on the NUTS 3 level) is accurately quantified in this paper by the computation of so-called incidence rate ratios. The remainder of this article is as follows: The literature review (including hypotheses) and the operationalisations of the variables of interest are presented in Sects. 2 and 3. Based on the results of the applied negative binomial regression models presented in Sect. 4, policy implications, the research outlook and the limitations of this paper are finally discussed in Sect. 5.",1

Peris,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"The main objective of the European Union (EU) is to strengthen the social and economic cohesion of the EU regions, as well as to reduce the inequalities among them. In doing so, and in accordance with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) are implemented through five main funds: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund (CF), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).Footnote 1 In order to support job creation, business competitiveness, economic growth, sustainable development, and improve citizens’ quality of life, the Regional Policy has allocated €351.8 billion -almost a third of the total EU budget- to the Cohesion Policy funds for the 2014–2020 period. According to the Panorama Inforegio magazine, support from the EU’s cohesion policy had led member states to experience a 5% growth in per capita gross domestic product. The bulk of Cohesion Policy funding, over 50%, is allocated to less developed European regions in order to help them to catch up and to reduce the economic, social and territorial disparities that still exist in the EU.Footnote 2 Among all the aforementioned funds, the present paper focuses on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which represents almost 44% of the total budget. These funds are allocated at the NUTS level 2, which is a regional classification providing a harmonized hierarchy of regions: the NUTS classification subdivides each member state into regions at three different levels, from larger to smaller areas. For practical reasons the NUTS classification generally mirrors the territorial administrative division of the member states, supporting availability of data and policy implementation capacity. Specifically, the NUTS regulation defines minimum and maximum population thresholds for the size of the NUTS regions: NUTS level 2 corresponds to regions with populations between 800,000 and 3,000,000 inhabitants. Taking into account this division, the regional eligibility for the ERDF is calculated on the basis of regional GDP per inhabitant (per capita), and NUTS level 2 regions are ranked and split into three different groups, according to their per capita GDP: \(R1\) corresponding to the most developed regions, \(R2\) which refers to transition regions, and \(R3\) which includes the less developed regions. Although the final decision on the way the budget is allocated is the result of a political bargaining process (between the European Commission and the Member States), an initial proposal is presented as a starting point. Nowadays, the European Commission proposes allocations using the so-called Berlin method. This is a methodology, devised in 1999, for allocating cohesion funds based on regional and national prosperity and unemployment. Our main objective is to propose a new initial proposal to distribute the ERDF budget. And we do it by using the claims problem approach.Footnote 3 A claims problem involves a set of agents demanding a part of some (perfectly divisible) endowment. It is a conflicting claims problem if the endowment cannot honor all the claims in full. If we consider the ERDF budget as the endowment to be allocated, and the claims consist of the amounts required to develop some projects (mainly in infrastructures: airports, universities, hospitals, etc.) that regions could not afford individually, it is noteworthy that the available budget is not enough to satisfy all the claims that the regions have on it. The most difficult and controversial part of our approach is to define the claim of each region. As the ERDF projects must be co-financed by the Member States (in a percentage that depends on the category of the region), it is up to these states to present the co-financed projects properly. An alternative way is to consider previous allocations and to observe the gap between the different region’s Gross Domestic Product (normalised in PPS euros). Once the projects have been selected, or each region’s claim has been fixed, the conflicting claims problem is well defined and the ERDF budget must be rationed by using well-known claims rules. As far as we know, the recent paper by Fragnelli and Kiryluk-Dryjska (2019) is the only reference analyzing the ERDF distribution as a conflicting claims problem. As mentioned in that paper “this approach has the great advantage that solutions may be obtained with a fast computation.” In this context, we should also mention the papers by Kiryluk-Dryjska (2014, 2018) that propose a formal framework for rural development budget allocation by using fair division techniques. Conflicting claims problems have also been used to analyze other related economic and social problems: in the education sector Pulido et al. (2002) use this approach for obtaining an efficient allocation of the university funds; in the fishing sector, it is a useful tool for searching possible solutions to address fish shortages, by proposing fishing quotas among a number of agents within an established perimeter (Iñarra and Prellezo 2008; Iñarra and Skonhoft 2008; Kampas 2015); or, in the negotiations on CO2 emissions, a relevant issue nowadays, Giménez-Gómez et al. (2016) and Duro et al. (2020) propose an appealing distribution by analyzing this situation as a conflicting claims problem. We consider the use of claims rules to propose an initial allocation for distributing the EU funds in order to achieve social cohesion and convergence among member states. In doing so, our first step is to formally introduce the distribution of the ERDF budget as a conflicting claims problem. Once this is implemented, we apply some of the usual claims rules and compare them from a convergence perspective (comparing changes in the inequality of regions once each of the proposals is applied). We define a convergence ratio to analyze this question. Our results show that the allocations proposed by all of the claims solutions reduce the divergence among regions. Moreover, we obtain that, among the analyzed claims solutions, the constrained equal losses performs better than the other ones and better than the current allocation, for the purpose of achieving the convergence objectives. Even though the EU has made significant efforts to “regularize” and “rationalize” the formal process for policy-making and the procedures for the negotiation of regional development programmes, the empirical evidence suggests that the interactions remain very complex and uncertain (Conzelmann 1998). As mentioned in Dotti (2015) “first, the EU and the member states decide general policy goals, the total budget and regional eligibility criteria. Next, each member state designs its own regional development strategies, according to the general framework and with the support of the EC (European Commission). In the final step, national and regional authorities have to implement regional development programmes, as agreed during previous phases and under the supervision of the EC.” Our proposal (the use of claims rules to solve the distribution problem) is about eliminating discretionary decisions and making the process of allocating the EU funds transparent. There are many papers analyzing the importance of ESIF funds in order to achieve greater social cohesion and economic growth among the European Union countries, most of them looking for the results obtained through the policies applied. For instance, Rodríguez-Pose and Fratesi (2004) apply cross-sectional and panel data analyses to observe the impact of European Structural Funds in Objective 1 regions; also Puigcerver-Peñalver (2007) studies the impact of the ESIF funds on the economic growth of the regions; Mohl and Hagen (2010) analyze the economic growth of the European Union countries, from a financial perspective, for the NUTS level 1 and NUTS level 2 regions; Bouayad-Agha et al. (2013) consider an econometric model to analyze the effect of the cohesion policies on the European economies; and Dall’Erba and Fang (2017) apply a meta-analysis with the objective of studying the impact generated by the ESIF funds on the development of the recipient regions. Some recent papers deal with political issues of the governance of the funds and the political/economic challenges. Bouvet and Dall’erba (2010) advocate that the decision process involves interaction between the actors (European Commission and Member States). Bodenstein and Kemmerling (2012) point out that the process of the distribution of regional funds has been termed a two or three-level game and the bargaining occurs between the regional and national actors. Chalmers (2013) provides some evidence that constitutionally strong regions are better lobbying advocates for investment projects. In Charron (2016) it is argued that “the determination of Structural Funds is based on an interaction between a region’s formal institutions (the level of a regional autonomy) and informal institutions (its government quality level).” Papp (2019) analyzes, for the case of Hungary, the electoral connection between legislators and voters, and the European Union’s contribution to regime legitimization. Finally, Crescenzi et al. (2020) argue that “in a context of rising economic nationalism and Euroscepticism, the value added of a supranational Cohesion Policy of the European Union is constantly under scrutiny” and propose to explore new institutional and policy arrangements in order to offer more flexibility and that “EU policies need to buy-in ‘national’ policy agendas in a more timely and systematic manner, sharing responsibility for (and ownership of) key policy reforms.” In this Eurosceptic scenario, the possibility of offering a neutral and fair initial point, as offered by the claims rules, could help to reach more consensual budget distributions. Moreover, the proposed claims rules can be supported by equity and fairness criteria. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Next, Sect. 2 formally presents the notion of conflicting claims problem and some of the main solutions in the literature. Sect. 3 presents the ERDF conflicting claims problems and applies the different claims solutions to the EU data. Sect. 4 analyzes and compares the proposed allocations from the point of view of convergence, and Sect. 5 studies the problem of ensuring some guarantees (in awards and in losses) for all regions. Some final comments in Sect. 6 conclude the paper.",3
42,1,Review of Regional Research,28 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-022-00165-2,The Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion and interstate migration in border regions of US States,April 2022,Friederike Seifert,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"States with relatively high welfare benefits are long believed to attract low-income individuals from lower-benefit states, acting as “welfare magnets” (Armenter and Ortega 2010; Borjas 1999; Brown and Oates 1987). Similar reasoning might apply to the expansion of public health insurance programs such as Medicaid. Notably, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes a Medicaid expansion from 2014 onward to low-income, non-disabled, working-age adults. However, not all states decided to implement it. Should expansion states then worry about an inflow of low-income individuals attracted by Medicaid? Previous studies could not find any state-level migration effects induced by Medicaid expansions (Alm and Enami 2017; Goodman 2017; Schwartz and Sommers 2014). However, much of this migration would arise in regions at the state border (McKinnish 2005). This phenomenon can strain border regions considerably, even if the overall state-level migration effects are negligible. Therefore, this paper aims at evaluating ACA Medicaid-induced border migration. It compares the in-migration of low-income, working-age individuals to border and interior regions of the same state before and after the ACA in difference-in-difference and triple difference frameworks based on individual-level American Community Survey (ACS) data (Ruggles et al. 2020). This paper is not the first to study border migration induced by the ACA Medicaid expansion. Most notably, Goodman (2017) considers migration of individuals from border regions to border regions by restricting its sample accordingly. However, this substantially decreases the available number of observations and results in statistical power issues, making it impossible for Goodman (2017) to identify any border migration effects. To overcome these issues, this paper uses the border-versus-interior-regions approach suggested by McKinnish (2005, 2007) and adapted to the 2006 Massachusetts Medicaid expansion by Alm and Enami (2017). This approach compares the evolution in migration rates to border regions to the ones of interior regions for the state enacting a reform. At a state border with a Medicaid coverage difference, the border regions on the expansion side should attract more in-migrants after the Medicaid expansion than before, and this increase should be larger than in interior regions. Using this approach, Alm and Enami (2017) could identify border migration effects for the Massachusetts Medicaid expansion. The contribution of the present study to the literature is twofold. First, it is the first one that applies the border-versus-interior-regions approach to the ACA Medicaid expansion and evaluates Medicaid migration effects for five states at once (Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, and New Mexico). Second, the present study extends until 2017, adding three more years to Goodman’s (2017) observation period. This allows both to increase the number of observations and study slightly longer-term effects of the Medicaid expansion on migration. This paper can only identify a statistically significant, positive Medicaid migration effect for Arkansas. The other states exhibit insignificant migration effects, which sometimes even turn negative, indicating that no Medicaid migration occurs. The differing results across states could stem from statistical power issues but might also result from state peculiarities. For Arkansas, the odds of having migrated are about 48% higher post-ACA in concerned border regions compared to before the ACA and interior regions. However, the effect is small in the aggregate due to the baseline migration odds of about 0.05. If all additional migrants take up Medicaid, the number of Medicaid beneficiaries in these regions increases by less than 4.2%. This increase seems manageable, probably not imposing a meaningful fiscal externality on regional budgets. The following section discusses the existing literature on public services migration in the US in more detail. Sect. 3 provides background on the ACA Medicaid expansion, the data, and study units, while Sect. 4 presents the empirical strategy and discusses the parallel trend test results. Sect. 5 presents the main results, while Sect. 6 discusses the reasons for the many insignificant results. Sect. 7 performs robustness checks, while Sect. 8 concludes.",
42,1,Review of Regional Research,01 June 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-022-00168-z,The fiscal consequences of immigration: a study of local governments’ expenditures,April 2022,Matti Viren,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this paper we study the fiscal consequences of migration. More precisely, we study the local authorities’ expenditures in Finland and scrutinize how the share of migrant population affects the (per capita) expenditures of public services.Footnote 1 The question is, are the per capita expenditures of local entities unrelated to immigration, and if not, how the expenditures develop with different levels (and structures) of immigration. By doing that we can cover an area which is rather poorly analyzed in most economy-wide analyses dealing with fiscal effects of immigrationFootnote 2. Practically all economy-wide analyses like Liebig and Mo (2013), Holmøy and Strøm (2012) and Alden and Hammarstedt (2016) concentrate on (net) income transfers to public sector and either ignore public consumption/production entirely or assume that per capita expenditures are equal with native population and immigrants. Although these assumptions can be defended by lack of data, they are not innocent and clearly require closer scrutiny. The local authorities’ view is particularly important for countries like Finland where most (over two thirds) of public services are provided by municipalities while the central government is in charge of most income transfers. Finnish municipalities are an interesting subject not only because of data reasons but also because of the rather special institutional set-up. Although Finnish municipalities have in principle a self-governing status they are rather service providers than independent decision-makers. The tasks and duties of municipalities are determined in the municipality law and more importantly the standard of services is controlled by the central government. A considerable part of municipalities income (over one fourth) comes from the central government so that the central government has a lot say of the quality of public services that are provided by the municipalities. Thus, the cross-municipality differences in expenditures can be interpreted rather from the “cost of providing services” than from the municipalities’ willingness to spend money point of view, even though that has also some role to play. Thus far, migration to Finland has been relatively small; people with foreign background represent only about six per cent of the total population and in many municipalities, there are only a few or even zero foreigners. On the other hand, in big cities the share is getting close to twenty per cent. At the same time immigrant population has become more heterogeneous. Thus, in the end of 2018, there were already immigrants from 202 countries (see the Appendix). In general, the effects of migration have been studied rather extensively although the emphasis has been on the labor market, where the hot potato has been the question whether immigration has a depressing on effect local residents wages (see e.g. Altonji and Card 1991). Here we skip that topic entirely and concentrate on the much narrower fiscal question of how the expenditures of municipalities are affected by immigration. In this branch of literature, there have been quite few studies. Thus, there is the study of Gerdes (2011), which makes use of data on Danish municipalities and the study of Jofre-Monseny et al. (2016) that deals with Spanish municipalities’ public spending in the early 2000. Both studies consider the issue mainly from the point of the welfare state trying to answer to the question: does immigration reduce or increase local welfare spending. The question goes back to Alesina et al. (1999) who argued strongly that ethnic fragmentation strongly reduces welfare spending, i.e. willingness to spend. Evidence of this is documented in e.g. Alesina et al. (2018, 2019). Also, Dahlberg et al. (2012) found that in Sweden, a larger immigrant population leads to less support for redistribution in the form of preferred social benefit levels. In the same way, Speciale (2012) found that immigration has a negative effect on education expenditures. A somewhat related hypothesis was presented by Razin et al. (2002) who argued that low-skilled immigration increases the cost of redistribution and thus reduces the demand for redistributive public spending. Stichnoth and Van der Straeten (2013) provide a review of the empirical literature on the effects of ethnic fractionalization on redistribution. Gerdes’ (2011) results are somewhat at odds with this “willingness” view although the results are not very clear-cut and depend on the indicator of welfare spending that is used in the estimating equation. Jofre-Monseny et al. (2016) arrive at somewhat different results indicating that local public spending decreases along with immigration density. However, results at the country level seem to contradict this pattern. Thus, Gaston and Rajaguru (2013) using cross-country data arrive at conclusion that immigration has rather increased than decreased welfare spending. As pointed out earlier, our purpose is not to test the Alesina hypothesis but rather to examine what is the fiscal (cost) impact of immigration on municipalities’ expenditures. In Finland, this issue has been studied earlier by Mäkelä and Viren (2018). They concluded that migration does indeed increase per capital expenditures. It is only that they had a rather short sample period and just part of the municipalities in the sample. The current study covers not only recent periods also periods when there were very few migrants (even zero) in Finnish municipalities and it also focusses on the nationality (altogether 202) and gender distribution of the migrant population instead of total number of immigrants only. Thus, we can study the expenditure effects of nationality related heterogeneity and also eventual effects of fragmentation e.g. by using the Herfindahl index for municipality level nationality shares. Next, we present the outline of the empirical analysis and the testable hypotheses in a more detailed way in Sect. 2. After that we introduce the estimating equation and in the same vein summarize the empirical results in Sect. 3. After going through the empirical analysis, we make some concluding remarks in the fourth section.",

42,2,Review of Regional Research,17 October 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-022-00172-3,The potential of small-scale spatial data in regional science,August 2022,Rolf Bergs,Rüdiger Budde,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In today’s research, the data supply of the official statistical offices forms the core basis for spatial analysis. In particular, the large-scale censuses provide the opportunity to put other data collections into an overall context. Census and survey-based data are the first important family of small-scale spatial data. Several developments that evolved independently have promoted the improvement of the supply of such traditional small-scale spatial data. Many public authorities worldwide provide some of their stored geographic data (often compiled over decades) on an open-access basis. On the internet, an increasing flood of information is provided. By using methods like web scraping (Gunawan et al. 2019), the number of possible data sources has risen to such an extent that it becomes indispensable to call their quality into question. Further data sources can be explored for scientific research by conducting targeted field research through structured interviews. Other kinds of information can be obtained by analyzing flows of goods from mail-order businesses and publishers or queries to search engines. Data traders use these sources since they provide essential information with strategic value at the firm level and for local policies. New data sources can be generated by transferring them to a geographical system using the stored addresses. By using such methods (also known as “geocoding” or “georeferencing”) (Goldberg 2008), it is possible to enrich existing spatial information with further attributes. Since this technique is relatively simple, it is now possible to tap into a broad spectrum of additional data sources. By using all these means, it is possible to delineate study areas so that the spatial units contribute to uncovering the specific phenomena under study. Small area level estimation is vital in light of a continual demand by data users for exact geographic detail in the published statistics and for various subpopulations. Traditional demographic sample surveys designed for national estimates do not provide large enough details to produce reliable direct estimates for small areas such as counties and even larger regions. Advanced statistical models can generate small area estimates with greater precision; however, the bias due to an incorrect model specification or failure to account for informative sampling needs to be considered. In fact, a great deal of such kind of small-scale data is produced by virtue of statistical estimation. Here advanced estimation techniques have been introduced and further refined during the last ten years, such as e.g., entropy econometrics (Fernández-Vázquez and Rubiera Morillon 2012; Zhang et al. 2014) or—yet more recently—data imputation by machine learning to precisely estimate gaps in data or generate granulated artificial data that comes significantly close to real data. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are a promising tool (Klemmer et al. 2019). A second family of small-scale spatial data is the realm of sensor-generated data. These are produced by ground-based technologies (e.g., air pollution, gauge, or rain observation stations) or remote sensing such as aerial images or satellite imagery. Day and night satellite data provided by the Sentinel missions (Copernicus) or the NOAAFootnote 1 are well-known examples. Worth mentioning are, e.g., daily global images of greenhouse gas emissions (Sentinel 5P), the DMSP-OLS composites provided by the NOAA until 2011/2012, and the new 14-bit on-board calibrated VIIRS images with a much stronger precision. The high spatial correlation between light emission and several socio-economic and environmental variables is a major advantage of using those data in socio-economic studies. Often, a direct environmental relationship is assumed between light emission and light pollution, the latter being associated with hive death or the disappearance of other insect species. Intuitively, nocturnal luminosity is also closely associated with anthropogenic activity, like the level of production, service provision and distribution by transport infrastructure (i.e., economic activity), energy consumption, and the related level of greenhouse emissions (Henderson et al. 2011; Chen and Nordhaus 2011; Mellander et al. 2015). Pinkovskiy (2017) used DMSP-OLS composites to estimate the structural breaks of economic growth along borders by applying a regression discontinuity design on light emission. The images and estimates presented in this study impressively show the diverging growth trends along the Ukrainian borders to the EU candidates Poland, Hungary, and Romania during 1992 to 2000. Proville et al. (2016) explored various relationships between light emission and economic activity by correlation analysis. As expected, electricity consumption and CO2 emissions are correlated most strongly with light emission (0.93). However, the correlation with GDP is only slightly lower (0.91). At first glance, such high levels of association would suggest using such digital imagery to estimate missing socio-economic data at a higher resolved scale. A major constraint for establishing stable relationships between different sorts of spatial data is spatial heterogeneity, such as varying land use or population density. All this implies a varying strength of correlation between luminosity and socio-economic and environmental variables along with different classes of land use. Machine learning technologies may open doors for an improved understanding of spatial data and its intrinsic relationships at different spatial scales. Nevertheless, in developing countries with poor official data infrastructure, DMSP and VIIRS have already played an important role in estimating income or environmental pollution (Ghosh et al. 2013). This Special Issue includes two papers using night satellite images, one is a study on Namibia exploring night light as a proxy to estimate wealth at a small-scale spatial level (Cf. the paper of Määttä et al. in this Special Issue). While survey and census-generated data have always been subject to anthropogenic error risk, such sensor-based data are likewise affected by possible errors. For satellite images, auroral light with disturbing artifacts, technical malfunctions of the sensor, pixel value outliers, light overglow, implications from different sensor technologies, and changing lighting technology are worth mentioning. Error removal in night sat images is possible (such as inter-calibration of image time series with improving sensor quality, removal of blooming, or removal of outliers) but can also be quite challenging, such as a correction of distorted variance implied by different lighting technologies, such as traditional lights versus LED (Kyba et al. 2017). The projection selected is also an essential criterion for properly interpreting the data. Pixel size adjustment is especially important for the observation of regions with a large latitude range because actual pixel sizes on the ground decline with growing distance from the equator. Hence, sensor-generated data should never be used under the prior assumption of “ready-to-use” and flawlessness. A third family of small-scale spatial data is hybrid data. Here survey and sensor-generated data are merged or further processed. Many such databases are open-access and presented by online viewers. Well-known examples are the EU CORINE database on land use. At Columbia University, the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) offers a broad range of global small-scale spatial data. One recent complement has been the NASA Covid-19 viewer (https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/mapping/popest/covid-19/). This database provides not only actual data on the spatial epidemiology of Covid-19, but also additional data on particulate matter at the endpoint, and 2020 population density at any scale and geographical clipping. Even though the scale of data differs among countries, the different data layers offer important insight into relationships between the local environment, population, and the pandemic. Further new composite databases comprise the Global High Resolution Daily Extreme Urban Heat Exposure. Combined with similarly resolved population data, this database offers a powerful tool for monitoring climate hazards and local resilience (https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/sdei-high-res-daily-uhe-1983-2016). The IÖR-Monitor, run by the German Leibniz-Institute for Ecological Urban and Regional Development, offers valuable small-scale spatial data on local land use, the density of road and rail networks, sustainability contexts, disaster risk, and renewable energy (https://www.ioer-monitor.de/). So far, the monitor results of this research are only presented for Germany, but they could potentially be provided at a larger geographical scope. In addition, there have been research projects funded by the European Commission exploring the use of satellite data and merging those with other microdata available. Such hybrid databases have been especially used for evaluation and controlling in rural and agricultural development, (Brennan et al. 2016; Bozzo et al. 2019; OECD 2019; Finger and El-Benni 2021; Michalek 2022). The above-structured features of small-scale spatial data are only a spotlight on selected sources; The discussion of the entire spectrum of accessible spatial databases would go far beyond the scope of that Special Issue. The main advantage of such small-scale spatial data is that they allow exploring evidence of different properties of space, namely spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence, in a considerably higher level of detail. Spatial heterogeneity has a much broader scope than presented in the few articles in this Special Issue. Landscape, topography, climate, the population distribution, to mention some, determine the heterogeneity of space. One important field of research in the context of the distribution of population is functional space, especially the distribution of urban and non-urban space. A broad spectrum of analytical tools has been developed for this sub-area of research to process small-scale spatial data and make truly functional space visible. Similarly, the other property of space, spatial dependence, can be well explored by geostatistical tools using granulated spatial data. Standard methods comprise the comparison of local and global spatial autocorrelation of different variables and spatial econometric modelling of highly resolved data (Dubé and Legros 2014). Spatial econometric modeling has dynamically evolved during the last decades, going beyond the standard models that just view the right or left side of the equation (such as Spatial Error, Spatial Autoregressive, or Spatial Lag of X models). The different types of models simultaneously viewing spatial dependence of the dependent variable, the predictors, and the residuals allow us to choose among tailor-made procedures for the respective purpose.",1

This has been compounded by a phenomenon of concentration of population in cities. The estimates of the Population Department of the United Nations state that, in 1950, just 29 inhabitants of the Earth out of 100 lived in urban areas. In 1990, this percentage reached 45%, while the urban population more than tripled, for a total of 2.4 billion. Nowadays, around 3.5 billion people live in urban areas. Around 2030, when the world population will presumably reach 8 billion, 5 billion people are estimated to live in cities. In this framework, cities tend to expand, leading to the minimization of commuting times and distances between them. Throughout history, urban expansion has always been related to urban population growth. Conversely, nowadays urban expansion continues even if local demographic growth has stopped, for the purpose of improving life quality, which is lower in peripheral areas. The result seems to be a modern revival of the age of medieval communes, with the competition between cities replacing the competition between States. The comparison between cities is an increasingly essential need and does not match the sectorial perimeter of urban geography. Economic, social, and—finally—environmental sciences need to compare cities according to their real dimension. This requires integrating the administrative delimitation with a proxy datum for the definition of the shape of the urban area in a homogeneous way. A proxy variable is required because the proposed method is meant to be simple and easily applicable, even when there are no detailed local datasets—such as, for example, commuting movements. The chosen variable is the brightness of nighttime satellite imagery, intended as a signal of human activity, and hence a parameter for the intensity of daily exchanges between the administrative unit of the central city and the other contiguous administrative units. This leads to the definition of a wider urban zone—through an iterative process articulated into several calculation procedures—intended as the summation of multiple local administrative units, and as the estimate of the real dimension of a city. In this process, the urban area is determined as the aggregation of single local administrative units: this produces an overestimation of the real urban area. However, the objective is not to perform an accurate delimitation of urban areas but to transpose all the available local sets of indicators on a common base, to perform mutual comparisons between wider urban zones. These “urban zones” are “wider” in relation to the extension/expansion of the functional scope that keeps together the area. This expression is here introduced and preferred to the more common “larger urban zones” as the first adjective recalls the measurement of land, with a focus on physical space and surfaces. Instead, “wider” recalls connections and links, which define the real interrelation within an area and reveal its “diffuse” nature.",1
42,2,Review of Regional Research,14 October 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-021-00159-6,Nighttime lights and wealth in very small areas:,August 2022,Ilari Määttä,Thomas Ferreira,Christian Leßmann,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Data quality is a long-standing obstacle for research applications in development economics. To address this, proxy measures of economic development such as nighttime lights observed via satellites have gained popularity in the past decade. It is a valuable addition to traditional data sources because it has global coverage and spatial granularity. The link between lights and economic output has been well established at a national level (Henderson et al. 2012). However, the local level evidence is incomplete due to the lack of high quality geographically disaggregated data on economic development that we could use to validate the light data.Footnote 1 Based on Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data, Bruederle and Hodler (2018) and Weidmann and Schutte (2017) analyse the relationship between light and various development measures at the local level. Their results show strong correlations across many developing countries. However, the DHS data lacks detail because of random sampling and random offsets of survey cluster locations to protect respondent anonymity. Therefore, we extend this literature by using two waves of the complete non-publicly available Namibian census, which provides data on the full population and exact borders of the enumeration areas.Footnote 2 The census allows us to answer more detailed research questions about the light-wealth association at a local level. First, we can evaluate the accuracy of DHS based results in Namibia. Second, the enumeration area borders allow us to study how the results differ across different spatial aggregations. We use buffers around point locations, administrative area borders and different sized grids cells as units of observation. Third, the census contains information on the whole population, which allows us to study total light in relation to the total stock of wealth in addition to widely used relative wealth measures—mainly wealth indices generated using principal components analysis (Filmer and Pritchett 2001). The second question relates to the discussion on the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), which states that the results may vary depending on the spatial aggregation of the data (Doll et al. 2006). In the context of nighttime lights and economic development, the aggregation has been done, for example, by using national borders, buffers around cluster points or varying grid sizes (Henderson et al. 2012; Bruederle and Hodler 2018). However, we are not aware of any study that systematically tracks the difference in results across different spatial aggregations. Furthermore, it is not clear what is the smallest aggregation, where light still provides a meaningful signal of economic development. We contribute to the literature by studying the same underlying data in different local areal units including enumeration areas, buffers around survey clusters, and varying grid sizes. Our third research question focuses on the proxy measurement of economic development using nighttime lights. The choice is data driven because survey data on asset ownership is often the only available indicator at local levels in developing countries. DHS, for example, provides rich data on household assets but not on income. In DHS, wealth indices based on principal component analysis allow researchers to then rank households, and thus clusters, in terms of wealth but this cannot provide indications of total wealth at local levels due to sampling designs. We suggest more straightforward measures to proxy the total stock of wealth, like the amount of people with access to electricity. Intuitively, this measure should be best correlated to the sum of light in an area. We can construct the stock of wealth based on DHS, but then we need a third data source for population density as DHS surveys are not representative at cluster levels. In contrast, we get the total population and information on their access to electricity directly from the full census data. Using this as a proxy for the total stock of wealth allows us to search for a signal of economic development in the light data, which might be missed due to the constraints in DHS data. Our results show a significant association between the total sum of light and the total stock of wealth across all surveys, aggregation methods and grid cell sizes. The same is true for measures of relative levels of wealth. In general, the association is stronger in most of the specifications for the census data. Therefore, we conclude that nighttime lights are an even better proxy for wealth on micro level, than the findings based on DHS data suggest. Furthermore, the significant association remains even on the smallest grid size that the light data allows, which is roughly 1 km2 at the equator. In other words, looking at a single pixel in the light data, carries a meaningful signal of wealth in that area. For the spatial units, we argue that the common practice of aggregating light from buffers around DHS survey cluster locations is prone to errors. The buffers fail to aggregate light that is relevant to survey respondents. The extent of the failure depends on population density, and therefore it leads to systematic bias between rural and urban areas. Additionally, the buffers often overlap, which leads to non-independent observations. Instead of the buffers, we recommend a grid-based approach. Literature on changes in wealth over time on a local level is also scarce. It is difficult to derive meaningful indicators of wealth changes from DHS data. We do not find a significant association between the change in relative wealth and light in DHS or census data. However, when we use the change in the total stock of wealth as a dependent variable, we do find a significant association in all census specifications, but not in the DHS data. The difference is most likely due to DHS requiring population density data from another source, which introduces measurement error in the results. Therefore, we provide new evidence that changes in light values provide a significant signal of changes in wealth even at the smallest possible grid level provided in nighttime lights data in Namibia. The signal, however, tends to get weaker in smaller spatial units. In Sect. 2 we introduce the relevant previous literature on nighttime lights. Sect. 3 discusses the data that we use. Sect. 4 presents our methodology and Sect. 5 discusses the results. Sect. 6 concludes.",2

This special issue investigates the topic from a wide set of perspectives and methods. It builds on the continued strong interest in the question of how history matters for development patterns in general but adds the dimension of regional heterogeneity and dependencies. A search of the words “historical”, “historic”, “history”, “path dependence”, or “persistence” in the title of papers published in either Economic Geography, Journal of Economic Geography, Regional Studies, Journal of Regional Science or Papers in Regional Science, highlights the continuous importance attributed by the international community of scholars to the impact of history on regional development. Figure 1 shows in particular the increasing number of papers published according to these criteria, which has increased particularly over the last five years. History papers published in selected regional science journals. The figure shows the number of papers published in Economic Geography, Journal of Economic Geography, Journal of Regional Science, Papers in Regional Science, or Regional Studies, where the title of the paper contains one or more of the following words: “historical”, “historic”, “history”, “path dependence” or “persistence”. (Source: Authors count based on the 11th November 2022 search on the journal’s homepage) This special issue is devoted to the two important research fields of economic history and regional development in combination, addressing the impact of history on regional development. In doing so, a challenge is to select relevant perspectives. This partly mirrors the different methods often used in the literature, but also the disciplinary diversity seen in the fields. The special issue accordingly includes contributions based on both quantitative and qualitative methods, but it also presents different perspectives in considering the impact of history on regional development from e.g. a spatial econometrics approach, a regional policy evaluation approach, an economic history approach, and a more local development approach. In this sense, it partly addresses the impact of history on regional development while at the same time considering diversity with respect to history, methods, policy, and applications. The following sections provide a brief summary of economic history and regional science as separate, yet interdependent, scientific fields. We also shortly present some of the current debates on the importance of path dependence and persistence, which may also apply in regional contexts. We conclude by offering a short presentation of the various contributions on the impact of history on regional development in this special issue.",

This literature suggests that the permanence of formal institutions and the slow-changing nature of cultural norms might explain the long-lasting effects of historical events (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012; Acemoglu and Dell 2010; Becker et al. 2013; Guiso et al. 2008; Tabellini 2008). However, the link between history and economic development is not unidirectional: exposure to a given institutional and economic context can result in a permanent change in the preferences of residents, and therefore might have long-term, historical consequences. In this vein, Alesina and Fuchs-Schündeln (2007) document that individuals that have lived under the Communist regime in East Germany display more favorable attitudes towards the role of the state in providing social services relative to West Germans after reunification.Footnote 1 In this short essay, we focus on regional policy, i.e. on the measures aimed reducing regional imbalances in local economic development. All advanced economies devote a huge share of their resources to reduce economic differentials across regions.Footnote 2 On the one hand, historical events could lead to wide differentials, even within the same country, in the quality of local (formal and informal) institutions that affects the effectiveness of regional policy. On the other hand, the exposure to regional policy, especially in the form of prolonged and generous funding, could provide a preference shift, which is able to constrain the potential for territories to grow for a long time. Italy is an extraordinary laboratory to test these interactions. Over the centuries, different areas of the country experienced different political dominations, with related significant cultural diversities. Since 1861, however, there has been a unique, centralized State, with a single legal and political framework. Thus, economic agents with different cultural traditions might be observed in a similar environment. It is not surprising, then, that a large literature has developed, exploiting the Italian context to study the impact of cultural norms on policy change. Investigating the introduction of regional governments in Italy, Putnam (1993) makes the point that local traditions of civicness are the single most important determinant of the different performance of the newly designed institutions across regions. Moreover, the country has a long tradition of regional interventions while the quality of public services is quite heterogeneous at the local level. Therefore, a number of papers look at how the policy context induce changes in norms, perceptions and behaviors. For instance, Barone and Mocetti (2011) show that taxpayers are less prone to cheat on taxes, if they live in places where public services are efficiently provided. Accetturo et al. (2017) study the long-term consequences of a martial law introduced after 1861 in some areas of the country infested by crime (brigandage) with the aim to protect rich people from robberies and kidnappings. They document that the law increased the affection of the group of people it protected toward the newly created state and generated a persistent rise in electoral turnout.Footnote 3 We concentrate on the case of the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno (CasMez, from now on), a huge development program for the Italian South that started in the 1950. Institutional details are provided in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, we show that the effectiveness of the CasMez has been influenced by the civic traditions of the Italian territories, classified according to Putnam’s study (1993). We also document that the governance of the CasMez, which was initially technocratic in nature, but then gave increasing importance to the claims of national and local politicians, has influenced the relationship between effectiveness and historical heritage. In Sect. 4 we show that the exposure to the CasMez persistently modified the preferences of the residents for state intervention, regardless the actual economic impact of the policy. Some policy implications are depicted in Sect. 5.",1

Recently, an increasing number of publications have been geared towards place-specific historical dependences and the role of initial conditions for developing new paths as a source of urban prosperity (Grillitsch and Sotarauta 2019; Hassink and Kiese 2021; Miörner 2020). In its evolutionary turn since 2006 (Boschma and Frenken 2006; Martin and Sunley 2006), economic geography has also taken up this strain of research, especially in the research area of evolutionary economic geography (EEG). The consensus in this field is that development paths are path-dependent, but can be shaped by agency (Tödtling & Trippl 2013; Garud and Gehman 2012; Grillitsch and Sotarauta 2019). The latter is defined as “the ability of people to act, usually regarded as emerging from consciously held intentions, and as resulting in observable effects in the human world” (Gregory and Jonston 2009, p. 347). To explore the relationship between structure and agency in new path creation, the existing body of research often relates to cities or regions affected by structural change. The extent of the socio-economic upheaval to be found there is particularly suited for investigating this connection (Grillitsch and Sotarauta 2019). Despite recognition of the significance of agency, one criticism concerns its insufficient consideration in EEG (Dawley 2014). Research related to this criticism has been conducted over the last decade (Steen 2016; Grillitsch and Sotarauta 2019). Nonetheless, the historically shaped interplay between system-related conditions and agency has not yet been exhaustively studied (Miörner 2020).Footnote 1 For instance, Hassink et al. (2019) identify a research gap concerning the role of non-tangible factors, especially shared expectations, visions and conventions, in the development of new industrial paths, in particular questioning their ambivalent effects in terms of promoting rather than hindering new paths. Following these reflections, a basic assumption of this contribution is that the aforementioned non-tangible factors can both promote and inhibit their creation. Miörner (2020) pursues similar questions. According to his conceptualization, shared expectations, visions and conventions can be bundled under the umbrella terms of local imaginaries and local directionalities. He argues that they are key variables influencing system selectivity. The latter describes “the tendency of the system to selectively reinforce some forms of actions and strategies and dampen others” (ebd.: p. 4). In addition to the previously mentioned research gap, Miörner (2020, p. 3) criticises that “the literature lacks convincing explanations for why and when agency can play a role and it neglects the recursive relationship between structure and agency”. Referring to the described research gaps in EEG, this paper aims to contribute to the literature by answering the following two research questions: First, how do past-related imaginaries and future-oriented directionalities—in particular fundamental perceptions, conventions, mental representations and identities—affect agency and new path creation? Second, how can they be used purposefully to shape place-specific economic development patterns? The assumption is that imaginaries and directionalities can trigger (change) agency. Agency can then lead to the adaptation of urban structures, i.e. system reconfiguration, in turn promoting new path creation. The research questions are approached by engaging in theoretical considerations and in a further step by means of an empirical case study. The latter serves the purpose of verifying to what extent the theoretical considerations on the meaning of imaginaries and directionalities, their impact on agency and targeted application are applicable and thus speak for their greater consideration in EEG. The qualitative case study investigates the influence of the economic heritage of the local textile and clothing industry of Mönchengladbach, Germany, especially in relation to the structural change processes the city has experienced over the last decades. The elaboration of the case study is based on a document-based analysis to explore the topic and gain a better understanding of the context. Seven guideline-based interviews with relevant local experts helped gain deeper insights. Overall, this contribution finds that interpretation of urban economic history matters. Such interpretation is reflected in the imaginaries and directionalities driving or inhibiting agency and thus new path creation. The theoretical and empirical analysis of how imaginaries and directionalities take effect indicates four major mechanisms: communication and cooperation, motivation, training and employment, and research and innovation. Overall, the paper concludes that imaginaries and directionalities should be assigned greater attention in the study of urban structural change processes. The paper also provides some recommendations for local stakeholders regarding the conscious and purposeful handling of imaginaries and directionalities. The remainder of this paper is structured in five chapters. Chapt. 2 presents the theoretical background for the analysis, followed by a discussion of the methodology applied (Chapt. 3). The case study analysis in Chapt. 4 illustrates the development of the textile and clothing industry in Mönchengladbach. The empirical findings are further discussed against the background of the theoretical considerations in Chapt. 5. A concluding chapter provides a brief summary, some recommendations and a brief outlook on further research questions.",3

Because regions, particularly within the same nation, are interlinked, this implies that local COVID-19 transmission dynamics not only depend on community transmission rates, but also on disease dynamics in other regions. Local flare-ups can spill over into other regions. Understanding patterns and extent of such spillovers becomes particularly relevant now, as countries are beginning to lift nation-wide lockdowns and move to more localised responses. This requires identifying relevant spatial networks, i.e., networks that help predict the spatiotemporal diffusion of the disease and investigating their effect under different containment policy regimes. Contributing to this understanding is the aim of this paper. In this paper, we focus on Germany and analyse the influence of three different types of spatial networks on the spread of COVID-19 across districts over time and containment strategies. The three networks are: the mobility network, the commuter network, and the social network. The strength of connection between two districts within the mobility network is measured via phone-location-tracking-derived movement of individuals, whereas connectivity within the commuter network is based on data from the Federal Employment Agency. The strength of links within the social network is measured by the Social Connectedness Index (Bailey et al 2020), which captures the intensity of Facebook friendships between two districts. It is important to note that the structure of the networks (i.e., the strength of links) is time-invariant and pre-determined, i.e., reflecting typical patterns of connectivity prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. To investigate if the three networks influence interdistrict transmission dynamics, we compile a dataset on weekly incidence rates (defined as the number of new COVID-19 cases per inhabitant) for each of the 401 German districts. This district-level panel dataset spans the period 1 January 2020–31 May 2020. We link disease incidence in the remaining districts to the home district by averaging COVID-19 incidence rates across all other districts using connectivity within a given network as weight. This measure thus captures the network-proximity-weighted average COVID-19 incidence rate of all other districts. The intuition behind this index is that disease dynamics in other districts are more relevant the closer districts are connected to the home district. Importantly, this measure incorporates the whole network (i.e., all districts) and updated information on case numbers. This is—to the best of our knowledge—novel and allows us to investigate the effect of networks on the spatiotemporal propagation of the disease beyond initial stages. Using the panel data, we then employ an OLS regression approach to empirically assess if lagged changes in network-proximity-weighted average COVID-19 incidence rate predicts disease incidence in the home district. Our regression setup accounts for district fixed effects as well as state \(\times\) week dummies. The latter absorb general (within-state) disease dynamics as well as variation in state-wide containment policies. The former control for differences in district-level characteristics that could influence disease transmission intensity (e.g. population density or distance to initial hotspots). Furthermore, we always include lagged incidence rates observed in the home district to control for within-district transmission dynamics. The regressions produce two main results. First, the structure of all three networks is predictive of the spatiotemporal diffusion of COVID-19. Case incidence rises in the home district following an increase in the network-proximity-weighted average COVID-19 incidence rate. The size of the point estimators for the network effects are statistically indistinguishable from within-district dynamics, illustrating the importance of taking into account network effects when trying to understand the spatiotemporal spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. Among the three networks, the social network has the strongest effect and contains the most information (as measured by the Bayesian information criterion). The second main result is that the intensity of transmission within all spatial networks drops substantially (below the critical value of one) after the introduction of containment policies in week 12 (16 March 2020). Using information on daily observed mobility (rather than time-invariant, typical mobility patterns), we show that neither changes in the (relative) pattern of mobility nor changes in the quantity of movement can explain the reduction in network transmission intensity. Though not empirically testable, the natural conjecture then is that qualitative aspects of mobility must have changed. Possible aspects are a change in mode of transport or the adherence to physical distancing guidelines. A main policy implication of our findings is that changing qualitative aspects of mobility are far more important in slowing down the spread of the disease across space than the reduction of mobility itself. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The next section discusses the literature related to our study, which is followed by a brief overview of the COVID-epidemic in Germany during the first 22 weeks of 2020. In Sect. 4, we present the data used in our analysis before outlining the estimation approach in Sect. 5. The results are discussed in Sect. 6, while Sect. 7 offers concluding remarks.",

43,1,Review of Regional Research,28 February 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-023-00183-8,Where do knowledge-intensive firms locate in Germany?—An explanatory framework using exponential random graph modeling,April 2023,Mathias Heidinger,Fabian Wenner,Alain Thierstein,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Knowledge-based firms have been recognized as important drivers of urban development that increasingly shape and concentrate economic activity in only a few places (e.g., Friedmann 1986; Sassen 2001; Hall and Pain 2006; Taylor and Derudder 2016; Waiengnier et al. 2020). Transnational corporations depend on these knowledge-based firms, which function as central actors in knowledge creation and diffusion (Bathelt et al. 2004). This process has led to the formation of multilocational, often multinational, firm networks of knowledge-intensive firms offering their services globally (Derudder and Parnreiter 2014). Here, firms access heavily localized knowledge and make it available globally (Bathelt and Glückler 2011). Therefore, cities increasingly act as nodes in global flows of knowledge, capital, and goods in such networks of firm locations (Castells 1996; Sassen 2001; Smętkowski et al. 2021). Still, how well a city or region is positioned in the global economy depends on both physical and non-physical networks (Castells 1996). Staying competitive in the global economy means fostering innovation and adapting new knowledge sources (Bathelt and Glückler 2011). Agglomeration economies enable and improve these processes through shared labor markets or spontaneous knowledge spillovers due to spatial proximity between firms (Combes and Gobillon 2015). At the same time, firms are increasingly embedded in functional networks fomed by cities and firms. In these networks, so-called “urban network externalities” (Capello 2000) arise. Here, cities are able to “borrow” (Camagni et al. 2016), exploit, or partially replace local agglomeration functions from other places, even ones that are not in physical proximity to each other (Capello 2000; Burger and Meijers 2016). This interplay of local externalities, through agglomeration economies, and connectivity, through network economies, plays a crucial role in the knowledge creation process and economic growth of a region (Bathelt et al. 2004; van Meeteren et al. 2016). Although various location factors such as universities, a high local GDP, international airports, or corporate taxes have been identified as beneficial for attracting firms, they are not equally important to all industries (e.g., Zandiatashbar and Hamidi 2018; Adler and Florida 2020; Sigler et al. 2020; Chong and Pan 2020; Wu et al. 2022). The main goal of this paper is to explore how multi-branch, multi-location firms of advanced producer service (APS) firms and High-Tech industries shape and use space in Germany. Our assumption is that firms specifically choose their locations to not only increase their competitive edge but also add highly localized knowledge to their knowledge creation process. Furthermore, we expect that characteristics in space, such as the mode of transport and travel time between two places, have a significant influence on how and where firms operate their firm locations. Therefore, we assume that locations in multi-location multi-branch firm networks are not independent of each other but interconnected by specific location requirements, proximities, and accessibilities. This relational approach to observing firm networks requires the use of network analysis since the standard assumption of non-independence is violated, making statistical regression analysis infeasible. In the literature, different network analysis approaches have been used to model location choices, including exponential random graph models (ERGMs) or stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs) (Liu et al. 2013b; Broekel et al. 2014; Block et al. 2019; Chong and Pan 2020). We opt for the ERGM approach for several reasons. First, SAOMs require specific actor-based assumptions, such as specific intra-firm considerations of locations that we do not have (Block et al. 2019). Additionally, SAOMs are not unproblematic when used in a spatial context (Broekel and Bednarz 2018). Second, we intend to understand why certain patterns of firm networks can be observed. The goal, thus, is to understand how these individual location decisions collectively shape the space we observe. Boschma and Frenken (2003) argue that, in addition to spatial concentrations, attention should be paid to the mechanisms by which knowledge is passed on, imitated, or adopted in firm networks. ERGMs provide us with the opportunity to examine these firm location patterns in Germany in more detail and go beyond the general description of location choices. Linking firm locations to the spatial characteristics of regions that are linked by transport infrastructure highlights the importance of accessibility and supra-local connectivity in firm networks. In this paper, we take the interlocking network model (INM) approach to conceptualize firm networks and relate it to local infrastructures and location factors. Taylor (2004) introduced the INM to approximate the underlying knowledge and information flows through a relationality between two places (Lüthi et al. 2018). We base our analysis on a comprehensive dataset of firm locations, with locations of the 30 largest firms in 14 subsectors aggregated to knowledge bases in Germany and combine it with different modes of accessibility (rail, road, air). We chose Germany because it has a highly diversified economic structure, and the territory features an interesting urban system of cities and surrounding urbanized areas organized in a decentralized federalist structure. We show that the location choice of firms in a knowledge base, on the one hand, is strongly dependent on the type of sector firms are assigned to and, on the other hand, to some extent, a path-dependent development. However, distinct differences between the four bases are evident. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly summarizes the theoretical background of knowledge networks and how knowledge gets created in space. Section 3 introduces the empirical approach, namely the exponential random graph model, as a way to model firm networks against infrastructural properties such as railway networks and introduces our datasets. Section 4 discusses the results of the employed models and their implications. Finally, Sect. 5 gives an outlook and concludes this study.",
43,1,Review of Regional Research,23 January 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-022-00176-z,"The regional variation of a housing boom. Disparities of land prices in Austria, 2000–2018",April 2023,Christian Reiner,Robert Musil,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The global housing boom has provoked public debates which have predominantly focussed on urban agglomerations and the “housing question” regarding the affordability and inclusiveness of urban housing markets (e.g. Martin 2011; Holm 2009; Vollmer 2018; Wachsmuth and Weisler 2018; Aigner 2018). Little attention has yet been paid to temporal and spatial price dynamics beyond large urban agglomerations (rare exceptions include Blanco et al. 2016; Casolaro and Fabrizi 2018; Mariš 2021). Thus, the aim of this paper is to gain deeper insights into the regionally variegated effects of building land price developments in the context of a national housing price boom as experienced by the Austrian economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. According to data from the Austrian Central Bank, Austrian residential property prices stagnated in the years after 2000 but started to rise during the Great Recession, doubling between 2007 and 2020. To shed light on the regional variation of this national housing boom, the empirical analysis in this paper is based on regional building-land prices as opposed to house prices. Regional average prices for land plots for detached houses (sized 600–800 m2) are used as an indicator for building-land prices. Analysing land prices can be motivated by several factors: Firstly, despite the long tradition of theoretical analysis of land prices in economic geography, there is a dearth of empirical research using data on land prices. Secondly, land is a more homogeneous good than houses or apartments are. Thirdly, compared to the building stock, land and land prices remain largely neglected in recent convergence debates (Özdilek 2011). Fourthly, land prices vary more over space than do prices for houses or apartments. For instance, the ratio between the most and the least expensive Austrian regions is about 30 for average land prices but only about 3 for average apartment prices. Thus, we argue that building-land prices are a more space-sensitive indicator for capturing regional disparities and price cycles than are price dynamics for single-family houses or apartments. Investigating Austrian building-land prices is interesting due to Austria’s small-structured urban system (Lichtenberger 2002; ÖROK 2009), the decentral economy (Palme 1995) and the federally organised state (Kanonier and Schindelegger 2018). These factors are expected to result in a pronounced regional differentiation in land prices. In 2018, Austrian average building-land prices at the district level ranged between 1015 €/m2 and 34 €/m2. Urban agglomerations and tourism-intensive regions are the most expensive regions and the lowest land prices can be found in the north- and south-eastern economic periphery. With the exception of Vienna, building-land prices follow a pronounced west-east-price gradient. Further, the ownership structure of the Austrian housing market is characterised by a substantial degree of heterogeneity: high shares of private rental and of public housing dominate in urban markets, whereas owner-occupiers are more prevalent among suburban and rural markets. Finally, there are concerns about the dangers of a price bubble in Vienna (OeNB 2020), but there has been hardly any empirical research on (excessive) price dynamics beyond the Austrian capital (Schneider and Wagner 2015; Mundt and Wagner 2017; Van-Hametner and Zeller 2018). This paper addresses the following three research questions, in accordance with the research gaps as outlined below: (1) Do regional building-land prices in Austria converge or diverge over time? (2) Which fundamental factors explain differences in regional building-land price growth rates? (3) Does the spatial diffusion of the building-land price boom occur alongside the urban hierarchy or towards neighbouring regions? The paper is structured as follows: section two reviews the relevant literature and characteristics of Austrian land and housing markets. Section three presents data and methods. Section four, five and six comprises the empirical analysis and the final section discusses the empirical results as well as implications for future research.",
43,1,Review of Regional Research,19 April 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10037-023-00180-x,Migration and wage inequality: a detailed analysis for German metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions,April 2023,Ramona Schmid,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"After 2015, Germany was the second largest single destination country for international migrants among OECD countries behind the United States (OECD 2019). In this context, the Eastern enlargement of the EU, the financial crisis in 2008/09 and the 2015 refugee crisis play decisive roles for migration flows to Germany. At the same time, Germany is confronted with growing labour shortages in high- and medium-skilled occupations due to its shrinking working-age population. Managed labour migration is therefore an additional factor of increasing foreign workforce in order to match labour demands (OECD 2018). Depending on the area of settlement, foreign workers are confronted with regional-specific labor market conditions. In the presence of urban-rural wage gaps (Brixy et al. 2022) and higher shares of foreign population in German metropolitan areas (Schaffner and Treude 2014; Glitz 2014), it is of special interest to analyse wage differentials between German and Non-German workers within a regional context of metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. The extent of immigrant-native wage gaps provides insights on how well foreign workers are integrated into the labor market and society. Thus, analyzing overall wage gaps between German and Non-German workers but also possible differences depending on the area of work is of particular importance and make Germany to a special case. Detailed analyses of driving factors and developments of wage differentials not only over time but also in different regions are thus of high relevance for decisions in immigration and labor market policies (Ingwersen and Thomsen 2021; Brunow and Jost 2022). This paper adds to current literature evidence on developments of wage differentials between German and Non-German workers with a special focus on regional differences between German metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. It further contributes not only new findings for the years after the beginning of the refugee crisis in 2014/15, but also reveals estimation results for several points in time. Therefore, it is identified how the impact of various explanatory factors on wage differentials evolves over time. Additionally, until now not considered possible effects resulting from changes in the share of foreign population are observed. Using administrative linked-employer-employee data provided by the Research Data Center of the German Institute for Employment Research (IAB) full-time employed workers according to their nationality are subject of analyses from 2000 to 2019. Considering a rich set of individual-, firm- and regional-specific explanatory factors, this study is based on estimating unconditional partial effects in the framework of the recentered influence functions (RIF) regressions approach introduced by Firpo et al. (2018). This approach allows detailed estimations along the entire wage distribution, considering disparities away from mean wages. On the basis of this estimation strategy, aggregate and detailed decompositions are estimated applying the RIF-regressions based Oaxaca Blinder decomposition (Fortin et al. 2011). Descriptive analyses regarding raw wage gaps between German and Non-German workers provide evidence that there are not only significant differences in wage distributions but also growing differentials around median wages after 2012. Another important contribution of this paper is the presentation of regional-specific variation in the magnitude of wage gaps. On average, higher immigrant-native wage differentials are estimated in large cities and metropolitan areas. At the same time, tendencies of ethnic clustering in these areas are identified. Applying detailed decomposition analyses, this study provides insights in the driving factors behind overall wage gaps in Germany as well as separately for metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. With a focus on the part of wage gaps that is explainable by differences in the observable characteristics between German and Non-German workers, the study provides insights on the driving factors behind the endowment effect. There is not only evidence for changes in the relative importance of specific factors over time, but also sources of possible wage disadvantages of foreign workers shift between different parts of the wage distribution. This can be seen by a shrinking relative effect due to differences in educational attainment independent of the location at the wage distribution. Further, wage gaps in the lower half of the distribution are explained to large parts by differences in the sector of employment. Despite the fact that the analysis covers only full-time working employees, it seems that there is a certain allocation to lower paid economic sectors for Non-German workers. In contrast to this, at the upper half of the distribution wage gaps mainly occur due to differences in exercised occupations. Differences in the regional presence of the foreign population mainly impact wage gaps of the lower half of the distribution. Based on these analyses, regional-specific decomposition analyses in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas contribute evidence on varying impact of characteristics explaining wage gaps. In particular, differences in educational levels play a crucial part in explaining higher wage gaps in urban areas. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 provides an overview on related literature. In Sect. 3, the used data set is described and corresponding to that, general trends in migration and regional differences in Germany as well as descriptive statistics are presented in Sect. 4. Further, in Sect. 5 the empirical approaches are specified and finally, the empirical results are presented in Sect. 6. Discussion and conclusion of the estimated findings are provided in Sect. 7.",
