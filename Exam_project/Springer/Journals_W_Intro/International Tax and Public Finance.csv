The paper offers an illuminating picture of what has happened with international financial flows in the Eurozone since 2009. As is well known, the Eurozone’s GIIPS countries (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain) have had current account deficits for many years. Before the crisis, these were matched by private capital inflows. However, as Sinn and Wollmershauer show, during the crisis years the capital inflows were no longer of a private nature, nor were they from explicitly created rescue facilities. Instead, the main line of credit can be found hidden on the balance sheets of the National Central Banks (NCBs): the TARGET balances. The authors are the first to show that these ‘loans’ indeed match the trade balances and have effectively financed the deficits in the GIIPS. In particular, the NCB’s of the GIIPS countries created money via private bank lending, thereby expanding their liabilities vis a vis the ECB. The interest charged on these liabilities has been the same that the ECB applies to other lending as there is no requirement for countries to hold capital for the money they borrow through TARGET loans. Thus, it offered a cheap source of finance for the GIIPS to cover their trade deficits. The authors warn that this process cannot be sustained and draw a parallel with the collapse of the Bretton Woods system four decades ago. They then discuss two remedies that could avoid such a scenario. The first is keeping the TARGET balances as they are and introduce Eurobonds. This provides an explicit insurance for investors and a form of redistribution to weaker countries by keeping interest rates low. Discipline should come from political pressure to keep borrowing within limits as the market will not price the individual countries’ risk. The alternative is that the ECB redeems the TARGET balances once a year with marketable assets, as is the case in the US. By requiring private capital for borrowing, market forces are brought back into the system and interest rates for TARGET loans to the GIIPS countries will reflect the market price of risk. The authors state a preference for market discipline rather than peer pressure.",

It presents the first comprehensive Target database by collecting and reconstructing information from the NCB balance sheets and IMF statistics, a method subsequently also adopted by the ECB itself, and shows that the Target surpluses and deficits basically have to be understood as classical balance-of-payments surpluses and deficits as known from fixed-exchange-rate systems. To finance the balance-of-payments deficits, the European Central Bank (ECB) tolerated and actively supported voluminous money creation and lending by the NCBs of the periphery at the expense of money creation and lending in the core of the Eurozone. This has shifted the Eurozone’s stock of net refinancing credit from the core to the periphery and has converted the NCBs of the core into net debtors of their banking systems, institutions that mainly borrow and destroy euro currency rather than print and lend it. The reallocation of refinancing credit was a public capital flow through the ECB system that helped the crisis countries in the same sense as the official capital flows through the formal euro rescue facilities (EFSF, EFSM and the like) did, but it actually came much earlier, bypassing the European parliaments. It was a rescue program that predated the rescue programs. As we will show, by replacing stalling capital imports and outright capital flight, Target credit financed substantial portions, if not most, of the current account deficits of Greece and Portugal during the first three years of the crisis, and a sizeable fraction of the Spanish current account deficit. In the case of Ireland, they financed a huge capital flight in addition to the country’s current account deficit. Beginning with the summer of 2011, they have financed an even more vigorous capital flight from Italy and Spain. With the Italian capital flight, the Target credits have reached a new dimension and the ECB has entered a new regime, whose implications for the survival of the Eurozone should be discussed by economists. We can only touch upon the upcoming issues in this introductory piece.Footnote 1

Indeed, unemployment imposes substantial social costs in terms of obsolescence of human capital and social skills. In response to these concerns, many countries have cut taxes on unskilled work, while tightening sanctions on inadequate efforts to find work. Moreover, as part of active labor-market policies and ‘welfare-to-work’ programs, several governments have also introduced workfare. This paper investigates the interaction between tax policy, welfare benefits, sanctions on inadequate search, workfare, and externalities from work. To that end, we incorporate labor-market imperfections that induce governments to provide income support to those without work (namely, search costs and involuntary unemployment) into a model of optimal nonlinear income taxation. In the standard optimal tax model, workers can adjust their labor supply only on the so-called intensive margin by altering hours of work. Empirical work, however, reveals that tax and benefit programs cause low-skilled workers to adjust their labor supply not only on the intensive margin (i.e., marginally reducing or raising the hours they work in their jobs), but also on the extensive margin (i.e., entering or leaving the labor force). By incorporating search costs, we allow agents to adjust their labor supply on both these margins. Within this setting, optimal unemployment is determined by the requirement that distortions on the extensive margin balance those on the intensive margin. On the one hand, generous in-work benefits help to alleviate distortions on the participation margin by encouraging more low-skilled workers to actively look for work. On the other hand, such benefits make it more attractive for high-ability agents to mimic lower ability agents, thereby distorting work effort. Given an exogenous income level provided to the poor without work, the government thus faces a trade-off between boosting employment of low-skilled agents and raising work effort of higher skilled workers. A positive implicit tax rate on the extensive margin distorting job search is therefore the price for combatting poverty while protecting labor supply of higher skilled workers. This paper extends the analysis of Boone and Bovenberg (2004) in two directions. First, it incorporates job externalities, workfare and a public monitoring technology for the search effort and skill levels of the unemployed and explores how exogenous changes in these new elements impact optimal policy and employment. As a second extension, we allow the government to optimize over not only the tax system but also welfare benefits. Job externalities in the private sector cause the government to attach more importance to reducing the tax wedge on the extensive margin. This results in more progressive labor taxes as marginal taxes on the intensive margin are raised. At the same time, welfare benefits paid to those out of work decline as in-work benefits assume a larger role in alleviating poverty. Hence the recent popularity of Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC), which reduce average tax rates for low-skilled workers but raise marginal tax rates in their phase-out range, can be explained by governments putting more emphasis on the positive externalities for society of people working in a job instead of receiving welfare benefits. If it can target sanctions for inadequate search effort at high productivity types for whom it is socially optimal to search for work, the government can afford to levy higher labor taxes on marginal workers without discouraging these agents from seeking work and without hurting lower skilled agents. In this case, the government in fact uses information about the skill levels of the unemployed to redistribute consumption towards low-skilled agents with fewer distortions on the search margin. The lower overall tax wedge on the search margin allows for a larger explicit tax wedge on search and a smaller tax wedge on the intensive margin of labor supply. Accordingly, active labor market policies designed to monitor unemployed workers’ search behavior act as a substitute for an EITC as they allow the government to levy a higher average tax on low skilled workers and reduce marginal taxes for the higher skills. Similarly, if the sanctions for inadequate job search are accompanied by workfare, the benefits of workfare (in terms of additional production and possibly job externalities) cause the government to attach less importance to stimulating employment in the private sector and thus reduce the need to make the tax system more progressive. Hence, in the same manner as sanctions aimed at high-skilled workers for whom it is socially optimal to search, workfare is a substitute for the EITC. In particular, it raises average tax rates on low-skilled workers while reducing marginal tax rates facing higher skilled agents. Also Saez (2002) incorporates the two labor-supply margins of not only hours worked but also labor-force participation in an optimal income tax model. Our approach differs from that of Saez in two important respects. First of all, whereas Saez assumes that all unemployed have voluntarily left the labor force, we account also for involuntary unemployment. Agents thus face two risks: being born with low ability and being involuntarily unemployed. More generally, we are more explicit than Saez (2002) about the labor-market imperfections affecting the costs and effectiveness of labor-market search, including the welfare implications of these imperfections. We incorporate not only more labor-market imperfections (such as search costs and positive externalities of employment), but also additional government instruments, including workfare and sanctions on inadequate search based on monitoring both search effort and skill levels of the unemployed. The second main difference is that Saez (2002) allows for more general preferences that are not necessarily quasi-linear in leisure. Whereas his results are thus more general than ours, Saez assumes heterogeneous preferences and leaves implicit the underlying social welfare function in the presence of these heterogeneous preferences. Our specific assumptions on preferences enable us to derive more analytical results on comparative statics with respect to labor-market imperfections (such as the costs and effectiveness of search) and institutional features of the welfare and monitoring system (such as workfare and the level and nature of sanctions on inadequate search). This sheds additional light on the determinants of the optimal tax schedule. Indeed, a substantial literature (see, e.g., Boadway et al. 2000; Ebert 1992; Weymark 1986, 1987, and Lollivier and Rochet 1983) has turned to quasi-linear preferences in leisure in order to obtain more intuition for the determinants of the optimal nonlinear income tax, as these preferences allow for closed-form solutions of the standard optimal nonlinear income tax problem. Our quasi-linear preferences also imply that a utilitarian government cares about the distribution of consumption rather than the distribution of work effort. Indeed, policy debates typically focus on raising consumption rather than reducing work effort of the poor. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. After Sect. 2 sets up the model, Sect. 3 characterizes the solution and focuses on how the government trades off distortions on the intensive and extensive margins. Section 4 shows that an EITC becomes more attractive if the government attaches a higher social value to people working in the private sector. The opposite happens if a government prefers workfare. Section 5 concludes. All proofs of the results are in the Appendix.",2

As the relative supply of skilled workers falls, the skill premium is lowered, and wage inequality diminishes. Tinbergen’s concern with growing inequality between skilled and unskilled workers is more relevant today than it was in the 1970s. Many Western countries are currently confronted with sharply increasing skill premiums. Skill-biased technological change causes the demand for skilled workers to increase more rapidly than the supply of skilled workers (Katz and Autor 1999). In Tinbergen’s terminology: the race between education and technological change is currently lost by education. Also, globalization may jeopardize the prospects for low-skilled workers. In light of the deteriorating labor market position of low-skilled workers, it is not surprising that subsidies to foster skill formation have a strong policy appeal. By boosting human capital formation, equality may be served because general equilibrium effects on wages reduce the skill premium. As there is less pre-tax inequality, the need to redistribute incomes through distorting income taxes may diminish at the same time. The main question of this paper is: Should general equilibrium effects on the wage distribution be exploited in an optimal redistributive tax-cum-education system? To answer this question, this paper analyzes optimal redistributive tax and education policies in a Mirrlees (1971)-framework. Due to imperfect substitution between different skill types in labor demand, the skill premium is determined by both demand and supply conditions in the labor market. Furthermore, skill levels are endogenously determined by human capital investments, and not exogenous as in Mirrlees (1971). Naturally, governments use the income tax and transfer system to redistribute resources. An important question is, therefore, whether education policies should optimally complement the redistributive tax system. Bovenberg and Jacobs (2005) derive, in a partial equilibrium framework, that human capital formation should neither be taxed nor subsidized (on a net basis) in an optimal redistributive program with linear or nonlinear taxes and subsidies. The intuition is as follows. One the one hand, subsidies on education are implicit subsidies on work effort, since working and learning are complementary in generating income. On the other hand, education subsidies are regressive, since high-ability individuals invest more in human capital (the ‘ability bias’). With the earnings functions used by Bovenberg and Jacobs (2005), both effects cancel out, and the sole role of education subsidies is to offset the distortions of the income tax on skill formation. Indeed, the Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) production efficiency theorem dictates that all investments in human capital (an intermediate input) are efficient under these conditions (Jacobs and Bovenberg 2011). This paper closely follows the analysis of Bovenberg and Jacobs (2005). However, the main difference is that the wages of workers are now endogenous. This paper maintains their assumptions to ensure that human capital is optimally not subsidized in the absence of general equilibrium effects on wages. In particular, the earnings function is assumed to be weakly separable between ability, labor, and education, both with linear and nonlinear policies. Additionally, the production function for human capital is assumed to have a constant elasticity if linear policies are considered, see also Jacobs and Bovenberg (2011). Individuals also have an iso-elastic utility function, so that labor supply elasticities are constant, and income effects are absent. This simple utility function highlights the crucial role of human capital supply elasticities under linear policy instruments. Finally, the analysis is restricted to two types of agents that differ in their ability to acquire human capital. We refer to the high-ability type as the ‘skilled’ and the low-ability type as the ‘unskilled’ agent.Footnote 1
 Whether education policy should optimally be employed to provoke redistributive general equilibrium effects on the skill premium is shown to depend crucially on two things. First, can education policy affect the relative supply of human capital in such a way that the skill premium falls? The skill premium will be a downward sloping function of the relative supplies of total ‘effective labor supply’. Effective labor supply is the product of the quantity of labor supply (i.e., hours worked) and the quality of labor supply (i.e., human capital), which is determined by human capital investment. Hence, education subsidies must increase the relative effective labor supply to be helpful in reducing wage inequality. Second, if education subsidies do indeed increase relative supply of effective labor, should education subsidies, when optimally combined with an income tax, also be used? The answers to both questions are not obvious, and they differ fundamentally for linear and nonlinear policy instruments. The first part of this paper considers optimal linear tax and education subsidies. Linear education subsidies tend to increase effective labor supply of both workers at the same time, and it is not clear whether relative supply of human capital is increased at all. The effective labor supply of each agent depends on his human capital and his labor effort. It is demonstrated that general equilibrium effects can never be exploited for redistributional reasons when effective labor supply elasticities are equal across agents, and income effects are absent. The reason is that relative effective labor supply remains fixed. Indeed, linear education subsidies will only compress wage differentials if the skilled worker’s supply of effective labor is more elastic with respect to the subsidy than the unskilled worker’s effective labor supply. As agents are assumed to have human capital production functions with a constant elasticity (under linear instruments only), the labor supply elasticity of the skilled worker has to be higher than that of the unskilled worker for education subsidies to have the potential to compress the wage distribution. The second question is: If the skilled worker has a higher labor supply elasticity, and education subsidies therefore can reduce the skill premium, should education subsidies also be employed in an optimal redistributive program alongside optimal linear taxes? With linear policies, the answer to this question is no. A linear education subsidy is distributionally equivalent to a linear income tax in the absence of general equilibrium effects. The reason is that gross income is linear in education as a result of the constant elasticity of the production function for human capital. Hence, it is not optimal to exploit general equilibrium effects with the education subsidy because the income tax can do this equally well, while avoiding excessive investment in human capital. By allowing for general equilibrium effects, this paper demonstrates that the distributional equivalence between income taxes and education taxes is preserved. The linear income tax generates the same general equilibrium effects on the wage distribution as the linear education subsidy, while the latter avoids distortions in human capital investments. As a result, the efficiency results of Bovenberg and Jacobs (2005) derived in partial equilibrium carry over to the general equilibrium case. In contrast, the optimal linear income tax is importantly affected by general equilibrium effects on wages. The assumption that skilled workers have a higher labor supply elasticity than unskilled workers implies that higher income taxes will reduce effective labor supply of the skilled workers relatively more than that of unskilled workers. Linear income taxation thus increases the skill premium, and before-tax income inequality increases. Consequently, general equilibrium effects on wages run against the distributional benefits of a higher income tax, and optimal income taxes are lowered as a result. Theoretically, the optimal linear income tax may even turn negative if the indirect general equilibrium effects on the pre-tax wage distribution are strong enough to offset the direct effects of higher marginal tax rates on the post-tax wage distribution. That optimal linear tax rates could be negative is an important new finding in the literature on optimal linear income taxation (Sheshinski 1972; Dixit and Sandmo 1977; Atkinson and Stiglitz 1980). The second part of the paper considers the simultaneous setting of optimal nonlinear tax and education policies. Optimal nonlinear policies differ fundamentally from linear policies when general equilibrium effects on wages are present. The key to understanding why they differ is that the relative effective labor supply can, by definition, be directly steered by the nonlinear tax and education schedules—even if all supply elasticities of labor and human capital are equal. By giving a marginal education subsidy on the high type, and a marginal education tax on the low type, the government can directly increase the relative supply of skilled human capital to lower the skill premium. Therefore, the first question—can education policy affect the relative supply of education in such a way that the skill premium falls?—can be answered affirmatively. The second question is: Should education subsidies be optimally employed in an optimal redistributive program? The answer with nonlinear policies is yes. The skilled worker optimally faces a marginal subsidy on education, while the unskilled worker faces a marginal tax on education. The optimal marginal income tax on the skilled worker is negative, while the optimal marginal tax on the unskilled worker is positive, as in Stern (1982) and Stiglitz (1982). Hence, under nonlinear taxation, the efficiency results break down. We demonstrate that marginal education taxes/subsidies are directly linked to the top rate: marginal subsidies are zero when the top rate is zero. As the skilled worker faces a positive subsidy on both labor effort and education, and the unskilled worker faces a positive tax on both education and labor effort, the skill premium will be reduced. A skilled worker will be less tempted to mimic an unskilled worker, incentive compatibility constraints will be relaxed, and the government can redistribute more income. In contrast to the linear policies, nonlinear instruments do exploit general equilibrium effects for redistribution. We analyze the quantitative importance of general equilibrium effects by simulating optimal nonlinear income taxes and education subsidies. We find that the marginal top rate is negative, and rather small for plausible elasticities of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor, which confirms the findings of Stern (1982). Optimal education subsidies are not large either, since there is a direct link between the top rate and education subsidies. However, we demonstrate quantitatively that general equilibrium should be exploited for redistribution when the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor is very low. Tinbergen’s suggestion to promote skill formation so as to provoke a decline in the skill premium for redistributional reasons is possible only under nonlinear policies. The case is lost under linear tax instruments. Intuitively, the generic linear education subsidy is an inefficient instrument to reduce the skill premium because it increases human capital supply of all agents simultaneously. Nonlinear education subsidies avoid this simultaneous increase in human capital supplies and can be tailored to increase supply of the high-ability types, while simultaneously lowering the supply of the low-ability types. Numerical simulations of optimal nonlinear policies demonstrate education policies can only be usefully employed for redistribution when the high-skilled and low-skilled workers are poor substitutes in production. However, for empirically plausible values of the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers, it appears that education subsidies have only a limited role to play in an optimal tax-cum-education policy.Footnote 2
 This paper is related to a number of other papers. First, by allowing for endogenous wage rates, this paper contributes to a growing literature on optimal income tax and education policies; for earlier contributions, see, for example, Ulph (1977), Hare and Ulph (1979), Tuomala (1990), and Nielsen and Sørensen (1997). More recent contributions include Maldonado (2008), Alstadsaeter et al. (2008), Grossman and Poutvaara (2009), and Schindler (2011). Second, a number of papers analyze optimal taxation if different skill types earn endogenously determined wages, and the government cannot tax or subsidize all production inputs at different rates. Naito (1999, 2004, 2007) and Pirttilä and Tuomala (2001) show that both the Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) production efficiency theorem, and the Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) theorem break down with endogenous wages. We also demonstrate that when wages are endogenous the zero commodity tax theorem is not applicable to education and production efficiency in human capital formation ceases to be optimal under nonlinear income taxation. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the model with optimal linear income taxation and education policies in general equilibrium. Section 3 studies the same problem using nonlinear instruments. Section 4 simulates optimal nonlinear policies. Section 5 concludes. Appendix contains all the main derivations. Some non-essential derivations and more simulation results are available in an unpublished appendix.Footnote 3

On the empirical side, Wilson (1997) argues that the fear of a race to the bottom has induced a shift of control of environmental policy from the states to the Federal government (see also Vig and Kraft 1994). List and Gerking (2000), however, do not find any evidence of a race to the bottom in environmental standards when US environmental policy was delegated to the states during the Reagan administration. The survey by Levinson (1997a) is inconclusive. The theoretical paper by Oates and Schwab (1988) is a classic. It shows that a race to the bottom does not occur if governments behave competitively, meaning that in determining the optimal source-based capital tax and the optimal environmental tax, they take the net rate of return on capital in all other jurisdictions as given. However, if the capital tax is exogenously fixed, the environmental tax will be set too low: A first-best optimum across all jurisdictions commands a higher environmental tax. A recent contribution was made by Ogawa and Wildasin (2009) who extend the Oates and Schwab framework by allowing for transboundary pollution, caused by the use of capital. They show that decentralized decision making results in a first-best optimum if jurisdictions recognize that capital fleeing the country will lead to pollution when employed in another country. These results look surprising, and they can be challenged. It has been put forward that the assumption of a large number of jurisdictions may play a role (Levinson 1997b). List and Mason (2001) find that inclusion of transboundary pollution results in an ambiguous outcome depending on the initial pollution stocks and the level of heterogeneity between two countries. Kim and Wilson (1997) present a second-best model of tax competition and the environment. They include a distortionary labor tax and public goods provision. In equilibrium, the capital tax is equal to zero, and the environmental standard is below the Pigovian level. In their model, revenue from the labor tax is not enough for the public goods provision. By relaxing the environmental standards, more capital can be attracted from abroad, which increases the revenues for financing public goods. Kanbur et al. (1995) also reach this conclusion: Countries will reduce their environmental standards below the Pigovian level in order to attract foreign investors. For an overview, see Rauscher (2000). Kim and Wilson (1997) also suggest, based on an earlier study by Bucovetsky and Wilson (1991), that in a dynamic framework, where savings are endogenous, efficiency might be restored if the capital tax is resident-based. For a more extensive overview regarding a race to the bottom, we refer to Oates (2002). The present paper offers a general model capable of unifying existing theories as well as a model where governments play a game against each other. In setting the optimal policy, a government no longer takes the net rate of return for granted but determines the different tax rates, given the tax rates imposed by the other government. The main innovative feature we offer is true dynamics. Hence, the supply of capital is no longer exogenous, but it is the result of savings decisions based on expectations of the investing agents regarding future tax regimes. We show that in this context a counterintuitive result may be obtained. Numerical examples are provided showing an emission tax rate that is higher in the Nash equilibrium than under cooperation. The main reason for this phenomenon is that under cooperation the capital tax will be higher than under competition. This induces consumers to save less. Hence, under competition, there will be more capital available which may, ceteris paribus, lead to a higher demand for environmental quality, and hence gives rise to a more strict environmental policy. Moreover, marginal product of the polluting input is higher. Transboundary pollution will have a mitigating effect, since under competition a jurisdiction neglects the effect of pollution generated at home for the welfare in the other jurisdictions. This idea was explored some years ago in a paper by Marsiliani et al. (2004). However, the present model is more general in several respects. In particular we allow for decreasing returns to scale. Moreover, in the policy game that we consider the strategies consist of taxes, including a pollution tax and a corporate tax. There are related papers that analyze savings behavior under tax competition. See Ha and Sibert (1997), Lejour and Verbon (1997), and Klein et al. (2005), but they do not include environmental externalities.Footnote 1

Immigration is a topic of policy debate not only for social reasons, but also for economic ones. Immigrant workers could help deal with current labor supply shortages in booming sectors of European economies (Zimmermann 2005). Younger than average, they reduce the old-age dependency ratio,Footnote 1 which can help deal with the financing challenge of old-age expenditures (Borjas 1994). Using different macroeconomic models, existing country-specific studies provide disparate estimates of the financial contribution of migration. Our goals are to provide comparable general equilibrium estimates for four representative European countries and to investigate the role of demographic, labor markets and institutional factors in cross-country outcome differences. According to demographic projections from Eurostat (2011), the old-age dependency ratio in the European Union should rise from 26 % in 2014 to 53 % in 2060. With a smaller share of workers, an increasing number of retirees and a moderate pace of social security reforms, population aging creates a financing challenge for the typical pay-as-you-go pensions systems in Europe, as well as health and long-term care expenditures. According to the Ageing Working Group (2012), total old-age social security expenditures should increase 4 % points of GDP in the European Union between 2010 and 2060. Without migration, the old-age dependency ratio would increase even more, to 61 %. The long-term financial contribution of immigration to old-age financing however varies across countries, due to differences in immigration volumes, institutional settings, workforce composition, immigrant skill levels and other factors. Long-term macroeconomic financial incentives associated with immigration thus vary across countries, influencing immigration-related policy in various degrees. As a response to the 2015 European refugee crisis, several countries have been lobbying for an increase in the degree of coordination of national-level immigration policy. Consistent quantitative estimates of the financial contribution of immigration are thus required for policy comparison and to inform policy makers involved in coordination. Although estimates exist for a number of countries, they are provided in different studies using different models. Table 1 provides an overview of relevant quantitative estimates available in the general equilibrium literature and shows their disparity. For instance, Schou (2006) predicts that immigration has a negative impact on public finance in Denmark while Izquierdo et al. (2010) find a positive impact for Spain. Whether these differences come from modeling choices or from country characteristics is unclear, which makes cross-country comparisons problematic and policy making coordination difficult.Footnote 2 One of our contributions to the literature is to provide a set of consistent estimates for four representative European countries, Austria, Germany, Poland and the UK, suitable for policy comparison and coordination. In order to provide consistent estimates for different countries, we use the same overlapping-generations model calibrated for each country. The model is standard but rich to accommodate differences in institutional settings and labor markets across countries. In particular, the pay-as-you-go pension system, with flat and earnings-related parts, captures financial incentives for postponed retirement. As the skill distribution of immigrant and native populations differ, households are separated into three skill classes. Because social security contributions and benefits depend on labor market status in different ways in different countries, the labor market is modeled in detail. Specifically, the labor market is imperfect and households choose education into one of three skill levels, as well as labor market participation, job search efforts if unemployed and work hours if employed. Migration in and out of the country is exogenous. In line with empirical evidence, foreign workers have worse prospects on the labor market even at equivalent skill level, which we model with exogenous and constant penalties. We find that future immigration flows, as projected by Eurostat (2011), have different contributions to old-age social security financing across countries. Projected immigration flows after 2015 are equivalent to 14.3 % points labor income taxes in Austria, 7.3 in Germany, 6.2 in the UK and 1.7 in Poland for a comparable public finance position in 2060. As immigrants are younger, a permanent immigration inflow raises the proportion of households who are in the contributing phase of their life and decreases the proportion of households who are in the benefit phase of life. The resulting broadening of the tax base allows for a relative reduction of the tax rate. One obvious reason for cross-country differences is that projected immigration volumes differ, being about three times larger for Austria and the UK than for Germany, and eight times larger than for Poland, relative to population size. This is however not the only reason. Hypothetically assuming relative future immigration volumes as in Germany for all countries, immigration is equivalent to 5.7 % points labor income taxes in Austria, 3.9 in Poland and 2.1 in the UK, compared to 7.3 in Germany. Another factor is differences in institutions. For instance, the pension system in the UK has a Beveridgean nature with a focus on minimum income, while Germany has a Bismarckian pension system with a strong earnings-related part, which is more expensive. With identical immigration volumes, public finance gains are more limited in the UK than in Germany because the pension system is comparatively cheaper. Further contributing factors are the age structure of the population, the distribution of skills and the production structure. From a policy perspective, our results provide another rationale for cross-country differences in immigration policy. Mayda (2006) empirically finds that labor market concerns, along with noneconomic factors, are related to differences in attitudes toward immigration across countries. Our study suggests that public finance concerns due to population aging represent another economic factor behind immigration policy heterogeneity: some countries benefit more over the long-term from immigration than others. The paper continues with four sections. In Sect. 2, we document stylized facts on the demographics, migration and labor markets in Europe and explain our choice of representative countries. In Sect. 3, we present the model. Results of our quantitative investigations are contained in Sect. 4. Policy implications are derived in the following section. Section 6 concludes.",7

Backus,Alejandro Esteller-Moré,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the main roles of modern governments is the redistribution of income. There is a growing literature in economics which seeks to understand just why it is that net contributors to a redistributive system support it (Boeri et al. 2001). Nearly every OECD country has a degree of progressiveness in their income tax system (OECD 2008, p. 112) designed to redistribute income from the better off to the worse off indicating a preference among the population for redistribution. Some of the research in this area has shown that the source of the inequality can play a role in determining the degree to which people support redistribution. However, much of the literature on redistributive preferences has focused on a general conception of these preferences and subsequent demand for redistribution. We consider redistributive preferences within the context of a single redistributive instrument: unemployment benefits. In general, the specific policy instrument used to redress inequality has been ignored when studying people’s preferences for redistribution. But the policy instrument is an essential part of the question of redistributive preferences. Piketty (1996) notes “individuals might well share the same ‘values’ as far as distributive justice is concerned, but...they disagree about the way actual inequality between individuals is generated” (p. 8). Where people disagree about the source of inequality, they will likely also disagree about the policy best suited to redress the inequality. It is therefore essential to consider redistributive preferences within the context of a particular instrument since the underlying reasons for why a person supports redistribution might vary from one instrument, say transfers to the poor, to another, say unemployment benefits. In this paper, we examine the relationship between changes in the income distribution, as measured by changes to the unemployment rate, and stated preferences for unemployment benefits. Economists have identified a number of potential motivations underlying support for redistribution like demand for insurance and inequity aversion, and Alesina and Giuliano (2011) note that the empirical disentanglement of these motives is difficult, albeit not ‘fatally’ so. We address this challenge directly and seek to contribute to the empirical work on redistributive preferences (e.g. Dahlberg et al. 2012; Luttmer and Singhal 2011; Guillaud 2013), using a newly constructed data set and a particularity of the Spanish labour market whereby public sector workers enjoy nearly inviolable job security. We estimate the effect of individual unemployment risk and of the local unemployment rate on workers’ declared preferences for redistribution via one instrument: unemployment benefits. We then decompose that effect into the part explained by risk aversion and demand for insurance and the part explained by inequity aversion. Our results suggest that in this case it is demand for insurance that drives declared preferences for redistribution. We find no evidence that inequity aversion plays a role in determining people’s preferences for redistribution via unemployment benefits. Studying the unemployment rate/benefits relationship may provide deeper insight into preferences for redistribution given the saliency of the two. Gimpelson and Treisman (2015) find that there are systematic differences between the perceived and actual level of income inequality when considering income shares. Kuziemko et al. (2015) argue that demand for general redistribution might not be too intense because people are unlikely to be aware of the level and changes in some more general inequality metric. Atkinson (2015) also raises the issue of the saliency of changes in income distributions. He notes that a change in the Gini of at least 3 % points may be necessary to be salient. Such a large change generally takes years if not decades to be realised, perhaps reducing the salience of the overall change. Ashok et al. (2016) use broad questions about redistributive preferencesFootnote 1 and inequalityFootnote 2 and find little evidence that rising inequality in the USA has led to increased demand for redistribution over the past 40 years. It is arguable that the absence of any effect in their study is due to the in-salient nature of changes to measures like the Gini or percentile ratios. The level of unemployment, however, is a clearly visible, often reported and simple to comprehend variable making it more likely that individuals will recognise any change and respond, assuming that they respond at all. Moreover, in the case of unemployment, the instrument (unemployment benefits) and the target of the redistribution (the unemployed) are inextricably linked making it simpler to analyse the relationship between the two. While focusing on unemployment goes some way towards addressing issues of salience, it does so at the cost of generality. Our results tell us something about the relationship between unemployment and demand for redistribution via unemployment benefits but may tell us little about how demand for redistribution via some other instrument will respond to changes in the income distribution. Nor are our findings on the underlying motives necessarily generalisable to other forms of redistribution. The unemployment rate/benefits nexus is distinct from more general conceptions of redistribution in some important ways. Unemployment benefits are designed primarily to smooth consumption over time. Moreover, the insurance function of unemployment benefits is likely to be more salient than its redistributive function. Unemployment benefits are often referred to as unemployment insurance, though there is indeed a redistributive component to unemployment benefits. As Boadway and Oswald (1983) argue, “casual observation suggests that policy makers have in mind redistribution of income as at least one rationale for unemployment insurance” (p. 195). Moreover, the unemployment rate and broader measures of income inequality are linked (Bover et al. 2002; Castells-Quintana and Royuela 2012). This lack of generality may be a feature of our setting as well as a shortcoming. Disagreement over the manner in which income is redistributed is found in McCall and Kentworthy (2009) who show that while people object to increasing inequality and support government intervention to address the problem, they disagree about the appropriate instrument to do so. Thus, the relative importance of different motives underlying redistributive preferences may depend on the choice of redistributive instrument under consideration (Husted 1990). General survey questions about the role of government in the redistribution of income may neglect heterogeneity of the preferences over the source of inequality and the instrument of redistribution and may therefore fail to measure the relationship of interest. Again, we pay a cost of ‘generality’, but gain an advantage insofar as our conclusions apply to a particular policy in a clear and direct way. In summary, using unemployment and unemployment benefits to study redistributive preferences allows us to focus on a single, salient measure of inequality and a specific, well-defined instrument through which it is redressed. The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2, we briefly review the literature and outline a theoretical framework to aid us in interpreting our results. In Sect. 3, we describe our data and discuss our identification strategy. Results are discussed in Sect. 4. Conclusions are drawn in Sect. 5.",3

However, considerably less is known about the causal impact of one spouse’s retirement incentive on the other spouse’s retirement. Suppose that the wife’s pension benefit accrual increases. If the substitution effect dominates, the wife works longer. But to what extent is the husband’s labor supply affected? This is a key issue in policy design. If complementarities in leisure are important, a delayed retirement age of female workers potentially leads to an aggregate increase in labor force participation rates of elderly males. In this paper, I exploit a pension reform, which primarily affected a subgroup of female workers, to recover the effect of the wife’s retirement incentive on the husband’s retirement behavior. Before 2001, broad categories of Swedish local government workers in female-dominated occupations were entitled to retire with full pension benefits already at the age of 63. This possibility was abolished for those turning 63 in 2001. At the same time, there were no major changes in the private sector occupational pension plans. This enables me to compare couples in eligible and ineligible cohorts where the wife prior to retirement was a local government employee and private sector employee, respectively. Hence, spillover effects can be examined in a transparent way using graphical evidence and administrative data containing the entire Swedish population. In a difference-in-difference setup, I estimate a sharp relative decrease in the retirement probability of 63-year-old wives in the local government sector in the years following the reform. Seen over the whole post-reform period 2001–2005, the relative decrease amounts to around 20 percentage points as compared to the pre-reform year 2000. This significant own response is consistent with earlier studies (e.g., Karlström et al. 2011). However, there was no significant response of their husbands, and this finding is surprisingly robust. In the most preferred model, which includes a full set of control variables, the point estimate of the treatment effect is 0.007. The 95 % confidence interval ranges from −0.028 to 0.041. Accordingly, large cross-responses for husbands can be ruled out. This suggests that cross-effects (from wife to husband) are substantially smaller than the direct effect of the wife’s own incentive on the wife’s retirement. One potential explanation is that there was a strong norm of private sector workers to retire at 65 in Sweden. Such a strong norm might attenuate the husbands’ cross-response. A couple of things are worth pointing out, however. First, the results presented in this paper are still consistent with small cross-responses between spouses; the upper limit of the 95 % confidence interval for the female response is −0.157 and the corresponding lower limit for the husbands’ response is −0.028. Thus, cross-effects of approximately 1/5 of the wives’ response cannot be ruled out. Second, the reform used for identification affected wives’ retirement behavior at age 63. This raises some issues concerning external validity. On average husbands tend to be older than their wives. Consequently, a large number husbands married to wives treated by the reform were aged 65 and above and retired and, hence, not in the estimation sample. In practice, the couples studied in this paper are couples where the age difference is small or where the husbands are younger than their wives. This is a very interesting population, but admittedly not fully representative. Third, the data source used in this paper entails only a limited number of pre-reform years. Ideally, one would have liked to verify the common trend assumption in an even better way. A final caveat is therefore that the causal interpretation of the estimated parameters should be made with some caution. Still, the analysis is arguably more transparent and compelling than earlier studies. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the previous literature. Section 3 contains an informal discussion about the theoretical framework. The Swedish occupational pension system, which provides the source of exogenous variation exploited in the paper, is described in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 I discuss the empirical specification. Section 6 provides a description of the data source and a descriptive analysis. Section 7 reports the regression results, and Sect. 8 concludes the paper.",14

But exempting farmers from registering for and paying VAT meant that the VAT paid on farm inputs either entered into the price charged to taxable agro-processing firms or reduced the trading margins of the farmers themselves—depending on elasticities of supply and demand. If the VAT on inputs entered into the price, it would most likely cascade throughout the production–distribution process and have an indeterminable and capricious effect on ultimate consumer prices. If it reduced the disposable income of farmers, it would be a regressive form of taxation imposed on mostly low-income groups. In either case, the result was considered unacceptable and a way had to be found to relieve exempt farmers of the VAT on their inputs without requiring them to register for VAT. To achieve this, the European Union (EU) devised a unique flat-rate scheme that allowed farmers to apply a flat rate to their sales to taxable processing firms and add the amount to the invoice accompanying their supplies to processing firms. This rate, set by the government, represented the effective VAT rate on total taxable inputs of the exempt agricultural sector.Footnote 2 Farmers were allowed to keep the amount thus calculated as compensation for the VAT on their inputs, while agro-processing firms could deduct it from the VAT on their sales. Alternatively, but equivalently, processing firms were allowed to deduct a similar presumptively determined amount from their VAT on sales, which they were assumed to pay out to farmers. In either case, farmers did not have to file VAT returns or keep a record of their VAT on purchases. This scheme would wash out the VAT on farm inputs on average, but not on a farm-by-farm or product-by-product basis. Accordingly, its effects are arbitrary and distortionary, influencing, among others, input choice. Half a century has elapsed since the introduction of the flat-rate scheme. In the meantime, the scheme or, for that matter, the treatment of agriculture has not received much attention in the literature on tax, although the food sector is an important part of many economies. After an early full treatment by Tait (1988, chapter 7), Ebrill et al. (2001, chapter 9) provide a general overview of the issues, but Bird and Gendron (2007), Ecker et al. (2012) and Schenk et al. (2015) do not deal with the VAT treatment of agriculture in their books on the VAT.Footnote 3 At the same time, much experience has been gained with the application of the VAT to the agricultural sector in countries in as well as outside the EU. Interestingly, the flat-rate scheme has not been adopted by any non-EU country, perhaps because of its uneven effects. Further, the thinking about the design principles of a best-practice VAT has evolved, particularly since the introduction of such a VAT in New Zealand and various other latecomers to the VAT. In light of these developments, the question arises of whether or not the current arrangements in the EU Member States are still satisfactory. Against this background, this article surveys and evaluates the application of the VAT to the agricultural sector in the Member States of the EU and some other countries. This is done by reference to the design principles of a best-practice VAT as developed in the tax literature and generally applied in countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa. To begin with, it is widely agreed that a best-practice VAT is primarily intended to raise revenue, predictably and efficiently. The VAT differs from the excise taxes in that it is not intended to internalize external costs or change people’s behavior, and from the import duties in that it should not be used to support trade policy. It differs from the income tax in that it is not the instrument of first choice to influence the tax burden distribution or to stimulate industry through investment incentives. The income tax and the social benefit system are much better tax-and-expenditure instruments to address the regressivity of the overall tax system. And investment incentives, if considered desirable, should be incorporated in taxes on profits, because they purport to raise the net return on investment. In short, under the VAT, the primary goal should be revenue and revenue alone. That revenue can be used, of course, to finance pro-poor expenditure programs on, say, education and health care. The major design principle that follows from this view on the role of the VAT is that it should tax all goods and services used or consumed in the country equally at a uniform rate. Exemptions should be restricted to those absolutely necessary on administrative grounds, including a threshold for small farmers (and other small businesses), whose compliance and administrative costs tend to be disproportionately high in relation to turnover. Otherwise, a broad base and a single rate are indicated since they distort the efficient allocation of resources brought about by the market as little as possible.Footnote 4 Admittedly, the EU (and national governments) interferes heavily in agricultural markets, among others through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),Footnote 5 but adding a VAT-induced distortion is unlikely to improve the situation. Accordingly, neutrality (meaning that relative prices should not change on account of the VAT) remains a prominent lodestar in VAT design. On this basis, the following considerations are relevant for the VAT treatment of the agricultural sector: In principle, farmers, agro-processing firms and traders in food products should be taxed the same as other manufacturing and trading establishments if their sales exceed the registration threshold below which potentially taxable persons do not have to file returns and pay VAT. This means that their output should be subject to the standard rate, that they should be able to deduct the VAT on inputs from the VAT on output and that they should remit the net VAT to the government or receive a refund if the VAT on inputs exceeds the VAT on output. The neutrality criterion also implies that agricultural products entering intra-EU and international trade should be treated on a destination basis—that is, taxed in the country of consumption rather than the country of production. In other words, exports should leave a country free of VAT, while imports should be taxed on a par with domestically produced goods. In short, the VAT should not be used to protect domestic agriculture or to subsidize exports.Footnote 6
 Farmers whose output (turnover) is less than the registration threshold do not have to register for the VAT, although they can elect to do so. Consequently, they cannot charge VAT to their customers, nor deduct the VAT charged by registered suppliers. For administrative (or political) reasons, the exemption from registration can be extended to the whole agricultural sector as is possible under the Common VAT Directive (2016) in the EU. Farmers incur costs in complying with the VAT by having to register for VAT or by electing to do so. These costs tend to be distributed regressively with respect to income: as a percentage of income (or turnover), on average, small farmers (with inadequate accounts) incur higher costs than large farmers (with proper books of account).Footnote 7 Exempt farmers do not incur compliance costs but are faced with nondeductible VAT on inputs. If exempt farmers cannot or do not have to comply with the VAT, an effort should be made to eliminate the VAT on their inputs so that it does not have to be borne by them nor become an arbitrary element of tax in product prices. Taxing inputs of agricultural products without relief through the VAT mechanism means that these products are possibly discriminated against compared with other domestically produced goods and services, or against similar imported products which enter the country presumptively free of VAT on inputs. Arguably, relief is not necessarily called for if farm produce is sold at the farm gate or to exempt traders in local markets, because the full VAT (assuming this to be the standard rate, not some zero rate) would have been paid on foodstuffs sold through taxable trading channels. The article proceeds with a brief review, in Sect. 2, of some pertinent statistics of the agricultural sector in the EU, highlighting features that have a bearing on the design of an appropriate VAT regime for the sector. As shown in Sect. 3, such a regime can be in the form of either a (regular) ‘taxation regime’ or an (exceptional) ‘exemption regime’, both supplemented by measures to relieve exempt farmers of the VAT on inputs. Section 4 discusses the taxation regimes in various EU Member States as well as some other countries. Section 5 does the same for the exemption regime—that is, the common flat-rate scheme in the EU. On the basis of a comparative analysis, Sect. 6 then attempts to distill the preferred choice from the survey.

At the same time, harmful tax competition between the Member States, which would jeopardize revenue collections, should be avoided. With this in mind, the European Commission has made various proposals for aligning the CTs in the EU to remove tax obstacles for companies operating on an EU-wide basis. Following the publication of a number of expert reports—Neumark Committee (1962), Van den Tempel (1970) and Ruding Committee (1992)—and the issue of a Code of Conduct (European Commission 1998), the European Commission (2001) proposed a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) for European companies. The common base would be allocated to participating Member States which could then apply their own CT rate, an approach known as formulary apportionment (FA). Neither the various reports nor the CCCTB proposal actually left the drawing board.Footnote 1 Yet, some approximation or coordination of the CTs within the EU remains attractive, because it would reduce compliance costs for corporations established in more than one Member State, eliminate various forms of tax arbitrage, enable cross-border loss offsets and business restructuring, and, more generally, reduce tax-induced distortions of the intra-EU allocation of capital. The European Commission, along with the Member States, believes that these objectives should be achieved by strengthening source-based taxation of corporate income. This paper surveys and evaluates the corporation tax systems of the Member States of the European Union on the basis of a comprehensive taxonomy of actual and potential regimes, which have as their base either profits; profits, interest and royalties; or economic rents. In doing so, it should be borne in mind that the need for CT coordination in the EU should be examined in light of the basic principles—neutrality and subsidiarity—that govern the tax relationships between the Member States (Cnossen and Bovenberg 1997). The leitmotiv of the Treaty of Rome (1957) is that the single market should ensure an efficient allocation of resources. Hence, unless expressly stipulated otherwise, CT regimes should affect saving and investment decisions as little as possible. The treaty’s implicit neutrality criterion implies that the effective tax rate [CT and personal income tax (PT)] on various forms of capital income, such as retained profits, dividends and interest, should be approximately the same across Member States. By contrast, the Treaty of Maastricht (1992) enshrined subsidiarity as the guiding principle in the discussion on the assignment of policy functions in the EU. Subsidiarity proceeds from a presumption in favor of decentralization.Footnote 2 Basically, policy functions, including taxation, should be exercised by the Member States, although the states are obliged to consider the effects of their actions (spillovers) on other Member States. While tax neutrality appears to require a substantial degree of tax harmonization, subsidiarity implies that each Member State should be permitted as much tax sovereignty as is commensurate with the goals of free trade and free competition in the single internal market. In other words, tax systems should require little concerted coordination, except perhaps on basic design principles.Footnote 3
 To set the stage for the review and the subsequent discussion of reform options, Sect. 2 develops a taxonomy of CT regimes and briefly reviews revenue developments. Against this background, Sect. 3 proceeds to examine the actual CT regimes of the Member States and attempts to distill some basic findings. Next, Sect. 4 reviews various directions for CT reform and coordination. Section 5 outlines the preferred choice and concludes.",10

25.0,4.0,International Tax and Public Finance,16 January 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-017-9481-0,The marginal cost of public funds is one at the optimal tax system,August 2018,Bas Jacobs,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The marginal cost of public funds is the ratio of the social marginal value of a unit of resources raised by the government and the social marginal value of a unit of resources in the private sector.Footnote 1 The marginal cost of public funds is therefore a measure indicating the scarcity of public resources. Ever since Pigou (1947), many scholars and policymakers are convinced that the marginal cost of public funds must be larger than one, since the government relies on distortionary taxes to finance its outlays. If the marginal cost of public funds is indeed larger than one, this has important normative consequences for the determination of optimal public policy in many fields. In early theoretical contributions, Stiglitz and Dasgupta (1971) and Atkinson and Stern (1974) demonstrated that the Samuelson (1954) rule for the optimum provision of public goods needs to be modified to account for tax distortions.Footnote 2 The optimal level of public goods provision should be lower, and the optimal size of the government should thus be smaller, if the marginal cost of public funds is higher. Many applied cost–benefit analyses multiply the cost of public projects with a measure for the marginal cost of public funds that is larger than one. As a result, public projects are less likely to pass a cost–benefit test. For example, Heckman et al. (2010) evaluate the Perry Preschool Program and add 50 cents per dollar spent to account for the deadweight costs of taxation. Many other examples can be given, but the message is clear: The marginal cost of public funds has a tremendous impact on how governments should evaluate the desirability of public policies.Footnote 3
 This paper questions the conventional wisdom that the marginal cost of public funds is necessarily larger than one by explicitly introducing distributional concerns to motivate tax distortions. Most of the literature has focused on Ramsey (1927) frameworks with homogeneous agents where redistributional concerns are absent by assumption see, e.g., Browning (1976, 1987), Wildasin (1984), and Ballard and Fullerton (1992). Hence, the marginal cost of public funds for distortionary taxes are analyzed, without paying attention to the ultimate reasons why there are distortionary taxes.Footnote 4
 This paper contributes to the literature on the marginal cost of public funds in a number of ways. First, it follows Mirrlees (1971) by providing a micro-economic foundation for tax distortions. Earning abilities and labor supplies are private information. These informational constraints in combination with distributional concerns of the government are the reason why distortionary taxation is optimal in second-best settings. Second, this paper does not need to rule out non-distortionary, non-individualized lump-sum taxes to obtain a non-trivial second-best policy problem, as in the representative-agent literature. The main finding of this paper is that, at the optimal tax system, the marginal cost of public funds is equal to one for all tax instruments. The marginal cost of public funds for the non-distortionary non-individualized lump-sum tax equals one at the optimal tax system. This comes as no surprise, since non-individualized lump-sum taxes neither feature distortions nor distributional benefits. By adjusting non-individualized lump-sum transfers, the government ensures that the social marginal value of resources is equalized in the public and the private sector. Moreover, the marginal cost of public funds for distortionary taxes should be one as well, since it should be equal to the marginal cost of public funds for non-distortionary taxes. In settings with heterogeneous agents, the marginal cost of public funds for a distortionary tax is thus shown to depend not only on the marginal excess burden of the tax, but also on the marginal distributional benefits of the tax. If the marginal cost of public funds is one at the optimal tax system, the marginal excess burden of a distortionary tax is exactly compensated by its marginal redistributional benefits. To demonstrate how allowing for heterogeneous agents and non-individualized lump-sum taxes drive our main findings, this paper analyzes the special case in which the government cannot optimize lump-sum transfers. Even then it is not correct to conclude that the marginal costs of public funds of a distortionary tax is necessarily larger than one. The marginal cost of public funds for distortionary taxes can either be larger or smaller than one depending on whether the marginal distributional gains are smaller or larger than the excess burden of the distortionary tax. The representative-agent models are nested as a special case of the model without non-individualized lump-sum taxes and where all distributional benefits of taxation are zero. Only in that special case one can unambiguously conclude that the marginal cost of public funds is larger than one, since all available tax instruments only cause distortions, but yield no redistributional gains. The literature on the marginal cost of public funds has generated substantial confusion, see also the reviews in Ballard and Fullerton (1992), Dahlby (2008), and Jacobs (2009). In particular, earlier literature has not settled down on a commonly agreed definition for the marginal cost of public funds.Footnote 5 Moreover, the most regularly used definition, e.g., in Atkinson and Stern (1974), Ballard and Fullerton (1992), and Sandmo (1998), has some undesirable properties. First, the marginal cost of public funds for lump-sum taxes is generally not equal to one, even though there is no theoretical presumption that the marginal cost of public funds for lump-sum taxes should differ from one if lump-sum taxes are optimized. Second, measures for the marginal cost of public funds of distortionary taxes do not directly relate to the marginal excess burden of taxation, even though this relationship is suggested by, e.g., Pigou (1947), Harberger (1964), and Browning (1976). Finally, standard measures for the marginal cost of public funds are highly sensitive to the choice of the untaxed numéraire good. All these properties of standard measures for the marginal cost of public funds make it difficult to apply in policy, for example, in social cost–benefit analysis. This paper aims to resolve the issues in the literature by defining the marginal cost of public funds as the ratio of the social marginal value of public income and Diamond (1975)’s measure of (the average of) the social marginal value of private income.Footnote 6 Intuitively, if the private sector receives an additional unit of funds, social welfare not only increases because the private sector experiences higher utility, but social welfare also changes if the additional unit of funds in the private sector causes income effects in behavior that result in revenue losses or revenue gains for the government. These income effects on taxed bases need to be taken into account to correctly calculate the marginal cost of public funds. However, the standard definition of the marginal cost of public funds is defined as the ratio of the social marginal value of public income (measured in ‘social utils’) and (the average of) the private marginal value of private income (measured in ‘private utils’). The traditional measure therefore ignores the income effects on taxed bases, which is shown to cause all its undesirable properties. By using the Diamond-based measure for the marginal cost of public funds, it is demonstrated that—at the optimal tax system—the marginal cost of public funds for lump-sum taxes is one, the marginal cost of public funds for distortionary taxes is directly related to the excess burden (in the absence of distributional concerns), and the marginal cost of public funds measures are no longer sensitive to the normalization of the tax system. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the model. Section 3 is devoted to optimal taxation, optimal provision of public goods, and the marginal cost of public funds under linear tax instruments. Section 4 shows that the main result extends to nonlinear taxation using a tax perturbation. Section 5 discusses the policy implications of the analysis. Section 6 concludes. An online Appendix derives the marginal cost of public funds using compensating variations and rigorously proves the main findings under nonlinear instruments.",30

In general, the literature suggests that taxes levied on consumption or property are less distortionary and growth-harming than those levied on corporate or labor income (Mankiw et al. 2009; Slemrod 1990). Despite these findings, the scope for shifting taxes to more growth-friendly revenue sources appears underused in many countries. For instance, various institutions have frequently advised European governments to augment growth potentials by shifting the tax burden away from labor to other tax bases such as property (e.g., European Council 2015; OECD 2014; IMF 2013). Germany in particular has been identified as a country which makes only little use of property taxes,Footnote 1 while having a high implicit tax rate on labor (see Fig. 1). At the same time, the distribution of income and wealth has become more uneven in many advanced economies (including Germany) over the past few decades, and finding better ways to tax affluent households is back on the policy agenda of many governments (Atkinson and Piketty 2010; Peichl et al. 2010; Bach et al. 2009). Property constitutes the quantitatively most important wealth asset of German households, and the development of real estate prices has been found a crucial component of observed wealth inequalities (Lindner 2015). The use of outdated cadastral values to determine property tax liabilities is commonly said to be an important reason why revenues from taxing property are so low in Germany (Spahn 2004). Indeed, the current valuation of real estate defining the property tax base dates back to 1964 in Western Germany and to 1935 in Eastern Germany. Various scholars have argued for a revaluation of such cadastral values, but no reform has been carried out (e.g., Blöchliger 2015; Färber et al. 2014). Similar situations with very outdated cadastral values determining property tax liability can be found in several other European countries (Andrews et al. 2011). Our study first simulates a property tax reform for Germany in which the tax base is no more defined by the cadastral value but by the market value of the property. To assess distributional consequences, we study changes in pre- and post-reform property tax liabilities as well as in disposable income across the income distribution. This relates to the literature recommending to look at both income and wealth when interested in distributive effects (e.g., Peichl and Pestel 2013).Footnote 2 Further, we simulate two revenue-neutral scenarios in which the additional tax receipts are used to finance a reduction in social insurance contributions on labor income. Simulating such a policy reform is difficult since there exists no data source which provides information on both current property tax liability and the actual market value of the property.Footnote 3 However, the HFCS (Household Finance and Consumption Survey) of the ECB provides extensive information regarding the value of properties owned. In addition, the EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) contains information on property taxes currently paid. In order to conduct our simulation, we match the two representative survey microdatasets. Performing a number of validity checks we show that especially on a more aggregate level such as household income deciles, the matched dataset preserves the properties of the original HFCS dataset sufficiently well. The matched dataset is then used to simulate a property tax reform that applies current market values instead of cadastral values. In a first scenario, we assess the potential revenue gain induced by the use of up-to-date property values. Next, we simulate a revenue-neutral scenario in which the additional revenue is used to lower social insurance contributions (SIC) via a lump sum SIC credit. As a third scenario, we simulate a proportional reduction of social insurance contributions, again under revenue neutrality. All simulations are carried out using EUROMOD—the tax-benefit microsimulation model for EU member states. It allows us to evaluate changes in households’ disposable income induced by the different scenarios. Our baseline simulations focus on first-order effects of the three reform scenarios. In addition, we also discuss the relevance of second-order effects in our context, and provide robustness checks in the Appendix accounting for potential labor supply responses. From a budgetary perspective, our simulations suggest that the revenue from property taxation would rise from currently € 5.8 bil. to € 16.3 bil. This additional revenue would allow a reduction of the implicit tax rate on labor from currently 37.2 to 36.5%. Examining distributive effects, our results first indicate that the (average) percentage increase in the property tax liability is roughly constant across the income distribution of property owners. Hence, the relative size of the property tax liability across the income distribution of homeowners is by and large preserved. Second, when examining the effect of the proposed update of cadastral values (again without redistributing the additional revenue) across the entire income distribution, we find that the relative change in disposable income varies little across income deciles. Thus, an update of cadastral values without using the additional revenue to lower the tax burden on labor would render such a reform virtually neutral in terms of redistribution. Finally, we turn toward the two revenue-neutral scenarios in which the additional tax receipts are used to lower the tax burden on labor income. We find that when a lump sum SIC credit is granted, all household deciles would gain in disposable income except for the top three ones. In contrast, when using the additional revenue for a proportional reduction of social insurance contributions, the effect on disposable income is small and relatively similar across the income distribution. In sum, we find for both scenarios that more households would gain than lose from the tax shift, with gainers mostly situated in the middle of the income distribution. Our results relate to the existing literature in a number of ways. First, several proposals have been made to increase tax revenues from wealth and property (e.g., Bach et al. 2014; Piketty 2014). Our paper adds to this literature by assessing the revenue potential of an important policy tool, namely an up-to-date valuation of the property tax base. As mentioned above, outdated cadastral values determine property tax liability not only in Germany but also in several other European countries, making our results also relevant for other jurisdictions (see OECD 2014; Andrews et al. 2011). Furthermore, previous authors have pointed out that the redistributive element of the German property tax in its current form is rather limited (Bach and Schratzenstaller 2013). Our results support this view and indicate that this would not be substantially different once cadastral values are updated. In fact, our findings suggest that the potential for redistribution (if desired by the legislator) depends on the simultaneous reduction of the tax burden on labor. In addition, our results speak to the literature analyzing the distributive effects of tax shifts from labor income toward other tax bases such as consumption (e.g., Pestel and Sommer 2017). So far, little empirical work has been dedicated to property tax related simulations, mostly driven by data limitations. A notable exception is Moscarola et al. (2015), assessing labor market reactions to a property and labor tax reform in Italy. In a similar vein, Figari et al. (2017) investigate the fiscal and distributional consequences of including homeowners’ imputed rent in personal taxable income as a kind of property tax for six European countries. Using up-to-date property values to determine property taxes could be regarded as an important complement (and maybe even as a substitute depending on the specific design) to housing income taxation. Finally, Kuypers et al. (2017) currently create a EUROMOD input database directly from the HFCS dataset. Their approach aims at broadening the scope of EUROMOD by including information on wealth from HFCS, but they do not combine this with EU-SILC data. The novelty of our paper is the creation of a new dataset via statistical matching that allows analyses regarding two variables which have never been jointly observed, namely the current property tax liability and the actual market value of the property. Our approach may potentially be extended to other European countries covered by EUROMOD, providing a fruitful avenue for further research. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 illustrates the institutional background of property taxes in Germany. Section 3 describes the matching procedure which combines the two datasets. An analysis of the quality and validity of the matched dataset is provided in Sect. 4. The simulated tax reform and its distributional and revenue effects are described in Sect. 5. The final section contains a conclusive discussion of our results.",6

From the policymaking perspective, the adverse consequences include, among others, reduced tax base, lower quantity/quality of public goods, distortions in market competition, deterioration in economic and social institutions and—consequently—lower economic growth. While SE may also entail some social advantages [e.g. it can mitigate government-induced distortions, see Choi and Thum (2003)], they are significantly outweighed by the negative impact of unreported activities. Consequently, policymakers aim at reducing SE. Econometricians, in turn, should be equipped with the tools to measure the size of this phenomenon and estimate the effects of various policy instruments on SE. On the one hand, the measurement of SE is not only the econometricians’ task: the size of the non-observed economy is sometimes provided by national statistical offices that have access to the most complete, detailed microdata and are able to conduct dedicated research among different groups of agents. On the other hand, however, shadow economy estimates of statistical offices are often unavailable, published with a significant time lag, expensive, internationally incomparable and nontransparent. As a result, there is still a need for external, econometric estimates of the SE. In this paper, we propose a revised approach in this area, illustrated with the estimates of the shadow economy for—depending on the model—up to 43 countries and their comparison to the analogous results obtained by the respective statistical offices. Our contribution builds upon the two well-known econometric models: currency demand analysis (CDA) and multiple-indicator multiple-cause model (MIMIC). Both approaches exhibit drawbacks, which are to some extent documented in the literature, but are widely neglected in empirical applications. In particular, CDA regressions often omit important variables (e.g. development of electronic payment system), frequently estimate shadow economy drawing on a scenario of a non-existent zero-tax economy (e.g. Tanzi 1980; Embaye 2007), apply incorrect functional forms of the currency demand equation [discussed by Breusch (2005b, c), Ahumada et al. (2008)] and make controversial assumptions regarding the velocity of money (e.g. ignore that official GDP figures often already include some shadow economy estimates). MIMIC models, in turn, produce an unidentified latent variable, and its measurement results hinge fundamentally on ad hoc just-identifying restrictions that are introduced into the model informally, or even implicitly. The application of ad hoc identification strategies, such as using MIMIC output as an ‘index’ anchored at some selected point in time at the level of an external CDA estimate of SE, may bring inconsistent and flawed results. To see this, consider the recent MIMIC-based shadow economy estimates of Hassan and Schneider (2016). In spite of the low degree of transparency (see Sect. 2.2 for some details) in presenting the actual source and dating of the shadow economy estimates used to anchor various MIMIC models, Schneider generally confirms that his MIMIC applications draw on external CDA estimates in terms of level calibration. In theory, without an unusual assumption that velocity of money differs between shadow and non-shadow economy, the upper bound of the share of SE in the total GDP (including SE) from the CDA model is equal to the share of cash outside banks in the M1 monetary aggregate, and this can only be true in the unlikely case of 100% cash being used solely in the shadow economy. Therefore, as a consistency check, one may compare Hassan and Schneider’s shadow economy estimates with the share of cash outside banks in M1 for the selected countries (see Fig. 1). Source: IMF, Hassan and Schneider (2016) Maximum shadow economy levels implied by the CDA model versus Hassan and Schneider’s (2016) shadow economy estimates from the MIMIC model. Note To make the comparison precise, we present it only for certain years for which we were able to recalculate the maximum shadow economy levels implied by the CDA model in terms of % official GDP (GDP figures published by statistical offices). This recalculation required the information on the shadow economy estimates of the statistical offices included in the official GDP figures (see section 3.2), which is very rarely disseminated. One can observe that the cited shadow economy estimates for the chosen countries are ca. three times higher than the described upper bound. This is a conclusion that is clearly inconsistent with the CDA foundations that the authors draw on, showing that the adopted MIMIC approach is flawed.Footnote 1 To address the well-justified critique received by such applications of the CDA and MIMIC approaches, in this paper we propose a unified statistical model. First, we specify and estimate an extended, panel version of the CDA equation in different versions for up to 43 countries, controlling, among others, for the development of the electronic payment system. Second, we derive from the model the vectors of unconditional (time-averaged) panel-specific means and variances of the shadow economy. We abandon the often adopted assumption that the share of SE in the total economy is zero, even under perfect institutions and zero tax rate. Instead, we use the best observable levels of the shadow-economy-related variables in OECD countries as benchmarks to derive the ‘natural level’ of SE. Third, we estimate a MIMIC model by maximizing a (full-information) likelihood function, reformulated in two ways: (i) instead of anchoring the index on an arbitrary time period and using arbitrary normalizations or other discretionary corrections, we use the means and variances estimated in our CDA model, which suffices for just identification; (ii) we constrain the parameter vector to explicitly assume away the negative variances of structural errors and measurement errors. What exactly do we measure in this way? The literature uses many definitions of the non-observed or shadow economy, with different authors often focusing on different aspects of this issue. A very important common factor for all types of the shadow economy is that it is most often a cash payment that allows the seller not to report the transaction. With only a few exceptions (such as e-commerce, online gambling or bartering), if an electronic payment was made instead of cash, it would be difficult not to register the transaction. Since our estimates of the shadow economy levels in this paper are mainly based on the cash-related CDA model, the scope and the coverage of the estimated shadow economy should then be largely consistent with the definition of the non-observed economy formulated by the European Commission (2013) as comprising: (1) illegal activities where the parties are willing partners in an economic transaction (e.g. drug selling), (2) hidden and underground activities where the transactions themselves are not against the law, but are unreported to avoid official scrutiny (e.g. unreported part of revenues to avoid taxation) and (3) informal activities where typically no records are kept (e.g. home tutors). Under this definition, the SE can be approximated by unreported transactions made by both registered and unregistered entities. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss CDA and MIMIC approaches, providing the critical assessment of their previous applications and indicating our amendments. Next, we present our strategy of developing a unified CDA-MIMIC statistical model (Sect. 3). In Sect. 4, we discuss our empirical results, including the sensitivity analysis. Section 5 concludes and suggests some areas for further research.",27

Backus,Nicky L. Grant,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Some commentators have voiced the suspicion that, while a few sophisticated taxpayers (and their tax or financial advisors) might be sensitive to variations in tax rates, the average taxpayer is too oblivious or unresponsive to the marginal tax rate for anything like the economic model to be a realistic representation of reality.Clotfelter (2002) Do tax incentives for charitable giving lead people to give more? In the USA, taxpayers can deduct their charitable donations from their taxable income if they choose to itemize, or list, their deductible expenditures (e.g., donations, mortgage interest paid, state taxes paid) in their annual filing. Taxpayers can choose to subtract the sum of their itemized deductions or the standard deduction amount, whichever is greater, from their taxable income. The tax deductibility of donations was introduced into the US tax code in 1917 and has survived every tax reform since, fundamentally unchanged (Fack and Landais 2016). It has been called ‘probably the most popular tax break in the Internal Revenue Code’ (Reid 2017, p. 82). This deductibility of donations produces a price (or tax-price) of giving equal to 1 minus the marginal tax rate faced by the donor if she itemizes and equal to 1 if not. This fact has been exploited in a sizeable literature aimed at estimating the elasticity of charitable giving with respect to this price. In general, estimates of the price elasticity of giving have been obtained using either tax-filer data (i.e., data from annual income tax forms), or from surveys. Estimating this elasticity using tax-filer data limits the sample to individuals who itemize their tax returns as no information on donations is recorded for non-itemizers.Footnote 1 However, itemizers are substantially wealthier than non-itemizers on average.Footnote 2 As such, the estimated price elasticity obtained using tax-filer data estimates the responsiveness of the average itemizer and may not reflect that of the relatively poorer average taxpayer. In order to estimate the elasticity of the general taxpayer, we must consider non-itemizers who compose about a fifth of total donations (Duquette 1999).Footnote 3 This is often achieved using survey data from the general population of taxpayers, including non-itemizers. In their meta-analysis, Peloza and Steel (2005) report that studies using tax-filer data (40 of the 69 studies they surveyed) estimate a price elasticity on average of − 1.08 compared to a mean elasticity of − 1.29 from studies using survey data (the remaining 29 studies), rejecting the null hypothesis that the mean responses are equal.Footnote 4 This suggests the economically counterintuitive result that the average taxpayer is more responsive to changes in the price of giving than itemizers with higher average income.Footnote 5 Such a conclusion is in contrast to what has been found in a related literature that estimates the elasticity of taxable income, where higher income individuals are found to be the most sensitive to changes in tax rates (e.g., Feldstein 1995; Saez 2004; Emmanuel Saez and Giertz 2012 for an overview). This paper provides an explanation for this result, showing it to arise from a downward bias in the estimator of the price elasticity using survey data in the standard model considered in the literature. Theoretical and empirical evidence is provided demonstrating this bias, which follows from a hitherto unrecognized source of endogenous price variation arising from changes in itemization status. It is shown that controlling for itemization status yields a consistent, and more efficient estimator (relative to two stage least squares estimators) of the price elasticity under a simple testable restriction which we find is strongly supported by the data. Results from this model find that the price response of the average taxpayer is inelastic, consistent with recent work in Hungerman and Ottoni-Wilhelm (2016). Only for those with income in the top decile do we find evidence of an elastic and statistically significant price response. This provides one explanation for the observation of Clotfelter (1985, 2002), and others (e.g., Aaron 1972), that the estimated price responsiveness of charitable giving seems unrealistically large for the average taxpayer. Our findings are also significant for public policy analysis as a price elasticity less than unity is indicative that the tax deductibility of charitable donations may not be ‘treasury efficient.’Footnote 6 Moreover, the optimal subsidies of giving derived in Saez (2004) depend heavily on the sensitivity of donors to the price of giving. For example, the optimal subsidy with a price elasticity of − 1 is eight times larger than with a price elasticity of − 0.5. This is important since we find with 95% probability that the price elasticity in the model removing the bias is bounded below by − 0.59 compared to − 1.59 for the standard model. The literature in this area has long recognized two main sources of endogeneity in the price of giving. First, that the marginal tax rate is a function of taxable income, which, in turn, is a function of donations for itemizers (Auten et al. 2002). We follow a common practice in addressing this source of endogeneity (detailed below in Sect. 3). Second, that the price of giving is a function of itemization status itself, and hence donations, for so-called ‘endogenous itemizers’ (Clotfelter 1980), i.e., people that, conditional on their other deductible expenditures, are itemizers only because of the level of their donation. A common solution to this issue in the literature, using both tax-filer and survey data, has been to omit these endogenous itemizers, generally a small share of the sample, leaving only exogenous itemizers in the sample. In studies using tax-filer data, this exclusion is sufficient to expunge the endogenous price variation (e.g., Lankford and Wyckoff 1991; Randolph 1995; Auten et al. 2002; Bakija and Heim 2011), providing consistent estimation of the price elasticity of giving for the average itemizer. However, if the interest is in consistently estimating the price elasticity of the average taxpayer, then we must use samples which include those who may itemize their tax returns in certain years and not in others. We show that in such samples a third, and heretofore unacknowledged, source of endogeneity remains even if endogenous itemizers are excluded. This is because non-itemizers face a price equal to 1, and not the lower price of 1 minus the marginal tax rate as for itemizers, because their donations are sufficiently small (conditional on their other tax deductible expenses). In short, as itemizing is a function of donations for endogenous itemizers, so is not itemizing a function of donations for all non-itemizers. As a result, estimators of the price elasticity of giving based on data which includes non-itemizers (e.g., Brown and Lankford 1992; Andreoni et al. 2003; Bradley et al. 2005; Brown et al. 2012; Yöruk 2010, 2013; Brown et al. 2015; Zampelli and Yen 2017) will be downward biased.Footnote 7 To understand the intuition of the price endogeneity arising from the inclusion of non-itemizers in the sample, consider the case where a taxpayer switches from being an itemizer one year to a non-itemizer the next. By definition, her donations have decreased (holding other deductible expenditure constant) and the price of donating has increased. As such, a negative relationship will be found between the change in donations and the change in price, by construction; even in the extreme case where donation decisions are made at random.Footnote 8 This leads to a difference in the mean donation of itemizers and non-itemizers (conditional on expenditures and other controls) that cannot be picked up in a fixed effect for those who switch itemization status in some years and not in others, being inherently time varying. A natural approach to address this bias would be to form a two stage least squares (2SLS) estimator, instrumenting for the change in price. We consider two exogenous instruments: the ‘synthetic’ and the actual change in marginal tax rates. Despite finding evidence that these instruments satisfy the identification condition, they only explain a small variation in the price of giving, as most of the price variation comes from changes in itemization status. Consequentially, we find that the 2SLS estimators yield standard errors too large to make any economically meaningful inference. Instead, we develop an alternative approach. We show formally that the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the price elasticity in a model which controls for change in itemization status removes this bias when the average change in price for those who stop and start itemizing is of the same magnitude; a testable restriction. This restriction is shown to hold with probability close to 1, suggesting this estimator is consistent. Moreover, since it exploits the maximal exogenous variation in the price and is estimated via OLS it is more efficient than any 2SLS estimator. In fact, we find the standard error of the OLS estimator of the price elasticity in this model to be one half, or less, than those obtained via 2SLS. Finally, to note another benefit of this approach is that it estimates the average treatment effect, and not the local average treatment effect estimated by 2SLS. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides the formal theoretical results and discusses the bias in the standard model based on survey data. Section 3 discusses the data and our instruments, where Sect. 4 presents the empirical results. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Sect. 5. Proofs of the theoretical results along with extra empirical output are provided in the Appendix.",3

The potential benefits of using these data for research are immense, but they have not yet been fully exploited in most countries. Administrative data typically cover entire populations rather than samples and therefore have fewer problems with attrition, non-response and measurement error than traditional survey data sources (Card et al. 2010). The large size and high quality of the data also help conduct more reliable causal inference, increasing the statistical power to identify causal effects and facilitating the study of heterogeneity in those effects, which is both policy relevant and academically interesting. At its best, administrative data allow combining information from many different registers or authorities, thus resulting in very rich information contents that would be impossible to achieve with traditional surveys. While the advantages of having access to high-quality administrative data for research are well known, the actual process of how researchers can gain access to such data is less often discussed. Obtaining access to the right data is in many cases a key hurdle in conducting high-end policy-relevant empirical research. In this paper, we discuss the typical issues in accessing and using high-quality administrative data and provide some possible solutions to these issues. Our arguments are mainly based on our own experience of working with the tax authorities in Finland and the UK, and thus, we use the tax authority as a running example. We also provide two case studies from Finland and the UK as examples of how to achieve improvements in the research environment at an institutional level. The use of administrative tax data also has some drawbacks, as pointed out recently by Slemrod (2016). The data are not always error free, as there can be data-entry errors or incomplete consistency checks that fail to correct mistakes made by taxpayers (see, e.g. Gillitzer and Skov 2018). Tax return data, in particular, tend to contain very little demographic information beyond age and gender of the taxpayer, preventing researchers from studying a wide range of questions if the data cannot be combined with information from other sources. However, in many countries such as in Finland and other Nordic countries, individual-level data from different government registers can be merged using unique personal identifiers. Finally, it is important to keep in mind that governments collect data for specific operational purposes and try to minimize the costs of compliance for individuals and firms. Therefore, the raw data may not always be suited to address the research questions of a particular study. Our discussion relates to various different types of processes of getting access to administrative tax data for research. At one end of the spectrum, some countries lack any procedure for external researchers to access confidential administrative data sources. In other cases, data access may be granted after lengthy negotiations on a case-by-case basis, but researchers often face challenges to work with the data because there is no detailed documentation and it is stored in different databases within the tax administration. In more advanced settings, there are standardized practices for data access and project approval. This is the case of the HMRC Datalab in the UK, and Finnish individual tax return data held at the Statistics Finland, both discussed in more detail below. Finally, at the other end of the spectrum, we could place the data generated in the context of field experiments where researchers collaborate directly with the tax authority. Some of the issues that arise in those cases are discussed by List (2011) in an overview of field experiments. It is worth noting that while randomized field experiments are an extremely valuable recent development, the bulk of tax research still concerns the analysis of data that already exist for administrative purposes. Data management practices vary a great deal across countries and research projects, but the obstacles to data access often appear to be similar everywhere. One key consideration is how to align the different interests of researchers and administrators. A second issue is how to ensure that data confidentiality is maintained while not making the access and research too difficult and burdensome. Finally, it is important to ensure the continuity of the collaboration between academics and the administration throughout the often-lengthy research process and beyond. By reflecting on the experiences in Finland and the UK, we discuss how to make administrative data more easily accessible to researchers, for the benefit of both the academic community and policymakers. For the UK case, we describe the access to administrative tax records through the HMRCFootnote 1 Datalab, which welcomed applications from researchers from May 2011. For the case of Finland, we discuss a different model where the national statistics office (Statistics Finland) holds data on individual tax returns and also a variety of other types of register data such as the Finnish linked employer–employee data. Both models have already generated a large number of academic contributions. We discuss the benefits and limitations of these two models of data access, extracting general lessons that may apply to other countries.",3

This is particularly the case in countries that have been severely affected by the crisis and that are trying to put their public finances back on a sustainable track in an environment of high public debt and slow economic growth. In the context of such debates, both the level and the structure of taxation have been the subject of scrutiny and some taxation principles of the pre-crisis years have been called into question. One such principle, that has sparked extensive discussions in the literature, has to do with the taxation of capital. Before the crisis, tax rates on capital in most developed countries were on a declining path, as tax competition between countries contributed to a shift of the tax burden away from capital (Devereux et al. 2008). Since the crisis, however, there have been multiple calls to increase taxes on capital (Piketty 2014; Stiglitz 2012) and several international organizations appear less concerned about this form of taxation than before (European Commission 2015; International Monetary Fund 2015). The case of capital taxation is particularly interesting since economic theory provides a strong prescription, namely that in the long-run capital should be taxed at a zero rate. The rationale for not imposing any taxes on capital follows from the basic principles of uniform taxation of final goods (Atkinson and Stiglitz 1976) and non-taxation of intermediate goods (Diamond and Mirrlees 1971). In its clearest form, this proposition has been documented by Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985), and thus is often referred to as the Chamley–Judd result. As shown in these two papers, any positive tax rate on capital will distort the intertemporal allocation of resources between consumption and savings, discourage savings and lead to less capital accumulation. This distortion is so large that, as Mankiw (2000) stresses, any capital income taxation is suboptimal compared to labor income taxation, even from the perspective of an individual with no savings. While, following the work of Chamley and Judd, several authors have investigated the generality of the result and raised important qualifications to itFootnote 1 the conventional wisdom among economists, summarized in Mankiw et al. (2009), remains that optimal tax rates on capital should be close to zero. In light of these conclusions stemming from economic theory, a natural question that emerges is whether countries that have deviated from this policy prescription have indeed experienced lower rates of economic growth. We investigate this question using the detailed information on taxation provided by the OECD Revenue Statistics, one of the few databases that report not only the overall level of taxation in different countries, but also the composition in terms of different forms of taxation. Moreover, the database includes annual observations and spans a relatively long period, from 1965 to 2014. This is particularly important, as it allows us to exploit changes in tax policies over time. The data also extend beyond current OECD members to cover several developing countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America. Combining these data with standard national accounts data from the Penn World Table, we assess whether and to what extent greater reliance on capital taxation is harmful for economic growth. We perform this assessment using a variety of econometric techniques. These include the standard fixed-effect panel regressions, as well as the panel error-correction techniques developed by Pesaran et al. (1999). The latter allow us to exploit the annual frequency of our data and separate the short-run from the long-run impact of capital taxation. To eliminate potential endogeneity concerns, due to feedback from economic growth on the tax structure as well as due to possible omitted variables, we also document estimation results using the difference and the system generalized methods of moment (GMM) estimators proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991) and Blundell and Bond (1998), respectively. The results that we obtain do not support the standard theory prescriptions. We find that shifts in the tax burden toward capital, conditional on the overall level of taxation, do not systematically reduce rates of economic growth. In many specifications, the association between capital taxation and growth rates is in fact positive and in the remaining ones it is not statistically different from zero. We then explore whether the estimated effect is potentially heterogeneous across countries. Separating the countries based on their level of development, we provide evidence that the association between capital taxation and growth tends to be more positive in high-income countries in our sample and less positive or even negative in low-income countries. We further document that these empirical findings are robust to the specific measure of capital taxation that we employ, to the exact way we distinguish between high- and low-income countries and to the inclusion of other variables that influence the relationship between capital taxation and economic growth as controls. To rationalize our empirical findings, we propose a variant of the multi-country innovation-based growth model of Aghion and Howitt (1992). The model allows for capital accumulation so that we can analyze the link between capital taxation and innovation, which is the main engine of growth in the model. It also incorporates technology transfer, as in Aghion et al. (2005) and Acemoglu et al. (2006), with innovations produced in leading economies spilling over to lagging economies. In the model, there are two channels through which capital taxation can influence economic growth. The first is by shifting the tax burden away from labor taxation, which reduces the market size for new innovations and has an adverse effect on domestic rates of innovation. The second one is by financing productive government spending, which raises the productivity of innovating firms. Using this model, we study the effects of capital taxation on the long-run equilibrium level and the growth rate of output for different economies which vary in their proximity to the technology frontier. As our analysis demonstrates, starting from a benchmark equilibrium with zero capital taxation, a shift to positive capital taxation can increase the long-run growth rate, either when this comes with a corresponding reduction in labor taxation or when the additional tax revenue is used to finance productive government spending. These effects, however, apply only in the case of leading economies which actively engage in innovation. This is because in leading economies lower labor taxation and more productive government spending increase the rate of long-run growth by stimulating innovation. In the case of lagging economies, there is no innovation taking place domestically and economic growth is driven by the imitation of existing innovations developed in leading economies. Thus, any change in capital taxation does not alter the ability of the country to tap on the existing global stock of innovations or the long-run rate of economic growth, which is effectively exogenous. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief summary of the theoretical and empirical literature investigating the relationship between capital taxation and economic growth. Section 3 discusses our data set as well as our empirical strategy. Section 4 reports our regression results. Section 5 presents our theoretical model, while Sect. 6 describes the equilibrium of the model. Lastly, Sect. 7 offers some concluding remarks and discusses some policy implications.",16

If the separability condition is not satisfied and the desired direction of redistribution goes from higher- to lower-skilled agents, one should use commodity taxes and subsidies to discourage the consumption of goods/services that are substitutes with labor supply and encourage the consumption of goods/services that are complements with labor supply.Footnote 1 There is now a sizable literature emphasizing that, in Mirrleesian income tax settings, subsidizing (or publicly providing) goods or services that are consumed in conjunction with labor supply can be welfare-enhancing. The argument is that, by subsidizing (or subjecting to a relatively more lenient tax treatment) the purchase of goods or services that are complements with labor supply, one can slacken the binding incentive constraints faced by a government designing a nonlinear income tax for redistributive purposes.Footnote 2 These constraints arise because the government does not directly observe an individual’s earning ability (skill), and therefore cannot levy taxes or transfers that are directly conditioned on innate ability. Instead, the government pursues its redistributive goals by means of an anonymous nonlinear income tax schedule, i.e., it designs a menu of combinations of gross incomes and taxes, and hence disposable income, and lets agents choose their preferred income point. To achieve redistribution, taxes on low-income earners must be lower than on high-income earners, and conceivably negative. High-skilled agents might then find attractive to mimic low-skilled agents by lowering their labor supply and earning an income qualifying for a lower tax burden. The tax schedule must then be designed in such a way that mimicking is deterred or, in other words, that it satisfies the incentive-compatibility constraints (self-selection constraints) requiring that each agent has no incentive to choose a point other than the one intended for his/her skill type on the income tax schedule set by the government. One question that has so far been neglected in the literature is whether the welfare-enhancing effects from subsidizing work-related goods/services hinge on the ability of the government to optimize a fully nonlinear income tax, or whether similar welfare gains can be obtained in settings where the government relies on less sophisticated income tax systems like the ones that we typically observe in real economies.Footnote 3 The aim of this paper is to fill this gap in the literature by focusing on child care services as a paradigmatic example of goods/services that are complements with labor supply.Footnote 4 Besides the fact that real-world governments do not typically tax income on a fully nonlinear scale, one reason why the question that we address is interesting is that it is in principle ambiguous whether the effectiveness of subsidies to work-related goods as a welfare-enhancing instrument is increasing or decreasing in the degree of sophistication of the underlying income tax schedule. On the one hand, as the income tax becomes more sophisticated, social welfare increases and it becomes more difficult to reap welfare gains by supplementing income taxation with other policy instruments. On the other hand, as we have just remarked, as the income tax becomes more sophisticated (flexible), it becomes easier for the government to offset, for each agent, the distortionary effects generated by subsidizing the work-related good. We employ a fairly canonical model where a subset of agents need child care services in order to work, and evaluate the welfare gains from subsidizing this work-related good under income tax schedules that exhibit different degrees of sophistication. In particular, we consider (1) a linear tax system, (2) a two-bracket piecewise linear income tax, (3) a four-bracket piecewise linear income tax, and (4) a fully nonlinear income tax.Footnote 5 We partition the population into “users” (parents) and “nonusers” (non-parents) of the work-related good, and based on the assumption that the attribute (parental status) identifying “users” is publicly observable, we allow the government to select different tax schedules for each group. This allows us to see how the presence of a need for a work-related consumption good affects optimal marginal income taxes, and how the optimal tax schedules change as a subsidy for the work-related good is introduced.Footnote 6 To simplify the analysis, we focus on the case where for each unit of labor supply, one unit of the work-related good needs to be acquired by “users.” In other words, we assume that parents need one hour of child care services for every hour of market work. Our contribution is mainly quantitative. We present numerical simulations comparing the welfare gains of subsidies for work-related goods under different income tax systems. We characterize individual behavior based on an empirically relevant labor supply model, and we use administrative wage data from Sweden as our source of taxpayer heterogeneity.Footnote 7 The labor supply model adopts a quadratic utility function specification, inspired by the contributions by Stern (1986) and Tuomala (2010). This utility specification produces realistic labor supply behavior and is also computationally convenient as it admits a closed-form solution for the labor supply choice subject to a linear budget segment. This is especially practical when the government is optimizing piecewise linear tax schedules and the optimal choice of each individual needs to be calculated repeatedly, as in the nonlinear budget set procedure of Hausman (1979).Footnote 8 To compute the optimal fully nonlinear tax systems, we employ a specification with a large number of discrete types, following the simulation approach outlined in Bastani (2015), which also enables us to use exactly the same representation of the wage distribution in all our simulations. Our results indicate that the effectiveness of subsidies to work-related goods as a welfare-enhancing instrument is increasing in the degree of sophistication of the underlying income tax schedule. While under a linear income tax, the magnitude of the welfare gains obtained by subsidizing the work-related good is negligible, the welfare gains that can be achieved by subsidizing the work-related good under a piecewise linear income tax amount to about the same as the gains that can be achieved by subsidizing the work-related good under an optimal nonlinear income tax. This finding enhances the policy relevance of the optimal tax argument in favor of providing subsidies to work-related goods. The optimal value of the subsidy rate on the work-related good is in general quite large and is also (weakly) increasing in the degree of sophistication of the underlying income tax schedule. Finally, our results also shed light on the relative welfare gains of employing piecewise linear rather than fully nonlinear income taxes, showing that piecewise linear taxes are able to reap a major part of the welfare gains associated with fully nonlinear income taxes. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we outline the nonlinear income tax problem, which serves as our theoretical benchmark. In Sect. 3, we present the governments’ problem in the case of linear and piecewise linear tax structures. Section 4 describes our empirical calibration as well as the linear and piecewise linear optimal tax problems. Section 5 describes our results, and finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",1

This means that public finance solutions that work well in developed countries are not necessarily suitable for developing economies. An example is the progressive income tax system. It is unlikely to work well in contexts where many work outside the modern sector. The implication is that redistribution must rely in large measure on expenditure-side policies. The corporate income tax is also likely to be too complicated a tool vis-à-vis the taxing of small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), suggesting that simpler presumptive taxes should be considered instead. Second, shortcomings in administrative capacity also relate to low fiscal capacity. Although the tax-to-GDP ratio has, on average, increased among low-income countries (See Fig. 1), one can safely state that the current level (around 15 per cent of GDP) remains too low to finance necessary development spending. While increasing the tax take is, on this background, a key goal in the tax and development agenda, such efforts must not create unnecessary distortions on private-sector development. Source: Own calculations based on GRD data Total tax revenue including social security contributions by income groups. Third, and closely related to what we said above, tax systems in developing countries need to be designed with the small formal sector in mind. Taxes, almost by definition, fall on the formal sector, and although the tax-to-GDP rate may be low, tax rates on formal employers and employees may in many cases well be quite substantial. Increasing the tax base to cover the present informal sector is, thus, an indispensable step to raise tax revenues in developing countries. Fourth, a particular feature of developing economies is the phenomenon of the “missing middle” (see e.g. Dharmapala et al. 2011). The notion of the missing middle refers to the empirical regularity that the distribution of firms is dominated by a large share of largely informal small firms and some large (even multinational) companies, whereas the medium-sized firm category is largely missing. This creates two pressures to taxing businesses: One needs to worry about building tax systems that create incentives for small businesses to grow, and at the same time, it is vital to make sure that large, multinational, companies pay a fair share of taxes. The latter goal is particularly challenging. It is widely expected that these companies often engage in tax planning via international profit shifting. Finally, because of the extraordinarily high levels of inequality in many developing countries, distributional concerns are even more pressing than in developed countries. Yet, in addressing these concerns, analysts often face a severe lack of statistical evidence. The UN SDGs called for a data revolution, inter alia because it is common that a clear and detailed picture of the severity of inequality is missing. This is so for many reasons, including that survey-based measures of inequality are highly likely to underestimate the true state of inequality.Footnote 1",1

The analysis of state capacity, defined as the institutional capability of the state to carry out various policies that deliver benefits and services to households and firms (Besley and Persson 2011), has emerged as the cutting edge of research on the relationship between governance, institutions and long-term economic development. The focus has been on two dimensions: fiscal capacity and legal capacity, defined as the capability of raising revenues from taxes, and of enforcing contracts and property rights, respectively. Besley and Person (2011) argue that such capacities are complementary and give rise to ‘development clusters’: groups of countries that are rich and have well-developed fiscal and legal capacities, or groups of countries that are ridden by poverty and have weak state capacity. Up to this point, the literature has mainly been concerned with the causal effect of state capacity on economic development (Dincecco and Katz 2016; Dincecco and Prado 2012). However, it has also emphasised that building fiscally capable states is at the heart of state formation and performance in providing public goods (e.g. Acemoglu 2005a). This paper also looks at fiscal aspects, but it focuses on the financial planning side—the capability of states to design, implement and monitor their budget.Footnote 1 Strengthening such ability is strategically important to economic development, since achieving greater efficiency in public financial management implies more efficient public goods provision (see, for example, Martin-Vasquez 2014).Footnote 2 In doing this, the state needs a well-functioning bureaucracy with Weberian characteristics, which means autonomy from the government and professionalisation of its ranks (Evans and Rauch 1999).Footnote 3 This is particularly important for states in less developed countries, since they have much larger needs than high-income countries for investment in infrastructure and basic public goods and services.Footnote 4 In particular, this paper contributes to a thin literature on the long-run determinants of state capacity. Such literature has mainly been based on conditional correlations and has hitherto independently assessed the role of historical factors, such as the incidence of external and internal conflicts (Besley and Persson 2011), the experience of statehood (Bockstette et al. 2002), and the effects of geography, such as abundance of natural resources (Isham et al. 2005) or the conditions affecting population density (Herbst 2000). It has also considered the role of political systems, arguing that executive power subject to checks and balances will tend to promote common interests, rather than using the state to retain power (Besley and Persson 2011). But such political economy explanations remain an underexplored area in empirical research. We contribute to this literature by looking for the first time at the political determinants of administrative capacity for public financial management. Our focus on constraints on the executive as a primary political determinant of administrative capacity is supported by a large literature in political science and political economy. This argues that the emergence of effective states in developing countries depends on how checks and balances on incumbents may help create a preference for more common-interest spending, primarily through two mechanisms: (1) a strong legislature which finds the need to generate broad-based coalitions, thereby offsetting the narrow focus of the executive, and (2) an independent judiciary which promotes broad-based access to public services through statutory service obligations or rights-based arguments and rulings (Besley and Persson 2011; Bardhan 2016; Centeno et al. 2017; Dincecco 2017).Footnote 5 To examine the determinants of administrative capacity, we use a recent data set on public financial management performance measures in developing countries constructed by the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) project, a consortium of the World Bank and other donor agencies. For a sample of forty-seven developing countries, we find a substantial positive effect between institutions that place constraints on the executive power and current quality of budgetary institutions. Addressing identification concerns, we show that our results are robust to different specifications, controls and estimation methods. Our findings indicate that, to build financially capable states, it is important to build cohesive political institutions, providing strong checks and balances on the discretionary power of the executive. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a conceptual framework on the relationship between political institutions and administrative capacity. Section 3 discusses our measures of administrative capacity. In Sect. 4, the empirical strategy, the data and the results are presented. Section 5 concludes.",8

As we show in this paper’s preferred estimates, around $420 billion in corporate profits are shifted from the 79 countries in our sample annually, amounting to almost 1% of these countries’ GDP. Using statistics from Tørsløv et al. (2018) for comparison, the shifted profits represent 6% of all corporate profits and 37% of MNEs’ corporate profits. This estimate implies that at least $125 billion is lost in tax revenue, around 10% of all corporate tax revenue. Our methodology enables us to go beyond these aggregated figures and present estimates of the scale of profit shifting for individual countries. Tax havens and profit shifting by MNEs have been receiving increasing attention from researchers, policymakers and the media alike, as documented by the recent studies cited in this paper. This is in part because it has become rather easy for MNEs to avoid paying corporate tax, but also, thanks to recent leaks of confidential documents and thorough investigative case studies, it has become relatively easy for the public to learn about it and for researchers to provide evidence of it. Yet, the scale of the tax revenue losses incurred by individual governments remains uncertain due to the inherent difficulties of estimating tax avoidance and due to gaps in the availability of relevant data, some of which are being addressed by recent proposals of the European Union (EU) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and some of which are being overcome by innovative researchers. For example, Bilicka (2019) uses the United Kingdom’s confidential corporate tax returns to learn how aggressively foreign MNEs are reducing their corporate tax liability, and Alstadsæter et al. (2019) use audit and leaked data from tax haven institutions to study tax evasion by wealthy individuals. While similar studies do provide rigorous evidence, they are limited in their scope and provide revenue loss estimates for only one or a handful of countries. In this paper, in contrast, we provide estimates of the scale of profit shifting and the consequent tax implications for as many countries as possible; this requires us to sacrifice rigour to some extent for the sake of improved scope. Specifically, we estimate the scale of profit shifting and tax revenue losses using data on foreign direct investment (FDI). Our two most important data sources are the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS), which contains bilateral FDI stock data for around 100 countries between 2009 and 2016, and the IMF’s Balance of Payments Statistics (BOPS) containing data on FDI income for an even wider set of countries. We begin by observing that a higher share of investment from tax havens (or offshore financial centres—we use both terms interchangeably in this paper) is associated with a lower reported rate of return on inward FDI. We argue, in line with UNCTAD’s (2015) World Investment Report, that this pattern is caused by profit shifting and we estimate its scale and the resulting tax revenue losses. Importantly, we present country-level estimates of profit shifting, which enables us to study its impact on the individual countries’ government revenues and thus also the distributional impact of profit shifting. Indeed, our main research question in this paper is which countries’ tax revenues are most affected by international corporate profit shifting. We estimate the resulting tax revenue losses to understand which countries are losing the most tax revenue relative to their economic size. We compare the results across country groups classified by income per capita and while we do identify some differences in the point estimates, we find that these differences are rarely statistically significant. We further compare our findings with four other studies that have reported country-level tax revenue loss estimates, each of which uses a different methodology: Tørsløv et al. (2018), Cobham and Janský (2018, 2019a) and Clausing (2016). Most of these studies identify some differences across income groups, but the nature of these differences varies across the studies. This paper’s empirical contribution is presented in the following five stages. First, using new and updated data sources, we re-estimate and critically review the work of UNCTAD (2015) in what we call the baseline model. Second, we develop an extended model which improves on the baseline model in a number of aspects. Third, for the first time using this methodological approach, we report country-level estimated tax revenue losses. Fourth, we compare our results with four other recent studies that provide country-level tax revenue loss estimates and this is the first such comparison made. Fifth, we focus on the distributional impact of profit shifting and compare the revenue losses across countries using our estimates as well as those from the other four studies. These five specific stages altogether contribute to the expanding body of literature on profit shifting and tax havens. We make a contribution to the existing research in at least two specific areas. First, we contribute to the ongoing collective attempt to arrive at credible estimates of the scale of profit shifting. Despite the inherent difficulties, discussed for example by Fuest and Riedel (2012), of making such an estimation, a growing number of studies do make estimates of the scale of profit shifting, as our literature review below documents. However, a number of these focus on just one country, such as Gumpert et al. (2016) on Germany or Zucman (2014) on the USA. We develop estimates for a wide range of countries—indeed, for all countries for which we have available data. We see this study as a contribution to international policy debates, since only a limited number of similar estimates are available (and often not for as many countries), and we compare ours to four others that do exist. Second, we contribute to the study of the heterogeneous impacts of international corporate tax avoidance. So far, most research looks at individual countries or, in the case of an international focus, often concentrates only on the division between developing and developed countries. For example, Fuest et al. (2011) find that the effect of the host country corporate tax rate on the debt ratio of multinational affiliates in developing economies is larger than for affiliates in developed economies. A similar division is used by Johannesen et al. (2017), who link the tax aggressiveness of MNEs with the economic development of their host countries, but they also estimate models that exploit the cross-country variation in economic and institutional development. This more granular approach is needed and similar studies should reflect the country-specific characteristics. In this paper’s preferred model, we perform our regression analysis using regional- and income-group fixed effects and carry out the rest of the estimation at the country level, at which we also present the results and discuss differences across income groups. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We begin with a brief literature review of related research in Sect. 2 and an overview of the data used and basic descriptive statistics in Sect. 3. We describe our empirical methodology in Sect. 4 and present the results in Sect. 5, in which we also compare our estimates with those reached by other similar papers. Finally, Sect. 6 provides a discussion of the implications of the results and concludes.",49

Evidence from South African tax registers,October 2019,Wian Boonzaaier,Jarkko Harju,Jukka Pirttilä,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Emerging or transition economies such as South Africa need to secure a sufficient revenue base to finance developmental activities by the state and to fight poverty and inequality. At the same time, these countries need to make sure that the distortions created by the tax system are kept at bay so that the tax burden does not hinder job creation and productivity growth. An essential element in understanding the welfare consequences of the tax system is to have reliable evidence of the behavioral impact of taxes. In developed countries, what is nowadays regarded as credible evidence is studies that use comprehensive administrative taxpayer data to examine the consequences of exogenous changes in tax legislation over time or between similar taxpayers. Such ‘New Tax Responsiveness’ literature has been summarized by, for example, Saez et al. (2012) and Kleven (2016). However, the literature providing similar micro-level evidence with credible identification strategies using data from developing countries or emerging economies is scarce, with two studies on Pakistani data being the prime exceptions (see Kleven and Waseem 2013; Best et al. 2015). The need for more evidence is quite pressing, as it is likely that behavioral responses may well differ across countries. For example, low- and middle-income countries typically have lower revenue-raising capacity, and this likely impacts the possibilities for tax avoidance and evasion. The elasticity estimates for reported income from these types of countries can therefore be greater than in developed countries, at least for this reason. One particular avenue where emerging economies need to make progress is job and value creation in the formal sector. Much of this is bound to arise from small- and medium-sized enterprises. Guidance on how tax policies affect the behavior of such firms is even harder to find, even for developed countries. The body of research on the impact of taxes on small-business behavior, including tax avoidance and potential growth impacts, is still relatively small, although currently expanding. In this paper, we examine the impact of a small-business corporate income tax schedule (SBC) on small- and medium-sized firms (SME) using population-wide, high-quality administrative data from the South African Revenue Service. This paper is one of the first to provide evidence of the elasticity of corporate income in emerging economies. This is the first time such evidence has been generated using administrative tax data from Africa.Footnote 1 We utilize discontinuous changes in tax incentives created by the graduated, progressive corporate income tax (CIT) schedule for small- and medium-sized firms to identify the causal effect of taxes on firm behavior. Recent literature, starting with Saez (2010) and summarized in Kleven (2016), shows that these kink points create incentives for firms to locate right at them, and this so-called bunching phenomenon can be used to estimate the extent of the distortions caused by the tax system. Intuitively, the more the firms bunch at these tax rate thresholds, the more elastic the tax base is, and the greater the distortions are. In addition, we characterize the role of reporting responses (evasion/avoidance) and real economic responses (changes in true output) in explaining observed behavior. Both real and reporting responses have a similar effect on tax revenue, at least in the short run. However, decomposition of the response is of great importance when considering the effectiveness of tax policy, particularly when considering the efficiency of tax revenue collection. For example, in the case of significant real output responses, a reduction in tax revenue due to a reduced tax rate can be more easily justified by the increased real economic activity (and vice versa).Footnote 2 Admittedly, it is difficult to obtain causal evidence of the different mechanisms at play. However, by utilizing detailed administrative data and changes in the location of the CIT kink points, we provide several pieces of descriptive evidence that help us to outline the likely drivers of the observed overall responses. We find very large responses to discontinuities in the CIT schedule. There is distinctive and sizeable excess bunching at the kink points in the corporate income distribution, and the corresponding local corporate taxable income elasticities with respect to the CIT rate are 0.17 at the upper CIT kink (350,000 Rand or around 26,000 USD) and 0.7 at the lower kink (60,000 Rand). When zooming into the anatomy of the response, our descriptive evidence suggests that changes in reporting behavior are likely to explain a notable share of the overall response. One noteworthy phenomenon we document is that firms react to changes in the location of kink points by a greater change in reported sales than in reported costs. These findings suggest that the original goal of encouraging economic activity and job creation by applying a graduated corporate tax rate schedule is at least partly mitigated by the lack of distinctive real economic responses to tax incentives. Our paper is closely related to the analysis of progressive corporate income taxation by Devereux et al. (2014), who show that bunching at CIT kinks identifies the elasticity of the corporate income tax base. They find that firms in the UK bunch significantly and sharply at the kink points of a similar CIT rate schedule as in South Africa, and find evidence of income-shifting between corporate and personal tax bases that largely explains the behavioral response. Naturally, the work on taxation and development, surveyed recently by Keen (2012) and Besley and Persson (2013), is also closely related.Footnote 3 In addition to the studies on Pakistani data by Kleven and Waseem (2013) and Best et al. (2015), a few other papers study taxes in developing countries utilizing administrative data. A closely related paper is that of Bachas and Soto (2015), who estimate the distortions caused by the peculiar Costa Rican corporate income tax system where the average tax rate increases at certain income thresholds. Using additional data from tax audits, they argue that the response to these tax notches is almost entirely due to evasion, mostly cost overreporting. The Costa Rican and Pakistani notch-based tax systems are, of course, highly interesting, but since they are not typically applied elsewhere, seeking additional evidence on the impacts of more traditional types of taxes on individual and corporate behavior in developing countries is of great importance and holds the promise of considerable external validity. In addition, Carrillo et al. (2017) and Pomeranz (2015) use administrative taxpayer data from Ecuador and Chile and combine these data with field or natural experiments to examine how tax evasion can be combated in developing countries. The focus in these types of experimental papers, surveyed by Mascagni (2017), is different from ours: They concentrate on avoidance and evasion rather than studying more conventional sufficient statistics for determining overall behavioral responses. There is no doubt that experimental evidence of the possibilities for influencing evasion is of key importance, but it remains equally useful to know more about the overall extent of the distortions that current tax systems induce. The paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 presents the institutional framework of the South African corporate tax system. Section 3 outlines the conceptual background for the analysis and the empirical strategy we use in the estimations. Section 4 describes the data and includes some descriptive material. The results are presented in Sects. 5, and 6 concludes.",4

The bulk of this literature has some common features. One is the assumption that the central authority raises revenue, either via lump-sum fees imposed on the lower-level governments, or by taxing some lower-level tax base. Another is the assumption of centralized leadership whereby the central authority is able to commit to its policy, while the lower-level governments cannot do that.Footnote 1 Although these assumptions are well suited to describe the institutional settings within most sovereign countries, they do not capture some key characteristics of the European Union (EU). One characterizing feature of EU is that the revenue available for the central authority does not arise from lump-sum fees imposed on the lower-level governments. Instead, the bulk of the revenue at the EU level comes from two main sources: own resources and other revenue. The own resources constitutes the major source of income within the general EU budget, and it is made up of three categories. (i) Traditional own resources which mainly consist of custom duties on imports from outside the EU and sugar levies, (ii) a VAT-based resource which is a standard percentage levied on a value-added-tax (VAT) base in each EU country and (iii) a GNI-based resource where a standard percentage is levied on the gross national income (GNI) of each EU country. The GNI-based resource is the dominant source of revenue and represents about 60% of total own resources.Footnote 2 Another feature of EU is that it is often defined as a political union which is characterized by decentralized leadership.Footnote 3 This notion implies that the lower-level (national) governments act as first movers vis-à-vis the upper level. There are several arguments for why EU exemplifies a decentralized economic federation. One is that the member states have a significant influence over EU policy via the council of Ministers (which is made up of ministers from the member state governments). Another is that the central authority redistributes income (e.g., via Structural and Cohesion Funds) conditional on the national policies. This makes it possible for the governments in the member countries to act strategically as first movers vis-à-vis the central authority.Footnote 4 A third argument is that EU is still in the process of being developed, while the national governments may already have pre-committed to policies based on domestic objectives.Footnote 5 These observations imply that a theoretical analysis of the incentive structure underlying public policy in a fiscal union of EU type should incorporate (i) a system of financing for the central authority where the revenue is proportional to some measure of the local jurisdictions’ national income and (ii) decentralized leadership. Although there are some earlier studies that analyze the incentive structure in an economic federation characterized by decentralized leadership, there are no previous studies which address the question of how a proportional revenue system affects the incentives facing the lower-level governments when they implement their tax and expenditure policies. The purpose of this paper is therefore to set up a stylized model to analyze how proportional membership fees affect the lower-level governments’ incentive to tax labor income. This analysis is conducted both when the lower-level governments act as Nash followers and therefore treat the choices made by the other governments in the federation as exogenous, and when the lower-level governments are able to exercise decentralized leadership vis-à-vis the central authority. The motive for focusing on labor income taxation is that labor income taxes constitute a major source of revenue for the governments in many countries. A consequence of having a proportional revenue system is that it (to some degree) makes it possible to tax a given tax base in different ways. The reason is that GNI (among other things) is made up of labor income earned both at home and abroad. This means that when the federal fee is proportional to GNI, then this (to some extent) constitutes a residence-based tax on labor. If the local governments are restricted to source-based taxation, it follows that a similar tax base (labor) is taxed in different ways (residence based vs source based) depending on the level of government. This feature is novel compared with earlier studies, where it is usually assumed that different levels of government share a common tax base which is taxed in a similar way. A theoretical analysis along the lines outlined above makes it possible to address several empirically relevant questions. Does a federal revenue mechanism that is proportional to a measure of the local jurisdictions’ national income provide the local governments with an incentive to implement a nonzero (i.e., distortionary) marginal tax on labor income? Will the lower-level governments respond differently if the fee paid to the central authority is proportional to the local jurisdictions’ gross domestic products (GDP) or proportional to the local jurisdictions’ gross national incomes (GNI)? Is there a qualitative difference between the policy implemented by a local government which exercises decentralized leadership, and the policy implemented by a local government which acts as a Nash follower (vis-à-vis the other governments in the federation), in the presence of a proportional federal revenue mechanism? How does labor mobility affect the results? To address these questions, we set up a model of an economic federation made up of two member states and a federal government. The federal government raises revenue via fees that are either proportional to the member states’ GDP or GNI, and the federal government uses its revenue to finance an exogenous expenditure requirement and (except in a special case) to redistribute resources between the two member states. The federal fees are paid by the state governments, and each state government raises its revenue by taxing the labor income and the profit income earned within the state. There is no restriction on the profit tax. This implies that if the state government chooses to implement a nonzero tax on labor income, then this is a consequence of optimization instead of some arbitrary restriction imposed on the government.Footnote 6 The approach used in this paper makes it possible to analyze how the local governments will respond to the incentive structure implied by the use of a proportional federal revenue mechanism. The key results can be summarized as follows: (i) a proportional federal revenue mechanism provides the local governments with an incentive to implement a higher tax on labor if the local governments act as Nash followers. (ii) The design of the marginal tax on labor income differs depending on whether the federal fee is proportional to GDP or GNI. (iii) If a state government is able to exercise decentralized leadership vis-à-vis the federal government, then the incentive structure underlying the taxation of labor is independent of how the federal government collects its revenue. (iv) If the federal government is not concerned with redistributing income between the two member states, then a proportional federal revenue mechanism provides a decentralized leader with a distinct motive to implement a positive tax on labor income. Only a few earlier studies have examined the incentive structure in a federation with decentralized leadership. Köthenbürger (2004) analyzes tax competition under decentralized leadership, and he considers a two-layer fiscal union with mobile capital where each member state chooses its capital tax to finance the provision of a local public good, while the federal government uses lump-sum transfers to redistribute resources between the member states. His main finding is that horizontal fiscal externalities are neutralized by ex post federal policy. Aronsson (2010) analyzes local public good provision and redistribution in an economic federation where the public sector is not able to observe the ability of the individual agents. Aronsson shows how federal ex post redistribution modifies the provision of the local public good and the design of the optimal income tax. Caplan et al. (2000) study federal lump-sum redistribution and spillover effects of local public goods. With redistribution carried out by the central authority that is directed to the private sector, it is shown that decentralized leadership gives rise to an efficient outcome. Caplan and Silva (2011) analyze decentralized provision of an impure public good where the central authority provides matching grants and redistributes income after the lower-level jurisdictions have determined their contributions to the impure public good. Labor is assumed to be imperfectly mobile, and it is shown that an equilibrium with positive contributions to the impure public good is Pareto efficient.Footnote 7 Finally, in a model of tax competition, Silva (2017) shows that federal equalization schemes provide local governments with correct incentives in the sense that they prevent the phenomenon known as “race to the bottom.” Another issue that has been addressed in the context of decentralized leadership is environmental policy.Footnote 8 Aronsson et al. (2006) consider a model where the central authority sets emission targets to be implemented by the lower-level jurisdictions. The governments in the lower-level jurisdictions face a mixed tax problem, and it is shown how the lower-level governments use their policy instruments to influence the emission target imposed by the central authority. It is also shown that this provides an incentive for implementing a distortionary tax on labor and that the commodity tax does not satisfy the additivity property. The outline of the paper is as follows: In Sect. 2, we characterize the private sector and the federal government. In Sect. 3, we characterize the policy implemented by the local governments when labor is immobile, while the policy implemented when labor is mobile is characterized in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",1

Entrepreneurs challenge incumbent firms thus stimulating improvements and productivity gains and can themselves bring innovations into the market, in the form of new products or processes. A reflection of this view is the widespread existence of policies designed to foster entrepreneurship, to support small young firms and to ease credit constraints. At the heart of the market failure that these policies try to solve is asymmetric information. First, there is an intrinsic riskiness in starting a new venture which makes investors require a risk premium thus raising the cost of capital. Second, the chances of entrepreneurial success depend on a number of factors including the entrepreneur’s human capital, which is not directly observable thus giving rise to adverse selection. Third, the entrepreneur himself faces asymmetric information at the time of acquiring input factors, notably when hiring personnel and in cases when third-party technologies have to be employed. This paper focuses on simultaneous informational asymmetries in the credit market and in the labour market. We develop an agent-based computational model which is designed to mimic the mechanisms described in Boadway and Sato (2011). Our novel contribution lies in explicitly taking into account learning over time and its consequences on the effects of tax and subsidy policies. Simulation analysis is here used to test the effects of policies made of a tax on entrepreneurs and a subsidy to labour income, in a more realistic setting. We study a market that is not in an extreme condition of either full or no information, where excess entry favours learning and thus produces more information in less time. The intuition behind our claim is rather straightforward. If agents over time learn about other agents’ ability or quality, then having more entrants in earlier periods increases the amount of information available and leads the market closer to a condition of full information. Consequently, the optimal level of entry with learning is larger than in a first-best scenario with full information; as the loss in surplus suffered as more bad entrepreneurs enter, the market is (partly, or entirely) compensated by an increase in future surplus due to more efficient market conditions. In our model entrepreneurs and workers decide whether to enter an entrepreneurial market, entrepreneurs hire workers and fund investment costs by means of external financing, and a government may levy taxes or subsidies on both entrepreneurial income and wages. Asymmetric information plagues both the credit market and the input (labour) market. The estimated entrepreneur’s abilityFootnote 1 affects the cost of financing she faces, while the estimated worker’s quality affects his expected wage. After replicating the main features of a market as described in Boadway and Sato (2011) for the polar cases with full information and with no information available, we then introduce the possibility that agents may learn over time, thus better estimating abilities and qualities thanks to informative signals. Our simulation results point to the fact that the way information is produced in the economy meaningfully affects the scoring of different policy options. In some settings a tax on entrepreneurs, which would be optimal under a no-information regime, might be detrimental welfare-wise when learning occurs. Our results suggest that the optimal levels of a subsidy to workers and of a tax on entrepreneurs strongly depend upon the information regime observed in real markets and that learning always implies lower taxes on entrepreneurs at the optimum compared to the no-information regime. In the following, Sect. 2 summarizes the relevant previous literature. Section 3 describes the model, and Sect. 4 discusses the simulation results. Section 5 concludes and points to future avenues for research.",2

Empirical estimates typically indicate low take-up (see, e.g., Blank and Ruggles 1996; U.S. Department of Health & Human Services 2015; Department for Work and Pensions 2008; Riphahn 2001; Gustafsson 2002).Footnote 1 Incomplete take-up reduces the effectiveness of social programs and limits the ability of the government to reduce poverty. It is therefore of central policy importance to understand how take-up can be affected. The various factors that might explain why individuals do not apply for the benefits they are entitled to have generally been categorized into lack of information, information costs, transaction costs, stigma and complexity/non-transparency (Currie 2006; Remler et al. 2001). However, little is known about the relative importance of these factors in different parts of the population. Using a randomized field experiment in the Swedish pension system, we investigate whether information letters with different framing affect the take-up rate of housing allowance for pensioners. Specifically, from a sample of about 95,000 single pensioners (10% of all single individuals in the age group \(65+\) in Sweden) with sufficiently low income to potentially qualify for the housing allowance, about 10,000 individuals were randomly selected to receive any of four different information letters.Footnote 2 One of the letters contained basic information about the housing allowance, which was reproduced in the other three letters with a slight addition that relates to the hypothesis we wish to test. One of the framed letters addressed the role of eligibility myths and stigma while the remaining two letters aimed at clarifying the eligibility criteria. An application form was enclosed in all mailings. Therefore, the letters simultaneously lowered both information costs and transaction costs related to applying for the benefit. Individuals who received no information mailing make up the control group. The housing allowance is a means-tested benefit for pensioners with low income and wealth that pays maximum SEK 5000 (SEK 1 \(\approx \) USD 0.11) per month with an average payment of SEK 2400. Previous studies indicate substantial under-utilization of this benefit and the foregone benefits are large. According to the Swedish National Audit Office, half of the non-claiming individuals are estimated to forego SEK 900 per month, an amount that individuals with a monthly pension income of SEK 10,000 typically could qualify for (Riksrevisionen 2013). While only 15% of the current pensioner population receive housing supplement, as many as 30–35% are likely to be eligible. Our study is closely related to three previous studies in the empirical literature on benefit take-up. From a methodological perspective, our study is inspired by Bhargava and Manoli (2015) who conduct an extensive information intervention aiming to increase the take-up of the US EITC. We distinguish our project from Bhargava and Manoli (2015) by studying take-up among a group of non-working individuals in great economic need with low take-up, namely poor elderly. From a policy perspective, it is important to know whether the effectiveness of information letters varies across individual characteristics like work status and age. Furthermore, as noted by Korpi and Palme (1998), the pensioners are of particular interest since public transfers play a larger role in their income than they do for the working population. The second study is by Matikka and Paukkeri (2016) who analyze the effect on the take-up of the minimum guarantee for pensioners in Finland by sending information on eligibility and an application form to eligible individuals. Our study is similar to the Finnish study in the sense that they also focus on poor elderly. However, in contrast to Matikka and Paukkeri (2016) where the letter recipient status was based on pre-determined pension income status, we randomly assign individuals to different information letters. Furthermore, while Matikka and Paukkeri (2016) study the introduction of a new benefit, we study a benefit that has long been in place. As a result, we do not have to account for potential effects of media coverage and time on take-up. Our study is also inspired by Guthmuller et al. (2014) who conduct a randomized information experiment to increase the take-up rate of a health-insurance voucher program for the poorest in France. An important distinction between our study and Guthmuller et al. (2014) is that they evaluate the effects of two treatments (varying the subsidy amount and invitations to information meetings) against a basic information letter. In our experiment, we have two control groups: one that received no letter and one that received a basic information letter. This allows us to evaluate both the effects of receiving any information at all as well as the specific contents of such a letter. The results show that simple information letters had a significant effect on the application rate and subsequent take-up. The baseline application rate in the targeted control population was only 1.4%, while the corresponding rates in the different treatment groups were between 9.9 and 12.1%. The only letter that had a significantly different effect from the basic information letter was the letter that addressed common misconceptions about the benefit’s eligibility criteria. This group had the highest application rate of 12.1% compared to the basic letter of 9.9%. The effects are particularly large for old pensioners (above the age of 80). We also find that the economic impact of the treatment was substantial. Using an IV analysis, where application is instrumented by treatment, we estimate an income effect of approximately SEK 750. This means that the applicants, induced by the treatment (i.e., the compliers), increased their income by roughly 10%. However, the information treatments also had negative effects in the form of substantially lower conditional acceptance rates. The applications in the control group were accepted in almost 3 out of 4 cases, while up to 50% of the applications in the treatment group were declined. These findings suggest that there is strong positive self-selection among the applicants in the treatment group and that the information letters pushed some individuals to apply even though they were not eligible. The lower conditional acceptance rate in the treatment group seems to be largely driven by wealth, which the Pensions Agency cannot observe prior to submission. However, all the other unobservables—occupational pension, cohabitation status and housing expenses—also seem to contribute to lower eligibility among the treated applicants. Declined applications are costly both to the individuals in terms of false hope and the effort of applying, but also to taxpayers in general through the administrative costs of processing applications for ineligible applicants. The substantial decrease in conditional acceptance rates among the treated is somewhat surprising since all letters aimed at simplifying the pensioners’ own evaluations of eligibility. We can only speculate about the reasons for this decline in self-selection among the treated. One reason could be the well known fact that Swedes (and Scandinavians in general) report a very high level of trust toward public institutions [see, e.g., Rothstein and Uslaner (2005)]. It is possible that a high level of trust may misfire, so that an individual who is informed by an institution that she may be eligible simply disregards her own knowledge and presumes that the authorities know best. If this, arguably speculative, story is correct, public institutions with high levels of trust need to be extra careful when designing information campaigns aimed at increasing benefit take-up in situations with imprecise targeting. It could also be the case that the information treatments simply lowered the costs of submitting an application to the point where many applied even though they thought that they were not likely eligible.Footnote 3 The results also indicate that far from all letter recipients applied (the non-application rate is close to 90%). Many probably refrained from applying because they knew that they were not eligible due to any of the aforementioned unobservables. Even though this group did not waste any effort on applying, the misdirected letters may have a cost in terms of bad publicity for the Pensions Agency. Of course, the high non-application rate also implies large direct costs of sending letters to non-eligible people. This adds to the necessity of more accurate assessment of the eligibility of individuals before scaling up these interventions to the broader population of (potentially eligible) non-claimants. Our finding that information letters increase take-up is consistent with studies that examine the impact on benefit take-up of receiving an information letter compared to receiving no letter at all. Bhargava and Manoli (2015) find large effects on take-up from simple reminders about the EITC. Matikka and Paukkeri (2016) also find that the targeted information letters about a new guarantee pension system (introduced in 2011) significantly increased take-up and prompted pensioners to apply sooner.Footnote 4 To our knowledge, the only related study with similar difficulties in reaching the eligible population is Guthmuller et al. (2014). While the submission rate in their experiment was slightly higher than in our case (16.7%), the conditional acceptance rate was very similar (55.2%). Regarding the different explanations for why some individuals do not apply for the benefits they are entitled to, we conclude, based on the modest differences between the different letter framings, that the primary explanation for the low take-up rate among poor elderly is low awareness.Footnote 5 An interesting exception, however, is that the conditional acceptance rate for the Rule of Thumb Letter was about 20% higher than that of the Base Letter. Demonstrating the eligibility criteria using simple examples might therefore be the most effective tool to get eligible individuals to apply. This is in line with the finding in Bhargava and Manoli (2015) that simplified information about the benefit had larger effects. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a background of the Swedish pension system and the housing allowance for pensioners. Section 3 describes the experimental setup, including the sample selection and the contents of the information letters. Section 4 reports the results from the experiment, and Sect. 5 concludes.",4

The new approach is to exempt dividends and capital gains corresponding to a normal rate of return from tax and to levy a full tax—equal to the personal tax rate on income from capital—on any excess returns. The rate of return allowance (RRA) is computed as the product of the imputation rate, which is the after-tax interest rate, and the stepped-up basis of the share, which is the sum of its acquisition price and all previous unused RRAs. An in-depth account of the new system has earlier been given by the chief architect of the reform, Peter Birch Sørensen (2005),Footnote 1 and further analysis appears in Alstadsæter and Fjærli (2009), Fjærli and Raknerud (2009), Lindhe and Södersten (2012), Jacob and Södersten (2013), and  Kari and Laitila (2016), as well as in several chapters of the Mirrlees Review (see e.g., Griffith et al. 2010). The Norwegian Shareholder Tax is seen to avoid the distortionary lock in effect associated with conventional realization-based taxation of capital gains. As the new rules make the tax equivalent to a cash flow tax, the system is also argued to be neutral with respect to firms’ investment and financing decisions. However, neither Sørensen nor the other authors quoted above present an explicit analysis of the impact of the tax on the firm’s cost of capital. Relying on what is essentially intuitive reasoning is problematic as standard tax models suggest important differences in the impact of shareholder taxes between the two sources of equity funds, i.e., new share issues and retained earnings. As the basis of a corporate share under the Norwegian Shareholder Tax depends on its acquisition price, it is clear that investment projects financed from new share issues will benefit from the new rules. But it is also clear that the retention of earnings to finance new investment does not add to the basis of the shares, that is, to the tax benefits. This apparent asymmetry therefore seems to indicate that the new rules may well eliminate the tax distortion to the cost of new share issues, but will leave the cost of capital unchanged when the marginal source of funds is retained earnings. The provision that the stepped-up basis of the share includes any unused RRAs (including compound interest) makes no difference to this, as the shareholders neither gain nor lose from postponing the allowance. This short note derives the firm’s cost of capital with the Norwegian Shareholder Tax. Despite the apparent asymmetry in the treatment of the two sources of equity funds, the Shareholder Tax is shown to be neutral, just as claimed by Sørensen et al. The simple and important key to this result—overlooked in previous research—is that a shareholder who chooses to realize the capital gain from the retention of earnings is able to get a higher price for her shares as a result of the future RRAs which the next shareholder may claim on her acquisition cost. This share appreciation exactly offsets the capital gains tax suffered by the original shareholder.",2

Although it has been strongly prioritized by political leaders of the European Union, and several proposals have been put forward, little actual progress has been made either on border management or on how to distribute or redistribute refugees across member states. At the heart of this policy problem is the strong resistance to refugee immigration among large parts of the population in each country. This resistance appears to be due to two main components: refugee immigration increases cultural heterogeneity, and it may weaken public finances.Footnote 1 While concerns about increased cultural heterogeneity are mostly subjective and value-based, the effects of refugee immigration on public finances can in principle be objectively measured. Such measurement will improve countries’ understanding of the consequences of admitting more or fewer refugees.Footnote 2 In this article, I investigate what would be the likely fiscal consequences if the European Union would allow increased refugee immigration. The analysis uses data from Sweden, which has had high refugee immigration from several countries of origin for several decades, and high-quality data that allow identifying these refugees and tracking their economic performance. The results indicate that the fiscal consequences would be fairly modest even if refugee immigration was substantially increased. As a benchmark, the fiscal redistribution to the entire refugee population in Sweden in 2015 is estimated to have been the equivalent of 1.0% of GDP. If the European Union would resettle every single refugee who currently resides in Asia or Africa, it would amount to an immigration rate of 2.5%. The implied average annual fiscal redistribution to these refugees over their expected lifetime (58 years) is estimated to be the equivalent of approximately 0.6% of GDP, i.e., substantially below the corresponding number for Sweden in 2015. This estimate is based on an assumption about the labor market potential of these hypothetical refugees that is likely to be an exaggeration in the negative direction.",4

In response, policymakers have proposed—and economists have studied—a large variety of schemes designed to increase saving for retirement. One instrument to boost saving for retirement of particular interest is ‘automatic enrolment’ (sometimes termed default enrolment or ‘opt-out’ design) where employers enrol employees automatically into a workplace pension scheme, which employees can then choose to leave. Although automatic enrolment has been prominently highlighted as a particular success story of the real-world implementation of the insights of behavioural economics (Benartzi and Thaler 2013; Madrian 2014; Chetty 2015; Thaler 2016), until now almost all the evidence on the impact of automatic enrolment on participation in employer-provided pensions and pension saving comes from the voluntary introduction of automatic enrolment by large firms in the USA (Madrian and Shea (2001) and Choi et al. (2004); though Chetty et al. (2014) study a case in Denmark). In many cases, these firms have introduced automatic enrolment to comply with the Internal Revenue Service’s non-discrimination rules (see Choi et al. 2002; Butrica and Karamcheva 2015).Footnote 1 However, the effects of automatic enrolment on pension saving when employers do not voluntarily choose to introduce it (and are instead obliged by government to enrol their employees automatically) may be different—particularly if employers take action to limit pension participation, such as by providing low employer pension contributions. This paper studies the effect of obliging employers to enrol their employees into a workplace pension, using the first ever introduction of such a policy on a nationwide scale. Specifically, we exploit the phased roll-out, by employer size, in the UK of the obligation for employers to enrol most of their employees into a pension automatically since 2012 to estimate its effect on saving in a workplace pension by private sector employees. The roll-out from largest to smallest employers introduces exogenous variation in the timing of when employers were obliged to enrol their employees in a workplace pension scheme, which we exploit using a difference-in-differences methodology. This paper provides the first assessment of the impact of automatic enrolment that allows for changes in employer behaviour in response to the policy in a context where those employers did not choose to introduce automatic enrolment. This kind of impact cannot be identified when automatic enrolment is introduced voluntarily by some large employers. We find that obliging employers to implement automatic enrolment in the UK led to large increases in the pension participation rates and in the total contributions to workplace pensions. For targeted private sector employees, automatic enrolment led to an increase of 36 percentage points in the probability of participating in a workplace pension scheme. By 2015, 88% of targeted private sector employees who were enrolled automatically were a member of a workplace pension. The largest effects on pension participation are for those with the lowest participation rates prior to automatic enrolment: those in their 20s, lower-paid employees, those who have joined their employer more recently, and those employed in industries with low pre-reform rates of pension participation. The policy is found to have increased the total contribution rate to a workplace pension by 1.05% of earnings, compared with a pre-reform average of 7.0%, therefore significantly boosting pension saving. One of the reasons that automatic enrolment has increased workplace pension savings is that employers’ decisions have boosted—rather than mitigated—the impact on pension savings. We find some employers enrolling their employees into pension schemes with employer contributions well above the minimum contributions mandated by the government. The effect on pension saving was also increased due to substantial spillover effects of the policy. We find that the pension participation rates of workers who were not obliged to be automatically enrolled increased by 18 percentage points on average, thereby more than doubling the pension participation rate among this group. There are a number of important reasons that we would expect automatic enrolment to increase workplace pension participation. First, by defaulting employees into a pension scheme, automatic enrolment solves the procrastination problem (in which people think that in future they will save for retirement, but they are naive and continually put it off (O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999)). Second, because automatic enrolment involves default contributions and asset allocations, automatic enrolment makes the decision to participate less complex. Since complexity of a decision is known to lead to individuals putting off the decision to join (Tversky and Shafir 1992), automatic enrolment should therefore lead to higher participation. Third, Beshears et al. (2009) argue that individuals may see the default options under automatic enrolment as implicit advice on the best course of action. This endorsement (from either the employer or government) may lead to more people participating (and at the default contributions). Finally, there are some individuals who are automatically enrolled in a pension who were not previously offered an employer contribution to their pension, and now are offered at least 1% of qualifying earnings (see more details in Sect. 2.1). These individuals may choose to be in their workplace pension in order to be able to receive the (albeit small) employer contribution that they were not offered before. Previous empirical evidence on the impact of automatic enrolment has been based on its voluntary introduction largely by employers in the USA. Madrian and Shea (2001) compare two cohorts of employees at a large healthcare firm in the USA, where the cohort hired later were enrolled automatically into a 401(k) scheme with a 3% default employee contribution. They find that participation rates in the pension scheme increased dramatically for the cohort that were enrolled automatically, with 86% of employees enrolled in the 401(k) after 3–15 months, compared with only 37% of those who were not subject to automatic enrolment. Moreover, they find that the 3% default contribution was extremely salient; almost 65% of the cohort eligible for automatic enrolment had contributions equal to the default rate, and the proportion of the cohort with higher contributions fell, implying that automatic enrolment led to some employees contributing less than they would have in the absence of automatic enrolment. Importantly, Chetty et al. (2014) use Danish administrative data and find that only 15% of people respond actively to automatic pension contributions (by reducing other saving), implying that, for most people, higher pension saving due to automatic contributions is not offset by reductions in other saving. These results are of particular interest because automatic enrolment is becoming more popular among public policymakers internationally. Prior to its introduction in the UK, a small number of countries have introduced policies involving automatic enrolment, but they have been either partial or temporary (in Chile) or alongside a raft of other savings policies (in New Zealand). However, by 2017 several states in the USA (California, Connecticut, Illinois and Oregon) had legislated to introduce automatic enrolment (Munnell et al. 2016) while since 2018 new service recruits to the US military have been auto-enrolled into the Thrift Savings Plan (see Executive Office of the President 2016). Many other developed countries are also planning on (or actively considering) introducing automatic enrolment, including Germany, Ireland and Poland. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional setting for pensions in the UK and the details of the introduction of automatic enrolment there. Section 3 describes the data used in this paper, Sect. 4 sets out the empirical strategy, and Sect. 5 presents the results. Section 6 concludes.",4

In turn, this means that to assess the welfare properties of these policies, only these elasticities, rather than fully structural models, need to be estimated.Footnote 1 The sufficient statistic approach originated in a seminal paper by Feldstein (1999), who showed that the marginal excess burden (MEB) of a proportional income tax only depends on the behavioral responses to the tax via a sufficient statistic, the elasticity of taxable income (ETI). The ETI summarizes the response of a given household to changes in the tax rate, although these changes can be at several margins (hours, effort, etc.) Feldstein’s paper has given rise to a large literature devoted to obtaining empirical estimates of the ETI (Gruber and Saez 2002; Saez et al. 2012; Kleven and Schultz 2014; Weber 2014). Subsequently, Saez (2001) and Saez et al. (2012) showed that the Feldstein formula for the MEB could be extended to the top rate of tax in a progressive piecewise-linear income tax system, and they also established formulae for the revenue and welfare-maximizing rate of tax. These formulae also have the sufficient statistic feature; specifically, they depend only on the ETI, a statistic of the income distribution, which is constant if the top tail of the income distribution is Pareto,Footnote 2 and possibly a welfare weight. In this paper, we ask the question as to whether these sufficient statistic properties of key formulae also extend to tax systems with notches. Generally, a tax notch occurs when there is a discontinuous change in the tax liability as the tax base varies (Slemrod 2013; Kleven 2016). In practice, we do see notches in several major kinds of taxes, and these are being increasingly studied in the empirical literature. For example, in Pakistan, there are notches of up to 5% in the personal income tax (Kleven and Waseem 2013), and in Ireland, an emergency income levy after the financial crisis had a notch of up to 4% (Hargaden 2015).Footnote 3 There are small notches in the federal income tax in the USA, and larger notches induced by income-dependent entitlement to tax credits (Slemrod 2013). In Germany, there is a large notch in income tax generated by the Mini-Job program (Tazhitdinova 2018).Footnote 4 Notches also exist in other major taxes. For example, notches are, or were until recently, present in housing transactions taxes in the UK and the USA (Best and Kleven 2013; Kopczuk and Munroe 2015). They also arise in the corporate income tax in Costa Rica (Bachas and Soto 2015). Slemrod (2013) notes that there are many examples of commodity tax notches, where a marginal change in some characteristic can change the product classification so as to produce a discrete change in the tax liability.Footnote 5 Finally, as argued by Liu and Lockwood (2015), a VAT threshold can be thought of as a tax notch; a firm’s VAT liability changes discontinuously when its sales go over the registration threshold. Indeed, given the importance and near-ubiquity of VAT, this is probably the most important example of a tax notch. We first study notches in the income tax setting of Saez (2010) and others, where households differ in ability or taste so that the disutility of generating taxable income varies across households. For simplicity, we assume a two-bracket tax, i.e., a tax with a lower rate below a threshold, and a higher rate above. In this setting, our first contribution is to derive an exact formula for the marginal excess burden (MEB) of the higher rate of tax. This formula is similar to Feldstein (1999)’s formula for the MEB of a proportional income tax, but includes a correction factor that captures the effect of the bunching response to an increase in the top rate tax on tax revenue. The bunching response measures the change in the number of households bunching at the threshold to avoid paying the top rate of tax and is a property of the distribution of households. In what follows, to make it clear that this is a property of the distribution, we will henceforth call it the aggregate bunching response. It is thus distinct from the change in taxable income of a particular household induced by a change in the tax rate. The latter is measured by the elasticity of taxable income, and in what follows, we will call the second kind of response the individual response, as it pertains to a particular individual or household.Footnote 6 Our main point is that with a notch, unlike the case of a kink, the aggregate bunching response affects tax revenue because with a notch, the tax schedule is discontinuous at the threshold. Specifically, an increase in the top rate of tax increases bunching just below the notch, which—due to the notch—lowers tax revenue, and thus raises the MEB. Moreover, this correction factor to the Feldstein formula, denoted C, cannot be expressed as a simple function of the usual sufficient statistics, i.e., the ETI and the Pareto parameter of the upper tail of the income distribution. It does depend on these variables, but it also depends on the lower rate of tax, the position of the notch, and a counterfactual, i.e., the earnings that the individual at the top of the interval (the top buncher) would choose if faced with the higher rate of tax. So, the sufficient statistic approach seems to break down with tax notches. However, all is not lost. We show how the counterfactual earnings of the top buncher can be computed theoretically, using the indifference condition that the top buncher is indifferent between bunching and being above the notch. Alternatively, in any empirical study of bunching, it can be computed empirically, using the estimate of excess mass at the notch (the parameter B in Kleven and Waseem 2013). Thus, this paper is the first to show how bunching estimates at notches can be used to make welfare calculations. Of course, if the correction factor turns out to be small, the Feldstein formula still provides a good approximation to the MEB. Our third contribution is to investigate whether this is the case. Calibrations show that the percentage error from using the Feldstein formula for the MEB can be very large. At baseline values, the marginal excess burden is underestimated by a factor of six. So, the conclusion is that at least in the income tax setting, the sufficient statistic approach is not practical. We then turn to apply our approach to the VAT, which is the most empirically important example of a tax notch. We present a simple model of small traders who differ in productivity, and are subject to VAT at rate t above a threshold level of sales. We show that this model is formally equivalent to our income tax model, in the sense that registered firms above the threshold face an effective rate of VAT \(t_{R}\) on value-added, and non-registered firms below the threshold face a lower but positive effective rate \(t_{N}\).Footnote 7 We then show that the MEB of an increase in the statutory rate of VAT is given by the Feldstein formula for a proportional tax plus a correction factor as in the income tax case. However, the details of the correction factor are more complex, because an increase in the statutory rate t increases both the effective rates \(t_{R},t_{N}\). A calibration of the model shows that the proportional tax formula for the MEB of the VAT underestimates the true MEB by a factor of up to three. Finally, it should be noted that in this paper, we take all parameters of the tax system, including the notch, as given, and only vary the top rate of tax. A broader question, to be addressed in future work, is whether a notch can ever be part of an optimal tax system.Footnote 8 The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. After the literature review in Sects. 2 and 3, we set up the model. Section 4 has the main analytical results for the income tax, Sect. 4.3 has an extension to tax evasion, and Sect. 5 the simulations. Section 6 deals with the extension to the VAT, and Sect. 7 concludes.",3

Rablen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"An estimated 10% of world GDP is held in tax havens, much, though by no means all, of which goes unreported (Zucman 2013; Alstadsæter et al. 2018). The loss of tax receipts due to offshore tax evasion by individuals in the United States (US) alone has been estimated at $30–40 billion per annum (Gravelle 2009). In recent years, data breaches have allowed tax authorities around the world to acquire information on thousands of offshore investments. To recover any tax owing on these investments, tax authorities have, in many instances, offered affected investors a one-off and time-limited opportunity to make a voluntary disclosure through a bespoke facility giving overt incentives for honesty (usually in the form of a lower fine rate). We term facilities of this form Incentivized Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Schemes, or just “schemes”. The net revenues arising from such schemes have been significant: in 2009 a US scheme raised $3.4 billion (GAO 2013) and a UK scheme netted nearly £500 million (Treasury Committee 2012). The UK scheme is estimated to have cost £6 million to administer (Committee of Public Accounts 2008), implying a return of 67:1. This compares favorably with reported yield/cost ratios in the UK of around 8:1 for traditional audit-based enforcement programs (HMRC 2006).Footnote 1 The advent of offshore data leakages, and the associated implementation of voluntary disclosure schemes, may have come as a surprise to holders of legacy investments, but such developments are by now well understood by today’s prospective offshore investors. Given that such schemes are by now largely anticipated, this raises the question of whether the continued use of such schemes is gainful to tax authorities. In particular, in offering incentives for voluntary disclosure, might such schemes simply encourage illegal offshore investment in the first place—a concern pointed to by some recent empirical evidence. We shed light on this concern. In this paper, we appraise the use of anticipated offshore disclosure schemes using game theoretic tools. The model has two key features. First, we consider disclosure schemes that are implemented retrospectively in response to an information leak, as we argue characterizes practice in the UK and US. By the time of the information leak, however, the act of illegal offshore evasion has already taken place. As it cannot influence the illegal act retrospectively, the best a tax authority can do is seek to recover any tax owed. The importance of this observation lies in the fact that, in implementing incentivized schemes to recover efficiently tax owed from past evasion, the tax authority may inadvertently change the incentives for future acts of offshore evasion. Second, we recognize that there can be legitimate economic reasons for holding money in offshore accounts. Accordingly, not all investors who appear in data on offshore holdings owe tax. Pritchard and Khan (2005), the only published work we are aware of by tax authority insiders with unfettered access to the UK offshore data, reports that even among those entities flagged as the highest risk category in offshore data only 70% were expected to owe tax. Why invest offshore if not to evade tax? As well as potential pecuniary benefits in the form of higher pre-tax rates of interest than available onshore, offshore investments can also offer legitimate tax advantages. Pension funds routinely invest via funds domiciled offshore, for they enable investors from different countries to invest in the same fund and can also legally prevent instances of double taxation. Most major onshore hedge funds have an accompanying offshore vehicle. For US-based tax-exempt organizations, such vehicles provide some legitimate relief from taxation of unrelated business income tax. As well as legitimate tax advantages, offshore investments potentially offer a range of non-pecuniary benefits: offshore providers are known to offer greater convenience and sophistication, presumably as they face lighter regulatory controls as compared with their onshore counterparts (Helm 1997).Footnote 2 Recent leakages reveal that, in early 2000s, the Queen of the UK held around £10 million of her private money offshore: such investments had no tax motivation as the Queen is exempt from UK income and capital gains taxes. DEG, a development finance institution wholly owned by the German state, is known to have used offshore accounts for a number of years, citing non-pecuniary factors it utilized for legitimate operational purposes.Footnote 3 Professional poker players, and other individuals who must transact regularly in many different currencies, are also known to make legitimate use of offshore bank accounts (O’Reilly 2007). In order to appraise the impact of anticipated disclosure schemes, we first model the strategic interaction between investors and the tax authority in the absence of a scheme.Footnote 4 We then introduce a scheme into the model and compare the results. An investor can decide to place an exogenous lump-sum either onshore or offshore. An onshore investment must be made legally, but an offshore investment may be made either legally or illegally. As such, not all investments tax authorities observe in offshore data owe tax. If an investor invests offshore, the investment is subsequently observed by the tax authority with a positive probability. In the absence of a scheme, if an investor’s offshore investment is observed, the tax authority can, if it chooses, verify whether any tax is owed, but at a cost. Following verification of a tax liability, the tax authority can recover outstanding taxes and levy fines. An equilibrium of this game is inefficient to the extent that the tax authority struggles to achieve a credible threat to verify, owing to its inability to distinguish between legal and illegal offshore investments. In the presence of a scheme, the tax authority chooses an incentivized fine rate that will apply to liabilities disclosed within the scheme, and investors decide whether or not to make a disclosure within the scheme. If an investor does make a disclosure, they can either disclose their offshore investment to be illegal and pay the tax owed plus a fine at the incentivized rate, or disclose their investment as legal. The tax authority can choose to verify the investments of those investors who disclose their offshore investment to be legal (for an illegal investment might be falsely disclosed as legal). Even if an investor decides not to make a disclosure within the scheme, the tax authority can nevertheless choose to verify their investment and, where appropriate, levy fines. We find that the introduction of a disclosure scheme induces fewer investors to invest offshore illegally. Key to this finding is the idea that disclosure schemes induce endogenous decisions by investors that act to lower the marginal cost of enforcement for tax authorities. Our findings imply that the number of investors investing onshore increases, but so too may the number investing offshore legally. Thus, our model suggests that empirical evidence pointing to increased offshore investment following the introduction of a scheme may not be evidence that such schemes generate additional offshore evasion, but instead evidence that such schemes generate additional legal offshore investment. Tax authorities also benefit from schemes: expected net revenue increases due to the additional voluntary compliance that occurs when some investors switch from investing offshore illegally to investing offshore legally. Consistent with the design of schemes in the UK, the model predicts that the optimal incentivized fine rate is the lowest allowable fine rate permitted in legislation. The paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 gives an overview of the use and design of disclosure schemes in the recovery of offshore tax evasion, and Sect. 3 casts our contribution in the context of the existing literature. Section 4 presents the model, which is developed in the absence of a scheme in Sect. 5, and in the presence of a scheme in Sect. 6. Section 7 gives a comparative analysis of the consequences of the introduction of a scheme for investment behavior, welfare, and for net tax revenue; and Sect. 8 concludes.",6

In emerging economies, however, there are reasons to expect different fiscal adjustment patterns such as weaker sub-national own-revenue systems, higher levels of fiscal disparities, rent-seeking behavior and corruption, the composition of government spending, coordination failures in the conduct of fiscal policy, and bailout expectations (Bird 2012; Bird and Fiszbein 2008; Acosta and Bird 2005). Despite this widespread view, there is a lack of empirical evidence supporting some of these hypotheses. This article aims to fill this gap in knowledge by using a panel dataset of more than 900 municipalities in Colombia over the period 1985–2015. The Colombian case is interesting for three reasons. First, it is one of the most decentralized public systems in Latin America. For instance, the share of local spending in total public expenditures increased from 18.5 in 1995 to 36.8% in 2012, and intergovernmental grants as a percentage of national government expenditures rose from 46.7 in 1995 to 62.9% in 2012. Second, during the last three decades, Colombia has embarked on a political and fiscal decentralization program. Its purpose has been to transfer responsibilities from higher levels of government to lower ones in order to improve the efficiency in service delivery (Manor 1999; De Mello 2000; Rodden 2002).Footnote 1 Nevertheless, this process is still a work in progress (Bird 2012). Some authors claim that there is a problematic transfer system, limited tax autonomy, and important concerns about how to control sub-national spending to avoid over-borrowing and overspending. Third, over the period of analysis, approximately 10% of all municipalities in Colombia declared themselves in bankruptcy and followed specific debt restructuring programs under the Law 550 of 1999.Footnote 2 It is thus relevant to recognize the fiscal constraints that Colombian sub-national units face when they react to changes in their budgets and the decisions they make. Surprisingly, despite the facts that fiscal autonomy to raise own-source revenues and less transfer dependency are associated with higher levels of efficiency in delivering government services (Martínez 2016; Bird 2012), the Colombian fiscal scheme relies on large portions of grants going to local budgets (Faguet and Sánchez 2014; Cortés 2010; Sánchez 2006). For instance, Gemmell et al. (2013) support the hypothesis that if local governments acquire more administrative powers or autonomy to manage their budgets, especially on the side of their revenues, then it will generate higher levels of investment and enhance economic growth. However, as Sánchez (2006) and Martínez (2016) point out, intergovernmental transfers can have a negative effect on the local government behavior in terms of limited incentives to increase their own-source revenues to finance local productive spending.Footnote 3 Although to estimate the effect of grants or own-source revenues in delivery services is an important task, the purpose of this paper, instead, is to assess how local governments in Colombia maintain their fiscal solvency in response to budget imbalances, to determine what sort of policies they implement, and the role of intergovernmental grants in this context. Understanding this process is crucial because there is evidence that reductions in government spending or increases in tax rates, following fiscal consolidation programs, could have differential impacts on fiscal sustainability and economic growth (Alesina and Ardagna 2013).Footnote 4 My contribution to the literature in this research is thus threefold. First, I revisit the question about the dynamic interrelationship between revenues and expendituresthat at the local level, by using more disaggregated data on both the revenue and expenditure side following the specification proposed by Bessho and Ogawa (2015). Second, to the best of my knowledge, I provide the first empirical analysis on the fiscal adjustment process at the sub-national level in a developing country and relate the main results to the experiences in advanced economies. Third, given that the local governments in Colombia show important differences in terms of their fiscal autonomy, types of expenditure, and responsibilities (Bird 2012), I also compare the degree of fiscal adjustment across local governments bearing in mind population size, the level of local GDP per capita, and fiscal decentralization indicators. As in previous studies on fiscal adjustments at the local level, I estimate a panel vector error-correction model assuming that the local governments commit to satisfy an intertemporal budget constraint, in order to evaluate how local governments restore their fiscal solvency over time when they face unexpected changes in their fiscal deficits and public debt levels. In line with the effects reported in some international studies in developed economics, e.g., Japan, Spain, Germany, or the USA (Bessho and Ogawa 2015; Solé-Ollé and Sorribas-Navarro 2012; Buettner 2009; Buettner and Wildasin 2006), my results consistently show that intergovernmental grants and changes in government investment play an important role in helping sub-national units to reduce their fiscal deficits. Likewise, my estimations also highlight that there are perverse incentives in the Colombian fiscal scheme since local governments could induce more grants by increasing their spending, a fact that has also been shown for developed countries. Moreover, it is worth noting that, in contrast to the cases in the USA and Germany, own-source revenues in large cities respond to a higher extent to changes in other budgetary variables. This suggests that they could be in a better position to ensure themselves against common and idiosyncratic shocks. The organization of the paper is as follows. In the next section, I present a brief literature review. In Sect. 3, I describe a basic framework for understanding the intertemporal budget constraint at the local level. In Sect. 4, I present the datasets and point out their main characteristics. In Sect. 5, the empirical strategy is provided. Section 6 describes the specification tests used to estimate the model. In Sect. 7, I point to the main results and perform robustness checks. Section 8 concludes.",3

Evidence from the European Union tax haven blacklist,December 2020,Aija Rusina,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"After months of screening of global tax policies, on December 5, 2017, the European Union (EU) finance ministers blacklisted 17 countries for refusing to cooperate with the EU’s decade-long crackdown on tax havens.Footnote 1 The EU referred to the blacklist as list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions, since the listed countries failed to make sufficient commitments in response to the EU’s concerns. Large media sites, including the Financial Times, the Guardian, Thomson Reuters, among others, provided news coverage on the first-ever EU blacklist, naming and shaming tax havens. Before the blacklist was published, the public was unaware of the countries featuring in the list and the potential EU sanctions. On the blacklist publication day, it was revealed that, beyond being named, countries face few consequences for being blacklisted.Footnote 2 Since the blacklist does not have specific sanctions or financial penalties attached to it, it has been criticized as an insufficient response to the scale of tax evasion worldwide. Alex Cobham, the director of research at the Tax Justice Network (2017), commented that “tax avoiders and the countries that sponsor them will all be letting out a sigh of relief today.” In this study, I examine the effect that publication of the EU tax haven blacklist had on share prices of firms with subsidiaries in the blacklisted countries. As there were no specific penalties associated with the blacklist, I expect that it worked mainly as a shaming mechanism, potentially inducing reputational costs for firms exposed to the blacklisted tax havens.Footnote 3 Investors of the exposed firms may be concerned with damage to firms’ brand value, losing customers to a boycott, diminished prospects for recruiting and retaining employees, and a weakened ability to raise capital. Hence, a negative market reaction towards the users of the exposed tax havens can be expected. My contribution to the existing literature on effects of blacklisting and shaming of tax havens is twofold. First, this is the first paper to examine the publication of the first-ever EU tax haven blacklist, which was hotly anticipated by campaigners, lobbyists and politicians on both sides of the offshore debate. Second, the existing literature examines blacklisting effects on tax havens themselves, while I examine effects on firms that are users of the blacklisted tax havens. The analysis provides important policy implications on whether tax haven blacklisting and shaming affect firm value. I find significantly negative abnormal stock price returns following publication of the EU tax haven blacklist for firms that are users of the recognized tax havens. Publication of the blacklist reduced value of firms with the blacklisted haven subsidiaries by 0.56% relative to other firms. In economic terms, blacklist reduced the overall market capitalization of the exposed firms by $56 billion. The negative reaction increases with the proportion of tax haven subsidiaries the firm has, and the largest reaction is for those tax havens, for which it was not foreseeable that they would be included in the blacklist. To investigate the partial relationship between firm characteristics and stock price reaction to tax shelter news, I examine cross-sectional variation in the market reaction. I consider corporate citizenship, tax aggressiveness and expropriation as the potential mechanisms that can explain the negative market response to publication of the blacklist. First, the possibility of negative consumer reaction to indication of bad corporate citizenship makes firms relatively vulnerable to news of their tax avoidance strategies, especially so for firms operating in the retail sector. In line with this, I find that retail firms experienced a larger stock price decrease than firms in other industries. Further, potential countermeasures should matter most for more tax-aggressive firms, since they have more to lose if the tax haven preferential treatment is limited as a consequence of the blacklist. Publication of the blacklist may result in regulatory fines and penalties for past actions or lead to lower tax avoidance in the future, both of which may decrease firm value. I measure tax avoidance as that part of the statutory tax rate less firm’s effective tax rate that is unexplained by firm, country and industry characteristics. I find that the more tax-aggressive firms have more negative returns around publication of the EU tax haven blacklist. This result shows that investors expect firms might be audited or fined for past or overly aggressive tax avoidance. The negative reaction might also reflect the potential future costs of restructuring the firms might incur in order to keep their corporate tax payments low. As maintaining such tax strategies has become costlier, firms might reduce their tax avoidance in response. When I use cash effective tax rates to measure firm’s tax aggressiveness, I find that the market reacts positively to evidence that a firm tries to reduce taxes (has a high proportion of tax haven subsidiaries), when its financial reports would lead one to believe the firm is not tax aggressive (has a high cash effective tax rate). Finally, the underlying secrecy of tax havens can be used for expropriation purposes that destroy shareholder value. If investors suspect that managers who support tax avoidance activities might also be aggressive with reporting firm’s accounting earnings, then the market may grow suspicious of accuracy of the company’s financial statements.Footnote 4 Then, news on firm’s tax avoidance might be perceived as evidence not only about firm’s behaviour towards tax authorities, but also about insiders’ willingness to be aggressive with investors as well. Moreover, use of tax havens should be more costly to shareholders in countries that feature high expropriation risk. I use firm-level and country-level evidence to study expropriation as the possible cost to shareholders of having tax haven subsidiaries. If the blacklist was a credible threat, blacklisting should contribute towards higher scrutiny and less shareholder expropriation in the future. Then, weakly governed firms and firms in countries with high expropriation risk should be less negatively affected by publication of the blacklist than strongly governed firms. The results conform to these expectations and show, for a range of governance variables, a smaller negative effect of the blacklist for weakly governed firms. This suggests that the potentially increased auditing, monitoring, scrutiny and transparency following publication of the blacklist reduce some of the expropriation cost associated with having tax haven subsidiaries. Another explanation for the finding is that public shaming matters less for firms that are already exposed to high expropriation risk, and they therefore react less to publication of the blacklist. Moreover, investors react to the evolution of the blacklist and respond positively to countries being excluded from the blacklist. Overall, the results show that the EU was successful at shaming the users of tax havens, which resulted in negative market reaction towards the affected firms. The blacklist was considered as a credible threat to the retail firms and most tax-aggressive firms, despite the lack of specific sanctions or financial penalties. The blacklist was perceived as positive news in weakly governed firms and firms in countries with high expropriation risk. This is consistent with increased scrutiny by the EU and potential future countermeasures following publication of the blacklist, which should contribute towards less future expropriation of shareholders. The setup of the paper will be as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review, and Sect. 3 discusses the institutional setting, data and methodology of the study. Section 4 presents the descriptive statistics, while Sect. 5 discusses the results. Section 6 explores the cross-sectional variation in market reactions, and Sect. 7 discusses the evolution of the blacklist. Section 8 concludes.",7

This includes the discretion to decide about expenditures and to impose local taxes. This autonomy is often combined with equalization transfers ensuring that all subnational governments have sufficient funding to provide a similar level of public good provision. As Boadway (2004, p. 212) puts it “...equalization can be seen as a necessary counterpart to decentralization, offsetting its tendency to create disparities among regions in the ability to provide public goods and services.” However, since fiscal equalization provides jurisdictions with more funds when their own revenues decline, fiscal equalization may alter the incentives of subnational governments to raise their own source revenues. In particular, states receiving transfers may reduce their own tax effort (e.g., Musgrave 1961). Yet, depending on how fiscal equalization is designed, it may provide incentives to increase rather than lower taxes (e.g., Smart 1998). In a reform that became effective in 2007, the German federation has aimed to strengthen the autonomy of state governments in taxation and assigned the rate of the real estate transfer tax (RETT) to the discretion of the states. The system of fiscal equalization was left basically unchanged, however. As depicted in Fig. 1, the reform in 2006 had strong effects on tax policy. In the decade following the reform, the 16 German states have enacted no less than 26 tax rate changes. All changes were tax increases—no state has lowered its tax rate. Initially, the tax rate was 3.5% on the sales price. In some states, the tax rate has almost doubled; in 2017, the mean tax rate reached a level of 5.3%. Real estate transfer tax rate increases among the German States. Number of tax rate increases by the 16 German states in the years after the 2006 reform (left axis) and unweighted tax-rate average (right axis) by year. In 2006, all states were required to charge a tax rate of 3.5%. The authors’ own calculations The economic literature suggests that the RETT is a rather distortionary tax instrument. Because the tax drives a wedge between the buyer’s and the seller’s price, real estate transactions are deterred and the matching efficiency on real estate and labor markets is adversely affected (e.g. Lundborg and Skedinger 1999; Adam et al. 2011; Dachis et al. 2011). The fact that the states have utilized this distortionary tax instrument so heavily may indicate that they are under substantial revenue stress. Krause and Potrafke (2019) argue that the tax increases can partially be explained by government ideology as states with increasing rates differ in the party affiliation of government. As we show in this paper, an alternative explanation is that, rather than simply depressing the states’ efforts to raise their own source revenues, the combination of tax autonomy and fiscal equalization in Germany actually provides strong incentives to raise the local tax rates. The incentives of subnational governments for tax policy are the subject of a large body of theoretical literature (for surveys see Wilson 1999; Keen and Konrad 2013). This literature has emphasized in particular that tax policy of individual governments exerts fiscal externalities on others. If the set of tax instruments is restricted, the resulting tax competition equilibrium is typically characterized by inefficiently low tax rates. The literature has also noted that federal countries have institutions that work in the opposite direction (Keen and Kotsogiannis 2002). In particular, the literature has pointed to the role of fiscal redistribution (e.g. Smart 1998; Koethenbuerger 2002; Bucovetsky and Smart 2006). More specifically, the focus of the theoretical literature is on the incentives of a specific type of fiscal redistribution implemented by the Australian, the Canadian, the German as well as the Swiss federations. These countries feature systems of fiscal capacity equalization, where fiscal transfers are a function of fiscal capacity. With fiscal capacity equalization, the adverse impact of a high tax rate on the tax base, which reflects the deadweight loss from taxation, depresses the fiscal capacity of the state. Because this results in higher equalization transfers, states tend to disregard the economic cost of taxation and are subject to an incentive to increase their local tax rates. The empirical literature on the tax policy incentives of fiscal capacity equalization is relatively scarce. Dahlby and Warren (2003) analyze the effects of fiscal equalization on the incentive of Australian states and territories to raise taxes and note that states that receive more transfers when raising taxes actually tend to impose higher taxes. Evidence for Canada is provided by Smart (2007), who uses an instrumental-variable approach to find that tax rates in grant-receiving provinces are higher and more responsive to the tax rate in other provinces. More recently, Ferede (2017) considers the effects of equalization on provincial business and personal income tax rates in Canada. As in Dahlby and Warren (2003), the analysis distinguishes between an incentive that works through the effect of tax policies on the provincial tax base and an incentive that works through the effects on the average (representative) tax rate used to determine fiscal capacity. To identify the effects for grant-receiving provinces, Ferede (2017) exploits the discontinuity in the grant allocation formula. The results show that equalization leads to higher tax rates, in particular to higher personal income tax rates. Despite the strong fiscal redistribution present in the German federation, there are no papers providing evidence on incentive effects exerted on the German states’ tax policy. This is, of course, the consequence of the lack of tax autonomy that characterized German states before the reform. Baretti et al. (2002) as well as Boenke et al. (2015) explore effects of fiscal redistribution on tax collection efforts. Empirical research has also explored effects of redistributive state grants to German municipalities (e.g. Buettner 2006; Egger et al. 2010; Rauch and Hummel 2016). While this research generally supports causal effects on local tax policy, the mechanism behind the policy response differs slightly from fiscal capacity equalization. As noted by Dahlby and Warren (2003), in systems of fiscal capacity equalization, the degree of redistribution faced by a jurisdiction is directly affected by tax policy. More specifically, if jurisdictions raise their tax rate, the average (representative) tax rate increases. As a consequence, fiscal capacity equalization may exert much stronger effects on tax policy than redistributive grants to municipalities. This paper contributes to the empirical literature on tax policy effects of fiscal equalization by exploring the tax policy of German states. By considering the period following the devolution of tax setting powers, the German case provides ideal conditions to study how the tax policy incentives from equalization affect subnational tax policy and how these incentives change as a result of changes of tax policy. In order to measure the specific tax policy incentive faced by each state, we implement a detailed simulation model of the equalization system, which comprehensively captures the development of incentives in all states over the observation period. The model provides indicators of the degree of fiscal redistribution and the fiscal position of each state over time, which enable us to distinguish income effects associated with equalization from its incentive effects. Since the degree of fiscal redistribution faced by the individual state partly depends on its own tax policy and revenues, we employ instrumental variables based on simulations that keep a state’s tax rate and its share of the tax base at pre-reform levels. Controlling for the fiscal position and the associated income effects, the results support a substantial effect of fiscal equalization on a state’s tax policy. According to the estimates, with full equalization states set their tax rates from the real estate transfer tax at about 1.3 percentage points higher than without. Our analysis also shows that the incentive to raise tax rates has proliferated as each state’s decision to raise its tax rate has increased the incentive to raise taxes for all other states. The following section derives empirical predictions using a theoretical analysis of tax policy incentives under fiscal capacity equalization. Subsequently, Sect. 3 discusses the empirical methodology and Sect. 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 concludes.",6

Theoretical models on the democracy–welfare nexus suggest that democracies provide more public goods and services, and generate more income redistribution than autocratic regimes (Meltzer and Richard 1981; McGuire and Olson 1996; Acemoglu and Robinson 2006). The median-voter theorem, for example, predicts larger public spending and an expansion of the welfare state in democracies to satisfy the needs of the electorate if economic inequality is large and the poor and middle class are the majority (Meltzer and Richard 1981). Health care is a basic human need. Health infrastructure and access to health care are, however, costly. A national government therefore plays an important role in providing an adequate public healthcare system, especially for the poor and middle class. We expect that health expenditures of governments are higher in democracies than in autocracies as decision makers in democracies intend to satisfy the demand of the electorate for public health care. Figure 1 provides descriptive evidence for this hypothesis for high-income countries comparing democracies and autocracies which are at the same stage of economic development. We do, however, not expect that private health expenditures are larger in democracies than in autocracies because out-of-pocket health expenditures are primarily based on individuals’ private health investment decisions and increased government health expenditures in democracies might even substitute private out-of-pocket health expenditures.Footnote 1 Government Health Expenditure in Democracies and Autocracies in 2015 (high-income countries only). Luxembourg and Switzerland excluded as outlier We examine how political institutions influence government and private health expenditure by using pooled OLS, panel data, and event study models. Our panel consists of 151 developing and developed countries for the years 2000 to 2015. We employ health expenditure data from the World Health Organization and use four democracy measures. We find that health expenditures of governments are indeed higher in democracies than in autocracies, while private health expenditures do not turn out to be significantly affected by the strength of democratic institutions. Our findings corroborate previous empirical studies which exploit cross-country variation and show that government health expenditure is larger in democracies than in autocracies (Avelino et al. 2005; Besley and Kudamatsu 2006; Gregorio and Gregorio 2013; Profeta et al. 2013). Empirical literature on the relationship between political institutions and health expenditure is, however, scarce and not unambiguous.Footnote 2 Scholars show a positive relationship in cross section studies, whereas panel fixed effects studies with small samples lack statistical significance. Besley and Kudamatsu (2006) show a positive conditional relationship between established democracies and government health expenditure per capita for a cross section of 145 countries in the year 2000. Gregorio and Gregorio (2013) employ a cross-country approach for 159 countries in the year 2008 and confirm a positive conditional relationship between democracy and total and government health expenditure (per capita and relative to GDP). Profeta et al. (2013) examine the relationship between the strength of democratic institutions and indicators for public spending and taxation in a sample of 33 developing and low-income countries that have experienced a democratic transition during the period 1990–2005. The pooled OLS approach yields a U-shaped relationship between the strength of political institutions and public health expenditure (relative to GDP). This relationship, however, lacks statistical significance in a linear pooled OLS model and a panel model with country fixed effects. In a similar vein, Avelino et al. (2005) show a positive correlation between democracies and health spending which lacks significance in a fixed effects panel model for 19 Latin American countries between 1980 and 1999. Our empirical approach has some novel contributions compared to previous studies examining the effect of political institutions on health expenditure. Previous studies mainly use the composite index of the Polity IV dataset or even choose an arbitrary threshold score of this index to classify countries above as being democratic (see Besley and Kudamatsu 2006; Gregorio and Gregorio 2013; Profeta et al. 2013). The index is, however, highly controversial (see Cheibub et al. 2010; Plümper and Neumayer 2010). Moreover, definition and classification on the strength of democratic institutions may vary in different concepts. We therefore use four measures of democracy. Democracy measures may differ in whether a country is described to be a democracy or an autocracy and may therefore give rise to different empirical results. We moreover employ a large balanced panel of 151 developing and developed countries during the period from 2000 to 2015 and distinguish between the effect of democracy on both general government health expenditure and private (“out-of-pocket”) health expenditure. Because of the rather short period of available health expenditure data from 2000 to 2015, we observe only little variation in democracy within countries during the observation period. We therefore follow related studies and estimate cross-country and panel data models which allow us to estimate both between- and within-country effects of democracy. In addition, we employ event study approaches to examine how health expenditures evolve before and after transition to democracies and vice versa. Estimating the effect of democracy on health expenditures is likely to involve endogeneity problems, particularly because of unobserved characteristics (omitted variable bias), reverse causality, and measurement error in democracy measures. Previous empirical studies do not deal with the endogeneity problem and only provide conditional correlations between democracy and health expenditures. We overcome endogeneity concerns by using an instrumental variable (IV) approach which exploits geographical patterns and the diffusion of democratic regimes across countries. Similar to the approach of Acemoglu et al. (2019), we employ the average of the democracy scores of countries within the same region as an instrumental variable for the home country’s democracy score. Our instrumental variable approach allows estimating an effect of democracy in the cross-country OLS approach. Our cross-country estimation results show a positive effect of democracy on general government health expenditure (relative to GDP) according to pooled OLS and IV estimates. Democratic governments spend relative to GDP about 20–30% more on health than their autocratic counterparts, according to dichotomous democracy measures. The findings also suggest positive within-country effects in a panel fixed effects model. Panel fixed effect and event study results indicate that the difference in government health expenditure becomes visible within a rather short time period after regime transition. Our findings suggest a positive within-country effect of democratization of about 15–20% according to dichotomous democracy measures. Private health expenditures are positively related with democracy, but do not turn out to be significantly affected by the political regime. Our results suggest that democracies seem to care for their people by using government health expenditures to increase public health.",8

As production becomes increasingly mobile, countries will face an increasingly wide choice of which firms to target with their fiscal incentives. Our analysis begins from the assumption that governments are constrained in the number of potential inward investors they can, in fact, target with investment incentives. If incentive packages typically take forms that are specific to the FDI projects concerned (e.g. the provision of certain types of infrastructure that would complement the MNE’s plant), then it seems natural that a public bureaucracy should be constrained in terms of the number of such packages that it can devise annually.Footnote 1 Most obviously, such constraints might arise for administrative reasons. For example, decisions taken this year to hire specialised public servants to research and negotiate firm-specific incentive packages create an administrative-capacity constraint in future years (given that recruitment of highly specialised workers is often a lengthy process).Footnote 2 We assume that such a “targeting constraint” on government behaviour is binding. Consequently, it is infeasible for a national government to develop a project-specific incentive package for every potential inward investor. In this environment, we seek to answer the following two questions. First, which firm (or firms) will a government choose to target? Secondly, in what circumstances will more than one government compete to attract a particular firm’s production facilities? We examine these questions in a two-firm, two-country model, where both countries are constrained to target a single firm, with each firm being from a different industry. We assume that each country perceives one firm’s FDI as being more valuable than that of the other firm, with the two potential host countries having different valuations of the firms’ plants. We further assume that the two countries differ in terms of their “geographic advantage” such that a firm’s pre-tax profits differ across production locations, where the pattern of geographic advantage is industry-specific and is initially known with certainty to all players.Footnote 3 In this setting, we show that subsidy competition, where both governments choose to target the same firm, will never intentionally arise in equilibrium. Where the outcome of each FDI contest is perfectly anticipated, the losing country is better to opt out of a contest and target the other firm.Footnote 4 We consequently suggest that uncertainty about the pattern of geographic advantage may be important in explaining the occurrence in equilibrium of subsidy competition for FDI. Intuitively, when governments are unclear about international differences in a firm’s pre-tax profits, subsidy competition can arise in equilibrium, because both countries perceive a chance of winning the firm’s FDI and consequently have an incentive to participate in the contest. In this vein, we extend our basic model by injecting some uncertainty into the pattern of geographic advantage. Specifically, we assume that one of the firms operates in a sector where there is uncertainty on the part of governments concerning the international pattern of geographic advantage. We show that subsidy competition for this firm can arise in equilibrium, and we find a necessary condition for such subsidy competition is that the countries place a sufficiently high value on the FDI of the firm concerned. We view a government’s choice of the firm to target as being made prior to its decision as to the level and form of investment incentives to offer. Most of the existing literature on tax/subsidy competition for FDI in imperfectly competitive markets takes the identities of the targeted firm or firms as given, and thus, our analysis is of a prior stage in the behaviour of governments. A central reference is Haufler and Wooton (1999), which examines the fiscal competition between two governments for a monopolist’s plant. Fumagalli (2003) and Bjorvatn and Eckel (2006) both also consider the fiscal competition for a single firm’s FDI, but in the presence of indigenous firms who are assumed to be immobile and thus not targeted with investment incentives. In a similar vein, Black and Hoyt (1989) consider the fiscal competition for a single, large firm in the presence of a competitive fringe of untargeted firms. Ferrett and Wooton (2010a) relax the assumption that a single firm is targeted with subsidies and present a duopolistic model where each government makes a uniform offer to the two firms. These previous contributions all take the governments’ targets as given. Our purpose in the present paper is to allow the governments to choose which firms to target. Within the broader literature on tax competition for mobile capital under competitive market conditions (i.e. when there are many competing capital owners), our paper is closest in spirit to the small number of models that allow governments to discriminate between different tax bases.Footnote 5 Janeba and Peters (1999) and Marceau et al. (2010) both present models of capital-tax competition where governments face both internationally mobile and immobile (or domestic) tax bases. Both papers explore the consequences of allowing governments to discriminate between the two tax bases by setting different tax rates on mobile and immobile capital. However, these papers differ in important respects from our analysis. Most significantly, such discriminatory tax-setting differs from our concept of targeted fiscal incentives in that we assume that a government only has the administrative capacity to set a policy in relation to a single tax base (i.e. firm).Footnote 6 The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: In Sect. 2, we set out our model and preview how, given the countries’ targeting choices, equilibrium fiscal offers and plant locations are determined. In Sect. 3, we solve for the bidding equilibrium in the baseline version of our model, where the pattern of geographic advantage for both firms is known with certainty. We introduce uncertainty in Sect. 4 and consider the implications for the subsidy competition equilibrium. In Sect. 5, we ask whether, in an uncertain investment environment, it is in the interest of the firm to reveal the full nature of its FDI and profitability. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",

The political pressure to succeed in this regard may be even higher because governments are typically held accountable for any poor post-disaster management (Koetsier 2017; Cavallo and Noy 2009). However, the accompanying likely fall in production in the economy after such an event also induces reductions in government revenues (Melecky and Raddatz 2011), making even less funds available for government expenditure. Although in the case of developing countries, which generally have little government savings and catastrophe risk insurance coverage, international aid often can help finance recovery activities. This money is, however, usually disbursed slowly, there is great uncertainty on the amount to be received, and the actual amount received is generally much lower than what is required (Melecky and Raddatz 2011; Borensztein et al. 2009). Many developing countries are thus forced to finance their increases in expenditure through domestic or foreign borrowing (Borensztein et al. 2009). The subsequent higher levels of debt and higher interest rates tend to lead to lower credit scores, resulting in higher budget deficits and causing debt to further increase, creating a vicious cycle which threatens debt sustainability (Koetsier 2017; Borensztein et al. 2009). Importantly in this regard, there is emerging evidence that high levels of debt negatively affect economic growth (Greenidge et al. 2010).Footnote 1 The likelihood that government debt increases in developing countries after natural disasters is generally also supported by the empirical literature.Footnote 2 For example, in a study of the macroeconomic impact of major natural disasters across 26 countries Albala-Bertrand (1993) finds that the fiscal deficit, and subsequently government debt, increases. Looking at large-scale extreme weather events, Lis and Nickel (2009) uncover an upsurge in budget deficits in developing countries. Similarly, Melecky and Raddatz (2011) conclude that climate disasters raise the fiscal deficit in low- and middle-income countries, while Melecky and Raddatz (2011) also posit that on average budget deficits go up after climatic disasters in low- and middle-income countries. In a study of large-scale natural disasters in emerging countries, Klomp and de Haan (2015) provide evidence that investors perceive natural disasters as an adverse shock that make government debt less sustainable which in turn may eventually trigger a sovereign default and translate into higher government bond rates making borrowing more expensive. In a subsequent study, Klomp (2017) shows that natural catastrophes increase the probability of a sovereign debt default by about three percentage points, in particular for major earthquakes and storms. In this paper, we add to the literature on public debt and natural disasters by investigating the impact of tropical storms on government debt in the Eastern Caribbean. The region is arguably apt for the study at hand as its islands are characterized by high debt and low growth, together with high exposure to climate related disaster risk. In fact, the Eastern Caribbean is identified as the most disaster prone region in the world, particularly on account of the frequent number of hurricane strikes. For example, since 1970 natural disaster inflicted damage equivalent to more than 2% of the affected country’s GDP can be expected once every two and a half years (Rasmussen 2004). At the same time, the Eastern Caribbean islands have been in an unsustainable debt position for the past two decades (Fund 2013), where since the mid-1990s average national public debt has almost doubled. The overall government debt was estimated at about 79% of regional GDP in 2012 and has resulted in higher interest costs (Fund 2013). The increase in debt is accounted for by a deterioration in the fiscal balance owing mainly to a rise in government expenditure rather than a decline in revenue (Sahay 2005). Many Caribbean countries also do not benefit from international aid or intentional debt relief after a disaster occurs because of their middle income status, and only a few countries still qualify for concessional borrowing from the World Bank. According to Lugay and Ronald (2014), because of limited fiscal resources and inadequate international aid many Caribbean countries are then forced to borrow in the aftermath of a disaster. Indeed, Lugay and Ronald (2014) claim that in the Eastern Caribbean the occurrence of natural disasters leads to the accumulation of public debt to finance reconstruction as fiscal resources are often times limited and expenditure structures are too rigid to absorb the effects of external shocks. Natural catastrophe shocks are therefore likely a principal and recurrent factor for the rise in public sector debt in the region. Although some countries have made attempts to reduce their public debt through restructuring and fiscal consolidation, there has been little success thus far (Sahay 2005). There are already a number of existing studies specifically looking at the impact of natural disasters on government debt, or at least government expenditure and revenue, for the Caribbean. More precisely, in their study of the macroeconomic costs of a natural disaster for the region, Heger et al. (2008) uncover that external debt increases in the year after due to a shortage in international aid. Mohan et al. (2018) purport that government expenditure increases by 1.4% points in the year of a hurricane strike. On the other hand, the results of Auffret (2003) suggest that a natural disaster event leads to a moderate decline in government expenditure, while Acevedo-Espinoza (2014) finds that public debt increases with floods. Similarly, in a study of hurricanes, Ouattara and Strobl (2013) demonstrate that hurricane strikes cause an increase in government spending, although the impact on government debt is found to be insignificant. Focusing specifically on the Eastern Caribbean, as we do here, Rasmussen (2004) found that the median public debt increases by a cumulative 6.5% points over three years following a disaster, mainly because of an increase in spending and a small reduction in revenue. Our paper differs from the existing literature in two main ways. Firstly, compared to other studies that have relied on annual data, we have access to higher frequency, i.e., quarterly information on government debt. This allows us to investigate the short-term effects on debt. As a matter of fact, a growing literature has shown that much of the economic response to natural disasters may be missed if one examines annual data only; see, for example, Mohan and Strobl (2017) and Ishizawa et al. (2019). Secondly, we also are able to decompose debt in terms of its components, namely central government domestic and external debt and public corporation domestic and external debt, providing further insight into the dynamics of the debt response to natural disasters. To undertake our analysis, we combine quarterly data on tropical storm losses as derived from the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) catastrophe risk model with government debt and its components for the period 2000–2013 for 8 Eastern Caribbean countries. We then use panel regression analysis to econometrically quantify the impact of tropical storm losses on the debt to GDP ratio, as well as its decomposition into its components. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the data and provides summary statistics, while Sect. 3 lays out the methodology. Section 4 describes the results from the econometric estimation. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",10

Since Feldstein (1999) showed that the elasticity of taxable income (ETI) is—under certain conditions—a sufficient statistic for these efficiency costs, a large volume of work has sought to estimate this parameter. This work typically adopts a panel regression approach (e.g. Auten and Carroll 1999; Gruber and Saez 2002; Kopczuk 2005; Adam et al. 2019). However, such estimates are sensitive to the precise specification used to control for mean reversion or secular trends in income growth, and require a great deal of variation in tax rates over time.Footnote 1 More recently, new ‘bunching’ estimators have been developed which attempt to estimate the ETI by exploiting the prediction of basic neoclassical labour supply models that individuals should bunch at upward kinks and notches in the tax schedule (where, respectively, the marginal and average rates rise at a threshold). While research adopting this design has found evidence of substantial bunching by those (such as the self-employed) with significant scope for income manipulation, tax planning and evasion, evidence of bunching by employees is limited and appears to imply very low elasticities (Kleven 2016).Footnote 2 The primary contribution of this paper is to show that the vast majority of wage earners face substantial frictions to optimising their earnings, sufficiently large to prevent them from bunching at tax thresholds. We interpret ‘optimisation frictions’ broadly, to encompass not only adjustment costs arising from rigidities in contracts or pay structures and search and matching costs, but also inattention, lack of information, optimisation errors, etc. Since such frictions should at least partially abate over time,Footnote 3 it is important to distinguish whether small observed responses reflect frictions or underlying preferences; the unattenuated underlying elasticity will usually (though not always) be the most relevant parameter for long-run policy. While previous research has suggested that frictions could play an important role in attenuating the responses of employees around tax thresholds, ours is the first to confirm and quantify that effect for a broad group of workers in an advanced economy. Chetty et al. (2011) and Chetty (2012) suggest that frictions could be important but do not actually estimate them. Gelber et al. (2020) estimate the costs of adjusting earnings in the USA but only for low-paid workers approaching retirement, and likewise Zaresani (2019) only for disability insurance recipients in Canada. Kleven and Waseem (2013) look at bunching for a group of relatively high-income workers in the formal sector in Pakistan, finding that around 90% of them do not optimise their earnings in response to a notch due to frictions. Applying this same approach, we show that in an advanced economy, most working-age employees at various points across the earnings distribution face frictions in excess of 2% of earnings, and that for most low-paid workers the frictions are much bigger than that. This is true even for part-time employees, who might be thought to have greater flexibility in their hours of work. Using high-quality administrative and firm survey data for the UK, we first show that while company owner-managers and the self-employed bunch strongly at kinks in the income tax and social security contributions (SSC) schedule, employees do not. While similar patterns of bunching have previously been identified in the USA (Saez 2010; Mortenson and Whitten 2020), Denmark (Chetty et al. 2011; le Maire and Schjerning 2013), Sweden (Bastani and Selin 2014), the Netherlands (Bosch et al. 2019) and Ireland (Hargaden 2020), the peculiar tax schedule on personal income in the UK, which during the period we study contained notches as well as kinks, allows us to shed light on why.Footnote 4 By creating a strictly dominated region of earnings that no one should choose to locate in, regardless of how much they value consumption relative to leisure, notches provide a means of measuring the extent to which individuals are constrained from reducing their earnings by optimisation frictions (Kleven and Waseem 2013). We find no bunching below, and no dip above, several notches located at various points across the earnings distribution, meaning that frictions must be sufficiently large to offset the substantial gains from bunching. While we do see some bunching by employees at a notch lower down the earnings distribution, consistent with an underlying taxable earnings elasticity unattenuated by frictions of around 0.10–0.20, most of those who would locate in the dominated region in the absence of the notch still do so in the presence of a notch. This provides compelling evidence that the reason employees do not bunch at kinks is because a large majority face substantial frictions. This is true even immediately above the notch, where the potential tax saving from bunching was at times as high as 9% of earnings for the employee and a further 10.45% for the employer. A particularly novel feature of this paper is that the firm survey data we use contain information on employees’ hours of work in addition to their earnings. Exploiting this, we find that the bunching observed at a notch low down the earnings distribution is entirely driven by the behaviour of part-time workers, who make up the majority of individuals at this part of the earnings distribution. Bunching is negligible among full-time workers with similar levels of earnings (and correspondingly lower hourly wages), suggesting that they face much greater frictions than part-time workers. We make a methodological contribution to the bunching literature, showing how these responses can be decomposed into hours and hourly wage components, and that selection in who responds can be identified. Applying this approach, we find that those part-time employees who bunch are higher-hours, lower-wage types than those part-time employees who do not bunch. We also observe interesting variation in responses across taxpayers. Like Kleven and Waseem (2013) and le Maire and Schjerning (2013), we find that company owner-managers and the self-employed are particularly responsive to taxes, reflecting their greater scope for income manipulation, tax planning and evasion. Moreover, in recent years company owner-managers have become much more responsive than the self-employed. Among low-paid employees, we find that those in the retail and hospitality sectors are much more likely to respond than those in the public sector, and—perhaps surprisingly—that there is little difference in the responses of men and women conditional on working part-time. This raises the question of whether well-documented differences in observed behavioural responses between groups (e.g. men and women, employees and the self-employed) are a result of heterogeneity in preferences or in frictions. If increases in the share of women working full-time rather than part-time mean that they face larger frictions to adjusting their hours of work, that might help to explain why Blau and Kahn (2007), among others, find a decline in the elasticity of labour supply for women over time. The rest of this paper proceeds as follows:  Sect. 2 describes our institutional setting and data. Section 3 provides graphical evidence of bunching at kinks and notches in the UK income tax and SSC schedules and of how it varies between groups. Section 4 uses the bunching estimators of Saez (2010) and Kleven and Waseem (2013) to estimate elasticities from the bunching observed at kinks and notches, respectively. Section 5 outlines our method for decomposing bunching responses and identifying selection. Section 6 concludes.",1

This is typically assessed by comparing the gains and losses across different income groups: reforms are classified as progressive if they result in a greater proportional gain (or a smaller proportional loss) for households with low incomes, and regressive if the converse is true.Footnote 1 However, such analyses suffer from an important limitation: the incomes used to rank households—and the changes in transfer entitlements or tax liabilities—are usually snapshot measures derived from cross-sectional data. These could provide a poor guide to the distributional implications of reforms because snapshot incomes are not always a good proxy for well-being. Individuals’ circumstances often vary a great deal across life, and resources can be transferred across periods of life through borrowing and saving. As a result, well-being may be better measured using longer-run income measures (see, for example, Aaberge and Mogstad 2015; Bönke et al. 2015). In this paper, we contrast the snapshot and lifetime distributional impacts of two sets of reforms, one targeting the bottom of the distribution and the other targeting the top. At the bottom, we investigate reforms to the working-age benefit system that have played an important role in the policy response to widening inequality (Blundell 2006): an expansion in work-contingent transfers (like the EITC in the United States) and an increase to out-of-work benefits (like jobseekers benefit in most European economies). It has been well-established that work-contingent transfers are an extremely effective means of reducing poverty (especially among children: Sherman 2009; Joyce and Sibieta 2013) and raising the employment of lone parents (Hotz and Scholz, Hotz and Scholz; Brewer et al. 2006). Yet they are also seen as involving an equity-efficiency trade off, with Eissa and Hoynes (2011), for example, arguing that they raise a “glaring” distributional issue by transferring resources only to working families and “providing minimal support to the poorest families”, who for the most part are not in paid work. A key contribution of our work is to show that while increasing out-of-work benefits looks far more progressive than equally costly increases to work-contingent benefits at a snapshot in time, increases to work-contingent benefits are—on average—just as effective as increases to out-of-work benefits at redistributing resources to the lifetime poor. The reason for this is that the lifetime poor spend most of their working lives in low-paid work, whereas many of those who benefit from increases to out-of-work benefits are experiencing temporary periods of joblessness.Footnote 2 Such patterns of mobility suggest that the perceived equity-efficiency trade-off that policymakers face in deciding between increasing work-contingent and out-of-work transfers is less stark than typically imagined. Alongside the well-documented fact that income is far more equally distributed on a lifetime than annual basis (e.g Blomquist 1981; Björklund 1993; Creedy 1999; van de Ven 2006; Kopczuk et al. 2010; Brewer et al. 2012), these patterns also raise the question as to whether personal income taxes—which are typically assessed on monthly or annual income—are effective at targeting those who are lifetime rich. Like Bengtsson et al. (2012) we find that they are, with increases to the main rates of income tax primarily affecting those with high levels of income over their lifecycle. This is because higher—though not necessarily the highest—earners tend to exhibit greater persistence in their incomes over time. As a result, annually assessed personal income taxes appear well-targeted at the top half of the lifetime income distribution. While our analysis uses UK data and the UK tax and benefit system, our results are likely to generalise to other countries with similar labour market structures.Footnote 3 To assess the distributional impact of reforms from a lifetime perspective we require longitudinal data which not only tracks individuals over the entirety of their adult lives, but which also includes all the necessary information for computing individuals’ tax liabilities and for determining their eligibility for different transfers. Unfortunately, even in the few countries where sufficiently long-running administrative or longitudinal survey data are available, they do not include all the information needed to calculate individuals’ disposable incomes under counterfactual tax and transfer systems. Administrative datasets that do contain such information typically are not available for sufficiently long periods of time to cover individuals for the whole of their lives.Footnote 4 Instead, we use statistical models of earnings, employment, health, housing tenure and family composition over the life-cycle to simulate lifetime profiles for individuals born in the ‘baby-boom’ cohort (1945–54). The approach we take deploys a method proposed in Levell and Shaw (2016), who compare the performance of alternative lifetime simulation methods. It involves first estimating transition equations for annual outcomes, conditioning on a rich set of demographics and outcomes for previous years using an 18-wave panel survey. The resulting estimates are then used to construct a simulated dataset for individuals that contains all the relevant characteristics for calculating tax and transfer payments. In order to ensure that our resulting simulated life-courses are representative of the experiences of our cohort of interest, estimates from the relatively short panel we use are combined with information from a much longer-running cross-sectional survey. Specifically, the transitions estimated using our panel data are adjusted to match cross-sectional averages for the baby-boom cohort at each age. This approach allows us to minimise the risks of conflating age, period and cohort effects that would otherwise occur when generalising processes estimated across different cohorts using a relatively short panel. Our modelling approach incorporates insights from recent research on earnings dynamics, including the stylised facts that negative (positive) earnings shocks are more persistent for high (low) earners (Guvenen et al. 2015) and that the variance of shocks to income vary with age (Blundell 2014). Incorporating these more realistic income dynamics has been shown to have important implications for understanding the variance of lifetime earnings (Altonji et al. 2013), observed patterns of wealth inequality (Castaneda et al. 2003; De Nardi et al. 2016), and consumption decisions (Arellano et al. 2017). Our approach also allows us to realistically model complex tax liabilities and benefit entitlements over entire life-courses, enabling us to characterise the lifetime distributional effects of different tax and transfer reforms. However, it has two key limitations. The first is that our analysis does not incorporate behavioural responses to tax reforms, as is common in cross-sectional analyses of tax reforms.Footnote 5 In our lifetime analysis we impose two counterfactual tax systems on individuals (a baseline tax system as if they were under the current tax and benefit system for the whole of their lives, and a reformed tax system) but do not model how these counterfactual systems might change individuals’ earnings and employment, partnering and fertility. This allows us to model an almost complete set of characteristics that are relevant for calculating tax and transfer payments, such as detailed family composition, joint employment and earnings in couples, health status, housing tenure and house value. Typically, a number of these variables are omitted from dynamic models that incorporate behavioural responses (usually in labour supply or consumption) in order to maintain tractability.Footnote 6 A second limitation concerns coverage of those with the very highest incomes. Those in the top 1% of the income distribution are often not captured well in household surveys (Atkinson et al. 2011; Burkhauser et al. 2018) but may have different earnings dynamics even when compared to those in neighbouring percentiles. For this reason, we do not examine reforms that are only likely to affect those at the very top of the income distribution (such as reforms to the top rate of income tax), and examine the distributional effects by cross-sectional and lifetime income deciles, rather than percentiles. In contrasting the snapshot and lifetime distributional impact of these reforms, we add to a recent literature that has highlighted the importance of considering the long-run impacts of taxes and transfers. These include studies of their impact on individuals’ education (Blundell et al. 2016), employment (Hoynes et al. 2016), earnings (Dahl et al. 2014; Neumark and Shirley 2017) and health (Evans and Garthwaite 2014), as well as that of their children (Bastian and Michelmore 2018). We also contribute to a literature examining the lifetime distributional impact of policy that has tended to focus on indirect taxes (Davies et al. 1984; Poterba 1989; Caspersen and Metcalf 1994; Lyon and Schwab 1995; Metcalf 1999). This showed that while such taxes on consumption look highly regressive when assessed against annual income, the same is not true when lifetime income or—as a proxy—annual consumption is used. Similarly, we show the importance of moving beyond an exclusively snapshot perspective when analysing direct tax and transfer reforms. Our results suggest that policymakers seeking to redistribute resources to the long-run poor might favour doing so through increases to work-contingent benefits, given that these typically have less damaging effects on work incentives than out-of-work benefits. However, redistributing to those with few lifetime resources is by no means the only goal of policy. A growing literature has shown the consumption floor provided by benefits provides significant insurance value to individuals, both in retirement (O’Dea 2018) and working life (Landais and Spinnewijn 2019). In addition, credit market imperfections mean that redistribution towards periods of temporarily low current incomes can be particularly welfare-improving even if policymakers’ primary concern is the distribution of lifetime resources (Roantree and Shaw 2018). Rather, our results illustrate the importance of taking both a lifetime and snapshot perspective and of being clear about what one is trying to achieve: the alleviation of short-term hardship or the redistribution of lifetime resources. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we describe how we construct our simulated lifetime profiles, with further details provided in Appendices. Section 3 presents some descriptive statistics on lifetime incomes and how they compare to cross-sectional measures. This forms the backdrop to our results on the distributional effects of tax and transfer reforms on lifetime and cross-sectional income in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",1

Even though residence countries usually provide some method of double tax relief in an attempt to prevent double taxation unilaterally, for instance, by giving the investors a credit for tax paid abroad or by exempting foreign-source income from domestic tax, these attempts are mostly imperfect. Therefore, with the expansion of transportation and the fast-growing rates of capital transactions, double tax treaties have started to emerge. Their main role is to set out rules to avoid double taxation. Prior literature on double tax treaties (DTTs) primarily focuses on their effects on foreign direct investment (FDI) or on the formation side of DTTs (see Van’t Riet and Lejour 2018; Hong 2018; Chisik and Davies 2004). Accounting for the opportunities for treaty shopping, Petkova et al. (2020a) show that relevant tax treaties—which reduce repatriation taxes on dividends both over domestic law and the entire existing treaty network—will increase FDI by about 18%. Ligthart et al. (2011) use a gravity model to conclude that countries sign DTTs mainly to reduce international double taxation and, to a lesser extent, to provide a legal instrument for the exchange of information in tax matters. Despite these contributions, certain parts of the international tax treaty policy still remain unexplored. In this paper, I concentrate on the results for withholding tax rates (WTRs), in particular those for dividends. Generally, cross-border portfolio investments trigger withholding taxes in the source countries, i.e., the countries in which the funds are invested. Applying withholding taxes may be justified by the fact that foreign investors would otherwise benefit from the infrastructure of the source country without contributing enough to it by just paying the corporate income taxes (Taxology 2018). Therefore, WTRs are often levied to ensure the collection of taxes, especially in situations in which the income would possibly escape taxation (Willis 1963). Also, withholding taxes are a simple way of administering taxes, in particular because non-residents are less available to the tax authorities than residents. The most common withholding tax rates are those on dividends, interest and royalties. They are called withholding taxes because, even though the foreign investor is the taxpayer, they are withheld from the dividends or interest paid by the company in which the foreign investor has invested and remitted to the source country’s tax administration (Taxology 2018). In other words, they are to be paid to the tax administration by the payer rather than the recipient. When it comes to dividends, there is an important distinction as often one of two possible rates in the form of portfolio and participation dividends may apply. In particular, out of all double tax treaties in force in 2012, around 41% are symmetric (single-rated) and 59% are asymmetric (multi-rated), i.e., they prescribe different dividend withholding tax rates depending on the foreign investor’s ownership fraction. Often, companies owning less than a specified percentage of shares in a foreign company are granted only a limited reduction in the standard rate of withholding tax. Such shareholders are known as portfolio shareholders (Deloitte International Tax Source 2020). Shareholders owning more than the prescribed limit are often granted a more generous reduction or even elimination of withholding tax and are labeled significant shareholders. To my knowledge, this is the first, and so far only, paper dealing with this phenomenon, namely why some countries in their double tax conventions prefer homogenous withholding tax rates over separate rates for participation and portfolio dividends. Such differentiation is typically absent under national law. This paper investigates the reasons for the asymmetry in the withholding tax rates in DTTs. One possible explanation for the higher withholding tax rate on portfolio dividends is that tax avoidance in the case of portfolio dividends is more likely. In a theoretical model presented in Appendix 1, I demonstrate why home countries may have an interest in a high withholding tax rate in the host country, even though they do not receive the tax revenue from this tax. This may happen since the withholding tax rate abroad helps them to decrease domestic tax avoidance and increase thereby the tax revenue in the home country. In Sect. 4.1, I test this hypothesis with the existent data and present confirming evidence. Further, one hypothesis for having multi-rated withholding taxes on dividends is an existing spatial dependence on the rates of the countries’ peers that may be a driving factor for setting split rates. I confirm this hypothesis in Sect. 4.2. In the remainder of the paper, I provide more information on the dataset and some summary statistics in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, I look at the development of the withholding tax rates on dividends and their international tax competition over time. Section 4 investigates possible reasons for the differentiation between the withholding tax rates, and the hypotheses are tested empirically. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",5

28.0,5.0,International Tax and Public Finance,19 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-020-09653-y,Pigou in the 21st Century: a tribute on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the publication of The Economics of Welfare,October 2021,Ottmar Edenhofer,Max Franks,Matthias Kalkuhl,Male,Male,Male,Male,"2020 marks the centennial of the publication of Arthur Cecil Pigou’s magnum opus The Economics of Welfare. In this masterpiece of economic theory, Pigou set out “to study certain important groups of causes affecting economic welfare in actual modern societies” (Pigou 1920, Part I, Chapter I, §5, p. 11). It is noteworthy that Pigou used the term “actual modern societies” when stating the objective of his mission. Over the course of his early career leading up to the publication of his magnum opus, Pigou became a disciple of Alfred Marshall. As such, he supported Marshall’s efforts to establish economics as a discipline in its own right (Maloney 1985), setting it apart from philosophy and history. In particular, he distanced himself from economic historians, who, since the Methodenstreit in the 1880s, saw themselves as being increasingly separated from the new orthodoxy in economics, which now studied neo-classical equilibria and marginal utility (Hobsbawm 1987, chap. 11). Pigou was heavily engaged in contemporary politics and public debates of his times. In several columns, penned by the young Pigou, he advocated free-trade principles and argued against Chamberlain’s protectionist trade policies. Reacting to a senior cabinet member’s campaign, he mounted a defense of pension schemes that retain incentives to work. His writings on the efficiency of land rent taxation engendered a heated controversy among liberal members of parliament. Pigou continued working on social questions, such as minimum housing standards, unemployment benefits and medical insurance (Takami 2014). In this tribute, however, we wish to focus on Pigou’s contributions that laid the groundwork for the modern field of environmental economics (Sandmo 2015). In The Economics of Welfare, Pigou defined positive and negative externalities, described their impacts on production and devised ways of correcting or internalizing these externalities: In like manner, for every industry in which the value of the marginal social net product is less than that of the marginal private net product, there will be certain rates of tax, the imposition of which by the State would increase the size of the national dividend and increase economic welfare; and one rate of tax, which would have the optimum effect in this respect. (Pigou 1932, 4th ed., Part II, Chapter XI, §11) 
Local air pollution was already a significant problem at that time, as dust led to higher electricity demand (lightening) as well as higher costs for cleaning buildings and clothes—a problem that Pigou highlights in his book by citing a governmental reportFootnote 1: A valuable investigation was made in 1918 by the Manchester Air Pollution Advisory Board into the comparative cost of household washing in Manchester—a smoky town—as compared with Harrogate—a clean town. The investigator obtained 100 properly comparable statements for Manchester and Harrogate respectively as to the cost of the weekly washing in working-class houses. These showed an extra cost in Manchester of 7½d. a week per household for fuel and washing material. The total loss for the whole city, taking the extra cost of fuel and washing materials alone, disregarding the extra labor involved, and assuming no greater loss for middle-class than for working-class households (a considerable under-statement), works out at over £290,000 a year for a population of three quarters of a million. (Pigou 1932, 4th ed. Part II, Chapter IX, §10, Footnote 68) 
Today, we see Pigou’s legacy in the fundamental concepts of externalities and their correction through Pigouvian taxes or subsidies, which are taught in elementary economics courses. Modern research on optimal environmental taxation has often equated a tax set at marginal environmental damages with the Pigouvian tax (Cremer et al. 1998). In this line, various works have analyzed optimal policies in so-called second-best settings, that is, when there exist market failures or distortions besides the environmental externality. Examples are different forms of heterogeneity combined with imperfect information, leakage effects due to jurisdictional spillovers, market concentration, innovation market failures, etc. In these settings, the fundamental research question is often whether the optimal environmental tax deviates from the ‘Pigouvian level’—and in what direction (Aronsson and Sjögren 2018; Cremer et al. 2003; Jacobs and De Mooij 2015; Jacobs and van der Ploeg 2019; Parry 1995; Requate 2005a, 2005b; Van der Ploeg 2016). These findings confirm, rather than disprove, the Pigouvian idea, as the underlying principle corresponds to Pigou’s approach of setting a tax that maximizes welfare. In that sense, Pigou’s claim that “there will be certain rates of tax [that] would increase […] economic welfare; and one rate of tax, which would have the optimum effect in this respect” also holds in second-best settings. Hence, the widespread convention of equating the ‘Pigouvian tax’ with marginal environmental damages, rather than the optimal second-best tax rate, fails to do justice to Pigou’s work. In what follows, we, therefore, consider a broader definition of Pigouvian pricing policies, namely those that maximize welfare (in either first-best or second-best settings). Notwithstanding the strong economic argument for Pigouvian pricing, environmental policy in many countries has been dominated by regulation, standards, and, in some cases, emission trading schemes (Cullenward and Victor 2020; Keohane et al. 1997). Despite strong support for stricter environmental policy, we see little public support for using environmental taxes (European Commission 2019)—neither for estimated second-best tax rates, nor for estimated first-best Pigouvian taxes. There are only few examples of Pigouvian taxes that attempt to reflect marginal social benefits—the US oil extraction tax to pay a fund for cleaning up oil pollution accidents is a rare example, where the tax rate is determined by a social cost consideration (Masur and Posner 2015). Even if taxes or levies are set to reduce environmental pollution, they are often based on political considerations rather than on rigorous assessments of the marginal social cost. Hence, many taxes that are part of the environmental policy mix, if they can be called Pigouvian at all, do not reflect the true marginal social costs—but the balance of political power of different interest groups. Similarly, energy and fuel taxes are often below their Pigouvian optimum (Coady et al. 2018) when taking into account the externalities associated with global warming or local air pollution. Globally, most taxes on fossil energy (irrespective of whether they are explicitly targeted at carbon emissions or not) are still far below the social cost of carbon (see Fig. 1). In some cases, the effective carbon price is even negative due to subsidies on fossil fuels (not shown in Fig. 1 due to data reasons). The International Energy Agency estimates that annual global expenditures for subsidies on fossil fuels averaged approximately US$ 340 billion in the period from 2016 to 2019.Footnote 2 Similar to fuel taxes, taxes on tobacco and alcohol are often set based on revenue motives (Masur and Posner 2015). While some countries, like the US and the UK, require regulatory impact assessments of social costs and benefits of policy proposals, the latter have rarely resulted in taxes that conform to Pigouvian pricing principles. Instead, these assessments, more often than not, merely rationalize other environmental policies, such as fuel efficiency standards. Source: own figure based on OECD’s effective carbon rate data in Kalkuhl et al. (2018) and temperature-related social costs of carbon (Kalkuhl and Wenz, 2020). Note that subsidies on fossil fuels are not included in this figure Effective carbon prices resulting from existing excise taxes, duties and carbon prices on fossil energy. Pigou’s work is still of utmost relevance today, especially since the chasm between the theory of Pigouvian pricing and its political implementation remains significant, as the above examples illustrate. Large market failures remain unaddressed—among them the adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions, the loss of biodiversity and the under-provision of public goods related to innovation, knowledge and health services (e.g., vaccination). In this article, we will revisit the relevance of the Pigouvian pricing principle for contemporary economic research and policy-making by defending two basic claims: While economists are right to believe Pigouvian taxes to be theoretically desirable, they are also prone to overlooking the significant theoretical problems that Pigouvian taxes still face. Paying scant attention to these conceptual problems is, however, likely to impede their implementation in practice. The widely held belief that Pigouvian taxes are ‘politically infeasible’ rests on a rather flimsy factual basis—as is borne out by an increasing number of countries adopting carbon prices. These two claims imply that the widespread consensus, namely that Pigouvian taxes are theoretically desirable, yet politically infeasible, throws a spanner in the works of scientific progress. Specifically, holding on to this consensus impedes necessary research into conceptual problems, whilst inducing economists to abandon welfare-maximizing policies too readily, instead accepting politically less demanding options. Both tendencies cause additional deadweight losses to societies. We will focus on the case of climate change due to the ongoing political ambitions to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in many countries and the lessons learned from successful and failed attempts to price carbon. We will use the term Pigouvian taxation to refer to direct pricing policies, such as taxes and levies—as opposed to indirect pricing via emissions certificate trading. A price collar is subsumed under direct pricing. The remainder of this article is structured as follows: We outline key conceptual challenges for implementing Pigouvian taxes (Sect. 2), we then discuss how current climate policy has increasingly moved toward Pigouvian principles and carbon pricing (Sect. 3), and finally suggest a research agenda (Sect. 4) for addressing remaining barriers to make Pigouvian pricing a common political practice. We conclude (Sect. 5) with some reflections on the legacy of Pigou’s work for contemporary economic policy.",12

Scientists know what needs to be done to avoid a climate catastrophe: emissions must be brought down now and rapidly. If nothing is done to curb the use of oil, gas, and coal and to replace these sources of energy by solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy, the heating of the planet will continue relentlessly. Despite hopeful signs in Europe (mainly the European market for emissions permits) and the USA (the election of President Biden with an ambitious agenda for climate policy) and China’s commitment to go carbon net zero by 2060, India and various other countries rely on coal for cheap energy and will try to delay the green transition. Furthermore, oil-, gas- and coal-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, Algeria, and others have no interest in the green transition either. Most economists recommend policy makers to implement a uniform carbon price throughout the globe and to have transfers from rich to poor countries to make sure all countries are on board. Furthermore, policy makers should commit to a path of rising carbon prices for the next three or four decades so businesses can plan their long-term investments to be in line with a carbon-free economy. The most common approach used by economists has been to set the carbon price to its Pigouvian price, which in climate economics is called the social cost of carbon (SCC). The SCC is the expected present discounted value of all damages done to the economy resulting from emitting one ton of carbon today. We discuss this concept at length in Sect. 2 and derive a tractable expression for the SCC. We show how the SCC needs to be adjusted for macroeconomic uncertainty, the risk of macroeconomic disasters, but also depends on climatic and damage ratio uncertainties. We also discuss the effects of a declining term structure of the discount rate on the carbon price. We then calibrate and find using the latest econometric evidence on damages from global warming (Burke et al., 2015), a simple model relating temperature to cumulative emissions (e.g. Allen et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009), and the macroeconomic disaster model for a market-based estimate of the discount rate (Barro, 2006, 2009) that the optimal carbon price is about $100 per ton of emitted CO2. This price should subsequently grow at a rate equal to the trend rate of growth of the economy. If the risks of climatic tipping points are taken account of, the carbon price can become much higher again (Cai and Lontzek, 2016) and cascading tipping points can push up the carbon price much further (Lemoine & Traeger, 2016; Cai and Lontzek, 2016). Given the debates about whether to use a prescriptive ethics- or descriptive market-based calibration of the discount rate and the much lower damages used in most integrated assessment models (e.g. around $15 per ton of CO2 in the DICE model of Nordhaus (2017)), there is an embarrassingly wide range of recommended carbon prices which is not very helpful for policy makers. It is thus not surprising that policy makers and the negotiators of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have adopted a more pragmatic approach. At the Paris Agreement signed in 2016, it was agreed to keep global mean temperature growth well below 2° and to aim for a cap of 1.5 °C. We show in Sect. 3 that this temperature cap implies an upper limit on global cumulative emissions and shows how this upper limit is affected by temperature sensitivity uncertainty and risk tolerance. We show that this upper limit requires a time path of the carbon price that grows at a rate equal to the interest rate corrected for risks to the rate of economic growth and to marginal abatement costs. This so-called Hotelling rule is not welfare based but cap based and corresponds to a more pragmatic approach. Risks in conducting climate policy not only derive from uncertainty about the climatic system, global warming damages, or economic growth prospects, but also from uncertainty about government policy and the risk of policy tipping or from uncertainty about the sudden drops in the cost of fossil fuel or renewable energy resulting from technological breakthroughs (e.g. the invention of horizontal drilling for shale gas). We show in Sect. 4 that this and more generally a disorderly transition to the green economy can lead to the risk of stranded assets provided investments once made are difficult to shift from carbon intensive to green sectors, and vice versa. This provides a case for financial regulators to regularly conduct climate stress tests. Finally, we offer in Sect. 5 a brief review of the obstacles to successful carbon pricing and in Sect. 6 a brief conclusion and some suggestions for further research.",5

This paper analyses the determination of the size of aggregate emission quota and its division between the polluters in a common agency framework. A set of principals can individually lobby a common agent to influence the aggregate size of the quota and subsequently for an increase in the slice of the quota each principal receives. The principals can be countries or firms, and the agent can be a regulator whose task it is to choose the policy structure. As a concrete example, this set-up can be used to describe lobbying related to effort sharing in the European Union’s climate policy. The member states act as the principals who influence the European Commission who decides the emission reduction target at the EU level and the sharing of individual emission reduction efforts. The interaction between the agent and the principals is modeled with a two-stage game, where each stage consists of a menu auction game. In the first stage, every principal offers the agent a contribution schedule that is contingent on the size of the aggregate quota decided by the agent. Following this, the agent, who cares about the contribution and the social welfare the quota induces, chooses the aggregate quota. In the second stage of the game, given the chosen aggregate quota, every principal offers an additional contribution schedule to the agent, which is now contingent on the individual quota the principal receives. The agent then decides the division of the quota given that it cares about the profit/benefit of each principal and about the received contributions. This paper finds that the political process distorts the size of the aggregate emission quota from the value satisfying the Samuelson’s rule for the provision of public goods. Without lobbying, the aggregate quota, which is a public good for the principals, is set such that the aggregate marginal willingness to pay for the quota matches the marginal damage from it. Every principal uses its political influence to increase the size of the aggregate quota to be divided, and, after the quota has been set, to compete against the other principals in the division of the quota. Despite the apparent incentive to free-ride on the other principals’ contributions for larger aggregate quota, every principal finds it in its interest to contribute. This is because the individual quota to be allocated in the second stage, and hence, the payoff is increasing in the aggregate quota. The end result is that both the aggregate quota and the individual allocations are excessive compared to the social optimum. These results are extended to the case where the quotas are tradable by adding a third stage to the above game, where the principals can trade the quotas given for free in stage two. An important exception to the overallocation result occurs in the case where the principals’ aggregate emission damage equals the agent’s damage. In this case, the aggregate and individual quotas match the social optimum. The reason for this is that each principal offers a marginal contribution to the agent that equals the difference between its marginal profit and marginal damage, which incentivizes the agent to choose the aggregate quota that maximizes social welfare. This study contributes to the literature on the choice of environmental policy in a political process described by a common agency.Footnote 1 This literature has covered international environmental agreements (Habla and Winkler 2013; Marchiori et al. 2017), international trade (Aidt 1998; Fredriksson 1997; Damania et al. 2003), overlapping geneneration models with an environmental tax (Karp and Rezai 2014), investment for clean technology (Grey 2018), corruption and environmental policy (Fredriksson and Svensson 2003) and the choice of emission tax and emission quota (Finkelshtain and Kislev 1997). The current paper focuses on endogenizing the choice of the aggregate quota and its division between lobbyists in the political process with multiple principals or lobbyists. This is in contrast with Finkelshtain and Kislev (1997), whose model contains only one lobby group consisting of multiple polluters. This group lobbies for an emission vector that contains the quotas of the polluters. In their model, the lobbyist does not directly influence the aggregate quota. Here, there are multiple lobbyists who lobby both for the aggregate quota and its division. This results in a formula for the aggregate quota (the above-mentioned modification of the Samuelson’s rule) and, as there are multiple lobbyists, in a competition for the individual quotas using the political influence. Relatedly, Lai (2007, 2008) also applies the common agency model, and focuses only on lobbying over the aggregate amount of (tradable) quotas and the decision to allocate the aggregate quota either by auctioning or grandfathering.Footnote 2 The second stage of the model, the quota-division stage, has similarities with a model in Grossman and Helpman (2001), on pages 233-235, where the agent decides the division of a budget between two identical principals of which only one is organized as a lobby group. In that model, the organized principal obtains a larger quota compared to the equal division which is the outcome without lobbying. In the current model, there are multiple non-identical principals. In addition, the principals can use their political influence before the division stage when the agent sets the aggregate quota to be shared. Persson and Tabellini (1994) analyse the supply of local public goods that are financed at the federal level, and find that the supply of local public goods is larger under lobbying than under the decentralized solution. Here, the public good is global for the principals, and the principals can use their influence to change the supply decision of the aggregate quota and the allocation of the quota. The study is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and the main results with a quota. This section also develops a special case with two principals. Section 3 extends the results to tradable quotas. Section 4 concludes.",1
28.0,5.0,International Tax and Public Finance,30 June 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-021-09675-0,Designing international tax reform: lessons from TCJA,October 2021,Mindy Herzfeld,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In 2017, the USA passed a major international tax reform as part of the enactment of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA).Footnote 1 The law has been subject to critiques from all sides, with commentators criticizing the law for reducing equity, benefiting wealthier business owners at the expense of individuals and adding to complexity and tax planning opportunities, while also increasing the deficit (Avi-Yonah, 2018; Kamin, 2018; Kleinbard, 2017; Kysar, 2018, 2020; MacGuineas, 2019). And yet, the international provisions of the law were largely modeled on and bear close resemblance to widely circulated international tax reform ideas as well as proposals introduced by the OECD as part of its base erosion and profit shifting project (OECD, 2013). Most notably, the US international tax reforms introduced by the TCJA closely parallel ideas included in a proposal for international tax reform laid out in a formative 2013 paper by Harry Grubert and Roseanne Altshuler (Grubert & Altshuler, 2013). The disconnect between their ideas, which built on more than a decade of thinking and research and formed the basis for the next iteration of proposals, and the results of the law passed by the U.S. Congress in 2017, provides a cautionary tale for public finance economists. This paper analyzes the tax law changes adopted by the TCJA that impact cross-border trade and investment by measuring them against goals for international tax reform that were widely agreed upon (on a bipartisan basis) prior to enactment. It finds that while the goals for the reform may have been based in well-accepted fiscal policy, the law changes seem to have fallen far short of the anticipated results. Most importantly, the new system did not eliminate the obstacles from either primarily tax-motivated planning or the tax preferences for overseas investment relative to domestic investment, and probably did not level the playing field between US and foreign multinationals. The gap between principle and practice can be attributed at least in part to a combination of rushed drafting as well as insufficient appreciation of how the complex rules would interact with each other as well as existing law. The partisan manner in which the law was enacted played a role in maintaining tax distortions, as it increased rather than decreased the uncertainty associated with the decision to invest domestically rather than overseas.
 The paper proceeds as follows. Part I briefly summarizes the existing literature on the goals of international tax reform as compared with well-accepted metrics in the domestic area. It then outlines the goals of tax reform articulated by Republican administration and congressional leadership in the lead-up to the passage of the TCJA. Part II outlines various international tax reform proposals made in the decade leading up to the 2017 tax reform, and the metrics developed by Grubert and Altshuler for evaluating the merits of different proposals. Part III analyzes the international provisions of the TCJA in terms of what they were intended to do and their results insofar as they can be evaluated to date. Part IV concludes.",1
28.0,5.0,International Tax and Public Finance,04 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-021-09689-8,Tariff elimination versus tax avoidance: free trade agreements and transfer pricing,October 2021,Hiroshi Mukunoki,Hirofumi Okoshi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs) has become controversial in the last two decades of rapid globalization. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that countries lose 4–10\(\%\) of corporate income tax revenue annually because of profit shifting.Footnote 1 One way to shift profits across countries is to manipulate the price of intra-firm trade (transfer price), which is known as abusive transfer pricing. Because MNEs determine the prices of transactions among related companies, they manipulate these prices to decrease profits in high-tax countries and conversely increase profits in low-tax countries. Some empirical research has provided evidence of transfer pricing being used to save tax payments.Footnote 2 Because the taxes paid by firms are one of the main sources of government revenues, tax avoidance by MNEs has become a serious issue, as trade liberalization and the creation of global value chains increase intra-firm trade and provide MNEs with greater opportunities to redistribute their tax base to low-tax countries. Our primary focus is on how such losses of tax revenues are linked to trade liberalization driven by trade agreements. Trade agreements among countries facilitate firms’ exports and imports. They also influence firm behaviors in other respects including transfer pricing and generate more complicated welfare effects. In particular, the specific rules needed to implement trade agreements complicate the effects of trade liberalization. We focus on the rules of origin (ROO) of a free trade agreement (FTA), which require exporters in member countries making tariff-free exports to other member countries to prove that the exported products originated within the FTA.Footnote 3 To meet the ROO, firms may change their strategies such as their input procurement. Conconi et al. (2018) concludes that the ROO of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) reduce imports of inputs from non-member countries, suggesting that such rules cause inefficiency in input procurement. Considering tax avoidance, this also implies that the ROO can hinder MNEs from shifting profits within the firm because they may need to consider whether their intra-firm transactions satisfy the requirements of the ROO. One way to prove the origin is to satisfy the value-added (VA) criterion, which is closely related to transfer price manipulation.Footnote 4 The VA criterion requires firms to add a sufficient value inside FTA member countries. Specifically, let p denote the export price of the product and r denote the value of the input materials, which are used per unit of final good production and do not originate in the FTA. The VA criterion typically requires that the VA ratio \((p-r)/p\) is above the specified level. This method of calculating the VA content is called the “transaction value method.” The value of the input materials depends on the transfer price if MNEs procure inputs from related companies outside FTA countries, and, hence, a VA criterion can constrain MNEs from engaging in tax avoidance through abusive transfer pricing. However, a VA criterion allows the MNE an option to meet the ROO without changing its input sources. This violates the principal purpose of the ROO to increase local procurement of inputs. Although this possibility has been overlooked in the economic literature on transfer pricing and FTA, it has been noted by some policy researchers. LaNasa (1996) stated that “[v]alue-added rules of origin may be circumvented by the use of transfer pricing, ... to increase the amount of local value added to ensure that the good qualifies as originating in the country of assembly, related parties could reduce the price of the imported materials used in the finished product.” Eden (1998) examined the ROO of NAFTA and suggested that “...underinvoicing parts coming outside North America and overinvoicing locally made parts would increase the North American content.” Falvey and Reed (1998) indicated that the VA criterion “...allows room for manipulation of prices as well as quantities, and may generate additional incentives for transfer pricing by multinationals.” Reuter (2012) similarly pointed out that “most rules of origin are on a percent-of-value basis ...By overinvoicing the value added, the MNE can more easily meet a rule-of-origin test and qualify for duty-free entry for its products into another country in the free trade area.”Footnote 5 The World Customs Organization notes that a disadvantage of the VA criterion of ROO is the possible exposure to transfer pricing.Footnote 6 A recent report by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited reports that exporters should consider an adjustment of transfer prices when making use of FTAs.Footnote 7 As Estevadeordal and Suominen (2003) reported that 68 of the 87 FTAs they analyzed employ a VA criterion at least in a particular product category, the aforementioned statements suggest that the effect of FTAs on tax avoidance and welfare can be understood clearly if we investigate the role of the ROO in restricting the abusive use of transfer pricing. Given the experience of tax avoidance countries face, analyzing the anti-tax avoidance aspect of the ROO holds crucial policy implications. In reality, different groups of policymakers, namely, customs and tax authorities, are responsible for designing trade policies and regulating transfer pricing. The interaction between these two authorities has been rare. According to WCO (2018), “...the WCO is working with the OECD and World Bank Group to encourage Customs and tax administrations to establish bilateral lines of communication in order to exchange knowledge, skills and data, where possible, which will help ensure that each authority has the broadest picture of an MNE’s business, its compliance record and can make informed decisions on the collect revenue liability.” Thus, the increasing number of FTAs and volume of intra-firm trade necessitates us to explore the relationship between transfer prices and ROO. Against this backdrop, this study builds an international monopoly model to investigate an MNE’s response to an FTA formation with two new elements: transfer pricing and ROO.Footnote 8 We consider a situation wherein an MNE produces final goods within an FTA member country and exports the goods to other FTA member countries. The MNE procures inputs from either an FTA member country or a low-tax country outside the FTA. In the absence of ROO, the MNE always prefers to produce inputs outside the FTA by itself and avoids tax by setting a high transfer price. However, the presence of ROO restricts the manipulation of the transfer price because a high transfer price reduces the VA ratio of the final product inside the FTA. Thus, the MNE chooses one of three options: (i) fully manipulating its transfer price to avoid tax payments at the expense of the preferential tariff of the FTA, (ii) procuring inputs inside an FTA to comply with the ROO and eliminate tariffs, or (iii) adjusting its transfer price to comply with the ROO to eliminate tariffs and pursue partial tax avoidance.Footnote 9 This model exhibits the MNE’s choice of the “tariff elimination versus tax avoidance” via its location choice of producing inputs and/or transfer price manipulation.Footnote 10 When the MNE chooses the second option, it no longer avoids higher taxes. When it chooses the third option, its transfer price deviates from the optimal abusive transfer price, which retains part of the MNE’s tax base in the high-tax country. As the ROO restrict the abusive use of transfer pricing through either a change in input procurement or an adjustment of the transfer price, tax revenues in a high-tax country increase. Thus, the VA criterion works as an anti-tax avoidance policy. Interestingly, the direction of shifted profits can be from a low-tax country to a high-tax country when the MNE adjusts the transfer price to meet the VA criterion. Empirical analyses on transfer pricing should consider the possibility that the VA criterion of ROO affects transfer pricing. The ROO can also increase the welfare gains of FTA countries because members can collect tax revenues from the MNE. Although consumers’ gains from the FTA are smaller than those without ROO, tax revenues from the MNE can cover the smaller consumers’ gains and the loss of tariff revenues. Our results present a new role of the ROO in preventing abusive transfer pricing and increasing the welfare gains of FTA formation for member countries. Our model contributes to the literature on transfer pricing policies since MNEs have been accused of tax avoidance activities. How to regulate transfer prices has been a central issue in policy debates. Several studies examine the effects of policies on transfer price manipulation. Elitzur and Mintz (1996) investigated the determinants of transfer prices when tax authorities use the cost-plus method to infer the appropriate transfer price. Nielsen et al. (2003) compared the use of transfer prices under two international tax systems, namely, separating account and formula apportionment.Footnote 11 Bond and Gresik (2020) examined a high-tax country’s unilateral adoption of border adjusted taxes and cash flow taxes when heterogeneous firms choose either arm’s length transactions or to establish their own subsidiaries in their input sourcing. Choi et al. (2020) examined the effect of the arm’s length principle on a monopolistic MNE’s transfer pricing and tax competition.Footnote 12 As their focus was on direct regulation on transfer pricing, the role of ROO in preventing abusive transfer pricing is overlooked in the literature. Our second contribution is to the literature on FTAs with ROO. Krishna and Krueger (1995) showed that the ROO may work as hidden protection against input suppliers outside the FTA. Ju and Krishna (2005) showed that ROO can either increase or decrease the price of FTA-made inputs, depending on the number of firms complying with the rules. However, their focus was on intermediate goods markets, and they did not consider how ROO affect consumers. Demidova and Krishna (2008) extended the work of Ju and Krishna (2005) by including the heterogeneity of productivity of final good producers. They showed that productivity sorting ensures the negative relationship between the stringency of the rules and the demand for FTA-made inputs (i.e., wages). Ishikawa et al. (2007) focused on final good markets, showing that the ROO have a role to segment markets within the FTA, and that both inside and outside firms producing final goods may benefit from the ROO at the cost of consumers. Mukunoki (2017) showed that an FTA with ROO may harm consumers if it changes outside firms’ location decisions. Mukunoki and Okoshi (2021) investigated a firm’s export price manipulation to comply with the ROO, particularly how an MNE’s transfer price manipulation affects the inputs imported from outside the FTA. None of these studies, however, consider transfer price manipulation to meet ROO. Felbermayr et al. (2019) suggested that there is little rationale for ROO because tariff circumvention is not profitable for 86% of bilateral trade owing to the small differences in external tariffs and non-negligible transport costs. This study thus provides a new rationale for the ROO from the viewpoint of tax avoidance by an MNE. This study also examines the connection between transfer pricing and trade policy. In this regard, Horst (1971) showed that the optimal transfer price is influenced by not only tax differentials but also tariffs. Schjelderup and Sorgard (1997) showed that if the importing country imposes an ad valorem tariff on inputs, an MNE can save tariff payments by reducing its export price. Subsequently, the optimal transfer price is influenced by both corporate tax avoidance and tariff avoidance.Footnote 13 Kant (1988) regarded the transfer price as a tool to repatriate profits when a foreign subsidiary is not fully owned by the parent firm. The study found that even when the tax rate in the home country is higher than that in the host country, an MNE has an incentive to remit all the profits earned in the low-tax host country. These studies, however, did not explicitly consider trade liberalization by forming an FTA, let alone the effects of ROO on transfer prices. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and derives the equilibrium. Section 3 investigates the effects of FTA formation on profit shifting, consumers, and the MNE’s profit. Section 4 discusses total welfare of member countries and the effect of input tariff. The last section concludes. An Online Appendix shows the results are robust by relaxing some key assumptions.",2
28.0,5.0,International Tax and Public Finance,26 July 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-021-09681-2,The value-added tax and growth: design matters,October 2021,Santiago Acosta-Ormaechea,Atsuyoshi Morozumi,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Previous empirical literature has shown that tax composition matters for long-run growth. For instance, it has been found that a revenue-neutral increase in consumption taxes, offset by a fall in income taxes, promotes growth in the long run (e.g., Arnold et al. (2011) and Acosta-Ormaechea et al. (2019)). However, this literature has been largely silent on the possible relevance of the way in which the composition of taxes is changed. In particular, little is known about whether the growth effect of a compositional change of taxes depends on whether a tax is raised through a rate increase or through a base broadening. This paper aims to shed light on this issue highlighting how the value-added tax (VAT), a type of consumption tax which has become increasingly popular over the last few decades, is raised in the context of a revenue-neutral reallocation with income taxes.Footnote 1 To begin with, why might it matter for growth how the VAT is raised? This is essentially because certain design features of the VAT such as exemptions and differentiated rates might induce inefficient allocation of resources. This is the case even though theory often suggests that consumption taxes, in general, might not distort optimizing agents’ investment decisions directly unlike income taxes.Footnote 2 Exemptions mean that no tax is charged on sales, but a VAT charged on inputs is not refunded/credited, whereas a pure VAT taxes all sales (including both wholesale and retail) and allows registered businesses to reclaim the tax charged on their inputs.Footnote 3 Thus, based on the view that exemptions distort firms’ input choices and create an element of production tax (Crawford et al. 2010; Keen 2013, and Cnossen 2020), they are likely to compromise the efficient allocation of resources, possibly having an adverse growth effect. Further, differentiated rates, where reduced rates are applied to selected goods and services, may also have a negative growth effect. This is associated with the view that they increase administration costs (Ebrill et al. 2001) and distort consumer choice through their effects on relative prices (Mirrlees et al. 2011). Taken together, a VAT revenue increase through broadening the base with fewer exemptions and/or achieving a more uniform rate structure with fewer reduced rates may be more growth promoting than a revenue increase through a rise in the standard rate, the rate applied to the largest portion of taxed consumption, because the latter increase is likely to forgo the efficiency gains. To consider the relevance of the form in which the VAT is raised formally, this paper decomposes the VAT following Keen (2013). Specifically, we decompose the VAT revenue (V) as a share of total tax revenue (T) as: where r is the VAT standard rate; e (\(\equiv V/(r C)\)) is C-efficiency, the ratio of VAT revenue to the product of the VAT standard rate and final consumption (excluding VAT revenue collection), C; and c (\(\equiv C/T\)) is the ratio of final consumption to total tax revenue. Here, C-efficiency measures the departure of the VAT from a perfectly enforced tax levied at a single rate on all consumption. It takes a value lower than one, when exemptions and reduced rates apply to some goods and services, and/or taxpayers’ compliance is limited (Ebrill et al. 2001 and IMF 2011).Footnote 4 In this regard, Keen (2013) suggests that, in advanced economies, the deviation of C-efficiency from the value of one arises primarily because of the VAT that is not levied due to exemptions and reduced rates (the policy gap), rather than the issues of taxpayers’ imperfect compliance (the compliance gap). The dominance of the policy gap over the compliance gap is echoed for Netherlands by Bettendorf and Cnossen (2015), who provide a detailed account of C-efficiency for the country. Further, Ueda (2017) shows that, in the context of EU member countries and Japan, cumulative changes in C-efficiency over the 2000-14 period are largely driven by cumulative changes in policy gaps. The present paper thus investigates the growth effect of C-efficiency relative to that of the standard rate in OECD countries, to shed light on the relevance of VAT policy design to growth. Our key findings are the following. Using a dataset for 21 OECD countries over the 1970-2018 period, we show that a rise in the VAT, offset by a fall in income taxes, promotes long-run growth only if the VAT revenue is raised through C-efficiency, but not if it is raised through the VAT standard rate. This result holds regardless of whether a rise in VAT revenue is offset by a fall in personal or corporate income taxes. The implication is thus that the design of how the VAT is raised matters for growth in the context of a tax reallocation between the VAT and income taxes.Footnote 5 Further, we show that, for a given VAT revenue, a rise in C-efficiency, offset by a fall in the standard rate, also fosters growth. This result demonstrates the general relevance of VAT design to growth, beyond the context of the specific reallocation between the VAT and income taxes. The possible interpretation is that, in the context of OECD countries, an increase in C-efficiency, reflecting (at least partly) the VAT base broadening through fewer exemptions and a more uniform rate structure with fewer reduced rates, promotes growth more than an increase in the standard rate. We acknowledge from the outset, however, that although this paper provides extensive evidence for the relevance of VAT design to growth, there are at least two important limitations. The first one is the absence of an analysis of income distribution. That is, even if VAT exemptions and rate differentiation might have an adverse impact on growth through inefficient resource allocation, they could have a positive impact on income distribution. The use of reduced rates, in particular, might benefit the poor relatively more than the rich, implying that it is important to consider the impact on income distribution as well to have a more balanced view on the overall VAT design impact. The second limitation is that variations in C-efficiency are likely to reflect much more than variations in the breadth of the VAT base and the degree of rate differentiation caused directly by VAT policy reforms. This is illustrated clearly by the fact that C-efficiency exhibits pro-cyclicality (as elaborated below). Thus, although we show that our results appear to be robust to the endogeneity concerns associated with business cycle fluctuations, the growth effects of C-efficiency cannot be interpreted narrowly as the effects of policies that impact on the breadth of VAT base and/or the degree of differentiated rates. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 explains the empirical methodology, and Sect. 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents and interprets results, and Sect. 6 offers concluding remarks.",5

Winer,J. Stephen Ferris,Pinaki Chakraborty,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Studies of government size in a democracy have traditionally focused on uncovering the factors that explain what parts of economic activity are brought within the public sector and what parts are left strictly in private hands. However, modern governments are now so large that the question of what determines the private good/public good composition, or privateness of public expenditure, is of comparable importance for understanding the role of government in society. In this paper, we construct a model with core and swing voters of the private–public composition of public budgets, where electoral competitiveness and income along with other factors play key roles. We then apply this model to explain the evolution of the privateness of the budgets of major Indian states over a substantial period of time. New measures of public expenditure on private targetable goods—required for measuring the privateness of state budgets—and of electoral competitiveness at the state level accompany the analysis. The Indian states are an excellent subject for our investigation for several reasons. First, these states vary widely in the privateness of their public budgets as well as in their underlying socioeconomic characteristics, while sharing a common political heritage based on majoritarian, parliamentary government. Second, the privateness of their budgets matters: It is likely that the balance between redistribution via the provision of targetable private goods and expenditure on public goods is an important factor in Indian development. Finally, the data required for our investigation—including the detailed line item budgetary data required to construct a suitable measure of the private/public composition of state budgets, and the electoral data required to measure political competitiveness at the state level—are publicly available for a substantial period of time for each of the 14 major states (containing about 85% of the population) that are included in our panel data set. In a core versus swing voter framework developed with application to India in mind, we are led to focus on the roles of political competitiveness and the real incomes of voters. A rise in competitiveness leads to a reduced role for targetable private goods relative to public goods in the public budget for several reasons.Footnote 1 First, swing voters are more concerned than are core supporters with the general economic consequences of public policy (see, for example, Besley et al. 2010), the core being more concerned with non-monetary goals and specific private benefits. These general interests include economic development and the public goods that are associated with it. Thus, as the weight of swing voters in the electorate increases, political parties find it electorally profitable to reduce the role of private goods in the budget. Second, the price of a unit of support gained from the supply of public goods falls (relative to that for private targetable goods) when the number of swing voters increases because of the non-rivalness in consumption of the public goods that such voters favor: A related mechanism is the center piece of the model of publicness of government spending of Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003).Footnote 2 The fact that swing voters are relatively more expensive to target effectively with private goods, as suggested by Dixit and Londregan (1996), reinforces the move away from private goods as their number increases. Finally, competition tends to reduce the rents that can be delivered to partisan supporters in the form of private goods. Hence, as electoral competition intensifies, taste, non-rivalness, targeting cost and rent-related considerations all lead competing parties toward more publicness in their budget plans. In order to uncover the role of electoral competition, it is necessary to control for other factors that are also likely to be important including, notably, real income, which varies across the states by as much as 1–5 in our sample that extends from 1987–1988 until 2011–2012. A commonly observed stylized fact is that for poorer voters, private benefits publicly supplied form a significant part of their consumption bundle. As incomes rise, however, the public expenditure required to generate an additional vote—what we shall think of as the price of a unit of support—through provision of private goods targeted toward loyal supporters who, as Wintrobe (1986) explains, expect a private return to their loyalty, increases relative to the price of support from provision of public or non-rival goods. Core supporters must also be encouraged to turn out to vote, as Stokes et al. (2013) emphasize, a task which is accomplished more cheaply via the provision of private targetable goods rather than using public goods, but one that also becomes more costly as average incomes rise. For these reasons, as incomes rise we expect that electoral equilibria will be characterized by relatively less government spending on private targetable goods. The importance of the level of development to the private/public composition of the public budget has been recognized before, for example by Magaloni et al. (2007) who use a different model with a similar idea about the price of support embedded in it.Footnote 3 However, the role of electoral competition has not been well studied in the present context. The intensity of electoral competitiveness as we shall think about it depends on the uncertainty, or ‘swingyness’ of electoral outcomes at the electoral district or constituency level.Footnote 4 Competitiveness in this sense rises with the relative number of swing voters because they are, by definition, less committed than are core supporters to vote for any particular party, as in Besley et al. (2010), Golden and Min (2013), Stokes et al. (2013), Datta (2019) and others. The contribution of this paper lies in the combining of electoral competitiveness with the level of development in a model that explains how and why the privateness of public expenditure varies across space and time.Footnote 5 Testing the main implications of our conceptual framework requires a measure of public expenditure on targetable private goods and an index of electoral competitiveness.Footnote 6 We construct both variables for 14 major Indian states over the 1987–1988 to 2011–2012 period.Footnote 7 Each is of independent interest. Targetable private goods, when compared to general public expenditure, are (relatively) rival, targeted at identifiable groups of voters and, at least to some extent, retargetable over an electoral period. How this component of the public budget can be constructed from line item Indian state revenue expenditure accounts that first became available in the Finance Accounts in 1987–1988 is described in detail in the Online Appendix. We also provide a new measure of competitiveness in elections at the state constituency level that captures the ex ante uncertainty, or swingyness, of multi-party electoral contests. An index of the kind we construct was suggested some time ago by Przeworski and Sprague (1971) and implemented for Canada by Ferris et al. (2016) and for India by Dash et al. (2019).Footnote 8 Such an index, which is superior to the often employed first versus second place vote share in ways described in detail later, has not to our knowledge been used to study public policy in the Indian context. While our empirical investigation of the role of political competition in determining the composition of Indian state budgets is to our knowledge unique, we are not the first to study the privateness of public expenditure in a developing country context. For India in particular, there is interesting work by Chhibber and Nooruddin (2004), Thachil and Teitelbaum (2015) and Nooruddin and Simmons (2015), among others. Chhibber and Nooruddin and Nooruddin and Simmons relate the composition of the budget to the share of the vote required for a party to become the government or to join a governing coalition. As this share declines, it is argued that incumbent coalitions are incentivized to focus more narrowly on specific segments of the electorate, leading to greater privateness in the budget, as is also suggested by the model of Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003). Although it is not part of the formal model presented in the next section, which emphasizes the key roles of competition and of income, we allow for this route through which the composition of the budget may be affected in our empirical work. To empirically study the determinants of budget composition over the longer run, the domain of our theory, we develop estimating equations formulated in error correction form and estimate using the pooled mean group approach of Pesaran and Smith (1995) and Pesaran et al. (1999).Footnote 9 This procedure allows for variation in coefficients of explanatory variables across Indian states in the shorter run, while calculating a common cointegrating vector. We augment this method by allowing for the possibility that convergence is conditional on the level of development, which varies widely across the states. Other estimation methods are also employed. Our empirical results confirm the hypothesized effects of electoral competition and income on the privateness of budgets in higher-income Indian states. In the richer states, more intense electoral competition and higher real incomes are shown to lead on to greater emphasis on public goods including capital infrastructure. In the lower-income states, however, we find that these effects are more muted, and even reversed in some cases, a situation that is consistent with a greater emphasis by contesting parties in these states on maintaining the loyalty and turnout of core supporters through redistribution. Counterfactuals are provided to illustrate the difference in the quantitative effects of competitiveness and the level of development on privateness across the states. The paper proceeds as follows. A formal model is presented in section two with corresponding estimating equations outlined in section three. Our new measures of public expenditure on targetable private goods and of multi-party electoral competitiveness are presented in section four. Estimation follows in section five along with counterfactuals that illustrate the quantitative importance of competitiveness and real incomes for budget composition. Section six considers the robustness of our main results to the use of public sector wages and salaries as an alternative to our new measure of spending on targetable private goods and to the instrumenting of income as well as other methods of estimation. Section seven concludes. An Online Appendix provides derivations and proofs. It includes a primer on public finance accounting in India for readers not familiar with Indian public finance accounting practices. This serves as a prelude to a detailed explanation of how our measure of state public expenditure on targetable private goods is constructed. The Online Appendix also provides summary statistics as well as details of the ancillary estimation discussed in section six.Footnote 10",4

Cross-country evidence,February 2022,Damián Vergara,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The availability of high-quality data on top income shares has revived an old debate: is income inequality an inevitable consequence of growth and globalization, or it is affected by domestic economic policies and institutions?Footnote 1 Following the theory of marginal productivity, the first view claims that trends in pre-tax inequality are mainly explained by market forces, for example skill-biased technological change and “superstar effects” (e.g., Kaplan and Rauh 2013). The second view contests that argument suggesting that what governments do is more important. In words of Alvaredo et al. (2013), “the fact that high-income countries with similar technological and productivity developments have gone through different patterns of income inequality at the very top supports the view that institutional and policy differences play a key role in these transformations.” To the extent that countries care about inequality, understanding the role of policies and institutions is of prime relevance.Footnote 2 However, empirical evidence in this regard is scarce. The measurement and identification challenges raised by this question make comprehensive analyses difficult.Footnote 3 I aim to contribute to this debate by providing cross-country evidence on the relationship between pre-tax income inequality, economic policy, and institutions. I investigate whether economic policy systematically correlates with pre-tax inequality and explore the role of institutions in shaping these correlations, i.e., I study whether, conditional on its implementation, the quality of the institutions affect who are the winners and the losers of the different economic policies. I focus on the role of political institutions. Consequently, throughout the paper, the term institutional quality refers to institutional features that reflect their degree of inclusiveness (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012) as, for example, state development, corruption, or political exclusion. To this end, I assemble a yearly panel of 43 countries for the period 1980–2016 with data on top income shares and different measures of economic policy, namely trade openness, government expenditure, financial development, and income taxation. The choice of the policy variables mainly follows Roine et al. (2009) which is, to my knowledge, the only paper that uses data on top income shares with similar purposes. As a starting point, I present OLS regressions of pre-tax income shares on economic policies that control for country and time fixed effects, as well as for other time-varying controls at the country-level. I find strong correlations between income inequality and economic policy after accounting for economic development. Openness to trade, government expenditure, and top marginal income tax rates are associated with smaller income shares of the richer 1% and larger income shares of the bottom 90%. Conversely, financial development is positively related to income shares at the top at the expense of the rest of the population. These patterns are robust to different empirical models, sets of controls, and variable definitions. I then explore the role of institutions in shaping the correlations between pre-tax income inequality and economic policy. Concretely, I inspect whether the inequality–policy correlations vary with institutional quality. While there is a vast literature that discusses how institutions interact with policy and inequality (e.g., Alesina et al. 2001; Acemoglu et al. 2015), to my knowledge, this question has not been quantitatively explored beyond the reduced form evidence of Acemoglu et al. (2015) on the distributional effects of democracy. I follow two strategies to test for heterogeneity in the relationship between policies and inequality. The first builds on the literature that argues that current institutions have their roots in pre-industrial features of the countries (Acemoglu et al. 2001; Acemoglu and Robinson 2012; Nunn 2009, 2020). I use Giuliano and Nunn (2018) country-level data on ancestral characteristics of modern populations and consider two variables that have been used as predictors of current institutions. The first is the level of jurisdictional hierarchies beyond the local community, which has been used as a predictor of state development (e.g., Gennaioli and Rainer 2007; Michalopoulos and Papaioannou 2013). Intuitively, ancestral groups that generated relationships with higher levels of political authorities developed more sophisticated forms of government in the long-run. The second is the proportion of the ancestors that preferred cousin marriage to non-cousin marriage, which has been used as a predictor of corruption and lack of political inclusiveness (e.g., Akbari et al. 2019; Schulz 2020). Intuitively, ancestral groups that preferred cousin marriage generated more closed social groups (and elites) that favored corruption in the long-run. The second strategy uses the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) database that is a time-varying dataset that provides a series of indexes that aim to capture the multidimensional concept of democracy (Coppedge et al. 2020). This dataset contains several indicators that characterize different aspects of countries’ institutions. I focus on three sets of indicators. The first measures different characteristics of the political regime—the prevalence of clientelism, the importance of hereditary succession in political power, and two measures of corruption. The second measures the degree of influence that different power groups—the aristocracy, the agrarian elites, the party elites, and the business elites—have on the political regime. The third measures the degree of political exclusion faced by different groups based on their observed characteristics—socioeconomic status, gender, political affiliation, and urban/rural status.Footnote 4 Using a variety of institutional variables and different empirical strategies, the analysis consistently shows that institutions affect the inequality–policy correlations. In particular, I find that institutions are determining for the distributional consequences of openness to trade and government expenditure. In the presence of high-quality institutions, openness to trade and government expenditure are related to less inequality. However, low-quality institutions map trade into more inequality and make government expenditure ineffective for helping the bottom 90%. Interestingly, the positive correlation between financial development and income inequality and the negative correlation between progressive taxation and income inequality are relatively stable along the institutional spectrum. While this setting inherently does not lend itself to inference from cleanly identified natural experiments and certainly does not capture all channels through which institutions, policy, and inequality are interrelated, I argue that the weight of evidence from a battery of panel regressions supports the claim that political institutions meaningfully affect the robust relationship between domestic economic policies and income inequality. Consistent with Helpman (2017), this suggests that globalization cannot be the only factor responsible for the recent increase in income inequality. Figure 1 provides a concise summary of the regressions. Following Kling et al. (2007) and Chetty et al. (2011), each figure plots the (standardized) income share of the bottom 90% against a (standardized) measure of economic policy separately by institutional quality (measured as a compounded standardized index based on the V-Dem variables). The partial correlations control for country and time fixed effects, GDP per capita, population, and the rest of the policy measures. The plots show that openness to trade and government expenditure benefit the bottom 90% only when institutions are high quality. They also show that financial development and income taxation strongly correlate with inequality regardless of the institutional variables. Partial correlations between bottom 90% income share and economic policy. Notes: Each figure plots the income share of the bottom 90% against a measure of economic policy, separately by institutional quality. Variables are standardized within the estimation sample. Figures control for country and time fixed effects, GDP per capita, population, and the rest of the policy measures. The institutional index is created as follows. First, I sum the following standardized V-Dem indices: regime corruption, influence of business elites, and degree of political exclusion by gender. I then standardize the sum. Finally, I label country-time points as Good institutions (Bad institutions) when the composite index is negative (positive). For details on the policy variables, see Sect. 2. For details on the institutional variables, see Sects. 2 and 4 I end the paper by proposing a narrative for rationalizing the results. I argue that one channel through which institutions may affect the inequality–policy correlations is by allowing (or limiting) rent-seeking activities by the rich. This narrative is consistent with several papers that give a central role to rent-seeking in shaping the upper tail of the income distribution (e.g., Bivens and Mishel 2013; Lazonick and Mazzucato 2013; Piketty et al. 2014; Stiglitz 2016; Haselmann et al. 2018). Certainly, the empirical results presented in the paper lack the necessary causal interpretation to be informative about mechanisms. However, my objective is to stress the importance of incorporating institutions in optimal policy analysis. If we accept that institutions matter for the mapping between economic policy and inequality, then optimal policy problems should allow social planners to affect institutions together with standard policy choices. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 presents the baseline results between economic policy and inequality. Section 4 explores the role of institutions in shaping the policy–inequality correlations. Finally, Sect. 5 briefly discusses the rent-seeking narrative that is consistent with the results and concludes.",1

In the 1960s when the VAT was adopted, the role and design of an efficient revenue-raising broad-based consumption tax were not fully understood.Footnote 1 To mimic the perceived burden distribution of the previous turnover taxes, multiple exemptions and exclusionsFootnote 2 were built into the VAT regime for public policy reasons (healthcare, education, social, cultural, postal and broadcasting services), because it was believed that the tax credit method could not be applied (leasing and letting of immovable property, financial services and insurance, betting and gambling), because it was politically considered not feasible to include agriculture in the base, or simply because it did not seem to make sense to have VAT charged to and paid for on an in-and-out basis by the same taxable entity (governments). The EU’s Common VAT Directive (2006), consolidating the earlier Sixth VAT Directive (1977) and some subsequent amendments, institutionalized these features. Further, various reduced rates were introduced purportedly to mitigate the VAT’s impact on lower-income groups, and a compensation scheme was adopted to keep agriculture outside the VAT’s ambit. In the meantime, it has become widely recognized that in countries without major constraints on administrative capacity, the VAT should only be used to raise revenue, predictably and efficiently, leaving it to the income tax and social benefit schemes to address distributional concerns and to excise duties and subsidies to deal with negative and positive externalities. In these countries, VAT should tax all goods and services at a uniform rate. This distorts the efficient allocation of resources brought about by the market as little as possible, as relative prices do not change. With reference to the production-efficiency theorem of Diamond and Mirrlees (1971), Crawford et al. (2010) argue that optimality considerations regarding base and rate differentiation do not fundamentally alter this guiding principle for VAT design.Footnote 3 It follows that exemptions should be limited to those strictly necessary on administrative grounds and that reduced rates should not be contemplated. In this respect, the EU-VAT leaves much to be desired. The issues are important because it has been shown that base-broadening and rate unification offset by a reduction in the standard rate fosters economic growth (Acosta-Ormaechea and Morozumi 2019) – more than would an increase in the standard rate in combination with a reduction in the income taxes. As a large body of theoretical and empirical literature (e.g., De la Feria & Krever, 2013; Ebrill et al, 2001) testifies, exemptions and multiple rates generate welfare costs that should be avoided. Apart from tax-on-tax effects (called cascading, occurring at intermediate stages of production and distribution), exemptions distort input choices, give rise to a self-supply bias, distort competition, cause delineation issues, complicate input VAT allocation over exempt and taxable supplies, favor imports, discriminate against exports, and induce ‘exemption creep.’ Similarly, differentiated rates distort consumer and producer choices. In an early but still relevant study, Copenhagen Economics (2013) calculated the efficiency gain that can be reaped if various exempt supplies are taxed (with credit for the VAT on intermediate goods and fixed assets). It analyzed the effects of six core services, that is, cultural activities, education, health care, garbage collection, postal services, and radio and television broadcasts, which, jointly, contributed 14.2% of GDP in the EU-27 (excluding Croatia) in 2010. The efficiency gain of fully taxing these services, which is what modern VATs do, would be 0.34% of GDP. If governments would be included, the gain might well approach 0.5% of GDP. By eliminating the self-supply bias, Copenhagen Economics notes, full taxation should have a significant positive economic effect, particularly on medium-sized and small businesses that account for 60% of business services in the affected sectors. Not surprisingly, Copenhagen Economics (2013, p. 12) concludes: ‘we recommend to look towards a full taxation solution.’ The conclusion is inescapable: the EU-VATs are not the efficient revenue-raising instrument that they can be. Current VATs violate basic neutrality norms and thus the single market’s equal playing field principle. The degree to which this is the case is generally measured by the VAT’s C-efficiency,Footnote 4 that is, actual revenue raised over potential revenue found by applying the standard rate to total consumption expenditures of households, non-profit entities and governments. This means that the C-efficiency should be 1 (one) for a uniform-rate VAT on all goods and services, assuming full compliance. The difference between 1 and the actual C-efficiency comprises the VAT that is not levied on account of the policy gap (exemptions, reduced rates, thresholds) and the compliance gap (the difference between what should be collected given existing legislation and what is actually collected). This may be referred to as VAT’s C-inefficiency.Footnote 5 The policy gap dominates the compliance gap in the EU. The problem with this approach is that C-inefficiency emerges as a residual: 1 – C-efficiency. This says nothing about its component parts: which goods and services are taxed at reduced rates or exempt but subject to distorting input taxes. Much appears to be said therefore for calculating C-inefficiency independently of C-efficiency. This can be done by applying the standard rate to consumer expenditures that are exempt and subtracting any VAT that is paid on inputs (fixed assets and intermediate inputs), and aggregating the individual items. Accordingly, C-inefficiency focuses on specific areas in which VAT is underperforming, and the results can thus be used to establish priorities of reform.Footnote 6 By contrast, C-efficiency merely connotes that there may be room for improving VAT performance, but is silent on details. Although the large VAT policy gap is a concern in the EU, original sin lingers on. The European Commission concentrates its research on narrowing the compliance gap.Footnote 7 It calls this the VAT gap (European Commission, 2020), ignoring the much larger policy gap, because that means that it has to come to terms with the shortcomings of the common directive. In the same vein, it continues to hammer on the anvil of the introduction of a ‘definitive regime:’ applying the VAT to intra-EU exports with credit for this tax by importers in other Member States along with the transfer of exporters’ VAT payments by exporting Member States to importing Member States, thus maintaining the destination principle.Footnote 8 To put VAT policy back on the agenda, this contribution renews the call for basic VAT reform. It illustrates the distortions and complexities of exemptions and lower-than-standard rates by analyzing the C-inefficiency of the Dutch VAT, which, in view of the mandatory exemptions of the common directive, should be representative of the VATs in most other Member States. This is followed by a proposal to unify differentiated rate structures. Subsequently, ways are explored to remedy the VAT base gaps by reforming the common directive, assigning VAT base design to the Member States, or by adopting a modern, common EU-wide VAT that can be piggybacked by the Member States.",5

Political support for place-based policies has grown in a number of countries, despite evidence of their mixed success (Barca et al., 2012; Markusen, 1996; Neumark & Simpson, 2015; Overman, 2018). Such government efforts (involving, for example, the funding of infrastructure, support for particular industries, or other local economic development schemes) aim to improve the economic performance of particular areas. The UK Government has introduced local industrial strategies comprising a range of measures to “build on local strengths and deliver on economic opportunities” (HM Government, 2018). Yet the practicalities of rigorously assessing numerous places’ key areas of competitiveness and future opportunities for economic development in such strategies can be challenging. In this paper, we apply methods from the economic complexity literature to analyse industrial strengths and future growth opportunities across UK local authorities. These methods have been shown to provide new insights into development patterns and the growth potential of countries and regions (Hidalgo et al., 2007; Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009; Neffket et al., 2011; Hausmann et al., 2014; Gao & Zhao, 2018; Cicerone et al., 2019). They have also been used to operationalise applications of smart specialisation strategies (Balland & Rigby, 2017; Chávez et al., 2017) across EU regions. With the exception of Bishop and Mateos-Garcia (2019), however, there has been surprisingly little work applying economic complexity methods to the UK context. This paper also contributes to a new conceptual understanding of the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and Product Complexity Index (PCI) in regional settings. In previous studies, the ECI was commonly described as a measure of the diversity and sophistication of a country’s (or region’s) production, so the analytical framework was frequently used to test or support theories relating to economic variety and diversification. However, more recent analysis has shown that the ECI is mathematically independent (or orthogonal) to diversity (Kemp-Benedict, 2014). Instead, it reflects a ranking of countries (or regions) based on the similarity of their economic activities (Mealy et al., 2019). Here, we describe how these measures should therefore be interpreted and applied in the context of regional data (such as UK employment data) and discuss the key theoretical implications for regional economic development. We also contrast the ECI and PCI to measures like the Krugman Index (Krugman, 1991, 1993), which is commonly used to analyse regional specialisation patterns. We show that UK local authorities with higher ECI tend to have higher per capita earnings, growth rates and greater ability to develop further industries with greater earnings potential, consistent with previous findings. In contrast to previous studies, however, we stress that this does not imply that these high ECI local authorities necessarily have a greater diversity of industries that few other local authorities are able to develop competencies in. There is, in fact, a negative correlation between diversity and ECI across UK local authorities. Instead, places with higher ECI tend to specialise in particular types of industries that are distinct from industries that low-ECI places tend to specialise in. Drawing on the PCI ranking of industries (which helps identify the types of industries that distinguish local authorities at either end of the ECI spectrum), we show that high-ECI places tend to be specialised in finance, insurance, information and communication, professional, scientific and technical activities, while local authorities with low ECI are more likely to be specialised in industries relating to agriculture, manufacturing and mining activities. These differences reflect an important challenge for the design of local industrial strategy. In the UK, these strategies are being developed in geographically proximate zones (at the level of Mayoral Combined Authorities or Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs)). However, our analysis reveals that extreme heterogeneity across local authorities’ industrial profiles can be present even within these small geographical zones. As achieving policy coherence across places with such different industrial contexts is likely to be difficult, local industrial strategies will likely need to consider how to target policies appropriately. Indeed, to best account for ‘local’ competencies and needs, it may be more appropriate to target policies towards groups of local authorities that share high similarity in their industrial strengths, rather than geographic proximity. Our findings also highlight important implications for the prospect of rebalancing the UK’s economic geography. The extent and persistence of the country’s regional inequality have been widely documented (Gardiner et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2015). Although the trend towards polarisation between big cities and other places has been observed in other countries too (for example Autor, 2019), the UK’s highly centralised governance arrangements have been identified as one of the contributory factors. This has motivated recent devolution trends, particularly to the new urban Combined Authorities (HM Government, 2011; McCann, 2016). Much of the discourse around local industrial strategy has emphasised the importance of “building on local strengths.” However, for many UK local authorities with low ECI, the growth opportunities offered by their existing industrial strengths are extremely limited. Our results illustrate the well-known ‘Matthew Effect’ of the rich getting richer (Merton, 1968), suggesting incremental policy change is likely to crystallise additional high wage opportunities in high-ECI, high-wage local areas but not in low-ECI, low-wage ones. Unless local industrial strategies can be appropriately designed to address the systemic differences in economic development opportunities across UK local authorities, existing income and productivity differences are likely to remain or even widen.",4

Thoresen,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"There are two major strands of research in the normative tax analysis of public economics. One approach is to characterise the optimal taxes starting with a clean sheet. This is known as the tax design problem. The other is the tax reform approach, highlighted in particular by Feldstein (1976), who argued that optimal tax reform must take as its starting point the existing tax system. According to Feldstein (op.cit., p.90), “in practice, tax reform is piecemeal and dynamic in contrast to the once-and-for-all character of tax design”. In the wake of Feldstein’s emphasis on tax reform analysis, a series of papers addressed in a theoretical framework the effects of small commodity tax reforms, often called tax perturbations (Diewert, 1978; Dixit, 1975; Guesnerie, 1977). Piecemeal income tax reforms have received attention only more recently, see Golosov et al. (2014), Saez (2001), Hendren (2016) and Bierbrauer et al. (2021). Most of the reforms that have been studied take the form of small perturbations of the initial tax function. We present a framework for assessing income tax perturbations focusing on the distributional and social efficiency aspects of the reform. Distinguishing between tax level and tax structure has a long-standing tradition in public economics. We can think of the level as determined by the height at which the tax schedule is located, while the tax structure is determined by the shape of the tax function, i.e. the marginal taxes at various income levels. The shape of the tax function determines both the distribution of the tax burden across heterogeneous taxpayers and the extent to which taxes are distortionary and harm the social efficiency of the economy. The tax level determines the total burden imposed on the taxpayers as taxes suppress private consumption to make resources available for the public sector. Determining the tax structure and choosing the tax level are separate decisions. Politicians can have different views about either, and informing the discussion about either is important. This motivates efforts to disentangle the structural and the level part of a tax reform where it changes the tax policy in both respects.Footnote 1 Our contribution is to present a decomposition allowing us to study structural changes, leaving aside the choice of tax level. To separate out the structural aspect of a tax reform, we assume that any change of the aggregate burden on the taxpayers is offset by adjusting a hypothetical uniform cash transfer (or lump-sum tax) to keep the tax level unchanged. Then, we have a pure structural reform that influences the distribution of the tax burden and the economic behaviour of the taxpayers. We explore the redistributive and social efficiency effects of this reform. The advantage is to achieve a clear distinction between a pure (zero-sum) redistribution and a quantifiable enlargement (or contraction) of the amount available for distribution due to a more (or less) efficient allocation. We leave aside how the actual mechanical change in aggregate tax burden may (dis)benefit the taxpayers, which is a different type of policy question. To make a welfare assessment of the distributional effects, we apply a particular class of welfare weights that reflect the inequality aversion of the distributional preferences. Departing from a tax-distorted initial allocation, efficiency effects are determined by the pre-existing tax wedges and the behavioural responses to the tax reform. The impact on social efficiency can then be measured by the behavioural-induced change of tax revenue. We shall elaborate on these aspects below. Suppose the outcome is a more unequal distribution and a more efficient allocation or vice versa. Then, we need to place a value on the induced revenue change in order to compare it with the distributional effect and achieve an overall assessment of the structural reform. For this purpose, we assume that a behavioural-induced revenue gain is recycled as a lump-sum transfer (or a loss is covered by a lump-sum tax). Our approach implies that we consider (positive or negative) transfers to the taxpayers in two steps, first to offset the mechanical effect of the tax reform to keep the tax level unchanged (Step 1) and then to redistribute the additional tax revenue generated by enhanced efficiency (Step 2). Opting for this two-step procedure, rather than a single step, is motivated by our desire to specify the various factors that determine how the reform affects welfare. Finally, we can describe how the overall welfare effect depends on the inequality aversion, which enables us to infer the range of distributional preferences that are implicit in political support for the reform. By exploring implicit preferences, assumed to be revealed by the tax reform, we add to the studies of implicit preferences previously based on the assumption that the actual policy is optimal, known as the inverse optimum problem (a term coined by Ahmad & Stern, 1984). We apply our procedure to piecemeal income tax reforms implemented in Norway during the period 2016–2018, enabling us to achieve results with substantial empirical content. Figure 1 shows how the 2018-schedule compares to the schedule of 2015. The figure reveals that although there are some reductions at lower and medium income levels too, the largest reductions are seen at the top. As we shall demonstrate, this implies that the architects of this reform do not exhibit a large degree of inequality aversion. The 2015 and 2018 tax schedules The studies of income tax perturbations in the literature take somewhat different approaches to highlight various reforms and various reform effects, but the papers share a number of key features. In particular, they typically distinguish mechanical effects (abstracting from behavioural responses) and behavioural effects of tax reforms, adopting the terminology of Saez (2001). The present study connects to other contributions of the literature. Golosov et al. (2014) establish a general and rich model to characterise the welfare effects of local tax reforms in a dynamic setting. The paper identifies the various mechanical and behavioural effects of tax perturbations. It addresses tax reforms that are departures from the existing tax system, such as introducing nonlinear capital taxes and introducing joint taxation of various forms of income in a life-cycle setting with age-dependent behaviour. In contrast, our paper presents a more detailed analysis of a more narrow set of tax perturbations. Bierbrauer et al. (2021) are mainly concerned with the political feasibility of income tax reforms in the sense that a reform is in the self-interest of a majority of taxpayers. They consider a perturbation of the tax function, which may enhance or diminish the amount of tax revenue. The main assumption is that any additional tax revenue, whether mechanical or behavioural-induced, is recycled as a cash transfer (or a lump-sum tax makes up for a loss). To assess the reform, most of the analysis assumes that the induced revenue is transferred as a uniform lump sum to the taxpayers. Considering net effects of the tax and transfer changes, there may be losers and winners. The political feasibility will depend on the respective numbers of winners and losers, and the welfare effect will in general depend on the welfare weights assigned to the various agents. With its emphasis on political feasibility, Bierbrauer et al. (2021) have a different focus than our paper. From a welfare-analytical perspective, the approaches show both similarities and differences. Bierbrauer et al. consider a revenue-neutral reform in the sense that any mechanical or behavioural-induced revenue change is offset by a lump-sum transfer. In this sense, their analysis could be perceived as addressing a structural reform where the benchmark is a fixed revenue rather than a fixed burden on the taxpayers, as in our structural reform analysis. We first ask how changing the profile of the tax schedule, while preserving the average burden on the taxpayers, impacts the distribution and affects social efficiency, where it is straightforward to measure the latter effect in terms of behavioural-induced change in tax revenue. In either study, a lump-sum transfer/tax is used as a level parameter. Hendren (2016) expresses the reform-induced benefit to an agent as the change in net resources (lump-sum transfer minus gross tax liability) transferred from the government to the agent plus the impact of the agent’s change of behaviour on government revenue. For a revenue-neutral reform, the net resource transfers sum to zero and can be used as one way to express distributional effects of the total reform. In our analysis, we use the mechanical effects of the (structural) reform to express the distributional effects. Since the individual net resource transfers are determined both by mechanical and behavioural effects, the distributional effects in Hendren’s approach include efficiency effects that we would like to separate out. Our paper focuses on taxation of labour income within a standard labour supply model. Hence, our framework is within the strong modelling tradition of optimal nonlinear and (piecewise) linear income taxation, see, for example, Mirrlees (1971), Sheshinski (1972), Dahlby (2008) and Apps and Rees (2009). The current paper proceeds as follows. We describe our theoretical approach in Sect. 2. Section 3 presents the Norwegian tax perturbations used in the empirical analysis in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",

Such policies include, for example, taxation and its degree of progressivity, and the composition of public expenditures. The pandemic has also given renewed prominence to the question whether directly experiencing major economic upheavals changes people’s attitudes toward public policies. To address these questions, this paper reports the results of a survey of about 2500 US individuals in October 2020 that elicits respondents’ views on potential changes in taxation and on who should bear the burden, as well as which types of expenditures could be reduced or increased. The survey explores the impact of personal experiences stemming from the pandemic—serious illness or job losses—in shaping respondents’ attitudes toward these fiscal policy choices. The survey was undertaken at a time when a significant share of US residents had already been gravely affected by COVID-19, and the issue was among the most salient during the contentious run-up to the November 2020 election. This is the first survey-based analysis to gauge people’s attitudes toward tax and other fiscal policy choices in the context of the pandemic, relating such attitudes to respondents’ personal experience with the pandemic, moral perspectives, and demographic characteristics.Footnote 1 It builds on previous studies that have advanced the understanding of people’s attitudes toward taxation (Stantcheva, 2020)Footnote 2 and public expenditure choices (Enke, 2020; Enke et al., 2020). Focusing on a US context—where previous studies have established certain regularities in the data—allows us to circulate a more concise survey and makes it easier to relate the results in the present paper to findings obtained in a pre-pandemic context by other researchers. The objective of the survey was to elicit people’s views in favor of or against the following: Increasing taxation as a way of financing additional expenditures caused by the pandemic and the need to foster the economic recovery, by introducing a temporary tax explicitly linked to this goal; Permanently increasing the degree of progressivity of taxation;Footnote 3 Reducing or further increasing various expenditure categories, such as health, education, military, etc. This is of interest in its own right;Footnote 4 in addition, based on results by Enke (2020) and Enke et al. (2020), it provides insight into each respondent’s moral perspectives (see below). Moreover, for some questions, the survey used different labels (“contribution” versus “tax”) and made appeal to different justifications (“solidarity” versus “financing the recovery”) to gain insights into the effectiveness of different ways of presenting policy packages and to understand what resonates best with different segments of the respondents. The key results are as follows: Attitudes regarding taxation, and progressive taxation in particular, are more favorable among people who hold “universalist” rather than “communitarian” moral perspectives, elicited in the survey through questions about spending priorities. Respondents who have experienced serious illness or job loss caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or who personally know someone who has, favor progressive taxation to a greater extent than others in the sample. More people with communitarian perspectives are likely to shift their views in favor of progressive taxation as a result of severe personal exposure to illness or job loss due to the pandemic. Support for a temporary levy seems relatively insensitive to variation in labels for such levy, with a marginally statistically significant preference for the term “COVID-19 recovery contribution.” The extent to which personal experiences can affect people’s attitudes toward public policies in general and preferences regarding redistribution in particular has been debated by economists, political scientists, and psychologists and is an area of active research in these fields. Some empirical studies argue that such attitudes in adulthood are largely shaped by a person’s immutable characteristics, such as genetic traits or country of origin, whereas other studies find a significant role for exposure to important events, especially if these are experienced during a person’s formative years.Footnote 5 By reporting evidence that individuals directly harmed by the pandemic are more likely to favor redistributive policies, our study provides further evidence that personal experiences have significant effects on attitudes toward public policies, although it is too early to determine how long-lasting such effects will be. In this regard, our results are consistent with the findings of studies that analyzed the impact of economic recessions on attitudes toward public policies. Tracking the labor market experiences and political attitudes of a sample of US individuals over 2007–2011, Margalit (2013) found that people who lost their jobs became more favorable toward welfare spending, and that this effect was larger among Republicans than among Democrats, although the effect dissipated as individuals regained employment.Footnote 6 In a similar vein, people belonging to a cohort that experienced a recession when young have been found to believe that success in life depends more on luck than effort, to support more government redistribution, and to be prone to vote for left-wing parties (Giuliano & Spilimbergo, 2014).Footnote 7 Moreover, members of a cohort aged 18–25 during an epidemic in a given country are less likely to trust their government, even years after the epidemic has ended; such adverse effect is stronger in democracies and in countries where the incumbent government has weak implementation capacity (Aksoy et al., 2020).",2

Earnings stripping is a practice in which a multinational corporation (MNC) finances a production facility with loans issued by an entity in a tax haven and can thus reduce its taxable income. The MNC thereby exploits corporate income tax rate differentials and the fact that interest payments on intercompany loans are at least partially tax deductible in many countries. This provides MNCs with an opportunity to lower their tax bills. The resulting profit shifts from high tax to low tax jurisdictions take place in, and therefore are relevant for, many developed countries. The OECD addresses this topic in its Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (OECD, 2013) and, in its final report, suggests best practice actions to reduce the prevalence of misuse of internal loans (OECD, 2015). To alleviate the issue, almost all affected countries have introduced thin capitalization rules which limit the deductibility of internal interest payments from taxable income and hence restrict debt shifting activities of multinational firms. The design of the thin capitalization rules varies across countries. Rules can either take the form of a safe harbor rule, which limits the tax-deductible amount of internal debt compared to equity, or an earnings stripping rule, which regulates the ratio of debt interest to pre-tax earnings. Interestingly, we note that countries exist that only use one of the two regulatory rules, while other countries have implemented instruments that simultaneously employ both types of rule (e.g., Denmark, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia and Japan). There is no doubt that thin capitalization rules, regardless of type, restrict the misuse of internal loans (Büttner et al., 2012; Wamser, 2014). However, there is a wider discussion taking place among economists and policymakers on which rule to use under certain circumstances. Indeed, recent policy changes have been witnessed in Belgium (2019), the Netherlands (2019), Sweden (2019), Lithuania (2019) and Japan (2019) to name just a few examples. Of course, the European Union’s Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (2016) will have given rise to some of these changes. Article 4 of the Directive stipulates that all countries in the European Union must implement an earnings stripping rule by January 2020 or if an equally effective interest limitation rule is already in place which can continue to be used in the meantime, by January 2024. The frequent policy changes highlight that countries are concerned about MNCs’ debt shifting activities and combat them with adjustments of tax rates and a mix of measures to fight profit shifting. Not all afore-mentioned countries changed their regulatory system to one which solely employs the earnings stripping rule. In this paper we will therefore focus in particular on the choice of regulation when both types of rule are available. We analyze thin capitalization rules in a general equilibrium model in which a MNC can shift profits via debt shifting and transfer pricing. The transfer pricing channel serves as a role model for other potential profit shifting methods and was chosen due to its current relevance for MNCs’ profit shifting activities. MNCs could also switch between shifting methods to avoid restrictions which apply to only one of their profit shifting strategies. Regulatory changes focused on one profit shifting channel will influence MNCs’ strategy as a whole. We believe that changes in effective costs of one method will lead to changes in effective costs of other methods, too. To consider this, the different profit shifting methods are modeled in the form of cost substitutes. The empirical literature on MNCs dealing with substitution across different methods of profit shifting is rather limited. Just a few papers, like those of Saunders-Scott (2015) and Nicolay et al. (2017), found evidence for the existence of a substitutional effect. Nevertheless, there might be other potential reasons for countries to implement a hybrid thin capitalization rule than the substitution of profit shifting channels. Møen et al. (2019) show that MNCs use both internal and external debt to shift profits. The possibility of shifting profits by external debt could offer an incentive for MNCs to evade regulation that is based on internal debt only. In turn, this could cause countries to tackle different types of debt with different rules and create incentives for the use of hybrid rules. See Møen et al. (2019) for a general discussion on using internal and/or external debt to shift profits and Blouin et al. (2014) for a discussion of the effects that thin capitalization rules have on the internal and external debt-to-asset ratios of MNCs. Another argument for the use of hybrid thin capitalization rules could arise due to firm heterogeneity. If countries could choose which rule to use for a specific sector, this could be beneficial in the context of the fact that heterogeneous firms may have different debt-to-asset ratios for reasons other than earnings stripping. For a general discussion of firm heterogeneity and profit shifting, see Krautheim and Schmidt-Eisenlohr (2011). However, we believe that the substitution of profit shifting channels is one of the strongest motives for the implementation of a hybrid thin capitalization rule, albeit one that has not yet been entirely analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to analyze a general equilibrium model which incorporates the simultaneous application of both safe harbor rules and earnings stripping rules in an environment where a multinational firm treats different channels of profit shifting as substitutes. The most closely related approaches to ours are those described in the papers of Schindler and Schjelderup (2016), Mardan (2017) and Gresik et al. (2017). Schindler and Schjelderup (2016) analyzed thin capitalization rules under cost complementarity and cost substitution. A main result is that stricter regulation of debt shifting can foster profit shifting activities. However, their results are either based on sole application of a safe harbor rule or, conversely, sole application of an earnings stripping rule. In contrast, our paper addresses the simultaneous use of safe harbor rules and earnings stripping rules. Our results indicate that the earnings stripping rule cannot completely replicate the consequences of the safe harbor rule; thus, the choice to employ both rules may lead to a welfare improvement. This result complements the results in the existing literature. Gresik et al. (2017) employ a general equilibrium analysis to show in which situations MNCs may carry out debt shifting and transfer pricing and that the safe harbor rule is inferior to the earnings stripping rule. Their main argument for the superiority of the earnings stripping rule is that this rule imposes restrictions on the misuse of debt financing as well as transfer pricing activities. They find that the safe harbor rule affects only the debt shifting strategy of MNCs. Mardan (2017) on the other hand found no clear preference for one rule over another when he investigated a model which focuses on the presence of financial frictions. The results show that the superiority of one rule over another depends on the extent to which MNCs can use other profit shifting channels besides debt shifting activities. In contrast to our approach, neither Mardan (2017) nor Gresik et al. (2017) use a setting in which a multinational firm treats different profit shifting channels as substitutes. Gresik et al. (2017) rule out a part of the substitutional effect by definition of the concealment cost function, as an increase in effective debt shifting costs does not lead to an increased use of transfer pricing in their model. Thus, they find that the safe harbor rule is inferior to the earnings stripping rule and the implication that follows is that hybrid rules should not be the policy of choice for countries. In contrast, our results suggest that the substitution of profit shifting methods alters the choice of the MNC in a specific way and also alters the effective tax rates and, as a consequence, the cost of capital. Thus substitution across profit shifting methods offers two opposing arguments for how an MNC can react to hybrid regulation. Either hybrid regulation could raise the effective cost of capital, the MNC thus reacting by decreasing the amount of capital it holds, or stricter regulation could force the MNC to increase the amount of capital it holds in order to mitigate the constraints. Hybrid rules may thus improve welfare if the reaction of the MNC coincides with the characteristics of a country’s welfare function. As a starting point, we are able to replicate the results of Gresik et al. (2017) in our framework as a literature benchmark, when we do not apply the afore-mentioned substitution. We then argue that countries either choose to employ the earnings stripping rule, the safe harbor rule or the hybrid model, depending on their unique country characteristics. It is therefore possible that one country chooses one type of rule, while another chooses a different type. All afore-mentioned European countries have enforced the same type of regulation. The safe harbor rule allows deductible interest expenses up to a 4:1 debt to equity ratio with a safe harbor limit of approximately €3 m. The earnings stripping rule allows a company to make tax deductions of 30% of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Japan imposes a debt to equity ratio of 3:1 and allows net interest payments of up to 50% of adjusted taxable income, except for net interest payments up to JPY10m. This paper aims to provide an explanation for the observed variation of fiscal rules. We will show that the decision of fiscal rules depends on country-specific factors like tax rates and capital investment. For example, all afore-mentioned European countries levy combined corporate income tax rates equal to or lower than the European average of 22% in 2020, e.g., 22% in Denmark, 20% in Latvia, 19% in Czech Republic and 15% in Lithuania. Japan levies a combined corporate income tax rate of 29.7%.Footnote 1 A similar picture can be drawn for effective average tax rates. In 2019, Japan had the highest effective average tax rate (27.2%) followed by the Czech Republic (21.2%), Denmark (19.6%), Latvia (17%) and Lithuania (13.4%). All countries decreased their combined and effective average corporate income tax rates in the last decades, possibly as a consequence of competition for foreign investment. The amount of inward and outward investments varies across those countries. The Czech Republic has the highest amount of inward foreign direct investment measured in percentage of GDP (68%) followed by Latvia (52%), Lithuania (38%), Denmark (35%) and Japan (4%). This ordering of countries is inverted in the case of outward investments as Denmark (63%) and Japan (35%) have the highest amount of outward foreign direct investment measured in percentage of GDP followed by the Czech Republic (18%), Lithuania (9%) and Latvia (6%). To summarize, these observations suggest that there exist a partition of countries which can be characterized by a low ratio of inward to outward investments and another partition of countries with a high ratio of inward to outward investments. We argue that these country-specific differences have an effect on the fiscal rules that the countries apply. Our prediction is that countries with a high ratio of inward to outward foreign direct investment can have an interest in protecting the tax revenues paid by MNCs through an additional safe harbor rule. In contrast, countries with a low ratio of inward to outward foreign direct investment are more interested in domestic tax revenues and wages and only implement an additional safe harbor rule if the MNC increases the amount of capital it holds. In many countries the reaction of the MNC will not coincide with their welfare characteristics, and therefore, these countries should only implement an earnings stripping rule. We will show that the results of our model substantiate this prediction. Accordingly, MNCs treating profit shifting methods as substitutes could be an important aspect explaining the policy choice of fiscal authorities in Denmark, Lithuania and Japan and other countries. We think that our results provide a new aspect to the explanation for why hybrid thin capitalization rules are used. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2 we present a general equilibrium model with debt shifting and transfer pricing. Section 2.1 focuses on the impact of thin capitalization rules and cost substitution on an MNC’s production decision. In Sect. 2.2 we discuss the effect on welfare maximization, and finally, in Sect. 3, we offer concluding remarks.",

In 1974 this figure stood at 23%, down from 88% in 1945. Moreover, at any point in time there is substantial cross-country variation. 2010 debt levels varied from 22% in Switzerland to 189% in Japan. Whilst it is widely recognized that these outcomes are the product of imperfect political processes, a full explanation represents a formidable challenge to political economics.Footnote 1 Persson and Svensson (1989) and Alesina and Tabellini (1990) formalized the idea of ‘strategic debt’. Given the likelihood of being replaced in the future, an ideologically motivated incumbent will encumber future (ideologically distant) governments with debt. The greater the ideological distance between the parties, the greater the level of debt.Footnote 2 On the other hand, as we discuss in the next section polarized preferences serve to weaken electoral mechanisms which themselves plausibly underpin proclivity to debt. The novel hypothesis is that polarization as defined by greater ideological dispersion in the electorate will instead reduce government debt. This paper investigates the relationship between central government debt and ideological polarization empirically. Figure 1 presents a simple cross-country correlation between central government debt levels in 2010 and the polarization measure generated from the World Values Survey used by Lindqvist and Östling (2010) in their analysis of the size of government. The data sample here is a cross section of quite diverse countries.Footnote 3 The scatter plot reveals a negative raw correlation between polarization and debt. Prima facie this is supportive of the argument advanced in the present paper, and somewhat contrary to the strategic debt literature. Nonetheless it is not possible to infer causality for the standard reason that analysis of cross-country performance omits considerable unobserved heterogeneity. Scatter plot of central government debt as a percentage of GDP in 2010 and ideological polarization by country. Ideological polarization is measured using the standard deviation of the ‘Gov’ question in the World Values Survey (see Lindqvist & Östling, 2010) Below the competing hypotheses are tested using time-varying polarization measures generated from ideology data from political manifestos and observed voting behaviour. One important feature of these data is that they vary over time. Previous analyses of the relationship between fiscal policy and ideological polarization have only used cross-sectional analysis, or in the context of panel data has relied on fixed measures of ideology for party positioning—wherein time variation is generated through variation in seats.Footnote 4 Within countries the distance between parties is not fixed over time; hence, the data used here represent an improvement over the previous work. Within-country variation also allows us to control for unobserved fixed country-specific characteristics that might drive debt. The econometric analysis consistently finds a statistically significant negative relationship between central government debt and ideological polarization in voter preferences. The relationship is robust to the inclusion of a number of controls and, in particular, is strengthened when a measure of fragmentation (which is distinct from polarization) is included. In contrast to the strategic debt literature we find that it is ideological dispersion in the electorate, rather than ideological distance between the government and their potential replacement, that correlates with debt. A one standard deviation increase in polarization correlates with lower central government debt by about 12% of GDP. To identify exogenous variation in polarization, we use lagged media penetration data and also the impact of the fall of the Berlin Wall on European politics. Campante and Hojman (2013) and Melki and Pickering (2014) both argue for a causal relationship from increased media penetration to reduced polarization. Using the alternative instrumental variables the results hold up in support of a causal negative relationship between polarization and debt. Furthermore, the negative relationship between debt and polarization is found to be stronger when ‘government efficiency’ is weaker. This latter variable is defined by institutional independence from political pressures. As such we would expect a priori that governments scoring highly on this measure would be more able to resist voter demands for debt. The data thus also support this line of reasoning. The negative relationship is also found to be especially strong when fiscal transparency is high. Whilst the ‘treatment’ of transparency is evidently far from random, this evidence can also be reconciled with the argument that electoral pressure for debt when there are many swing voters (i.e. when preferences are not polarized) is particularly strong when voters are more able to attribute fiscal policy outcomes to the incumbent. The paper contributes to the growing literature examining the economic consequences of political polarization. Azzimonti (2011) theorizes that the common pool problem in public service provision is exacerbated, causing higher taxes and lower growth, and Woo (2003, 2005) and Azzimonti and Talbert (2014) find increased policy variability and hence subsequent greater macroeconomic volatility. Canes-Wrone and Park (2012) argue for a ‘reverse political business cycle’ in which uncertainty over the future policy environment increases with polarization thus dampening investment prior to elections. On the other hand, Testa (2010 and 2012) and Brown et al (2011) theorize that polarization can reduce corruption. Melki and Pickering (2020) find supportive evidence for this hypothesis using data from the USA. The findings in the present paper are compatible with this literature. The basic argument here is that polarization can weaken electoral competition and in doing so act to reduce policy failures that can emerge from the political process.Footnote 5 The next section develops the theoretical argument, Sect. 3 contains the empirical analysis and Sect. 4 concludes.",
29.0,4.0,International Tax and Public Finance,02 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-021-09682-1,Revenue vs expenditure based fiscal consolidation: the pass-through from federal cuts to local taxes,August 2022,Luigi Marattin,Tommaso Nannicini,Francesco Porcelli,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Recent works in both macroeconomics and political economics show that the output effect of fiscal consolidation depends on its composition, as the choice of increasing revenues vs cutting expenditure is not neutral from both an economic and a political perspective (see Berndt et al. 2012; Alesina and Ardagna 2013, Alesina et al. 2017, 2019).Footnote 1 In particular, the evidence summarized by Alesina et al. (2019) shows that expenditure based fiscal consolidations, on average, have a smaller contractionary effect than tax based fiscal consolidations. Yet, existing studies underscore the role of local governments in a federal setting. As transfer cuts at the central level might translate into higher local taxes, changing the effective composition of the national fiscal adjustment, any macro evaluation of fiscal consolidations should take this transmission mechanism into account. What also motivates us is the possibility of exploring the presence of local governments’ asymmetric responses to variation in transfers. In other words, the flypaper effect that we usually observe when the flow of transfers goes up, inducing overexpansion of local expenditure, might be absent in the opposite case of transfer cuts. In this case, local governments might use their tax autonomy to compensate for the reduction in transfers, just reshaping revenues’ composition to avoid spending cuts.Footnote 2 We isolate this mechanism in Italy, where we can causally evaluate the fiscal policy reaction of local governments to a large fiscal consolidation effort imposed at the central level. By doing so, we also join a growing literature that uses variation across cities or regions to identify the impact of economic shocks of interest to macroeconomists, as causal inference is usually difficult with the use of cross-country variation alone.Footnote 3 Italy is the ideal testing ground for the causal evaluation of policy responses to the need of fiscal consolidation. Like many other Western economies, Italy went through a sharp fiscal consolidation in the aftermath of the Great Recession, resulting in a public deficit reduction from 5.3% of the GDP in 2009 to 2.1% in 2018. In the period 2010–2015, approximately one third of this fiscal consolidation occurred through a permanent cut in federal transfers to municipal governments, which were reduced by 8.6 billions of euros (out of a 25.1-billion deficit reduction in nominal terms). As the current public spending of Italian municipalities amounted to 39.6 billions in 2010 (excluding expenditure for local public transport and waste management), this transfer reduction had a sizable impact on the local governments’ fiscal position, and forced them to either increase local taxes or reduce spending, also because a tight balanced-budget constraint is in place and no deficit is allowed at the local level. This environment—which is common to many other countries with a certain degree of decentralization—allows us to investigate the transmission mechanism from a reduction in federal transfers to the composition of fiscal adjustment at lower layers of government. Moreover, as municipalities below the threshold of 5000 inhabitants were exempted from most of the transfer cuts, we can implement a difference-in-discontinuities design to causally evaluate the quantity and quality of the fiscal adjustment effort. Our identification strategy also benefits from the high level of Italian municipalities fragmentation: considering that 75% of them has less than 5000 inhabitants, even a narrow window around this population threshold provides a good sample size. In particular, local governments in municipalities below the threshold of 5000 inhabitants were exempted from (large) transfer cuts in 2012. This allows us to implement a difference-in-discontinuities design (see Grembi et al. 2016; Eggers et al. 2018) in order to estimate the causal impact of transfer cuts on the composition of fiscal adjustment, by controlling at the same time for confounding policies at 5000 and for time shocks in 2012. In fact, the 5000 threshold is also used in Italy to define the strictness of fiscal rules and the wage paid to local mayors (which has been shown to affect both their quality and performance), but neither of these two policies changed in 2012.Footnote 4 Of course, the year 2012 also affected the Italian economy and public finance because of other factors, but all of them were common to municipalities just below and just above 5000 inhabitants. Therefore, as we formally show in our econometric framework, the combination of the time variation before/after 2012 and the discontinuous variation at 5000 allows us to identify a causal effect.Footnote 5 Our empirical findings disclose a pass-through mechanism by which local governments react to the contraction of intergovernmental grants by mainly increasing taxes rather than reducing spending. In particular, real estate taxation at the local level is suddenly increased in municipalities that have enough fiscal space to do that. From a political economy perspective, we find that this revenue based fiscal consolidation is mainly driven by municipalities with low electoral competition and no party fragmentation in the government coalition. As tax hikes are faster to adopt and bring revenues more rapidly than expenditure cuts, the government may be prone to adopt them to realize the fiscal adjustment, unless it faces (external or internal) political competition by politicians that have an incentive to emphasize the tax increase in the public discussion and campaign against the government. Our study contributes to different strands of the literature in both macroeconomics and political economics. Moreover, we also provide a small contribution to the growing literature, recently surveyed by Agrawal et al. (2021), on how local governments set policy in a multi-level environment, interacting with other jurisdictions and the central government’s policy goals. In particular, we focus our attention on a less-studied form of interaction, investigating how local governments’ behaviour may alter central government’s fiscal policy crowding-out federal spending cuts increasing local taxes. The analysis of fiscal adjustments has mainly been conducted at the national level, mostly in the attempt to quantify the output effects of revenue based as opposed to expenditure based fiscal consolidation plans (see Giavazzi and Pagano 1990; Alesina et al. 1998; Forni et al. 2010; Alesina and Ardagna 2013, Erceg and Lendè 2013, Yang et al. 2015, Alesina et al. 2019). At the sub-national level, aside from the vast literature on political budget cycles (see Brender 2003; Brender and Drazen 2005; Drazen and Eslava 2010), the link between changes in transfers from upper-tier governments and the fiscal policy reaction by lower-tier governments has not been widely explored.Footnote 6 The literature on sub-national fiscal policy can broadly be divided into two categories: the first looks at the determinants of the distribution of transfers from the central government to local governments; the second investigates their effects on fiscal policy decisions at the local level. In the first strand, attention has mainly been devoted to verify how much the territorial distribution of transfers is affected by political considerations.Footnote 7 The second strand is the closest to our contribution. Central governments can affect local fiscal policy behavior in two ways: by changing the amount of grants or by imposing non-monetary restrictions such as tax and expenditure limitations. In this respect, Skidmore (1999) looks at local tax limitations imposed in US states between 1976 and 1990, and finds that they produced a reduction in constrained revenue sources but a parallel increase in unconstrained ones. In other words, they favored a reshuffling of the local budget on the revenue side, leaving pretty much unaltered the spending level. The most direct way to affect local governments’ fiscal behavior is undoubtedly by changing the level of transfers. In this regard, the literature has mainly focused on the so-called “fly paper effect,” namely the overreaction of local expenditure to changes in transfers from upper-tier governments, as opposed to the reaction of local spending to changes in local income (see, among others, Hines and Thaler 1995; Bailey and Connolly 1998, and for surveys see Hamilton 1983 and Inman 2008). Some empirical evidence of flypaper effects has been found in the US (Case et al. 1993; Knight 2002, and more recently Leduc and Wilson 2017), UK (Gemmel et al. 2002), Norway (Tovmo and Falch 2002), Sweden (Dahlberg et al. 2008), Gernmany (Baskaran 2016) and Braliz (Cruz and Silva 2020). More recently, Becker et al. (2020) find evidence in support of the flypaper effect through laboratory experiments. Although these studies provide causal estimates, they do not find evidence of asymmetric behaviour, that is a less than proportional reduction of local public spending when central grants are reduced (which is specifically the scope of our paper). As for the Italian case, Levaggi and Zanola (2003) and Legrenzi (2009) both find descriptive evidence of downward inflexibility of, respectively, regional and municipal public spending in the event of transfer reduction. Gennari and Messina (2014) do not find any robust result in terms of fiscal replacement, that is, municipalities reacting to smaller transfers by increasing their own tax revenues. Our paper stems from these mixed results and implements a quasi-experimental design to estimate the causal effect of transfer cuts on both local taxes and spending, as well as heterogeneous responses by the underlying political environment.Footnote 8 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sketches a simple theoretical framework that we use to interpret the empirical results. Section 3 describes the institutional setting and the data sources. Section 4 presents the econometric framework. Section 5 discusses the main findings and robustness checks. Section 6 concludes.

In these countries’ lobby groups driven by business interests argue that foreign investors who do not face the wealth tax, have a greater willingness to pay for a company’s stock than domestic investors who must pay the wealth tax. Furthermore, to cover the wealth tax cost, domestic investors must require a higher rate of return from companies they own compared to tax exempt investors. Therefore, the argument goes, the wealth tax imposes a competitive disadvantage on domestic investors and has stark implications for the ownership structure in an economy. Consequently, it should be replaced by a capital income tax (or if a capital income tax is in place, its rate should be increased).Footnote 2 A wealth tax differs from a capital income tax in that for a given amount of wealth, the tax liability of a wealth tax does not depend on the amount of capital income the wealth actually generates, while in contrast a capital income tax liability is related to that flow. A second difference is the lack of equivalence between a wealth tax and a capital income tax if we assume that they are revenue-equivalent. A wealth tax collects revenue from primarily taxing the principal and effectively imposing the same rate on components of the rate of return. In contrast, the capital income tax falls on the normal rate of return plus any rents and rewards for risk taking.Footnote 3 These differences could potentially affect investors’ willingness to pay for a company’s stocks in different ways. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the wealth tax and the capital income tax affect how investors value a company’s stock. We study two investors (foreign and domestic) who have the same investment opportunities, but where only the domestic investor is subject to a tax on capital income and wealth. We could have imposed positive taxes on the foreign investor as well, and even made assumptions on the relative sizes of the taxes facing the domestic and foreign investor without affecting our results. Capital markets are assumed efficient, transparent and liquid, and all investors are price takers, have access to the same information, and interpret information in the same way. The Fisher separation theorem states that within this framework, the investment decision can be separated from the risk-taking decision. Moreover, the criterion for the investment decision is to maximize the net present value of investment opportunities. This means that the investor’s risk preference is irrelevant for the investment decision, which is the focus of this article (but it is indeed important for the risk-taking decision). We first derive the opportunity return on capital for the foreign and the domestic investor, and then, we establish the two investors’ willingness to pay for a company’s stock that is traded freely. We assume that the asset value is determined by its net present value. Our starting point is a one-period model with an uncertain asset return. We then expand the analysis to the case of an infinite horizon where the asset generates a cash flow that is a martingale. Finally, these assumptions are relaxed, and we impose a finite time horizon, and abandon the martingale assumption. The outcome of all variants of our analysis is the same. Investors who face wealth tax and/or a capital income tax have a lower discount rate, but their willingness to pay for a company’s stock is not affected by either tax. The reason is that the tax liability arising from either tax reduces the cash flow from the asset, but this reduction is exactly matched by the lower discount rate, leaving the valuation of the asset on par with how the market and the foreign investor who is untaxed values the stock. In a next step we show that if a company owner increases her required rate of return from the company because of the wealth tax, say, she will harm the company’s market value and thus her own wealth.Footnote 4 Our results must not be misinterpreted as one where taxes do not matter. All taxes affect disposable income, and investors who are tax exempt or taxed at lower rates, may therefore be able, everything else equal, to hold more stocks than investors who pay taxes. The wealth of tax-exempt or low-taxed investors may therefore grow faster. There is a small literature focusing on the overall response to wealth taxes using European data. These studies find that taxable wealth is highly responsive to the wealth tax rate.Footnote 5 The effect of the wealth tax has also been studied in relationship with entrepreneurial risk taking (Hall & Woodward, 2010), migration (Organ, 2020), tax evasion (Alstadsæter et al., 2019, Guyton et al., 2020), and tax avoidance (Alvaredo & Saez, 2009; Hemel, 2019). There is a large literature on the effect of taxation on portfolio choice starting with the seminal paper by Sandmo (1977). However, there seems to be no paper that compares the wealth tax to a capital income tax with the aim of studying how these taxes affect the valuation of an asset from an investor’s perspective. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we derive the basic one-period model. Section 3 expands the model into one with an infinite horizon, while Sect. 4 considers a more general setting with a finite horizon, where we abandon the martingale assumption. Section 5 studies the investors’ willingness to bid for a domestic company that is for sale, while Sect. 6 studies the implications of increasing the required rate of return from the company because of capital taxation. The last section offers some conclusions.",1

Braml,Gabriel J. Felbermayr,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The world runs a current account surplus with itself (Gros,  2017): a logical impossibility that must result from measurement error or from—possibly fraudulent—misreporting. This global current account surplus is mainly driven by the trade balance, and not by primary income statistics, which are known to suffer from measurement error. This fact—that we refer to as the world’s self-surplus—has prompted Krugman (2010) to develop a humorous theory of “interstellar trade” that could be at the root of the global surplus. Less well known, the European Union has been running massive trade surpluses with itself over years, i.e., exports from EU Member States to other EU Member States exceed the value of imports as recorded by the importer. This self-surplus amounts to 307 bn Euro in 2018, or 1.9% of the Union’s GDP. The EU’s self-surplus is almost as big (86%) as the global-surplus of 357 bn Euro (422 bn USD) in 2018.Footnote 1 It is larger than the frequently criticized current account surplus of GermanyFootnote 2, and surpasses the combined GDP of the eight smallest EU Member States. It is therefore too big to be lightheartedly discarded as an irrelevant if amusing statistical artefact. As we argue, this self-surplus follows non-random patterns and may therefore unveil systematic biases. We suspect that the discrepancy may result from massive fraud in value added tax (VAT) declarations, which would amount to up to 64 billion Euro in a worst case scenario. In principle, such fraud would involve an over-declaration of export figures to save VAT for domestic sales. This is possible due to the destination principle in the European VAT system. Hence, firms face a sizeable and direct incentive to mis-report domestic transactions as exports. On the aggregate level, this may yield a credit-bias in intra-European Balance of Payments (BoP) data and can consistently explain the EU’s trade self-surplus. Recently, probably due to increasing international economic tensions, current account (CA) statistics have attracted unusual attention both from policy makers as well as researchers. For instance, there is substantial uncertainty about whether the EU has run a bilateral CA surplus or a deficit with the United States over the past decade. In times of trade conflicts, the absence of a definite answer is troublesome; see Braml and Felbermayr (2019) for an illustration and tentative interpretation of transatlantic facts. The underlying problem, however, is broader: International transaction data are of poor quality, due to negligence, strategic government manipulation, and fraud. This obviously sets limits for meaningful evidence-based research and policy making and, probably even worse, allows fraudsters hiding their illegal activities. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper that offers a systematic analysis and interpretation of the EU’s self-surplus.Footnote 3 We provide novel evidence by (i) describing the magnitudes and dynamics of the discrepancies in the intra-EU current account, by (ii) decomposing the self-surplus according to the sub-accounts in the current account, by (iii) investigating the contributions of single EU Member States, and by (iv) the interpretation of our findings based on forensic accounting methods. For example, we show that goods and services trade contribute almost equally to the observed discrepancy. This allows us to rule out such explanations that are specific to only either of the two sorts of trade, e.g., CIF-FOB differentials in the case of goods trade. Given the persistence of the discrepancy, random statistical noise can unlikely account for the observed patterns. Hence, we raise the cui bono—who benefits?—question and argue, later in this paper, that VAT fraud is a plausible explanation for the significant credit-bias that is prevalent in European current account statistics. For very good reasons, economists usually deem bilateral current account balances irrelevant from a macroeconomic perspective (Feenstra et al., 1999; Mankiw, 2018). However, they are of great importance for bilateral economic relations, in particular in the context of trade conflicts, currency unions, and external imbalances. For a deeper understanding of these self-surpluses as well as to explore potential mechanisms that drive it, this paper not only examines aggregated figures but focuses in greater detail on country and country pair specific discrepancies. Discrepancies in so-called mirror data are statistical artefacts prevalent in many international data with dyadic dimension.Footnote 4 In principle, any market transaction involves the documentation of corresponding values by buyer and seller. After correct summation, balances must necessarily mirror each other: All countries’ exports are equal to all countries’ imports; this is a mechanical accounting process and holds true by definition. However, in reality, perfectly corresponding mirror data are the exception rather than the rule. Frankel (1978) discusses potential reasons for the worldwide current account deficit in the 1960s and 1970s. In the early 2000s, the global debit-bias has turned into a credit-bias, meaning that surpluses exceed deficits. Helbling and Terrones (2009) suggest that time lags in international transportation might lead to lagged recording of imports relative to exports; in a world of rapidly growing trade, global surpluses would be a necessary consequence. According to this explanation, lengthy shipment processes and high growth rates distort trade figures. This bias should even revert, when global trade shrinks. Academic literature has emphasized the link between missing trade and export restrictions: Fisman and Wei (2009) measure the smuggling of art as bilateral discrepancy in trade figures and Vézina (2015) shows that missing exports frequently result from resource export restrictions. Both studies illustrate that discrepancies at the country level correlate with corruption indexes.Footnote 5 Since export restrictions lead to an under-declaration of the true export values, the opposite mechanism could explain the EU’s self-surplus: import restrictions would materialize in excess trade surpluses. However, no relevant import restrictions vindicating missing trade of more than 300 bn Euro annually are known in the very case of intra-EU trade, one of the world’s most liberalized cross-border economic zone. Considering the geographical proximity of EU Member States and the resulting possibility for land transportation, the relative weak economic growth, as well as the fact that services trade is equally affected, leads us to assume that other reasons must lie at the heart of the observed discrepancies. Ferrantino et al. (2012) investigate discrepancies in goods trade between the USA and China and link them to VAT fraud and tariff evasion. As tariff evasion can be ruled out for transactions within the EU customs union, our interpretation focuses on VAT fraud. In a nutshell, we argue that firms over-report the true value of their exports to receive a VAT rebate for goods that are sold domestically. The resulting export statistics are overblown and fail to match corresponding import figures. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: first, Sect. 2 discusses relevant conceptual issues and, second, reports the main finding: an empirical stock-taking of the EU and Euro Area self-surpluses. Third, it shows which Member State pairs exhibit the most severe discrepancies and identifies the countries that are most likely “responsible” for the discrepancy of a given pair. Section 3 provides a broad discussion of our descriptive findings, thereby turning to VAT fraud as an explanation for the observed discrepancies. Moreover, it estimates the potential revenue shortfalls and outlines a concept for an electronic clearing procedure that would tackle VAT fraud by the over-declaration of exports.

This approach does not fully explain the compliance behavior of individuals, as moral and social dynamics also drive individual reporting decisions (Andreoni et al., 1998; Bott et al., 2019; Hallsworth et al., 2017). Previous research suggests that taxpayers’ satisfaction with government action is a critical driver of their propensity to comply. If citizens believe that the government does not spend their taxes well, they may want to reciprocate by refusing to pay their full tax liability (Spicer & Lundstedt, 1976). If, instead, the belief prevails that institutions use taxes to fund public goods and services adequately, taxpayers will be more willing to comply (Alm et al., 1993). Even when they do not receive a full public good equivalent of their payments, citizens may be intrinsically motivated to honestly declare their income as if a “psychological contract” with tax authorities was in force (Fehr & Gächter, 1998; Frey & Feld, 2002; Frey et al., 2004). According to Feld and Frey (2007), such a contract holds as far as citizens perceive the political process as fair and the policy outcomes as legitimate, resulting in a stronger willingness to contribute to the welfare of the community. These perspectives imply a vital role for information about government action and the fairness of the political process. The media’s coverage of economic and policy issues, however, is far from being balanced. The communication literature agrees that mass media tend to over-report negative news as they generate stronger psychophysiological reactions in the audience (Soroka et al., 2019), and they better fit the public’s preference for negative contents (Agirdas, 2015). The negativity bias has proved particularly pronounced in the presentation of political (Cappella & Jamieson, 1997; Kepplinger et al., 2012; Le Moglie & Turati, 2019) and economic news (Garz, 2014; Soroka et al., 2018). Given the role of information in shaping the public’s opinion about public institutions, research on tax compliance should address the impact of the media negativity bias. However, empirically studying how the media affect citizens’ willingness to pay their taxes is challenging in many respects. Existing surveys do not provide information about the possible bias of the news consumed by the public, and the use of survey data entails endogenous sample selection and treatment assignment that prevent ascertaining causality. To address these issues, we design a framed laboratory experiment (Alm, 2012) that allows us to analyze how exposure to biased news affects compliance in a repeated taxation game. Experimental manipulations consist of news tickers reporting top stories about public finance and policy issues that run on subjects’ screens during the game. Using a between-subjects design, we contrast tax compliance outcomes under three conditions: negative, positive, and neutral news provision. The negative treatment reflects the media negativity bias that the communication literature credits with being the status quo in the supply of news about public finance and policy issues (e.g., Soroka et al., 2018; Soroka et al., 2019). Compared to the neutral treatment, the negative news condition seems not to affect tax compliance, suggesting that participants likely perceive the media negativity bias as the norm rather than the exception (Cappella & Jamieson, 1997; Elejalde et al., 2018; Garz, 2014; Kepplinger et al., 2012; Soroka et al., 2019). As the selection and tonality of news deviate from the status quo resulting in positive content, participants become significantly more compliant than the control group. The effect is economically sizable: subjects treated with good news reported a 23 percentage points higher compliance rate than those exposed to negative or neutral news. Overall, our results reveal that how the media present public finance and policy issues is a crucial determinant of tax compliance, suggesting that biased news is a constant source of psychological priming that may prevent the public sector from fully exploiting its tax revenue potential. Our paper bridges two strands of literature. The first comprises the economics of tax compliance, which has been approached from many perspectives (see Andreoni et al., 1998; Alm, 2012, 2019, for a review). We focus on the moral and social perspective on taxpayers’ behavior, which has linked compliance to the efficiency and fairness of public institutions (Alm et al., 1993; Koessler et al., 2019; De Neve et al., 2021; Feld & Frey, 2007; Hallsworth et al., 2017; Murphy & Tyler, 2008; Smith, 1992; Tyler, 1990; van Dijke & Verboon, 2010). These studies implicitly assume a critical role for information. We clarify this role and add to the literature by showing the compliance implications of biased information about government action and public finance issues. More in general, our findings improve the understanding of the psychological and social drivers of compliance, also including peer effects (Alm et al., 2017), cultural traits (Alm et al., 2017), trust in institutions (McKee et al., 2018; van Dijke & Verboon, 2010), social norms (Abraham et al., 2017; Becchetti et al., 2017; Lefebvre et al., 2015), corruption (Alm et al., 2016; Rotondi & Stanca, 2015), fairness concerns (Alesina & Angeletos, 2005; Gualtieri et al., 2019; Sabatini et al., 2020), and intrinsic motivations (Calvet Christian & Alm, 2014; Cerqueti et al., 2019; Dwenger et al., 2016; Luttmer & Singhal, 2011, 2014). The second strand of literature studies how media bias affects economically relevant behavior such as voting (Chiang & Knight, 2011; DellaVigna & Kaplan, 2007), civic-mindedness (Durante et al., 2019), crime perceptions (Mastrorocco & Minale, 2018), and consumption behavior (Nguyen & Claus, 2013), just to name a few. There is growing evidence that the media may also have an impact on tax compliance. Garz and Pagels (2018) show that the media coverage of celebrities’ tax issues causes an increase in the number of self-denunciations. Kasper et al. (2015) use a survey experiment to show that exposure to news that presents Austrian tax authorities as trustworthy leads to stronger trust in authorities and higher intended compliance. Cyan et al. (2017) find that TV and newspaper ads can improve individual attitudes toward tax compliance in Pakistan. We contribute to this field by focusing on a specific type of bias, the negativity bias, and revealing a so far unexplored outcome of this phenomenon. Our experimental approach also adds to the communication literature that studies the media negativity bias (Cappella & Jamieson, 1997; Garz, 2014; Soroka et al., 2018; Soroka et al., 2019; Trussler & Soroka, 2014), by suggesting that the systematic tendency of the media to focus on negative news may entail hidden social costs connected to the government’s inability to meet its revenue objectives. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the related literature and presents our hypotheses. Section 3 describes our experimental design and procedures. Section 4 presents our results. We discuss our findings and their possible policy implications in Sect. 5 and conclude in Sect. 6.",

Recent empirical studies report that markups, the wedge between marginal costs and prices, are on the rise in many countries across the globe (Loecker and Eeckhout 2018), including the USA (Loecker et al. 2020; Hall 2018). As a result, the welfare of the individuals, whose wages are a part of marginal costs, declines due to a higher cost-of-living. Because of declining marginal utility, such an effect is particularly detrimental to the indirect utility of poorer individuals. Furthermore, markups act as a distortion on labor supply and, thus, have a negative impact on efficiency.Footnote 1 Overall, rising markups may create a case for the government to utilize its tax policies in order to re-optimize the trade-off between equity and efficiency. The literature that considers redistributive taxation in conjunction with market power either conducts policy experiments with the profit tax (Boar and Midrigan 2019) or exclusively focuses on income taxes in settings where 100% profit tax is optimal (Kaplow 2019; Kushnir and Zubrickas 2019). It might, however, prove important to consider the interplay between the two policy tools. Ultimately, the two taxes jointly determine the state of competition and the total tax revenue in an economy. I explicitly model the strategic interactions between firms in a monopolistic competition setting in order to study the joint optimization of income and profit taxation. Atesagaoglu and Yazici (2020) explore the ramifications of higher markups for optimal capital and labor income taxation. Their study, however, abstracts from redistributive concerns. Scheuer (2014) studies simultaneous optimization of labor income and profit taxes in a setting with perfect competition. The purpose of this study, on the other hand, is to account for the redistributive taxation implications of market imperfections brought about by increasing markups. How does a government with redistributive motives optimally adjust its corporate profit and labor income tax mix as markups rise? Should the corporate profit tax decrease to stimulate competition or should it increase to extract higher profit tax revenues that can be redistributed to the needy? What is the role of optimal Mirrleesian income taxes? This study investigates the optimal policy rules that address these questions. I utilize a general equilibrium model featuring individuals that are heterogeneous in their earning abilities. Production is performed in two stages. A finite set of monopolistically competitive firms supply intermediate goods by using labor as the only input. This sector exhibits endogenous firm entry and, hence, generates endogenous markups which decrease in the number of firms. The final good producer aggregates the intermediate inputs in a perfectly competitive environment and sells the final goods to the individuals. A utilitarian government maximizes social welfare by simultaneously choosing its flat profit tax rate and Mirrleesian labor income tax scheme. Crucially, an increase in fixed production costs in the intermediate goods sector reduces the number of firms (i.e., by distorting R&D activities) and increases the wedge between prices and marginal costs. Whereas marginal costs of intermediate goods firms correspond to the wage rates of the individuals, prices of the intermediate goods factor into the cost-of-living. As a result, the real wages of the individuals decline. Furthermore, the reduction in real wages acts as a distortion of labor supply due to the substitution effect and, hence, leads to efficiency losses. Novel formulas for optimal profit and labor income taxes are presented in a stylized two-type model. The optimal profit tax primarily depends on three factors: (i) the Price Effect, (ii) the Tax Base Effect and (iii) the social value of taxable profits. Accordingly, (i) captures the distortive effects of the profit tax on competition, which leads to higher equilibrium cost-of-living. Thus, greater (i) tends to reduce the optimal profit tax. Furthermore, (ii) and (iii) are related to the redistributive prospects and contribute to an increase in the profit tax. The sign and magnitude of the optimal profit tax are determined by the counteraction of these two motives. The expression for optimal marginal labor income taxes, on the other hand, incorporates an additional term to the standard Stiglitz (1982) formula. This new term tends to reduce labor distortions as markups increase in order to restrict the contraction in total output. For the purposes of numerical simulations, I construct a benchmark US economy and estimate the fixed production costs that would yield a 20-percentage-point increase in the markups. Subsequently, I solve for and compare the optimal profit and labor income tax mix in the two states of the economy: with low and high fixed production costs. Optimal policy, in response to higher fixed costs, includes increasing the profit tax, despite its distortive effect on market competition. One important reason for this result is the simultaneous decline in optimal marginal income taxes. Reduced labor distortions incentivize higher labor supply, contributing to the expansion in the profit tax base, which is taxed at a higher rate with the optimal policy. A policy experiment suggests that, despite considerably depressing the real wages, the optimal policy makes almost all the individuals better off. In a next step, I consider a scenario where the profit tax does not have distortive effects on the competition due to fixed costs being fully deductible from profits. As a result, a 100% profit tax is optimal. Exogenously restricting the profit tax to be less than 100%, I investigate optimal labor income tax policies. I find that the optimal income taxes are almost stable as markups rise. This response does not exhibit increased redistribution. The social welfare, especially at the bottom of the distribution, is lower in comparison with the scenario with optimal profit taxation. An interpretation of this outcome is that the optimality of a redistributive response crucially relies on an operative profit tax. In an extension, I perform a reduced-form corporate profit shifting exercise. The results suggest that the government’s willingness to increase the profit tax, in response to higher markups, declines with the magnitude of the profit base elasticity. In other words, profit shifting may endogenously render the profit tax partially inoperative, preventing an otherwise optimal redistributive response. This analysis highlights the importance of fixing the profit shifting loopholes especially in the era of rising markups. The analyses thus far exploit higher fixed production costs as the underlying market mechanism that leads to greater markups by reducing the intensity of market competition. Indeed, there is mounting empirical evidence of increasing fixed costs (presented below). Nevertheless, keeping fixed costs constant, I consider increasing collusive behavior as an alternative reason for higher markups. Fundamental conclusions do not change. Hence, results should not be attributed to a specific feature of the fixed costs. Related Literature. Recent empirical evidence reports a slowdown in business dynamism (Decker et al. 2016; Pugsley and Sahin 2018) and an increase in markups (Loecker et al. 2020; Hall 2018) in the USA. Rising fixed costs can explain these stylized facts by imposing barriers for market entry and, hence, hampering competitiveness (Colciago and Mechelli 2020; Ridder 2020). Various arguments for the underlying causes of rising fixed costs include technological change (Acemoglu et al. 2020; Ridder 2020; Grullon et al. 2019; Bessen 2017), demographic change (Karahan et al. 2019; Hopenhayn et al. 2018), a slow-down in research productivity (Bloom et al. 2020) and increasing regulations (Gutiérrez and Philippon 2019).Footnote 2 Abstracting from redistributional issues, a recent strand of the literature studies different forms of taxation with market imperfections and strategic interactions which allow for endogenous entry and markups. See Coto-Martínez et al. (2007) (capital income and profit taxes), Colciago (2016) (labor and dividend income taxes), Etro (2018) (labor, dividend and capital income taxes), Bilbiie et al. (2019) (dividend income and consumption taxes) and Avdiu (2018) (capital and labor income taxes in developing countries). I contribute to this body of literature by studying optimal labor income and profit taxation with a government that has redistributive concerns. This study is most closely related to the analysis of optimal redistributive taxation in imperfectly competitive markets. To the best of my knowledge, endogenous firm entry is assumed away in a majority of the studies. An exception is Boar and Midrigan (2019), which is discussed below. One strand of the literature studies optimal Mirrleesian income taxation with firms that have monopsony power (Hariton and Piaser 2007; da Costa and Maestri 2018; Hummel 2020). Kaplow (2019) examines optimal labor income taxation in a setting where firms charge a constant and exogenous markup over marginal costs. In his setting, tax policies do not affect markups and a 100% profit tax is optimal. Under various market structures, Kushnir and Zubrickas (2019) investigate optimal Mirrleesian taxation, accounting for endogenous price setting and progressively distributed firm profits. As emphasized above, Kushnir and Zubrickas (2019) do not model endogenous firm entry and do not solve for the optimal profit tax which are the key aspects of this study. Via policy experiments, Boar and Midrigan (2019) investigate aggregate and distributional consequences of product market interventions and the profit tax. Their model features monopolistic competition and heterogeneous producers. Income taxes are used to balance the government budget. Findings of Boar and Midrigan (2019) suggest that, for a given markup, increasing the profit tax heavily discourages market entry, thereby reducing total welfare. In this study, I assume away producer heterogeneities, but simultaneously optimize profit and labor income taxes in response to increasing markups. Most relatedly, Eeckhout et al. (2021) studied optimal labor income and entrepreneurial profit taxation under increasing market power. Eeckhout et al. (2021) modeled two separate fixed occupations: entrepreneurs and workers. Entrepreneurs employ workers and earn entrepreneurial income which can be considered as profits. The government maximizes welfare by tailoring distinct income tax schemes for workers and entrepreneurs. The exogenously set number of entrepreneurs determines market power. Unlike Eeckhout et al. (2021), this study assumes a uni-dimensional skill distribution, but allows the number of monopolistic competitors to be determined at the equilibrium. Thus, a linear variable profit tax rate can be utilized to optimize the trade-off between real wages and redistribution. The model of Eeckhout et al. (2021) can explicitly capture equity concerns due to the asymmetric distribution of profits. This is not possible in my framework because there are no excess profits. This study shows that, even in the absence of asymmetric excess profit distribution, the optimal variable profit tax rate increases due to the enlarged profit tax base, when it is set simultaneously with the optimal income taxes. This paper is also related to Scheuer (2014), who studies optimal profit and labor income taxation by explicitly modeling entrepreneurship via a two-dimensional skill distribution. Scheuer (2014) abstracts from imperfect competition, which is the focus of this study. Finally, Atesagaoglu and Yazici (2020) investigate the implications of exogenously increasing markups (and declining labor share) for optimal linear capital and labor income taxation. In their setting, the government does not have redistributive concerns and aims at financing an exogenous stream of expenditure. They find that it is optimal to increase the capital tax when the reduction in labor share is accompanied by a higher profit share. I exclusively focus on the interplay between income and profit taxation. The government optimizes the trade-off between greater redistribution versus a higher cost-of-living.",3

Kalamov,Marco Runkel,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Obesity currently represents one of the most pestering health problems worldwide. For example, in the USA more than one third (38.2%) of the population aged 15 years and older is obese, i.e., has a body mass index (BMI) larger than 30 kg/m\(^2\). The average obesity rate in OECD countries is 19.5%. If overweight people with a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m\(^2\) are included, then even one in two adults and one in six children have weight problems in OECD countries (OECD 2017). It is well known that obesity and overweight are closely related to secondary disorders—like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or even some cancers—which considerably increase mortality (WHO 2017). As a countermeasure, many countries have implemented taxes on calorie intake like taxes on fat, sugar or soda (WHO 2016a). In practice, the stated aim of such ‘sin taxes’ is to reduce the prevalence of obesity. For example, the WHO (2016b) argues that “\(\ldots \) [e]vidence shows that a tax of 20% on sugary drinks can lead to a reduction in consumption of around 20%, thus preventing obesity and diabetes.” (italics ours) In theory, sin taxes are often motivated by the paternalistic approach of correcting self-control problems (e.g., O'Donoghue and Rabin 2003, 2006). People choose unhealthy diet since they underestimate their future health costs. In doing so, they inflict an internality on themselves which can be corrected by a sin tax.Footnote 1 Our paper shows that there is a gap between the stated aim of sin taxes on unhealthy food consumption in practice and the paternalistic foundation in the economic literature. We show that the optimal paternalistic tax on calorie intake is effective at the intensive margin, i.e., it mitigates weight problems of individuals, but not at the extensive margin, i.e., it does not induce individuals to choose a healthy weight. The reason is that self-control problems—which should be corrected by the optimal paternalistic tax—influence only the intensive margin, whereas the extensive margin is purely determined by rational motives of the individuals. Implementing healthy weight by a tax—and thus overcoming the problem at the extensive margin—is also possible. But the associated health-maximizing tax requires a further, welfare-decreasing distortion that may render the tax inferior to not taxing the individuals at all. In addition, with heterogeneous individuals the optimal uniform paternalistic tax may have the negative side effect of reducing calorie intake of individuals with under- and normal weight. We derive these results within a theoretical model and confirm them by an empirical calibration with data on US adults. In the theoretical model, individuals consume two goods, food and a non-food good. Food consumption is measured by calorie intake and associated with health costs. The model has two decisive features. First, health costs are U-shaped with a minimum at some healthy level of food consumption. This assumption is highly relevant since calorie intake is positively correlated with the BMI (Hall et al. 2011) and the all-cause mortality is U-shaped in the BMI (Global BMI Mortality Collaboration 2016, Figure 3). Second, besides the self-control problem, individuals have a rational motive for choosing an unhealthy diet. Specifically, the net marginal benefit of food, defined as the marginal rate of substitution between food and the non-food good minus the relative food price, may be different from zero. As the individual sets this net marginal benefit equal to the marginal health costs, the chosen calorie intake may deviate from its healthy level. The literature provides evidence for both motives of an unhealthy diet. For instance, Cutler et al. (2003) and Courtemanche et al. (2014) show that obesity can be explained by decreasing food prices and costs, i.e. the rational motive, and that this impact is aggravated by hyperbolic discounting, i.e. the self-control motive.Footnote 2 Our analysis starts with the case of a representative individual in the absence of taxation. We define the tempting calorie intake as the level of food consumption at which the above-mentioned net marginal benefit of food becomes zero. In its diet choice, the individual trades off the incentive to attain this tempting calorie intake against the need to account for health costs. Hence, it realizes a calorie intake between the tempting level and the healthy level. That is to say, food consumption is above (below) the healthy level if tempting calorie intake is larger (lower) than healthy calorie intake, so the individual becomes overweight (underweight). If tempting and healthy calorie intake just coincide, the individual realizes healthy weight. Importantly, whether the individual becomes over- or underweight (the extensive margin) is solely determined by the relation of tempting and healthy calorie intake and not by the degree of self-control. The self-control problem only worsens over- or underweight (the intensive margin), but does not determine the direction of the individual’s weight problem. Next, we determine the paternalistic welfare-maximizing tax on calorie intake. The paternalistic social planner maximizes the individual’s true utility taking into account the full health costs. The optimal tax turns out to be positive for an overweight individual and negative (subsidy) for an underweight individual. In both cases, the weight problem is mitigated at the intensive margin, i.e., the overweight (underweight) individual consumes less (more) calories and becomes less overweight (underweight). But the problem at the extensive margin remains. That means, the overweight remains overweight and the underweight remains underweight. Hence, the optimal paternalistic tax on unhealthy food does not give the individual the incentive to implement healthy weight. The reason is that the paternalistic tax corrects only for the self-control problem, but not for the rational motive for an unhealthy food consumption. In order to implement a diet that minimizes health costs and, thereby, maximizes health, we show that the tax on calorie intake just has to reflect the rational reason for an unhealthy diet, i.e. the net marginal utility of food consumption. However, such a health-maximizing tax leads to a stronger distortion (larger substitution effect) of the individual’s consumption decision than the optimal paternalistic tax. Hence, the individual’s true utility is lower under health maximization than under paternalistic welfare maximization. In addition, health-maximizing taxation may even be inferior to not taxing the individual at all. This result occurs if the individual’s self-control problem is not too pronounced. In our empirical calibration, we confirm these theoretical results and show that for the average US adult the welfare increase caused by the paternalistic tax amounts to a money equivalent of $2.16 per month, whereas the health-maximizing tax indeed lowers welfare by $3.35 per month. We finally extend the analysis to heterogeneous individuals and consider three types of consumers that may differ in the preferences for food consumption and the extent of the self-control problem. We show that the basic insights from the analysis of the representative individual carry over to each type of individual, if we focus on type-specific paternalistic taxation. Moreover, we investigate uniform calorie taxation and show that the optimal paternalistic tax rate reflects the weighted average of the individuals’ self-control problems. If the three consumer types represent the groups of over-, under- and healthy weight individuals and if overweight is more prevalent than underweight, then our theoretical analysis implies that the optimal paternalistic tax on calorie intake is positive and mitigates the weight problem of the overweights. But this comes at the costs of individuals with underweight and healthy weight, as they are also incentivized to reduce calorie intake and, thus, (further) deviate from a healthy diet. These insights are confirmed by the empirical calibration, where we show that uniform paternalistic calorie taxation increases welfare of the overweight by $3.82 per month, whereas the under- and normal weights lose $4.92 and $2.17 per month, respectively. Our paper links two important strands of the theoretical literature. First, there is a literature on paternalistic taxation of sin goods, for instance, O'Donoghue and Rabin (2003, 2006), Haavio and Kotakorpi (2011, 2016) and Cremer et al. (2012, 2016). In contrast to our analysis, all these studies assume monotonically increasing instead of U-shaped health costs. Hence, their approaches do not contain the distinction between extensive and intensive margin and cannot reveal the impact of taxation on these margins. Second, there is a literature on rational obesity, e.g., Levy (2002), Dragone (2009) and Dragone and Savorelli (2012). In contrast to our analysis, this literature ignores taxation and, thus, also cannot address the question whether healthy weight is obtained by a tax on unhealthy food consumption.Footnote 3 We combine both strands of literature by taking the issue of taxation in the presence of self-control problems from the first strand and the rational motive for weight problems from the second strand. By doing so, we are the first to investigate the implications of food taxation in the presence of extensive and intensive margins. The analysis builds on our earlier analysis in Kalamov and Runkel (2020), where we use a more general, fully dynamic model with different kinds of present-focused preferences in order to identify the distinction between extensive and intensive margins. But there we also ignore taxation issues and, thus, cannot derive the results obtained in the present paper. In the next section, we introduce the basic framework. Section 3 considers food taxation in the case of a representative individual, before we turn to the case with heterogeneous individuals in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",

The Japanese government quickly responded to the crisis by declaring a state of emergency in major metropolitan areas in early April 2020 and expanding the declaration to cover the entire country from mid-April until mid-May. Because of the emergency situation and out of the fear of infection risk, people’s mobility level plunged and physical economic activities came to a halt. Firms did not have ample time to adjust to the new operating environment. Some businesses that involve much social and physical interaction had no choice but to curtail, if not entirely suspend, normal operations. Even other businesses that do not necessarily involve much human interaction also had to contract, not only because shocks negatively affected demand for their products but also because employees were unable to commute to the workplace, especially in metropolitan areas where public transportation is essentially the only commuting option for many employees. This paper investigates how the sudden and massive reduction in people’s mobility affected firms’ activities during the COVID-19 crisis and whether firms’ adoption of work-from-home (WfH) arrangements helped them mitigate the negative impact on performance. The existing studies demonstrated the negative impact of COVID-19 on firms’ performance and how the feasibility of WfH mitigated the negative impacts (Bai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Alipour et al., 2021), but the individual firms’ behavior on the adoption of WfH during the pandemic and its effect on firms’ outcomes is largely unknown perhaps due to the lack of data that records the firms’ behavior and outcomes after the onset of COVID-19. To overcome the limitation, we use the original survey of several thousand Japanese firms conducted by the Tokyo Shoko Research (TSR) and Center for Research and Education in Program Evaluation (CREPE) of the University of Tokyo. The survey asks firms whether their employees worked from home before onset of the COVID-19 crisis in December 2019 and whether they adjusted the ratio of employees working from home during the crisis. The survey also collects information about firms’ activities, including sales, employment, and work hours during each month between February and September 2020. We find that a decline in mobility significantly reduced firms’ sales. Among our sample firms, sales declined by an average of 2.8% in response to a 10% drop in peoples’ mobility compared to the same month of the previous year. The negative impact of the pandemic on the sales does not propagate to the employment; a drop in the mobility does not reduce the employment in statistically significant ways. In contrast, a drop in mobility reduces the hours worked by an employee; a 10% drop in the mobility reduces the average hours worked by 2.1%. Ambiguous effects on employment at the extensive margin are consistent with a small change in unemployment observed during the COVID-19 crisis in Japan. They are likely to be attributable to government policies implemented during the crisis, including the employment adjustment subsidy and leave compensation, which encouraged firms to retain employees, as well as to Japan’s less flexible hiring and layoff practices than those of countries such as the U.S. In sum, the limited adjustment of employment at the extensive margin and moderate adjustment at the intensive margin is consistent with what has been found on the Japanese Economy in the literature. We also look at the heterogeneity of impacts of the pandemic across firm sizes and industries. The negative impacts were more significant among SMEs than among larger firms. Similarly, the impacts were more significant among firms in the industry that requires face-to-face contacts than the industries that do not require them. These heterogeneous impacts, however, are not precisely estimated. The adoption of WfH arrangement substantially mitigates the impact of the pandemic on sales. In the estimation of the mitigation effect of WfH, the challenge is to address the endogeneity of the WfH adoption. We are in particular concerned about the reverse causality that the firms severely hit by the pandemic, such as firms located in the urban center, are more likely to adopt the WfH setting. If this selection occurs based on the unobserved shock, the adoption of WfH seemingly amplifies the negative shock instead of mitigating it. To address this endogeneity problem, we employ two identification strategies. First, we use the adoption of WfH before the pandemic, namely as of December 2019. Second, we use the average adoption rate of WfH before the pandemic by industry–firm size as the instrumental variable to approximate the technical “remote workability” that presumably differs by industry and firm size. Among the firms that had previously implemented some remote work prior to the crisis, the negative impact of lower mobility on sales was mitigated by 55%. Similarly, the negative impact on hours worked was mitigated by 35%. We also find that firms which increased the number of employees working from home after the crisis were able to reduce the negative impact on sales, though quantitative effect was moderate. Overall, we find robust evidence that the adoption of WfH arrangement mitigated the negative impact of COVID-19 on firms’ sales. The adoption of WfH lessens the fiscal burden of the government through the reduction of the receipt of Employment Adjustment Subsidy, the short-time work subsidy scheme of Japan. Similar to some European countries, Japanese government has provided massive subsidies so that firms can hoard their employment; 68% of all the firms applied for the program by August 2021 and 4.2 trillion Japanese Yen, which is 0.8% of the Japan’s GDP, has been paid out from April 2020 to August 2021. Exploiting data on firms’ receipts of the Employment Adjustment Subsidy, we demonstrate that the reduction of the mobility increases the probability of applying for the subsidy. We find, however, that the adoption of WfH reduces the number of applications and mitigates the fiscal burden. We then quantify how much the adoption of WfH would reduce the government expenditures based on the estimated mitigation effect. Our conservative estimate shows that the fiscal burden would have been reduced by 2.5% if all the firms were to adopt a decent degree of the WfH arrangement (allowing 16% of all workers to work remotely). This simulation result suggests that subsidizing WfH and encouraging firms to offer flexible work arrangements could be beneficial from the public finance perspective. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related literature. Section 3 describes the survey data used in our analysis. Section 4 presents our estimated impact of COVID-19 on firms’ outcome, Sect. 5 presents the mitigation effect of remote work settings. Section 6 concludes.",2

These aims are vital within social transfer systems that impose high marginal taxes on low-income individuals. While in-work benefits are often implemented through tax credits, earnings disregards function within a social transfer system. They imply that benefits are withdrawn less than in a one-for-one ratio when a recipient starts to earn income. In 2002, a three-year experiment—nowadays a permanent policy—was introduced in Finland allowing for a monthly earned income disregard up to €100 for social assistance recipients. In 2005, the maximum amount was increased to €150. Before the reform, social assistance was reduced one-for-one when a recipient started to earn income. The reform is effectively equivalent to reduced tax rates, consequently leading to an increase in the effective wage rate. Standard economics theory would predict a higher labour supply for low-income individuals as a result of the reform. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the Finnish earnings disregard experiment using a quasi-experimental design. This evaluation is based on high-quality individual-level register data that cover the years 1995–2007. While many of the in-work benefit programs are targeted at specific demographic groups such as working families or single mothers, the Finnish experiment was targeted at all social assistance clients without additional eligibility conditions. The earnings disregard is evaluated as an event study. A difference-in-differences model is combined with coarsened exact matching and individual fixed effects. The control group is formed of means-tested labour market subsidy recipients. Labour market subsidy is meant for unemployed persons who enter the labour market for the first time or who have not worked long enough so that they are not entitled to earnings-related unemployment insurance. On average, the results show no employment effects, but there is some evidence of women’s positive employment response to the earnings disregard. This study is motivated by several factors. First, the maximum €150 monthly income increase can be significant for individuals living under the poverty line. Second, last resort-social assistance recipients are a substantial and policy-relevant group for their high rate of unemployment and social exclusion. For example in 2002, when the policy was introduced, 8.3% of the population received last resort social assistance. Last, quasi-experimental labour supply evidence related to making work pay policies is limited in Nordic countriesFootnote 1. This paper is organized in the following way. The next section introduces related literature and contributions. The third section describes the social security system in Finland and provides details on the experiment. The fourth section describes the empirical strategy and the data. The fifth section provides the results and discusses the sensitivity of the estimations, and the last section concludes.",

Parallel to experiencing since the 1990s the positive impact of Web-based technologies on labour productivity and on product variety, governments also recognize that the very nature of some of the underlying business models, particularly their intangible nature, often entails an erosion of revenues from indirect and corporate income taxation. Advocates for new ways to tax these companies argue that a tax on sales, a mechanism that reallocates taxing rights, or a mixture of the two, might help restoring a “fair” level of taxation as compared to the taxation of non-ICT companies. As some governments have proposed or introduced in recent years ad hoc taxes on the turnover these companies generate locally, it is imperative to gain a complete understanding of the economic consequences of these policies in order to inform policymakers and the general public of their likely effects and social costs. The contribution of this paper in particular is on the effects of an ad valorem tax on the sales of advertising by Web companies. The European Commission launched on 21 March 2018 an initiativeFootnote 1 with the aim to obtain a fairer allocation of tax rights in the digital market. The proposal came after several cases in which European and national tax authorities have forced some very large Web companies to pay taxes for liabilities supposedly due from past years. The debate on Web companies and their impact on tax revenues is not exclusive to Europe, though, see for instance the empirical works of (among others) Goolsbee (2000), Alm et al. (2005), Ballard et al. (2007) and Einav et al. (2014) documenting base erosion at the U.S. State level of sales tax revenues due to E-commerce. Such a kind of base erosion due to E-commerce may lead to non-trivial equilibria where tax rates are adjusted, too (Agrawal & Wildasin, 2020). The European Commission’s mentioned proposal envisaged a two-step approach, first a “targeted solution” introducing a tax on the sales from digital products and services (also named in the media Web Tax), then a more comprehensive approach which would be based on revised profit allocation of these multinationals across the Union and new rules reflecting digital presence according to the nexus principle. The focus of the present paper is about the Web Tax alone. The announced aim of the European Commission’s Web Tax is mainly twofold: to recover lost revenues from corporate income tax (in this respect, the Web Tax would act as a substitute for the corporate tax) and also, in the European Commission’s words, “to level the playing field” by reducing the tax-induced advantage of New Economy firms vis-a-vis traditional “brick-and-mortar” firms.Footnote 2 One reason why an indirect tax would be introduced as a substitute for direct taxation of profits can be traced back to the limitations that corporate tax systems face when dealing with intangible goods and assets, which facilitate transfer pricing and allow companies to sell to residents of a country or region without any physical presence there (the latter has been for a long time a prerequisite for the application of source taxation).Footnote 3 Some authors (e.g. Auerbach et al. (2008) and specifically for the digital markets, Agrawal and Fox (2017)) have endorsed the application of a destination-based principle to corporate taxation as a comprehensive solution to profit shifting which would apply to digital and non-digital markets. Although such proposal has many merits, in this author’s view a problem with it is that both the concepts of source and destination are hard to apply when dealing with advertising-supported digital services. Leading companies like Alphabet/Google and Meta/Facebook generate most of their revenues from selling advertising while providing their digital services for free. They are able to provide Web services in a country while selling advertising space in another country where the advertiser is resident. In such cases it is not straightforward to determine, least to measure, where the tax-wise destination of a transaction is located. The nexus principle as defined by OECD (2013) which advocates the use of input factors location as a proxy for the location of value generation is not fully applicable either, as production, the location of data, company servers and most of the company workforce might be in entirely different countries unrelated to the place where consumption occurs (thus, application of the nexus principle would de facto apply a source-based principle). Hence, the idea to try and capture corporate profits indirectly, by means of a Web Tax which would be levied on an imputed value of sales allocated to each European Member State where a Web multinational operates and provides services. Apart from the technical problems faced in applying such a Web Tax, its Welfare implications hinge on correctly gauging the incidence effects of the reform. I argue here that the nature of Web businesses providing digital services for free and selling ads to produce revenues, coupled with the very peculiar way in which these digital services match consumers with advertised content, may lead to very special conditions that make standard theory of tax incidence in oligopolistic competition regimes inapplicable. More specifically, the use of sophisticated matching algorithms based on consumers’ profiling imply that the larger the base of users is for a Web company, the more efficient the matching and, consequently, the larger the value-per-view (or per-click) for advertisers. As the total number of users served affects the willingness to pay of advertisers, it stands to reason that it implies an inverse demand function that is not necessarily monotonically decreasing in quantity. This intuition serves as the starting point for the theoretical analysis that follows. This paper contributes to the literature by providing an extension of standard Cournot-Nash models of tax incidence to a special case where firms operate on two-sided markets. In the model, although Web companies are assumed symmetrical and compete in the model with equal market power with respect to advertising services, they can enjoy monopolistic power in their own consumer’s market. Firms acquire, or generate, “contacts” by supplying a Web service for free to consumers. They produce revenues by selling some of these contacts to advertisers in the form of ad banners, and advertising on a Web platform is more valuable for advertisers, the larger its pool of contacts is. The model is then used to better understand what are the likely effects of a Web Tax on equilibrium price, ads sold and generated contacts. The policy contribution is twofold: to provide a theoretical framework which can be used to understand the likely Welfare costs, or gains, of the reform before factoring in tax revenues; and also to suggest where future empirical analysis should focus in order to quantify such costs. A major result I find is that, in the context of the model, adjustments to a new ad valorem tax on the side of acquired users of a Web service and on the side of sold ads move in opposite directions: Web companies may increase the quality of their service in order to gain more users, thus increasing the value ads have for advertisers and therefore increasing gross ads price which partly compensates for the tax; but, at the same time, Web companies may reduce the amount of sold ads. Based on the specific assumptions chosen for the model, the opposite may also hold true: Web companies might react to the tax by reducing investment and users, lowering gross ads price while increasing the amount of sold ads. The overall Welfare effects of such changes are not trivial and ask for more targeted empirical research to narrow down the analysis to specific demand functions and elasticities. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides motivation, in an informal way, for the idea that quantities produced and sold can differ for advertiser-supported Web services. It also provides support for the claim that larger users’ bases positively affect the reservation price of advertisers. Section 3 summarizes the related literature and contrasts it with the modelling choices taken in the next sections. Section 4 introduces a model of symmetric Cournot competition. Section 5 derives policy-relevant results for an ad valorem tax. Section 6 finally draws the main conclusions and points to further avenues for future research.",

This has led to calls for housing subsidies, and to the introduction of numerous measures aiming to reduce housing costs. Among others, recent years have seen the introduction of rent control, of a temporary accelerated depreciation schedule for the construction of residential units, and of subsidies for the acquisition of property by owner-occupiers. While many previous initiatives to make housing more affordable targeted renters and poorer households, increasing attention has lately been devoted to the costs of acquiring real estate. Both the German federal and the Bavarian state government implemented housing purchase subsidies in 2018, aiming to reduce purchase costs for owner-occupiers. These subsidies apply to both existing and newly constructed properties, with the Bavarian subsidy paid on top of the national subsidy. Although intended to foster homeownership and to make the acquisition of property more affordable, in particular for families, housing subsidies may well exert adverse effects by driving up real estate prices. This would especially be the case if housing demand is driven up by the subsidy scheme while housing supply is rather inelastic. According to claims by the federal government, the federal subsidy is unlikely to lead to large windfall gains, and the government claims to perceive a lack of evidence on price effects of housing purchase subsidies (Deutscher Bundestag 2019). However, several features of the subsidy design speak in favor of potentially large price effects. First, due to generous income thresholds, roughly three quarters of German families with minor children—and in the case of Bavaria three quarters of households regardless of family structure—would be eligible for subsidies when buying a property. Second, federal subsidy provisions were set to expire in 2020Footnote 1. This could in turn further stimulate housing demand between 2018 and 2020. With the German construction sector operating at its capacity limits (Gornig et al. 2019), housing supply is, however, rather inelastic. As the application window for the federal scheme is confined to three years, incentives for the construction sector to expand and develop additional capacity are limited. Contrary to claims by the government, one could thus expect a considerable pass-through into prices. Against this background, this paper investigates to which degree direct housing subsidies are capitalized into home prices. My study is the first to assess the price effects of direct housing purchase subsidies that are not intended as a stimulus measure. For this purpose, I exploit that Bavaria, Germany’s second largest federal state by population, introduced a much more extensive subsidy scheme than the federal scheme available in all states, with both broader eligibility criteria and higher benefits for Bavarian residents. I use this policy discontinuity at the Bavarian interstate border to assess the effect of subsidies on home prices in a difference-in-difference setting at the border, using a rich micro-dataset on German house prices. My findings indicate that in the second half of 2018, single-family home prices increased by roughly 10,000 euros more in Bavarian border regions than in neighboring regions of other states. These results are consistent with a full shifting of subsidies into the prices of single-family homes. In contrast, no effect can be observed for apartments. This is likely due to apartments seldom being bought by owner-occupiers who could claim the subsidy. Splitting the sample into houses with a comparatively high or low subsidization probability also points to heterogeneous effects: price effects tend to be larger in sectors of the real estate market with a larger exposure to the subsidy scheme. I also provide suggestive evidence that the subsidy scheme slightly stimulated construction activity of single-family houses, while possibly leading to a partial crowding-out of the construction of apartment buildings. Providing a clean identification of subsidy effects, my findings provide an important contribution to both the literature and the current policy debate at a time at which the affordability of housing is considered a key policy issue in many countries. Evidence on housing purchase subsidies in other countries also suggests a significant capitalization into real estate prices.Footnote 2 While the German and Bavarian schemes grant flat-rate direct subsidies, other countries tend to subsidize the purchase of real estate through the tax code by granting mortgage interest deductions. Generally, most empirical evidence indicates that such tax subsidies do not increase the homeownership rate and are passed-through into property prices (see Bourassa et al. 2013 for a survey). In a general equilibrium model of the US housing market, Sommer and Sullivan (2018) show that eliminating the mortgage interest deduction would result in declining property prices, increasing homeownership and improved welfare. Hilber and Turner (2014) point out that a subsidy’s effects on homeownership decisions and house prices depend on the elasticity of the housing supply: Homeownership only rises in areas with lax land-use regulations, whereas subsidies are capitalized into home prices in tightly regulated, rather inelastic housing markets. This house price effect might even result in an adverse effect on homeownership. Davis (2018) exploits the variation of US state-level tax legislation to assess capitalization effects of mortgage interest deductions on houses on both sides of the state border. His results indicate strong capitalization effects, with a one percentage point increase in the tax rate applied to mortgage interest leading to a 0.8 percent increase in house prices. Similarly, Berger et al. (2000) show a full capitalization of after-tax interest rate subsidies in Sweden. Using a Danish tax reform with a differential effect on mortgage interest deductions across tax brackets, Gruber et al. (2020) estimate long-term effects of housing tax subsidies. Their findings indicate zero effect on homeownership, but a sizable effect at the intensive margin as well as suggestive evidence that tax subsidies are capitalized into house prices. The institutional setup of a mortgage interest subsidy considerably differs from the German subsidy schemes, though. While the latter grant flat-rate direct subsidies to households below an income threshold, the size of a mortgage interest subsidy depends on both the price of a property and individual marginal tax rates. Due to the interaction between tax progressivity and the mortgage interest subsidy, high-income households with high marginal tax rates benefit the most from these subsidies. Evidence on direct subsidies is much more scarce. Also, in contrast to the German setting, governments tend to resort to direct subsidy programs as a stimulus when the economy is weak. In the wake of the financial crisis, the USA introduced a homebuyer tax credit to counter dropping demand in the housing market (Dynan et al. 2013). While first designed with a repayment requirement, the tax credit was granted as a subsidy in 2009 and 2010. In 2009, first-time homebuyers up to a certain income threshold were eligible for a refundable tax credit of 10 percent of the purchase price, capped at 8,000 USD. For most claimants, this is equivalent to a flat-rate subsidy, as in the Bavarian case. In a general equilibrium model, Floetotto et al. (2016) show that such homebuyer tax credits temporarily increase home prices and transaction volumes, but lead to negative welfare effects. Dynan et al. (2013) exploit regional variation in housing markets, finding only a small and temporary effect on sales. However, as credits were available throughout the country and the housing market underwent rapid changes, identifying a control group for an empirical analysis on prices is difficult. Similarly, the UK subsidizes the acquisition of newly built homes below a certain property value with an equity loan for up to 20% (40% for London) of the property value. Exploiting spatial discontinuities in the scope of the scheme, Carozzi et al. (2020) find strong capitalization effects in the supply-constrained London area, the size of which suggests an overcapitalization, but no effect on construction. In a region with rather elastic supply, the subsidy is instead shown to stimulate construction. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the subsidy schemes implemented in 2018. Section 3 describes the data sources used in my analysis. In Sect. 4, I subsequently present my methodological approach. This encompasses a description of the border difference-in-difference design and of the analysis of geodata. Results are presented in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes.",3
30.0,1.0,International Tax and Public Finance,14 July 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-022-09742-0,Measuring the unobservable: estimating informal economy by a structural equation modeling approach,February 2023,Roberto Dell’Anno,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Measuring the Informal Economy (IE) is important for economics because statistics on the IE allow for decomposing economic growth into formal and informal sources, which may be important when formulating counter-cyclical and structural policies (Quiros-Romero et al., 2021). IE influences economic performance through several channels and has relevant repercussions on many aspects of the economic and social life of a country. On the one hand, it reduces efficiency in goods and labor markets, worsens economic and social institutions, decreases tax revenue, reduces potential worthwhile public expenditure on infrastructures, education, research, health. On the other hand, it creates an extra value-added that can be spent on the official economy and, mainly for less developed economies or countries with a high unemployment rate, it often represents a social buffer and a source of job opportunities for low-skilled workers and poor. The size of the IE also affects society indirectly. For instance, de Soto (1989) sees informal activities as efficient market forces that emerge as a reaction to over-regulation and government oppression (Biles, 2009). For this reason, IE may be seen as a “signal” for policymakers of overburden in regulation, taxation, and other government-induced distortions. According to these multifaceted effects of informality on economic growth and income distribution, knowledge of the size of the IE is not only an econometrician task but an important topic for economics. In general, it is possible to identify three main topics in the literature on the IEFootnote 1: a definitional issue (i.e. what is “informal”), a measurement issue (i.e. “how” to estimate its size), and a theoretical explanation of the “informality”. In this paper, we focus on the measurement issue and, specifically, on one of the most applied and controversial estimation methods: the Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes (MIMIC) or Model approach. The OECD (2002) distinguishes two principal approaches to estimate the Non-Observed Economy (NOE)Footnote 2: the econometric methods and the National Accounting Approach (NA) to estimate the NOE. The former can be furtherly split into three strands. The “direct methods” are based on direct information regarding informal activities collected by (a) tax returns or administrative data; (b) questionnaire surveys; (c) experimental data. The “indirect methods” estimate the size of the IE by measuring the “traces” that it leaves in official macroeconomic data. This strategy includes: (a) the discrepancies methods (e.g. discrepancy between national expenditure and income statistics, or between the official and actual statistics of the labor force); (b) monetary methods, e.g. currency demand approach, physical input method. The third method is based on the statistical approach of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and follows the pioneering work of Frey and Weck-Hanneman (1984). It consists in applying a particular model specification of the SEM: the MIMIC model. According to this method, the IE is considered as an ‘unobserved’ (latent) variable that affects multiple observable indicators and is affected by multiple observable causes. First of all, it is important to clear the field from misunderstandings and futile competitions between NA and “econometric” approaches on the reliability of the estimates of the IE. It is unambiguous that the NA is the most reliable method to measure the IE. We believe that quality data lead to quality inferences and that no statistical method turns bad data into good data. National statistical offices have more resources, extensive and better data (e.g. microdata collected by ad-hoc surveys, exclusive access to administrative and confidential data collected by public administrations) than the scholars who usually apply econometric approaches. Due to this, the estimates of the NOE provided by statistical offices are the best source to know the size of the IE. Nevertheless, there are some shortcomings and limits that still suggest to estimate, and analyze, the IE also by using the econometric approaches: (1) the estimates based on the NA are usually published with a significant time lag and short time dimension; (2) the national offices of statistics have different resources (e.g. know-how, data available) and attention (e.g. due to political pressure, institutional factors) to estimate the NOE, and this affects both the degree of coverage of the different types of the NOE and the reliability of the estimates across countries and over time. Accordingly, estimates of the IE based on NA are often internationally and intertemporally incomparable; (3) Disaggregated data on the IE are usually unavailable for scholars outside national institutes of statistics; (4) the process of estimation applied to adjust official statistics for the presence of the NOE are not submitted to external peer review system and not replicable. It means that, according to the standard method for research validation, NOE estimates are in some way nontransparent. These shortcomings make NA estimates problematic for economic purposes and cannot be considered as a perfect substitute for econometric estimates of the IE. For that reason, exploring the other estimation methods should be considered as a valuable aim for economic research. As we explain in the following sections, the NA and the MIMIC “econometric” approach can be used as complementary methodologies to predict IE. Specifically, on the one hand, the MIMIC approach requires calibrating the estimates by (at least two) exogenous values of the IE and the best candidates for this are the NA estimates of the Underground Economy. On the other hand, NA may benefit from the MIMIC method to predict the IE, in some sectors or periods where NA estimates are not available. This paper makes a number of contributions. First, we present the MIMIC model as a special case of a SEM and introduce in this literature the Partial Least Square (PLS) estimator of SEM as an alternative algorithm to the standard (i.e. Covariance-Based estimator, hereafter CB) approach to estimate a MIMIC model. Second, given that one of the critiques against the MIMIC approach is related to the lack of transparency in exposition and replicability (e.g. Breusch, 2016; Feige, 2016), we describe, step by step, how to estimate the IE and specify a CB-MIMIC model in order to apply the PLS estimator. Third, we propose three (complementary) methods to convert the latent variable scores into a time-series with a “real” unit of measure (e.g. IE as a share of official GDP or as monetary value). Fourth, given that the most important constraint to assess methods to estimate IE is due to the impossibility to compare predicted and actual (non-observable) values of the IE, we elude this obstacle, by assessing the reliability of the MIMIC approach by a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The MC analysis has been set to simulate “realistic” values and, by following Andrew et al. (2020) suggestions to improve transparency in structural research, we focus on the issue of the identification, in robustness of results under several alternative assumptions and under which circumstances SEM approach reverse the predicted trend of the IE. For these reasons, our findings may provide practical guidelines to apply the SEM approach in this field of research. Fifth, we test if MC findings hold also in analyses of real-world phenomena, namely, by estimating the Italian IE from 1995 to 2020. The paper ends with some general conclusions on the reliability and limitations of the SEM approach.",3

Turnbull,Mitsuru Ota,Male,Male,Male,Male,"An environmental offset is a voluntary effort by an economic agent to compensate for a decrease in environmental quality due to irreversible emissions discharged by his economic activities through his own contributions to improvement in environmental quality. From a theoretical point of view, environmental offsets can be regarded as voluntary contributions to public good provision in the presence of environmental externalities. The problem of voluntary provision of offsets has been considered by Yoshida (1998), Shibata (1998), Ihori (1999), Vicary (2000), and Kotchen (2009).Footnote 1 Shibata (1998) studied this problem in a model with production externalities on the environment.Footnote 2 However, the other researchers examined the problem in partial equilibrium models or general equilibrium models of perfect competition with consumption externalities, where the polluting consumption goods are homogeneous ones supplied by dirty providers without market power. Recently, Yoshida and Turnbull (2021) have reconsidered the problem of voluntary provision of offsets in a general equilibrium model of monopolistic competition, where environmental degradation is caused by individuals’ consumption of differentiated goods produced by monopolistic firms with market power.Footnote 3 They have explored how an increase in the population size affects environmental quality, offsets, and net contributions, and have shown that while the comparative static results depend on the specification of the utility function, the offsets are independent of this specification in a large economy with many individuals and “carbon neutrality” holds: net contributions are zero. Will the same results hold when environmental degradation is caused by production externalities? The purpose of this paper is to examine this problem in a monopolistically competitive model similar to the Yoshida-Turnbull model. Shibata (1998) assumes that an income-earning activity of each individual causes environmental degradation but he can use two methods to offset the degradation. The first is to reduce his earning activity by increasing leisure which is a non-polluting activity. The second is to expend income on purchase of an environmental good and his own abatement activity. The effectiveness of these methods depends on whether labor supply is institutionally constrained or not. When labor supply is constrained, offsets via leisure and the abatement activity are not available, because pollutants have been already emitted in the environment. Thus, the only effective method is to buy the environmental good. On the other hand, when labor is not constrained, the method of purchasing the environmental good is inefficient compared to increasing leisure or the abatement activity, because the marginal cost of removing a unit of pollutant already emitted is larger than that of reducing emission of a unit of pollutant. Since the abatement activity has no positive utility, it is inferior to leisure. Therefore, the only efficient method is to adjust the scale of earning activity by leisure. Such individual reductions in productive activity to achieve social goals have come into prominence during the COVID pandemic recently as businesses, consumers, and workers have been asked to reduce activities that involve gathering in high-density space such as offices. One response to that is remote work, which managements complain makes supervision harder and leads to decreased productivity. We note that remote work has been recommended for decades as an environmentally friendly alternative to commuting as well. We follow the Shibata (1998) model of income-earning activity and introduce imperfection competition in the consumption good industry, while the environmental good is produced under perfect competition. We conduct the analysis based on the Yoshida-Turnbull (2021) social demand and supply approach giving environmental quality as functions of the number of monopolistically competitive firms. The social demand function is derived from individuals’ demand functions for environmental quality and the social supply function shows the feasible level of environmental quality. Environmental quality and the number of the firms which simultaneously satisfy the social demand and supply functions are their equilibrium levels. In order to examine the existence and uniqueness of an interior equilibrium, where offsets are positive, we specify the utility function consisting of environmental quality and differentiated goods as follows: (i) the CES utility function, which includes the Cobb-Douglas (CD) utility function, (ii) the Krugman (1980)-Pecorino (2009) (KP) utility function, and (iii) the Krugman (1981)-Mondal (2013) (KM) utility function. After demonstrating that for each utility function, there is a unique equilibrium solution such that environmental quality and the number of the firms are positive, we examine the comparative static effects of the population size on the environmental variables: environmental quality, offsets, and net contributions, and compare the results with those in the Yoshida-Turnbull model with consumption externalities. We show that the comparative static analysis of the population size with production externalities is different from the analysis with consumption externalities. Irrespective of the level of environmental externalities, an increase in the population size decreases the social demand for environmental quality. However, the effect on the social supply depends on the type of externalities. With production externalities, when labor supply is endogenous (exogenous), since pollutants emitted are perfectly (imperfectly) cancelled by an increase in the aggregate offset, the increase in the population size does not affect (decreases) the social supply of environmental quality. Thus, environmental quality is decreasing in the population size, but offsets and net contributions are increasing in it. These results are independent of the specification of the utility function. On the other hand, with consumption externalities, the results are affected by this specification. In the KP case, since the equilibrium level of environmental quality is determined by the social demand function, it is decreasing in the population size. However, in the CES and KM cases, an increase in the population size increases the social supply of environmental quality. Thus, if the equilibrium level of environmental quality is greater (smaller) than its ambient level, then environmental quality is increasing (decreasing) in the population size. We further explore what characteristics the environmental variables have in a large economy with many individuals. We show that with production externalities, as the population size increases, environmental quality monotonically decreases and converges to zero. However, since offsets monotonically increase and converge to the degradation rate of environmental quality, the carbon neutrality theorem holds: net contributions are zero in the large economy. On the other hand, with consumption externalities, the neutrality theorem holds, but characteristics of environmental quality and offsets are different: environmental quality depends on the specification of the utility function and offsets are affected by not only the degradation rate but also the marginal cost of monopolistic production and the substitution elasticity between differentiated goods. We also analyze the comparative statics of the degradation rate of environmental quality. In the interesting case where labor supply is not constrained, since an increase in this parameter increases the price of the composite good consisting of differentiated goods, the social demand for environmental quality increases. However, since the social supply decreases with a reduction in the aggregate offset, the results depend on the specification of the utility function: (a) in the CD and KM cases, offsets are increasing in the degradation rate but environmental quality and net contributions are independent of it, (b) in the CES case, (i) if environmental quality and the composite good are gross substitutes, then all environmental variables are increasing in the degradation rate and (ii) if they are gross complements, then environmental quality and net contributions are decreasing in the degradation rate, and (c) in the KP case, the result is the same as (i) in the CES case. These comparative static results are the same as those in the Yoshida-Turnbull model. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops a model of environmental offsets with production externalities. Section 3 characterizes an equilibrium solution and specifies several utility functions. Section 4 analyzes the comparative statics of some parameters. Section 5 summarizes the comparative static results with consumption externalities and compares them with those with production externalities. Section 6 contains some concluding remarks.",

Dashkeev,Stephen J. Turnovsky,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The federalism structure of the United States grants a substantial degree of fiscal sovereignty to its constituent member states. As a result of this, it is characterized by substantial heterogeneity both on the revenue collection side, as well as in terms of the intergovernmental separation of expenditure functions. With respect to revenue collection, two sources of heterogeneity stand out: (i) the asymmetry of the tax systems adopted by individual state governments, and (ii) their degree of flexibility (or rigidity) with respect to requiring a balanced budget. If one considers the three largest revenue-generating taxes in the U.S.A (labor income tax, capital income tax, and consumption tax), one will observe that of the five largest states, as measured by output, three (California, New York, and Illinois) collect most of their tax revenues from taxes on labor and capital income, while two (Texas and Florida) collect most of their revenues by taxing consumption. In some cases, neighboring states adopt polar-opposite tax systems. For example, Oregon does not collect a sales tax, while Washington State does not impose income taxes. At the national level, 59% of the U.S. GDP is produced by states that have a tax system biased in favor of labor and capital income taxes. States in which the composition of tax revenue is tilted toward the consumption tax, rather than toward income taxes, generate 23% of the national output.Footnote 1 This diversity is illustrated in Fig. 1.Footnote 2 Source: U.S. Census Bureau (2014), data for FY 2013. Note: This classification accounts for labor income taxes, capital income taxes, and consumption taxes, i.e. it ignores property taxes, excise taxes, severance taxes, stock transfer taxes, estate and gift taxes, and other miscellaneous taxes Tax systems in the continental U.S. states The second type of heterogeneous regional fiscal policy pertains to the range of public borrowing limits imposed across the U.S. states. To enable the analysis of these balanced-budget rules, states have typically been classified into one of the following two categories: (i) states having strict balanced-budget rules, and (ii) those with more flexible rules. This dichotomy is based on the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations index, ACIR (1987), which takes into account characteristics of the rules in each state.Footnote 3 According to the accepted taxonomy in the fiscal-federalism literature, states having an ACIR index between 7 and 10 are classified as having strict borrowing rules, while those with an index between 0 and 6 have more flexible rules. The latter group consists of 13, mostly large, states (Fig. 2). Cumulatively, these states having less stringent balanced-budget rules produce 46.2% of the U.S. GDP. As discussed below, the states’ balanced-budget rules have real effects on the states’ fiscal policies, especially their stabilization policies over business cycles. Source: ACIR (1987). Note: The yellow (lighter) color represents states with less stringent balanced-budget rules and corresponds to the ACIR index value of 6 and below. The green (darker) color represents states with strict balanced-budget rules and corresponds to the ACIR index value of 7 and above. The breakpoint value between the two types of the states is borrowed from the fiscal federalism literature (Color figure online) Balanced-budget rules in the continental U.S. states. On the expenditure side, the intergovernmental asymmetry of the provision of public goods in the U.S.A is another distinguishing feature of its fiscal structure. About two-thirds of public consumption goods are provided by the federal government, while approximately three-fourths of productive public goods are supplied by its regional authorities. One can conclude from Table 1 that expenditure categories such as national defense, and parks and recreation, are characterized as public consumption goods, since they increase the utility of households. Economic affairs (infrastructure and utilities) and education increase the productivity of private factors, and hence are referred to as productive public goods. In a recent paper, Dashkeev and Turnovsky (2018) analyze the welfare and risk-sharing characteristics of heterogeneous fiscal policy in a federal system, by comparing the performance of an economy in which regional governments are subject to differential borrowing limits, but with both regions imposing a consumption tax. However, with the larger share of tax revenues at the state level in fact being raised by income taxes, it is clearly important to allow for alternative sources of tax revenue collection by the constituent members of the union. Extending the framework in this way enables us to analyze the welfare and risk-sharing implications of diverse regional tax structures, and to compare them with the implications of the nature of the public borrowing constraint. The fiscal union we consider comprises two regions. Aside from their fiscal characteristics, the regional economies are identical (in terms of their size, technology, and preferences). In equilibrium, both regions collect the same amount of tax revenues and provide an identical quantity of public capital. One regional government taxes consumption, while the other taxes labor income, in both cases of their respective constituents. Initially, we assume that both governments refrain from borrowing, allowing us to focus on the implications of the design of regional tax systems. But later the constraints on public borrowing are relaxed, and in fact the flexibility of the borrowing constraints turns out to be critical in our assessment of the merits of the various schemes.Footnote 4 The framework serves the following objectives: (i) to analyze how the federal-state tax structure affects the transmission of productivity shocks across the union, (ii) to study the implications of the heterogeneous tax system in the union for welfare and interregional consumption risk-sharing, and (iii) to compare these consequences of the tax system, with the corresponding consequences of alternative limits on public borrowing by states. We should note that the identification of the welfare-maximizing design of the union tax system should be interpreted as a constrained-optimal, rather than a Ramsey-optimal, policy. This is because we restrict the choice of tax instruments to be between the consumption tax and the labor income tax, as well as the magnitudes of their respective tax rates, as required to maintain tax-revenue neutrality. Our analysis of the transmission mechanism shows that the asymmetric tax systems generate differential resource allocations across the union in the wake of an adverse economy-wide productivity shock, as well as a deterioration of risk-sharing in the fiscal union. This result hinges on both the revenue and the expenditure actions of the regional governments. On the revenue side, a region experiences a smaller reduction in tax revenues following the realization of a negative productivity shock if it imposes a consumption tax, rather than if it taxes labor income. This is due to the representative household’s consumption-smoothing motive that ensures the regional government’s tax-revenue smoothing. From the standpoint of public expenditures, the region in which the government collects more tax revenues can finance a greater supply of region-specific productive public goods, thereby enhancing the productivity of its capital and labor. These two aspects of regional public finance cause a shift of resources from the less productive region to the more productive one, that is, from the region that taxes labor income to the region that taxes consumption. This migration of resources amplifies the interregional productivity differential, creating a wider consumption gap between the regions, which in addition deteriorates interregional consumption risk-sharing. In the context of the desirability of the inward shift of resources, this asymmetric design of the regional tax systems can be interpreted as regional tax competition. Estimates of the productivity of public capital vary substantially; see Bom and Ligthart (2014). To allow for this variation and the associated uncertainty, we consider how the degree of risk-sharing varies with the productivity of public capital. We find that as the productivity of public capital increases, the differential impacts across the tax jurisdictions are amplified, and the adverse effects on risk-sharing are exacerbated. To identify further the characteristic of the union tax system that improves both welfare and risk-sharing, we allow for two alternative regional tax structures and expose them to one-time productivity shocks. In the first tax regime both regions collect consumption taxes; in the second, they collect labor income taxes only. Two conclusions emerge. First, we find that the adoption of any symmetric tax system eliminates fiscal externalities and improves interregional consumption risk-sharing. Second, we show that the productivity of public capital is the key factor determining the specific type of welfare-maximizing tax system. If the productivity of public capital is sufficiently high, the cost of business cycles to the union declines if its members tax consumption. However, if the productivity is sufficiently low, taxing labor income reduces the welfare cost to the union. Other aspects of the economy, such as the type of technology transmission process, or the type of shock (whether it is economy-wide or regional-specific), do not affect the tax system design. Moreover, in a fiscal union with very low, or low, public good productivity, the risk-sharing improvement is negligibly small. Finally, we explore the welfare and risk-sharing properties of two types of fiscal unions: (i) one in which regional governments choose the nature of the tax to impose on their constituents and (ii) an alternative in which policymakers design public borrowing limits. Our findings indicate that for both interregional risk-sharing and the welfare costs of business cycles the public borrowing constraints imposed by regional policymakers are more important than is their choice of a tax system. This is because in the former case the asymmetric public borrowing limit arrangement is more detrimental to risk-sharing than is the asymmetric tax system. In the latter case, for asymmetric fiscal unions, the welfare-maximizing borrowing limit design can reduce the cost of business cycles to a greater extent than can the design of the welfare-maximizing tax system. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses related literature, while the following section describes the analytical environment and equilibrium conditions. The calibration underlying the numerical simulations is summarized in Sect. 4. Section 5 analyzes the effects of a temporary, adverse, productivity shock on regional performance. In addition, to gain further insights into the macroeconomic dynamics in the union, alternative degrees of public good productivity are considered. Section 6 explores in detail the welfare and interregional consumption risk-sharing properties of two types of fiscal unions: (i) a fiscal union in which regional governments choose the type of tax to impose on local households, and (ii) a fiscal union in which policymakers impose public borrowing limits. Section 7 concludes while technical details are relegated to the Appendix. Appendix 1 presents a derivation of the equation for net regional asset accumulation, Appendix 2 summarizes the equilibrium conditions of the model, and Appendix 3 contains some results derived under alternative assumptions regarding the specification of technology.",

Examples are the US “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” of 2017, which implemented the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) rule, or discussions on a supranational level, such as the “Base Erosion and Profit Shifting” (BEPS) project of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (OECD 2016) or the Anti Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) of the European Union (EU) (European Council 2016).Footnote 2 The ATAD, for example, mandates all EU Member States to implement certain anti-tax avoidance measures and several lobby groups as well as countries claim that these measures will lead to competitive disadvantages of MNEs.Footnote 3 Indeed, empirical studies such as Altshuler and Hubbard (2003) or Ruf and Weichenrieder (2012) show that one ATAD measure—controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules—lead to less profit shifting behavior within MNEs. In this study, we investigate whether CFC rules impose competitive disadvantages on MNEs in the global M&A market and thereby affect corporate ownership structures. Understanding if and how taxes affect the market for corporate control should be in the interest of tax policy makers and several studies have already investigated this question. For example, the study of Feld et al. (2016) shows that acquirers under a worldwide tax system have a competitive disadvantage in bidding for foreign targets compared to acquirers who are not taxed on foreign income. Furthering this line of investigation, Bird et al. (2017) show that US-based acquirers—who were taxed on their worldwide income at that time—bidding for US targets are losing out to foreign acquirers who are tax-favored. Huizinga and Voget (2009) find that the prospect of higher international double taxation of foreign dividends decreases the probability of attracting parent firms in a cross-border M&A.Footnote 4 Some empirical studies analyze the effects of CFC rules on firm behavior. Voget (2011) finds that the presence of CFC rules increases the likelihood of headquarters relocation. Altshuler and Hubbard (2003) show that tightening US CFC rules in 1986 has substantially reduced tax planning opportunities with financial services firms in low-tax countries. Ruf and Weichenrieder (2013) and Schenkelberg (2019) provide evidence that a mandatory loosening to CFC rules in all EU Member States in 2006 increased profit shifting within the EU. For German MNEs, Ruf and Weichenrieder (2012) detect that CFC rules are effective in reducing passive investments in low-tax countries. The studies of Prettl (2018) and Clifford (2019) show that CFC rules lead to less tax-motivated profit shifting within MNEs regarding greenfield investment. These studies suggest that CFC rules reach the intended goal of reducing profit shifting to low-tax subsidiaries. However, Egger and Wamser (2015) find that subsidiaries of German MNEs, who are subject to CFC rules, show significantly lower fixed assets. They conclude that CFC rules lead to an increase in cost of capital if subsidiaries are subject to CFC rules. Hence, by also influencing real business activity abroad, CFC rules lead to non-intended “real business” effects. In this study, we aim to answer the open question whether CFC rules affect cross-border M&A activity. This question is of interest because an MNE can engage in tax avoidance, or extend its existing tax avoidance strategies, by acquiring a target in a low-tax country;Footnote 5 however, CFC rules counteract these strategies by potential immediate taxation of this target’s profit in the acquirer’s country.Footnote 6 Consequently, MNEs with parents in non-CFC rule countries may calculate higher reservation prices for low-tax targets than MNEs with parents in CFC rule countries, because these targets could be used as valuable profit shifting vehicles within non-CFC rule MNEs. CFC rule MNEs, on the other side, have to account for potential CFC rule application on low-tax targets’ income, which decreases after-tax cash flows. Based on this argumentation, the parallel presence and non-presence as well as different characteristics of CFC rules could distort the global market for corporate control and target location decisions of MNEs. Lobbyists even claim these distortions severely influence cross-border M&A, leading to competitive disadvantages for MNEs headquartered in CFC rule countries.Footnote 7 To investigate the influence of CFC rules on the global market of corporate control, we apply various multinomial choice models on a global M&A data set with more than 14,000 observations for the period 2002 to 2014. As our identification strategy, we use variation in low-tax rate thresholds of CFC rules and in statutory corporate income tax rates (STR), which vary over time and between countries. We find that the probability of acquiring a low-tax target is negatively influenced by potential CFC rule application on this target’s income. We show this result from two opposite perspectives in two distinguished data sets: First, from an acquirer country perspective by addressing the question whether CFC rules affect the outcome of which potential acquirer will finally buy a specific target. Second from a target country perspective by addressing the question whether CFC rules affect the outcome of which potential target will finally be bought by a specific acquirer. We find that the economic magnitude of this effect is rather small: A ten percentage-point increase in additional CFC rule taxation leads to a 0.5% lower likelihood that an acquisition takes place. In additional analyses, we show that the effect in the acquirer perspective becomes insignificant over time, which may be due to coordination efforts in supranational organizations resulting in a convergence of CFC rules worldwide. Another potential reason might be that countries implementing CFC rules later in time do so rather due to outside pressure and not due to self-motivation, which could lead to lower law enforcement in these countries for these specific regulations. However, in the target perspective, the effect remains significant, which may indicate that one intended effect of CFC rules (not buying low-tax targets for profit shifting) remains. Our study contributes to tax research as well as economic considerations in three ways. First, we contribute to empirical tax research on the effects of anti-tax avoidance measures on firm behavior, where little research has been undertaken so far. As Egger and Wamser (2015) point out, the reason why there are only a few empirical studies on CFC rules may be due to the difficulty of identifying the effect of anti-tax avoidance measures on MNEs that operate in multiple jurisdictions and avail complex group interrelations. To overcome these identification difficulties, we investigate the effect of CFC rules on the decision to integrate foreign firms into an MNE, which can be clearly identified via observed cross-border M&A. Moreover, we leverage the examined details of each country’s CFC rules by considering individual components of these rules such as low-tax rate thresholds and passive-to-active-income ratio thresholds. Second, we contribute to empirical research in the field of M&A and their tax-related determinants. Indeed, there are many empirical studies on the effect of tax regulations on M&A from various perspectives, for example, repatriation taxes (Hanlon et al. 2015; Edwards et al. 2016; Feld et al. 2016; Bird et al. 2017), international double taxation (Huizinga and Voget 2009; Huizinga et al. 2012; von Hagen and Pönnighaus 2017) or capital gains taxation (Ayers et al. 2003, 2007; Todtenhaupt et al. 2020; Huizinga et al. 2018). However, besides Voget (2011), our study is the first one that compares the effect of the increasingly important CFC rule on cross-border M&A activity.Footnote 8 Third, understanding how CFC rules distort the global market of corporate control is also of interest from an economic perspective, as cross-border M&A accounted globally for around 500 billion USD or 37% of global FDI (UNCTAD 2020). These numbers show that M&A are almost as important as greenfield investment, the other prominent form of FDI. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines our empirical approach and Sect. 3 describes our data set. Section 4 provides our analysis of the CFC rule effect on the acquisition of low-tax targets. Finally, Sect. 5 sets forth our conclusions.",1

Observable fiscal outcomes are shaped by many factors such as past policy decisions, the business cycle, financial market conditions, and the institutional, political, and economic environment. All at the same time, these factors might be endogenous themselves to fiscal policy. Even though there is a voluminous academic literature on the drivers of fiscal policy (for recent overviews see, e.g., Alesina & Passalacqua, 2016; Yared, 2019), it remains notoriously difficult to disentangle the impact of such factors from underlying incentives and preferences of decision-makers. The ideal experimental setup would consist of exogenously and temporarily shifting the budget constraint of a jurisdiction for one fiscal period and observing the induced fiscal response (if any). Taking a balanced budget as a starting point, unexpected higher revenues (or lower expenditures) result in a surplus, while unexpected lower revenues (or higher expenditures) result in a deficit, ceteris paribus. The budget consists of a predetermined part (e.g., entitlement spending, investment spending, interest payments, depreciations, etc.), which cannot be easily adjusted in the short and medium term, and of a discretionary part (e.g., personnel expenditures, operative expenditures, subsidies, etc.), which is allocated contemporaneously through a complex political bargaining process among the relevant interests within the institutional setup. Thus, any active policy response to a temporary relaxation of the budget constraint in the short run must come from the discretionary part of the budget. Large fiscal fluctuations—especially unexpected shocks—create opportunities and the potential justifications for decision-makers to use their political leeway to deviate from the ex ante budgeted resource allocation in the discretionary part of the budget. We aim to exploit such unexpected and large short-term variations in the tightness of the budget constraint and analyze the fiscal response triggered by it. In order to credibly separate such reactions from larger macro-economic or monetary and fiscal policy dynamics, we focus at the local (instead of the regional or national) level and on revenues from a property transaction tax which is not tightly linked to macro-effects and to the usual tax bases such as income and profit taxes. We take advantage of arguably (conditionally) exogenous variation in property gains tax receipts in the canton of Zurich (Switzerland) and study the expenditure response of local jurisdictions to transitory fluctuations in their own tax base. The immovable property gains tax (IPGT) is a particularly volatile revenue source. The receipts typically vary around a municipality-specific trend, and, from time to time, we observe larger temporary shocks. Fluctuations result in short-term temporary shifts (positive or negative) of the budget constraint. The parameters of the IPGT are set at the cantonal level, while the proceeds entirely benefit the respective municipality. Municipal decision-makers are aware of the volatility related to IPGT receipts. We define regular flows as revenue fluctuations that are within a window of what a municipality could expect ex ante. In contrast, positive shocks and negative shocks are defined as large deviations from this expected trend window (in our definition, deviations larger than ± 3 standard errors away from a trend). For fluctuations to be credibly exogenous for our purposes, they must emanate from idiosyncratic investment and location decisions by private individuals and must be unrelated to municipal public policy or other economic fluctuations such as the business cycle. To identify causal effects, we limit our analysis to large revenue fluctuations, which are typically unexpected by local policymakers and largely driven by individual location and private investment choices, and we purge variation coming from municipality-specific policy as well as economic factors. To do so, we control for underlying trends in the specific tax base and select from a large number of municipality-specific covariates applying causal machine learning methods. We use the post-double-selection method by Belloni et al. (2014) based on the LASSO estimator (Tibshirani, 1996). Ultimately, identification relies on a conditional independence assumption. According to traditional, normative public finance theory, the optimal reaction to fiscal fluctuations consists of smoothing them over time. The theory holds that governments should smooth short-term fluctuations and keep tax rates constant to minimize distortions (e.g., Barro, 1979; Lucas & Stokey, 1987). However, there is a large literature in political economics providing evidence that revenue smoothing is often not the chosen policy. More frequently, political processes feature substantial deficit bias leading to unsustainable public finances in many countries (e.g., Alesina & Passalacqua, 2016; Yared, 2019). In a companion paper, we find that a large one-off positive fiscal windfall in the canton of Zurich caused large and persistent fiscal imbalances (Berset & Schelker, 2020). Our baseline results are, however, predominantly in line with normative public finance theory suggesting revenue smoothing as optimal response to shocks. Only about 20% of positive tax shocks are spent as current expenditures, while no statistically significant effect on current expenditures is observed for negative tax shocks. However, the point estimates of negative shocks are substantially larger than those for positive shocks, but they are not very robust to specification changes. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature and set the relevant theoretical framework. Section 3 formulates testable hypotheses. Section 4 briefly describes the institutional environment of the canton of Zurich. Section 5 discusses the functioning of the property gains tax and our approach to distinguish regular fluctuations from shocks. Section 6 presents the data, the identification strategy and the empirical setup. Section 7 reports results and proposes interpretations. Section 8 concludes.",1
30.0,3.0,International Tax and Public Finance,22 March 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-023-09776-y,VAT fraud and reverse charge: empirical evidence from VAT return data,June 2023,Thiess Buettner,Annalisa Tassi,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"VAT has become a major source of tax revenue in most countries of the world not least due to certain advantages in tax enforcement. In particular, within the formal sector, the common invoice-credit form of calculating VAT provides a self-enforcing incentive structure (e.g., Pomeranz, 2015). Even in countries that are characterized by a large informal sector, the built-in withholding-tax feature has been shown to facilitate tax enforcement (Waseem, 2022). However, since taxes are refunded on inputs, VAT is susceptible to fraud. This is experienced in particular in the EU, where the so-called missing-trader (MT) fraud exploits the fact that “tax frontiers” have been removed in the EU’s common market. As exports are zero-rated and no import VAT is levied by the importing country, imports from other EU countries enter the country untaxed (Keen & Smith, 2006). After having sold a product inclusive of VAT, a fraudulent importer may disappear without remitting the VAT. The buyer, however, claims an input tax refund and a loss of VAT revenues occurs as a consequence. This fraud not only reduces available public funds, but it also transfers public resources to organized crime (De La Feria, 2020). Even though MT fraud has emerged as an issue more than 20 years ago (see Cnossen, 2001), there is still considerable uncertainty about the extent of resulting revenue losses. An often-used estimate of revenue losses due to non-compliance is the VAT gap. Defined as the difference between revenues collected and potential revenues, it is regularly calculated for all EU countries, and the total EU VAT gap in the year 2017 is estimated at about 11.2% of potential revenues (Poniatowski, 2019). However, this figure should not be equated with revenue losses from MT fraud (Yiallourou, 2019).Footnote 1 Studies that directly measure VAT fraud come to quite heterogeneous conclusions. Table 1 provides an overview of these estimates. For the EU as a whole, estimates range from annual revenue losses of 0.1% to 9.7% of total VAT revenues. Studies for individual EU countries also differ substantially. While methods vary, estimates are essentially based on trade data or national accounts. Despite the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of revenue losses, countries have implemented various measures to combat VAT fraud. The key measure used in the EU is to apply the so-called reverse-charge (RC) mechanism on domestic transactions (Keen, 2007). If a good is subject to reverse charge, the tax liability in business-to-business transactions is shifted from the seller to the buyer. Since the seller can no longer charge VAT and disappear without remittance, RC effectively erases the possibility for MT fraud. However, RC removes key features of the common invoice-credit form of the VAT that are important to ensure compliance. In particular, the withholding-tax feature of the VAT is removed and tax collection is effectively shifted to the end of the value chain, which may result in higher tax evasion. As a first step towards an assessment of the costs and benefits of implementing RC, it is important to obtain more reliable estimates of the extent of fraud. This paper adopts a novel approach to estimate the extent of VAT fraud by analysing the German VAT returns. We argue that the introduction of reverse charge for domestic transactions of certain products has made VAT fraud technically impossible in these areas. The resulting decline in input tax claimed, therefore, reveals the volume of fraudulent trade before RC implementation. Exploiting the German VAT return data at a granular five-digit industry level, we find that VAT reporting, including claims of input VAT, indeed changed significantly after the scope of RC has been widened in the years between 2009 and 2018. We complement our analysis by an analysis of other margins such as total sales and within-EU imports. The estimated effects on these margins are consistent with the view that the effect of RC on VAT returns is driven by MT fraud. Based on our empirical results, we estimate the volume of revenue losses from VAT fraud before introduction of RC at around 5% of total VAT revenues. Assuming that the extent of fraud is similar in the other EU countries, this figure
 suggests that about half of the VAT gap in the EU is attributable to MT fraud. Our key contribution to the literature on VAT fraud is to provide a novel approach to quantify the extent of MT fraud. To this end we exploit an institutional change in the VAT liability and utilize tax return data. A related research strategy has been used by Waseem (2019) to analyse VAT evasion and fraud in Pakistan, where illegitimate input tax credits are generated through “invoice mills”. In 2005, a reform reduced the VAT rate to zero for a number of industries, thereby eliminating the tax incentive to misreport. The findings indicate that overclaiming refunds, of which more than a third is found to be due to invoice mills, results in substantial revenue losses. Another contribution of our paper is that we document the scope of RC in German VAT. More specifically, we identify 22 industries affected by RC and quantify the fraction of sales that fall under RC. We embed the analysis of the effects of the reverse-charge method in a broader discussion of the problem of VAT fraud. In doing so, we explain why RC has been implemented and why it deals effectively with the type of fraud that is so common in Europe. The discussion shows that despite effectiveness of RC in the EU context, there are doubts whether it is really the silver bullet to fight VAT fraud, as it may encourage other forms of non-compliance. The next section provides a general discussion of VAT fraud and countermeasures, including the reverse-charge mechanism. Section 3 briefly reviews the implementation of reverse charge in Germany. Sections 4 and 5 present the data and discuss the methodology used in the empirical analysis. Section 6 provides the results. Section 7 provides conclusions and suggestions for further research.",

Evidence on welfare competition under Britain’s 19th-century Poor Law,August 2023,Jan K. Brueckner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A large literature has emerged studying strategic interaction among governments. The literature includes many theoretical papers, most of which focus on tax competition as a source of strategic interaction (see Wilson, 1999 for a survey). Spurred by this theoretical research, empirical work on strategic interaction has flourished. The goal of most empirical papers is to estimate policy reaction functions, which relate the level of a jurisdiction’s policy variable (a tax rate, for example) to the policy choices of its neighbors (see Brueckner, 2003; Revelli, 2005 for surveys). A nonzero slope coefficient in the estimated reaction function is evidence of strategic interaction. District benefit levels, England and Wales Histogram of epp changes While most empirical studies focus on tax rates, a smaller group investigates strategic interaction in spending levels. Within this latter set, a handful of papers looks for strategic interaction in the choice of welfare-benefit levels for poor households. Such interaction, known as “welfare competition,"" is the mirror image of tax competition, with high benefit levels attracting poor migrants via “welfare migration,"" but with high taxes repelling business investment and mobile taxpayers. In both cases, however, the result is an inefficiently low level of the policy variable, welfare benefits or tax rates. The three existing papers focusing on welfare competition are Figlio et al. (1999), Saavedra (2000), and Dahlberg and Edmark (2008), each of which finds evidence of strategic interaction in the choice of welfare benefits. The present paper adds to this small literature. Given the exhaustive overall body of empirical work on strategic interaction, any new paper faces a high hurdle in justifying its existence. Such a paper, whether its focus is on tax rates, welfare benefits, or some other policy variable, should offer a distinct methodological advancement, or other unique features not found in the previous literature. The paper clears this hurdle in part by offering the first study of strategic interaction using historical data. Relying on data from mid-19th century Britain, the paper focuses on the choice of welfare benefits by British districts under the New Poor Law, the welfare system of the time. Under this system, applicants were eligible for assistance partly on the basis of the length of their residency, a requirement that was made less stringent during the sample period. Beyond its historical focus, the paper is further distinguished from previous work by its investigation of the effects of this length-of-residency reform, motivated by theoretical predictions. Specifically, the analysis exploits the Irremovable Poor Act of 1861, which was passed in the midst of the sample period and reduced the residency requirement for welfare eligibility from five to three years. This change likely made welfare migration more attractive, and thus had the potential to alter the nature of strategic interaction among districts. The paper’s theoretical model predicts that under a plausible assumption, the looser residency requirement should have led to stronger interaction among districts (a steeper reaction function), while also reducing the equilibrium level of welfare benefits. To the best of our knowledge, the current tests of these hypotheses have no similar precedent in the strategic-interaction literature. The study thus makes an additional contribution by shedding light on the sensitivity of local welfare policy to changes in migration incentives.Footnote 1 It is useful to note that in the USA, various short-lived welfare residency requirements imposed at the state level were all declared unconstitutional decades ago, precluding a similar study of their effect on state benefit levels. But the strategic interaction uncovered by Figlio et al. (1999) and Saavedra (2000) in their US studies appears to confirm that the migration incentives these residency requirements were meant to undercut were indeed at work in the USA, driving state benefit decisions.Footnote 2 What new would be learned by showing that the same forces were operating in 19th-century Britain? On the one hand, such results would bolster the external validity of modern models of local government behavior, showing that they are broadly applicable even to an industrializing society. However, given that greater migration frictions presumably existed at that time, the emergence of strategic interaction might even be viewed as surprising, showing that even relatively limited mobility was enough to generate welfare competition among British districts. The pre- and post-reform structure of the sample period leads to an empirical model where the reaction functions are allowed to differ across the two subperiods. It is then possible to gauge the baseline extent of interaction among districts, along with short-run change in interaction as residency requirements are relaxed, a novel design. The empirical setup, however, is more conventional in another respect. In particular, to address the endogeneity of welfare benefits of neighboring districts, which appear on the right-hand side of the reaction function, the regressions rely on instrumental variables that are traditional in the literature: the demographic and other characteristics of neighboring jurisdictions, which help to determine the neighbors’ benefit levels.Footnote 3 In addition to contributing to research on strategic interaction among governments, the paper also advances the literature analyzing England’s economic and political institutions in the industrial revolution era. Following a heyday between 1970 and 1990 [see references in Boyer (2002), and studies based on Southall et al., (1998), economic research on the evolution of the 19th-century British welfare state has seen a recent resurgence, with studies including Chapman (2018, 2020a) examining the causes and consequences of public spending, and other work including Boyer (2019) and Horrell et al. (2020) documenting its impact on living standards and economic development. As in these more recent studies, the present paper offers insights into debates among contemporary officials and observers, who argued about whether poor relief influenced migration and whether relief generosity responded to migration (Boyer,  1993).Footnote 4 While earlier studies were often based on limited data, the use of newly collected, high-resolution data on poor relief covering the entire country allows this paper to provide better evidence bearing on these debates. The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the historical context of the study, and Sect. 3 presents a stylized theoretical model that generates the two testable hypotheses described above. Section 4 derives the estimating equation and discusses identification. Section 5 discusses the data, and Sect.  6 presents the empirical results. Section 7 discusses interaction in the two components of welfare spending (indoor and outdoor relief), and Sect. 8 offers conclusions.",1

For example, Bell and Van Reenen (2014) show that the top percentile of income earners in the United Kingdom received 35% of their total pay as bonus income in 2008, and the bonus share was even 44% in the financial sector. Similarly, Lemieux et al. (2009) find for the United States that performance pay accounts for most of the increase in wage inequality above the 80th percentile during the period 1976–1998.Footnote 2 At the same time, top income tax rates have been reduced in many countries. Egger et al. (2019) have shown for the OECD countries that income tax systems have become less progressive since the mid-1990s. They explain this development with the increasing international mobility of high income earners. Moreover, several countries specifically try to attract international top earners by means of tax cuts that are only available to foreign residents (Kleven et al., 2020). There is a substantial literature indicating that the international mobility of top managers has grown substantially over the past two decades (e.g. Staples, 2007; Greve et al., 2015).Footnote 3 Theoretical work has shown that the international mobility of top income earners reduces the optimal progressivity of income tax schedules in the countries competing for the high-skilled, mobile population (Simula & Trannoy, 2010; Lehmann et al., 2014). These effects are confirmed in empirical studies demonstrating that foreign residents respond to tax incentives with an elasticity that is far larger than the response of domestic residents (Kleven et al., 2013, 2014; Akcigit et al., 2016). In this paper we introduce overconfidence as a behavioral trait of mobile top earners and ask how this affects the tax competition for them. Specifically we focus on overestimation as the most common form of overconfidence.Footnote 4 The psychology literature has shown that many individuals overestimate their own abilities and talents, as well as the probabilities of advantageous events (Taylor and Brown 1988). This behavioral pattern is particularly pronounced among high-income individuals, who have experienced success in their previous career and attribute this success largely, or even exclusively, to their own abilities (Gervais & Odean, 2001). Empirical research has convincingly shown that company CEOs and top managers exhibit systematic and persistent patterns of overconfident behavior.Footnote 5 Thus Malmendier and Tate (2005) show that overconfident CEOs make excessive investments when their liquidity is high, and Malmendier and Tate (2008) show that overconfident CEOs engage in value-destroying mergers. Ho et al. (2016) demonstrate that banks with overconfident CEOs weakened lending standards prior to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and performed worse in the crisis. Finally, Humphery-Jenner et al. (2016) show empirically that firms ‘exploit’ this overconfidence by adjusting their compensation structure and increasing the share of incentive pay. There are some well-known examples of top income earners that are both internationally mobile and overconfident. Perhaps the most obvious case is Elon Musk, a South African native who migrated to the United States. As the current CEO of Tesla, a large share of his wealth is invested in Tesla stock, a clear signal of overconfident beliefs in his firm (cf. footnote 5). Another example is Josef Ackermann, a Swiss national who chaired the Deutsche Bank from 2002 to 2012 and in 2003 famously declared a 25% rate of return to equity as his target. A third example is Masayoshi Son, the Korean-born CEO of the Japanese SoftBank, who bought the US real estate company We-Work for USD 47 billion in 2019, and revised its value to USD 2.9 billion just one year later.Footnote 6 More generally, the psychology literature has shown that migration decisions are empirically linked to personality traits such as openness and extraversion (Jokela, 2009; Canache et al., 2013).Footnote 7 Just these personality traits have in turn been shown to be positively associated with overconfidence (Schaefer et al., 2004; Dessi & Zhao, 2018). Against this background, the present paper studies tax competition for managers that are both mobile and overconfident. We cast our analysis in a framework where managers hold an incentive contract and receive a compensation that consists of both a fixed wage and a bonus in case of success. Governments levy a bonus tax, but this tax can also be seen more generally as a higher tax rate (or surtax) on top incomes.Footnote 8 In our benchmark model we assume that governments maximize tax revenues and use the receipts from bonus taxation for redistributive purposes. In this setting we analyze how overconfidence of top managers affects both the compensation structure of the firms employing them, and the bonus tax rate that governments competing for the mobile high-skilled levy in the non-cooperative tax equilibrium. Our first main finding is that overconfidence increases the share of the bonus component in total manager compensation, relative to the fixed wage rate. This higher prevalence of bonuses makes the ex-post distribution of incomes more unequal and it increases the tax base for the bonus tax. Nevertheless, we find that higher levels of overconfidence reduce revenue-maximizing bonus tax rates in the symmetric Nash equilibrium. The intuition for this result is that overconfident managers overestimate the likelihood that they will receive the bonus, and hence pay the bonus tax. This increases their migration elasticity, and rational governments have to factor in this behavioral response. Since the true likelihood that the bonus is paid and the bonus tax is indeed collected is lower than anticipated by managers, overconfidence makes the bonus tax a less attractive instrument from the perspective of governments. Hence, in addition to the international mobility of top earners, their overconfidence may also contribute to explaining both the increased reliance of firms on bonuses and other forms of incentive pay, and the fall in top income tax rates faced by highly skilled migrants. The falling tax rate on bonus incomes does not imply, however, that overconfidence is detrimental for the government’s tax revenue collections. In fact, our second main result shows that managerial overconfidence raises bonus tax revenues in equilibrium, despite the falling bonus tax rate. This is because overconfidence shifts the manager’s compensation towards the taxed bonus component of his pay, and this increase in the bonus tax base dominates the effects of a lower tax rate. In fact, governments can “exploit” the overconfidence of managers in equilibrium, in the sense that the rewards to the overly high effort caused by the manager’s overconfidence partly accrue to the government as tax revenue. We then consider two modifications of our benchmark model. First, we assume that governments incorporate the utility of resident managers in their objective function, in addition to tax revenues. This gives the bonus tax a corrective component, as governments use bonus taxes to limit the managers’ excessive work effort that follows from the misperceived success probability. Therefore, equilibrium tax rates may now be rising in the managers’ overconfidence level, if this corrective component is sufficiently strong. In a second extension, we show that our results for revenue-maximizing governments are robust to introducing a two-tier income tax where the fixed wage income is taxed at a positive rate and bonus income is subject to an additional tax—or, alternatively, to a higher marginal tax rate. In this setting it remains true that, whenever the extra tax on bonus income is positive in equilibrium, it is reduced by overconfidence, and tax progressivity accordingly falls. Our paper contributes to the literature on the optimal taxation of mobile high-income individuals (Hamilton & Pestieau, 2005; Simula & Trannoy, 2010; Bierbrauer et al., 2013; Lehmann et al., 2014; Blumkin et al., 2015; Lipatov & Weichenrieder, 2015; Wilson, 2015). Most of this literature considers non-linear income taxation and focuses on marginal migration costs as a determinant of optimal marginal tax rates.Footnote 9 This literature shows that marginal tax rates generally fall as a consequence of international mobility, and that marginal tax rates on top earners may even become negative. We simplify the tax schedule by focusing on (piecewise) linear income taxation and show that adding overly optimistic beliefs will increase the elasticity with which high-income migrants respond to taxation, and hence further reduce optimal tax rates. We also contribute to the recent literature on optimal income taxation with behavioral agents (Bernheim & Taubinsky, 2018; Farhi & Gabaix, 2020; Moore & Slemrod, 2021). Much of this literature focuses on issues of tax salience and individual misperceptions of tax schedules. One exception is Gerritsen (2016), who derives optimal corrective tax policies when heterogeneous individuals work too much or too little. By incorporating overconfidence, we introduce individual misperceptions of their own abilities, which is a major theme in behavioral finance (Malmendier & Tate, 2005). Moreover we take the behavioral public economics literature to an international setting where countries compete in attracting mobile and overconfident managers.Footnote 10 Our analysis of bonus payments and their taxation draws on the framework of Besley and Ghatak (2013). Gietl and Haufler (2018) have extended this setting to analyze international competition in bonus taxes when governments bail out failing banks. Gietl and Kassner (2020) introduce overconfidence, but analyze bonus taxation in a closed economy. In this paper, we use a simpler framework without default risks and governments bailouts, which is therefore not specific to the banking sector. We combine, however, the international mobility of managers with their overconfidence. In the following, Sect. 2 describes our model, analyzing in turn the effort and migration decisions of high-skilled managers and the firm’s choice of the managerial compensation structure. Section 3 addresses international competition in bonus taxes when governments maximize tax revenues. Section 4 analyzes the case where governments maximize national welfare, including managers’ utility. Section 5 extends the analysis of revenue maximizing governments by considering a two-tier income tax in which all incomes are taxed at a positive, exogenous rate and an endogenous surcharge is levied on bonus income. Section 6 concludes.",1

Naturally, a tax audit is costly for the firm, as the handling of the auditor creates compliance costs and any tax audit creates a nonzero probability of additional tax claims, interest payments and penalty fees. Hence, firms have incentives to avoid greater audit intensity. When audit intensity depends on firm size, firms have reason to strategically bunch below firm size thresholds (FSTs) through size management. Respective FSTs are often made publicly available by tax administrations. However, size management distorts the firm size distribution and has negative effects on welfare. Specifically, due to the firms’ costs of size management, size management results in a deadweight loss, reduces firm’s future economic performance and, consequently, overall economic growth and also decreases aggregate productivity because of inefficient resource allocation. Despite the adverse effects that result from size management, research on this subject is scarce. To our knowledge, only two studies analyze how firms respond to threshold-dependent tax enforcement on the microlevel. First, Almunia and Lopez-Rodriguez (2018) find significant downward size management by Spanish firms and present evidence that underreporting of revenue is the key channel for this phenomenon in their setting. Second, Tennant and Tracey (2019) examine a threshold-dependent policy in Jamaica. In contradiction to the results by Almunia and Lopez-Rodriguez (2018), Tennant and Tracey (2019) find no size management around the FST. However, prior research has shown size management in many areas of taxation other than tax enforcement. For instance, Hoopes et al. (2018) analyze the responses of Australian firms to the threshold-dependent intensity of tax return disclosure. They find that firms manage their size to avoid disclosure. Further research has shown that size management at FSTs is related to kinks in corporate income tax (CIT) (Brockmeyer, 2014; Devereux et al., 2014), CIT notches (Bachas and Soto, 2021), CIT benefits (Hosono et al., 2018) and special CIT regimes for SMEs (Agostini et al., 2018), minimum CIT schemes (Best et al., 2015) and exemptions in value added tax (VAT) (Harju et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019; Onji, 2009). Moreover, size management has also been found in an array of nontax areas, e.g., mandatory IFRS reporting (Asatryan and Peichl, 2017), financial audit and disclosure requirements (Bernard et al., 2018) and labor regulation (Garicano et al., 2016). We use administrative microlevel tax return data to study size management for the entire population of German firms. These firms face threshold-dependent discontinuities in audit intensity. Specifically, the German tax administration segments firms into four size classes based on FSTs: very small (VS-class), small (S-class), medium (M-class) and large (L-class). Firms are assigned to a particular size class if their size exceeds either the respective FST for profit or for revenue (or both). The FSTs vary between industries (and increase continuously over time). Audit intensity between size classes varies most notably in terms of audit probability. For instance, in 2010, 21.1% of firms assigned to the L-class were audited as opposed to only 6.9% of firms in the M-class. In the S-class and the VS-class, the audit probabilities were only 3.5% and 1%, respectively (German Federal Ministry of Finance, 2011). Both the FSTs and the corresponding audit probabilities are regularly published online on the website of the Federal Ministry of Finance and in the Federal Gazette. In addition to audit probability, audit intensity between size classes also varies in terms of audit quality. First, administrative regulation dictates that for L-class firms, the audit must be consecutive, i.e., once an audit occurs, it must cover all years that were not covered by the previous audit for that firm. In contrast, for M-class, S-class and VS-class firms, the audit period cannot exceed three calendar years. Second, the skill level of the auditor and the specialization level of audit teams increase systematically with the size class. Our results imply an absence of size management in our data. Although, naturally, the null of no size management cannot be proven, a type II error is unlikely in our setting. First, our dataset is large, with approximately 2.7 million firms included. This substantially reduces the probability of making a type II error, even in our most granular subsample analysis, in which we search for size management in individual industries. Furthermore, as we rely on administrative data, we arguably face negligible measurement error and no selection bias. Finally, the results do not seem to be driven by our specific empirical strategy, as we obtain structurally equivalent results when applying an array of alternative tests. We make a contribution to the emerging field of studies on potential distortions created by threshold-dependent firm regulation in showing that firms in our setting do not react to FSTs by size management despite strong incentives to the contrary. We posit that the absence of size management results from optimization costs in the form of adjustment costs and information costs. The results we find for Germany contradict the results found by Almunia and Lopez-Rodriguez (2018) for Spain despite both countries being relatively similar in relevant drivers of optimization costs. Specifically, the two are similarly developed countries located in Western Europe, do not differ substantially in terms of the level of trust in public institutions and have similar tax rates. Despite these similarities, Germany and Spain differ in the specific design of their threshold-dependent enforcement regime. We argue that Germany’s specific implementation of multiple criteria for segmentation, multiple size classes, regular adjustments of FSTs and industry-specific FSTs increase optimization costs and, hence, can inhibit tax-induced size management. Moreover, the results by Tennant and Tracey (2019) on firms in Jamaica, where FSTs are based on a combination of taxes paid and revenue, indicate that a more multilayered threshold-dependent policy improves firms’ tax compliance as measured by both reported profitability and effective tax rates without causing tax-induced size management. Overall, this field of research is relevant for policymakers, as the results suggest that the specific design of threshold-dependent policies might allow governments to increase the efficiency of tax audits while not distorting the firm size distribution and, hence, avoid the negative effects of size management on welfare. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the effects of threshold-dependent tax enforcement and the rationale of tax-induced size management. Section 3 provides information on the German tax enforcement regime. Section 4 develops our hypotheses, and Sect. 5 describes the empirical strategy. Section 6 presents information on data and on sample selection. Section 7 provides the main empirical results as well as a discussion of them. Section 8 contains robustness tests, and Sect. 9 concludes.",1
