To put it briefly, young adults tend to leave home early in the northern part of the continent, while in more southern countries home sharing or co-residence is a more common stage of the young’s residential trajectory. For example, in 1994 the proportion of childless men aged between 20 and 24 who were not living with their parents was 45% in Denmark, 22% in the Netherlands and 19% in France (see Iacovou, 2000). In Spain and in Italy this was the case for only 2% in the same group. Larger differences were observed as children grew older. For the same countries, the probability that a childless man aged between 25 and 29 lived alone was equal to 83% in Denmark, 44% in the Netherlands, and 40% in France. But the corresponding figures were only 8% both in Spain and Italy. Those differences have been observed for decades, and are thus largely perceived as structural characteristics of the various countries. Factors generally perceived as causes of those differences among European countries are related to widely differing institutional settings and economic characteristics. Among institutional differences, the characteristics of the welfare system in a broad sense, and especially those related to the financing of education, are supposed to play a substantial role. For example, the Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway) have put in place a welfare system in which young adults are taken care of financially. In other countries, the costs of college education are almost entirely assumed by the State. Lastly, housing subsidies to young adults and students in particular give a clear incentive to parents and children to choose independent dwellings. In the French case, housing subsidies have been shown to have a substantial impact on students’ co-residence (Le Blanc & Laferrère, 2004). Features reflecting the influence of both institutional and economic settings which also play a role are the state of the rental market and the development of the mortgage market. In most countries, the rental market is the natural outlet for youngsters leaving the family home, inasmuch as most of them are unable to gather enough savings to meet downpayment constraints. In countries where the private rental market is small or declining, the interim role played by the rental stock is missing and one expects to see young adults living longer with their parents. The development of the mortgage market, on the other hand, commands the easiness with which young households can access homeownership. Usually, as the mortgage market develops, loan-to-value standards tend to increase, which facilitates access to homeownership by households being at early stages of the life cycle (i.e. with low savings, but high future income streams). Thus, we should expect to see young adults leaving home earlier in countries with a fully developed mortgage market (such as Denmark, Sweden, Germany, France), and later in countries where the mortgage market is underdeveloped compared to the European average (Portugal, Spain, Italy). Macroeconomic characteristics having an impact on the leaving home pattern at a country level relate mainly to the unemployment rate. The overall level of unemployment impacts the incomes as well as the accumulation of wealth of the parents, whereas the unemployment rate among the young workers affects the resources of the children negatively. Thus, unemployment affects the intergenerational distribution of income at the macroeconomic level, which in turn can be expected to have an impact on the occurrence of home sharing among parents and children. In this paper, we focus on the role played by the distribution of incomes within families on home sharing between parents and children. More precisely, we examine how the incomes of parents and children affect the probability of a child living at the parental home. By examining data from eleven European countries, we expect to shed light on the importance of this intergenerational distribution of income when explaining differences in co-residence in Europe. That is, notwithstanding other institutional differences referred to above, how are co-residence outcomes affected by the distribution of income between parents and children? Are the patterns consistent across European countries, or do they differ? Let us mention at the outset that our approach is not structural. On the contrary, we focus on the description of the statistical relationship existing between parents’ and children’s incomes on the co-residence outcome. The reasons for this choice are multiple. First, structural models of co-residence produced by the literature have relied on simplifying assumptions concerning, among other things, the child’s labor supply, the influence of public transfers, and the education choices of the children. While the following section reviews this literature in more detail, it seems fair to say that any structural model of co-residence can be attacked from a number of angles. Second, there is no universally accepted model of home sharing between parents and children. Various models to be found in the literature predict different types of influence of either the parents’ or the child’s income on the propensity of children to live with their parents. Thus, a purely statistical analysis may be an interesting first step and help to choose among competing models. Third, to the best of our knowledge even the purely statistical description we undertake is new in a context of cross-country comparison. We use data from the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) to relate leaving home decisions of young adults to the joint distribution of parents’ and child’s incomes. The empirical analysis comprises three main stages. In a first stage, we focus on cross-section evidence. Data from the fifth wave of the ECHP show that the probability of leaving home is positively correlated to the child’s income in all countries of our sample. The influence of parental income is much weaker, but tends to be positive when significant. Considering the weak influence of parents’ income evidenced in the first stage, in a second stage we focus on child’s income. We use the fixed-effects Probit model recently developed by Greene (2001, 2004) to control for family unobserved heterogeneity and examine how the child’s income influences leaving home within the family. Again, we find a positive and significant effect of child’s income for almost all countries. Thus, within a family, children with more income tend to live independently more often. Lastly, we use the panel nature of the ECHP to relate the changes in co-residence outcomes across time to income shocks for both parents and children. The results still suggest the same story. Overall, our descriptive analysis highlights regularities between European countries. This finding is important, since it seems to confirm that differences in institutional settings and economic features are the main drivers of the differences in leaving home patterns among European countries. In order to qualify the importance of income distribution factors on the extent of co-residence in the various countries, we undertake very simple simulations. The simulations basically consist of changes in the income distribution specific to a given country for an ``average’’ parent-child pair, and examining the probabilities of co-residence predicted by ten country-specific models. By doing that for each of the countries in our sample, we are able to build a qualitative idea of the relative importance of income distribution effects versus other institutional and economic effects on the co-residence patterns observed in those countries. While the intergenerational distribution of income observed in the Netherlands would generate the highest de-cohabitation rates if applied to other countries, the UK’s institutional and economic features seem to be the most conducive to de-cohabitation of young adults. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, results from the literature on the effects of parents’ and child’s income on the probability that the child lives at the parental home are discussed. Section 3 presents our data source, the ECHP, and discusses our empirical strategy. The main results are presented in Section 4. Concluding comments are gathered in Section 5.",46

Within a general trend of declining fertility rates in Europe, Spain has experienced the most dramatic fall in birth rates. The Spanish fertility rate dropped from 2.8 in 1975 to 1.15 in 1997, only to recover very lightly to 1.2 in recent years. Although desired fertility also went down in Spain and across Europe generally, it fell at a slower pace than fertility rates (Bongaarts, 2001; Goldstein, Lutz, & Testa, 2003). As a result, the gap between ideal and achieved fertility slowly increased in Spain in the last two decades. During the same period, the high level of unemployment and its persistence have probably been the most important changes that have affected the lives of young Spaniards. The failure of young couples to obtain stable employment has notably restricted their ability to leave their parents’ home, obtain mortgages and, as I argue here, have children. This paper employs the 1985 and 1999 Spanish Fertility Surveys (SFS) to show that the tightening of the labor market and worsening of economic conditions in Spain during the last two decades are important determinants of the gap between the number of children women consider ideal and their actual fertility. Further, the paper tests whether these findings are robust to the inclusion of additional relevant factors. In particular, the paper controls for the effect of within-couple differences in family-size preferences and religious orientation. The paper is organized as follows. The first section lays down the hypothesis on how aggregate and individual economic and labor conditions, besides preferences and religious composition of couples, can partly explain the gap between preferred and realized fertility. The second section describes the covariates as well as the methodology employed. The third section presents the results both for the 1985 and 1999 Spanish Fertility Surveys.",47

The WFTC, an in-work benefit for families with children, replaced the Family Credit, and like its predecessor was to be conditional on at least 16 h of paid work per week. The Government suggested that, in order to underline the connection between payments and work, the WFTC would be paid via the pay packet. In effect, this aspect of the reform would constitute a redistribution of resources within households from “purse to wallet”, as it would mean paying the benefit to the main earner in households, rather than to the main carer as was the case with the Family Credit. It was finally decided to allow couples the choice of the identity of the recipient of the benefit, with a possibility of veto from the main carer. The controversy which led to this change is reminiscent of the discussions which surrounded the reform of the child benefit system in the UK in the late 1970s. In both cases, it was felt that the distribution of resources within households might impact on individual behavior and welfare. This has indeed been confirmed by empirical evidence on consumption patterns (e.g., Lundberg & Pollak, 1996). The standard unitary model of household labor supply (see for example Blundell & Walker, 1986; Van Soest, 1995) does not allow for the analysis of the impact of redistribution of resources between household members, as those are constrained by the structure of the model to have no effect on choices. In this setting, individual preferences and the possible strategic interactions between agents are obscured by the structure of the model and choices are made subject to a household budget constraint. This approach would therefore fail to show any difference between Family Credit and WFTC resulting from the redistribution of resources away from main carers (mostly mothers) and toward main earners (mostly fathers). In fact, this part of the reform was not considered in the simulation of the WFTC conducted both by Blundell, Duncan, McCrae, and Meghir (2000), and Gregg, Johnson and Reed (1999). The present paper builds on the methodology suggested in Frederic Vermeulen et al. (2006) to implement a collective model of labor supply with discrete choice. The approach assumes that some of the preferences can be retrieved by the observation of the behavior of single individuals while a marriage-specific preference term and the bargaining rules are calibrated on observed labor supply of men and women in couples. The calibrated bargaining rule is then estimated on a set of variables including the relative financial contribution of wife and husband in household net income. In particular, one of the variables aims to capture the difference between giving the WFTC to the main carer versus giving it to the main earner. This way, the simulation of the WFTC reform does not only entail a change in budget constraints but also a potentially important effect on intrahousehold distribution due to the “purse to wallet” nature of the reform. In the present paper, we present the results on UK data and focus on the WFTC reform. Results for income tax and tax credit reforms for five other European countries are also summarized (for more results on UK reforms see Blundell, Lechene, & Myck, 2002). Following the methodology presented in Vermeulen et al. (2006), we construct a data set for couples on the basis of a fully deterministic model with features of the collective framework. The reforms are simulated on the predicted data. For two variants of the WFTC reform, we compute the changes in relative power within couples and the changes in labor supply and welfare. Our findings suggest that who receives the money does matter. It turns out that individual utilities in couples depend on the earning potential of the members of the couple including variables relating to the fiscal system. The simulations also suggest that as a consequence of changing the bargaining power within couples, labor supply responses can be different depending on the precise nature of fiscal reforms. The paper is organized as follows. We begin, in Section 2, with a description of the UK tax and benefit system. This is followed (Section 3) by a description of the data. Section 4 presents the theoretical effects of the reform. Section 5 analyzes the results of the reform simulations. Section 6 briefly reviews comparable results obtained from five other European countries, and Section 7 concludes.",20

Since flexible and easily identifiable, this representation of household decision processes is very popular when estimating household preferences, particularly in the presence of a complex budget constraint (see for instance van Soest, 1995). In this respect, it is a convenient model when studying the impact of a real or topical tax reform on household behavior (see e.g., Blundell, Duncan, McCrae, & Meghir, 2000). Yet, the unitary model treats the family as a black box and consequently the within-family income redistribution resulting from a policy reform cannot be identified. Alternatively, the collective approach specifies the individual preferences of family members and simply assumes that the household decision-making process leads to Pareto-efficient allocations. The present paper proposes a quantification of the distortions in tax reform analysis entailed by the use of a unitary model when the data are collective. The evaluation of tax reforms based on both unitary and collective models has been suggested by Beninger and Laisney (2002). Using purely synthetic data, they find important discrepancies in the incentive and distribution effects of revenue-neutral reforms based on unitary estimates rather than on the collective parameters. The aim of the present paper is to check the robustness of these results when the collective baseline situation is generated using real world data. This is done by means of a collective model calibrated on real data as described in Frederic Vermeulen et al. (2006), and by estimating a unitary model on this ‘collective data set’. We focus on German data, and a revenue neutral tax reform that consists of replacing the smooth progressive tax schedule and the current means-tested social benefits by a simple two-parameter linear taxation system involving a basic income and a flat tax. The same exercise is replicated for other European countries and other topical reforms. The outline of the paper is as follows. The second section briefly introduces the baseline German tax and benefit system (corresponding to the year 1998). Section 3 gives statistical evidence on the data used, the 1998 wave of the GSOEP. Estimation results for the unitary model are given in Section 4. Section 5 compares normative and positive analyses of the tax reform on the basis of the two models. Section 6 concludes.",21

Zimmerman,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A considerable literature in economics has blossomed around the notion that households do not make consensual decisions about time and budgetary allocation decisions, but that instead outcomes reflecting different preferences. A key area of inquiry has been around household decision-making for investment in children, where it has been shown in specific contexts that women are more dedicated to using resources for children’s benefit than are men, and that accordingly children fare better in households in which the wife has greater decision-making power relative to the husband’s. An improved understanding of how households make decisions about investment in their children holds considerable promise for improvements in specialty help-seeking for children with mental health needs. The canonical model in economics of household decision-making assumes that households speak—and buy and sell—with a single voice. Several alternative models of the household reject the assumption of unitary decision-making. Becker’s (1973) model assumes that individual resources at marriage are pooled but then determine each spouse’s access to what the marriage produces. Grossbard-Shechtman (1984) extends this insight by modeling the effects of marriage market conditions on allocation decisions throughout the marriage. Manser and Brown (1980) and McElroy and Horney (1981), offer models that argue that household decisions emerge out of a bargaining process that integrates multiple, competing preferences and economic influences over each spouse’s bargaining power. This literature has been extensively reviewed in several articles (Behrman, 1997; Haddad, Hoddinott, & Alderman 1997; Lundberg & Pollak, 1996; Manser & Brown, 1980; Strauss, Mwabu, & Beegle, 2000; Vermeulen, 2002). Theoretical approaches have typically employed Nash equilibrium concepts, maintained by threat points that represent the opportunity utility of the partners outside of the marriage. In these models, the bargaining power of each partner is determined by what his or her utility would be in divorce versus what it is inside the marriage. Considerable evidence exists that children’s mental health problems are severely undertreated (Cohen & Hesselbart, 1993; Costello, Farmer, Angold, Burns, & Erkanli, 1997; Farmer, Stangl, Burns, Costello, & Angold, 1999; Haines, McMunn, Nazroo, & Kelly, 2002; Leaf et al., 1996; Verhulst & van der Ende, 1997; Zahner, Pawelkiewicz, Defrancesco, & Adnopoz, 1992). Undertreatment for mental health problems is especially tragic, given that depression, attention-deficit, hyperactivity, and other mental health problems have been shown to interfere not only with children’s current well-being, but also with educational attainment and future job performance, and therefore with future psychosocial and economic well-being (Krueger, Caspi, Moffitt, & Silva, 1998; Mannuzza, Klein, Bessler, Malloy, & Hynes, 1997; Velting & Whitehurst, 1997). The decisions to seek treatment for children’s mental health issues occur in an environment unlike other health care decisions for children and even unlike adult mental health treatment decisions. For this reason, the study of the socio-economic determinants of children’s mental health services use is particularly important. This paper advances that research agenda by testing the role of marriage market factors in treatment decisions. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. After a brief overview of the separate literatures on intra-household decision-making and on investment in children’s mental health in Section 2, Section 3 presents an empirical model testing whether marriage-market factors affect the decision to seek treatment for a child’s mental health needs. Section 4 presents the data source and variable definitions, and Section 5 presents results of the empirical estimation. Section 6 concludes with some conceptual implications presented in the form of a theoretical model as well as implications for improving children’s mental health care.",1

In the case of Denmark and Western Europe, marriage migrants constituted half of the migration flows from non-Western countries in the 90s. The lack of integration of these immigrants means that the inflows are considered problematic, and restrictive migration regulation has been introduced. Thus, how immigrants sort themselves into household units have important implications for the integration of the current and future generations. In order to understand the marriage patterns of immigrants, we explore the educational homogamy and exchange mechanisms between individuals in immigrant couples. A large literature is concerned with the correlation between the educational levels of two spouses. In theory, the correlation is predicted to be positive because the education levels of two spouses are complements in the production of marital capital (Becker, 1973). Also, the empirical literature agrees that the correlation is in fact positive, and therefore the question boils down to an issue of the degree of homogamy over time and across countries (e.g. Halpin & Chan, 2003; Mare, 1991; Smits, Ultee, & Lammers, 1998). While only a few studies look at the issue of educational homogamy in the case of interethnic marriages, these studies also find support for positive assortative mating by education (Kalmijn, 1993; Lievens, 1998; Qian, 1999; Qian, Blair, & Ruf, 2001). Until now, no studies have addressed this issue in relation to marriage migration. When we study marriage migration between developed and less developed countries, the issue of assortative matching by education is particularly interesting. Restrictions on immigration in the source countries have had a remarkable effect on the marriage market, making marriage migration by far the most attractive way to gain admittance to any West European country. Thus, within this context education may not only be used to obtain an educated spouse, but also in exchange for other resources. Marriage migration between a less developed country and a developed country may be seen as an exchange of favorable living conditions against, for instance, a high bride price or a high education (Böcker, 1994, 1995; Gitmez & Wilpert, 1987; Van Amersfoort, 1995). This is a special case of the exchange hypothesis developed by Davis (1941) and Merton (1941). They hypothesize that two spouses exchange resources, e.g. higher status or money for good looks through marriage. Qian (1999) investigates whether interethnic marriage in the US may be explained by immigrants exchanging high education for a white spouse, and he rejects this hypothesis. Grossbard-Shechtman (1993) goes one step further than the sociological theory of exchange, which is only concerned with the formation of a single couple and not the marriage market as such. She analyzes compensating differentials and intermarriage within the framework of a market theory of marriage. A preference for homogamy in one ethnic group combined with a preference for heterogamy in another ethnic group results in the market establishing a compensating differential for intermarriages, which materializes in terms of relatively favorable or unfavorable characteristics for one party in the marriage. In contrast to the sociological theory of exchange, partners who deviate from the average preferences for homogamy vs. heterogamy may reap the benefits from intermarriage. In this paper, we investigate the degree of educational homogamy between spouses in couples involving at least one immigrant. We focus on the education of couples involving Turkish, Pakistani, and Ex-Yugoslavian immigrants in Denmark, whose marriage behavior is described in detail by Çelikaksoy (2004). By use of a survey from 1999, we test two hypotheses: the hypothesis of positive assortative matching (PAM) by education and the hypothesis of the existence of a compensating differential for marriage migration. Regarding PAM, the idea is that if the stylized fact of PAM also describes marriage behavior of immigrants to Denmark, one would expect that individuals in the upper (lower) end of the educational distribution tend to marry other individuals from the upper (lower) end of the educational distribution for that particular demographic group. To identify compensating differentials for marriage migration, we study whether individuals tend to get a spouse further up or down in the educational distribution by choosing an individual who immigrates for the sake of marriage. If the individualFootnote 1 gets a better educated spouse as a result of marriage migration, it indicates that the education of the migrating spouse is traded for good living conditions in the host country.Footnote 2 If, on the other hand, the individual gets a less educated spouse as a result of spouse import, it indicates that the migrating spouse has some favorable attributes that compensate for the lack of education, for instance unspoiled traditional norms (especially for female marriage migrants). It is an empirical question whether potential compensating differentials for marriage migration and PAM coexist. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the theoretical background for the two hypotheses in more detail. Section 3 describes the data set and variables used. Section 4 presents the empirical analyses to test the two main hypotheses, the PAM hypothesis and the hypothesis of compensating differentials. Section 5 concludes.",38

Lehrer,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The far-reaching consequences of dropping out of high school are widely known: work careers characterized by low wages, high unemployment, and few opportunities for further training; unstable marital unions; and overall bleak prospects for economic well being. Obstacles to the completion of secondary schooling include a range of often interrelated factors, including academic difficulties, the emotional turbulence that sometimes accompanies adolescence, substance use, pregnancy, violence in the neighborhood, poor schools, and dysfunctional homes. The central questions addressed in the present paper are: Are there differences by religion in the likelihood of successfully completing the transition to high-school graduation? If so, how large are they? Do the patterns vary by race? Previous studies have shown that two dimensions of religion—affiliation and participation—are systematically associated with years of schooling completed (see recent reviews of this literature in Lehrer, 2004a, 2006). The present analysis employs data from a large-scale national survey addressed to women, the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), to study whether the differentials by affiliation and participation that have been documented in earlier research can be discerned already at the early stage of graduation from high school. This survey contains information on the religious affiliation in which the respondents were raised and their frequency of attendance to religious services at age 14, thus making it possible to examine how both of these dimensions of childhood religion are related to the probability of going on to successful completion of secondary schooling. An attractive feature of the 1995 NSFG is that the number of respondents over age 20 is large enough to permit separate analyses of the religion–high-school graduation relationship not only for non-Hispanic whites but also for black youth.Footnote 1 Because of sample size limitations, most previous studies in this area have either lumped all racial/ethnic groups together or have focused exclusively on non-Hispanic whites. Data from the 1995 NSFG make it possible to test the hypothesis, suggested by recent ethnographic research, that the beneficial effects of religious involvement for adolescents may be especially salient for disadvantaged minority youth (Warner, 2002; Williams & Warner, 2001). In addition, these data provide an opportunity to ascertain whether the patterns of education differentials by religious affiliation documented in earlier studies for non-Hispanic whites extend to black youth.",21
4.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-006-0015-2,"Gender ideology, division of housework, and the geographic mobility of families",December 2006,Hendrik Jürges,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The aim of this article is to study the determinants of family migration decisions, i.e. the decision to make long-distance moves (within countries but across regional borders). Specifically, I will assess the significance of gender-roles for the inter-regional mobility of dual-earner households. Traditional gender-role beliefs imply that the husband should have the role of the primary provider or breadwinner. His labor market career concerns are of vital interest for the entire family. The wife, if at all employed, merely assumes the role of a co-provider. Her career is of minor importance, more or less expendable. In contrast, egalitarian gender-role beliefs ascribe the same importance to both partners’ careers, at least in principle. The potential importance of gender-role beliefs for family decisions such as where to locate is obvious. If only one partner’s job and career are deemed important for the well-being of the entire family, families will be less restrained in their decisions by losses of the partner who is the secondary provider. Economic and sociological family migration models differ in their assessment of the importance of gender ideology: sociologists think that gendered family roles play a major role in family migration decisions (Bielby & Bielby, 1992; Bird & Bird, 1985), whereas economists usually ignore this kind of concept (DaVanzo, 1976; Mincer, 1978). However, empirically, the differences between economic and sociological models are subtle. Mainly because married women usually have less favorable positions in the labor market than men, the main predictions are very similar: Dual-earner couples are less mobile than single-earner couples, because the wife’s employment has some effect on migration propensities, but men’s careers are more important in the migration decision. Hence women tend to lose (in terms of their labor market position) in case of a family move. Economists assert that this is the case only because men’s potential gains from migration outweigh women’s potential losses (Mincer, 1978; Nivalainen, 2004). In contrast, sociologists argue that the relative importance of husband’s and wife’s job is not only a function of their income or labor market position in general, but also of the gender ideology shared in the couple (Bielby & Bielby, 1992; Bird & Bird, 1985; Morrison & Lichter, 1988; Shihadeh, 1991). The basic individual-level migration model endorsed by most sociologists and economists was developed by Sjaastad (1962). According to this model, potential migrants evaluate discounted costs and benefits of migrating to another region. If benefits outweigh costs (if the net benefit is larger than zero), the individual moves to the other region. Benefits are usually job related. Individuals move from low-wage regions to high-wage regions, or from regions with high unemployment rates to regions with low unemployment rates. The costs of moving are mostly in terms of leaving behind location specific capital in various forms—family, friends, memories, an so on. Sjaastad calls this the “psychic costs” of migration. Gains and losses are thus not entirely in monetary terms. Although the Sjaastad model is useful in describing the migration behavior of men, it has limited value for the explanation of the regional mobility of married women (Bielby & Bielby, 1992; Mincer, 1978; Morrison & Lichter 1988; Sandell, 1977, Shihadeh, 1991). The general finding is that family migration decisions are largely dominated by husbands, even if wives are employed. Individual (job-related) returns to migration differ substantially between men and women. Married men who migrate are less often unemployed after a move and they enjoy increased wages. In contrast, women are migration losers in the sense that they are less often employed, have given up a qualified occupation, or earn less after a move. This has not only been found in the U.S. (Duncan & Perrucci, 1976; Lichter, 1983; Maxwell, 1988; Morrison & Lichter; 1988; Spitze, 1984), but also in Great Britain (Boyle, Cooke, Halfacree, & Smith, 2001) and Germany (Büchel, 2000; Jürges, 1998b). Mincer (1978) extended the Sjaastad model to families. According to his model, a family moves if and only if the sum of all household members’ benefits from moving is larger than the sum of all household members’ losses. In this case, each household member benefits from the move, either directly (e.g., in the form of higher wages) or because he or she receives compensation from other family members that undo migration losses. The nature of this compensation need not necessarily be financial. The model only implies that family members are compensated in terms of utility. The Mincer model further predicts a household split up if the sum of individual benefits is larger when both partners go separate ways rather than staying together at the same location. Although Mincer speaks of divorce, this needs of course not necessarily be the case. Dual-career couples, in particular if they are highly educated, also commute long distances, on daily, weekly or even monthly bases, to accommodate partnership and careers. To avoid separation, they also tend to locate in large, diversified labor markets (Costa & Kahn, 2000). Although being rather simplistic, the Mincer model makes several empirical predictions that are well confirmed (DaVanzo, 1981; Lichter, 1982; Long, 1974; Nivalainen, 2004, shows evidence from Finland): Single person households have a higher geographical mobility than couples or larger families. Dual-earner couples are less likely to move than single-earner couples, because the tied mover will suffer from disruptions of his or her paid work. Families move to accommodate the spouse with the superior labor market position. Because husbands, on average, have more favorable labor market prospects than their wives, women are more often “tied” partners (movers or stayers) than men. Still, Mincer’s model of family migration has been criticized as being incomplete by economists and sociologists alike. The economists’ critique mainly deals with the model’s missing specification of the distribution of the resources in the household. For instance, that migration losers are compensated is simply assumed but not founded theoretically. This is no longer deemed acceptable in modern economic household theory. Households form because there are gains from marriage that leave each partner better off than when living alone. The distribution of these gains between husband and wife is now explicitly modeled as the outcome of a bargaining process (specifically as a Nash-bargaining solution; see Manser & Brown, 1980; McElroy & Horney, 1981), in which the partner who has less to lose from a divorce will be able to extract more of the benefits of marriage. In the language of bargaining theory, the level of utility in the case of divorce is called threat point. (For simplicity, I only refer to the divorce-threat version of the bargaining model; another version, called separate spheres model, considers inefficient arrangements within the marriage as threat points; see Lundberg & Pollak, 1996). Lundberg and Pollak (2003) apply bargaining theory to family migration decisions. As in the Mincer model, a family only moves if both partners agree to the move. But clearly, a family move will shift both partners’ threat points. If one partner gains from the move (e.g. yields a higher income) but the other partner loses, the threat points are shifted in favor of the first partner. He or she has a higher income and on top of that gets a better intra-family deal. So this partner will always agree to the move. But what about the second partner? Nash-bargaining implies that the second partner will receive a smaller share after the move, but the crucial question is: a smaller share of how much? If there are net gains from migration, the second partner will receive a smaller piece of a larger pie, which can or cannot be an improvement in absolute terms. Thus, even though family income would increase after the move, the anticipated change in the intra-household resource allocation can lead to a veto by the family member whose bargaining position is weakened after the move. Because a potential increase in joint income is not realized, the family remains at an “inefficient” location. This theoretical argument actually dates back to Ott (1992), who applied it to fertility rather than migration decisions. Ott showed that opportunity costs of women who have children do not only reduce fertility, but reduce fertility to suboptimal levels. The main empirical implication of the bargaining model is that families are less mobile than the Mincer model suggests. Some moves that are beneficial in the sense that the net gains accumulated across all household members are positive will not happen when there is intra-family bargaining. Sociologists have criticized economic models from a different perspective. They claim that the models are incomplete in the sense that they do not account for influence of gendered family roles on decision making within the family (Bielby and Bielby, 1992). In fact, both the Mincer and the bargaining model are blind to the gender of the family members who gain or lose. As long as the sum of benefits outweighs the sum of losses or as long as both partners gain from the move, it does not matter if the move is made to foster the husband’s or the wife’s career. However, empirical studies from the U.S. have long shown that family migration decisions are asymmetric in the sense that—within the group of dual earner couples—women’s job characteristics do not help to explain the geographical mobility of families. For instance, Duncan and Perruci (1976) follow couples of college graduates longitudinally and find no effect of the female partner’s occupational status or her relative income on the propensity to move. Lichter (1982) studies the effect of the female’s occupational status, income, and work commitment on the migration probability of dual-earner couples. Of eight different indicators, only seniority had a significant negative effect on the geographic mobility of a couple. Gender ideology can explain these results as has been demonstrated in several studies. Bird and Bird (1985) report that men with egalitarian gender-role beliefs show more reluctance to accept a job offer in another region and less reluctance to move in order to foster their wives’ careers than men with traditional gender-role beliefs. Women with egalitarian role-beliefs are more likely to report that a recent family move was triggered by her career concerns. They also report more willingness to accept a job offer in another region regardless of their husbands’ jobs. Bielby and Bielby (1992) show that, independent of the partner’s income, traditional men are more willing to move for their own career’s purpose than egalitarian men, and traditional women are less willing to move than egalitarian women. But even among individuals with egalitarian gender-role beliefs, women are more reluctant to move for their own careers than men. Further, Bielby and Bielby find that, among men with traditional gender-role beliefs, the wife’s income has no effect on self-reported willingness to move in benefit of their careers, whereas women with traditional gender-role beliefs become increasingly reluctant to move to benefit their careers when the income of the partner increases. The above findings suggest that family migration decisions are asymmetric in the sense that men dominate these decisions also if their wives have a comparable labor market position, because men mostly take the primary provider role. However, many of these studies only look at the self-reported willingness to move and only few are really longitudinal and analyze the relevance of male and female characteristics for actual migration behavior. It is unclear if self-reported willingness really translates into behavior. For example, Berger, Foster, and Wallston (1978) report that even in egalitarian couples of college graduates, the female partner often eventually followed the male partner. Apparently, the men had less problems finding a job after graduating from college. This suggests that egalitarian role-beliefs can be too costly to be acted upon. However, it is unclear how far the Berger et al. results can be generalized because their sample was small and rather selective. In this article, I study if gender ideology matters for actual behavior using a large German representative panel data set (SOEP, see below). The question is whether traditional and egalitarian couples behave differently. Statistically, this translates into the question whether there are interaction effects between labor market characteristics—relevant for inter-regional mobility—of men and women in dual-earner couples and their gender ideology. More precisely, the analytical strategy is to sort couples in two groups: egalitarian and traditional couples. In egalitarian couples, husband’s and wife’s characteristics should have the same effect on migration behavior. Consider education as one of the most important determinants of inter-regional mobility: an egalitarian couple that consists of a highly educated husband and a less educated wife should be as mobile as a couple that consists of a less educated husband and a highly educated wife. Egalitarian couples in which both partners are highly educated should not be more mobile than couples with only one educated partner, because a move potentially affects the career of the tied mover. In contrast, if gender ideology matters, only the husband’s education level should affect traditional couples’ propensity to migrate. Traditional couples that consist of a highly educated husband and a less educated wife should have a higher migration rate than couples that consist of a less educated husband and a highly educated wife, but the same migration rate as couples with two highly educated partners. The existing literature on family migration suffers from lack of information needed for such a test of the importance of gender ideology. Either there are longitudinal data but no information on gender ideology (e.g., Jürges, 1998a, using SOEP data), or there is good information on gender ideology but no longitudinal data (Bielby & Bielby, 1992, explaining the respondent’s willingness to move). Moreover, much of the literature on family migration decisions that explicitly deal with gender ideologies is fairly old and most studies are from the U.S. In the face of the changing role of women in Western societies (e.g. increases in female labor force participation), the present paper aims at providing new evidence from a European country. Thus some background information on gender equality in Germany should be helpful. Germany ranks 9th in terms of the UN Gender Empowerment Measure (UN, 2005), an index that combines information on the number of seats in parliament held by women (Germany: 31%), the percentage of females among senior officials and managers (36%) and the male-female ratio of earned income (.54). Higher ranked countries include all Nordic countries, Belgium, the Netherlands and Australia. The US rank 12th with only 15% of parliamentary seats held by women but 46% females among senior officials and managers. The present paper contains two main innovations compared to earlier studies of family migration using the same data. First, I do not use “direct measures” of gender ideology such as the respondents’ agreement or disagreement to items like “It is more important for a wife to help her husband’s career than to have one herself”, “It is much better for everyone if the husband is the wage-earner and the wife takes care of her home and family”, or “A married woman should refrain from working if jobs are scarce and her husband is able to earn the family’s living”. Such direct measures are likely to be endogenous in the sense that individuals approve of such statements to justify the very fact that they are not working in the labor market. Instead, I will use the information on time spent on household chores, both on workdays and on weekends, contained in the SOEP data. Because the husband’s share in housework is often found to be larger in egalitarian couples than in traditional couples (De Laat & Sevilla-Sanz, 2004; Greenstein, 1996, 2000; Huber & Spitze, 1983), information on relative time-use is also informative about gendered family roles. This measure might be affected by covariates—such as the relative labor market position of a couple—that simultaneously influence migration behavior (Hiller, 1984). For this reason, one would feel uncomfortable using time-use on workdays. I will thus identify traditional and egalitarian couples by the husband’s share of housework done on a typical Sunday, where housework consists of traditionally female tasks (Greenstein, 1996): washing, cooking, cleaning the house, childcare, and grocery shopping (not so common on a typical Sunday in Germany because of strict opening hours regulations). Below, I will show in some detail that housework on Sundays is much less affected by labor market characteristics (male wages in particular) and more likely affected by gender ideology than housework on workdays. The second innovation of this is the operational definition of migration, i.e. the empirical distinction between residential mobility and migration. Due to a lack of information on migration distances, earlier studies using the SOEP data have defined migration mainly by the motive of a move, for instance defining all “job-related” moves as migration and all other moves as residential mobility (Jürges, 1998a, 1998b). Fortunately, the access to regional identifiers in the SOEP has been facilitated recently, so that it is now possible to define migration more conventionally by the (approximate) distance of the move.",62

These political changes had wider ramifications, especially in the economics arena, which extended to the behavior of households. For example, while the evidence generally points to real expenditure gains of the African households in post-apartheid South Africa, there is less recognition of the shift in the intra-household balance of power in decision making due to changes in the source and nature of the resource inflows into the household, especially in the gender composition of the income recipients. There now exists a large literature on the economic changes in South Africa following the dismantling of apartheid. However, there has not been much attempt to study their impact on the household’s expenditure pattern via possible changes to the decision making process inside the household. The primary aim of this paper is to examine on South African data whether resources accruing to different members of the household and from different sources have differential effects on the household’s expenditure patterns. In other words, we investigate whether or not the members of the South African household “pool” resources between themselves and between alternative sources before “collectively” deciding on the household’s expenditure outcomes. A particular distinguishing feature of this paper is its consideration of the recipient as well as the source of the resource inflows into the household. While the results of these tests hold universal policy interest (for example in increasing the effectiveness of income transfers to households by targeting them at individual members), they are of particular significance in the context of post-apartheid South Africa. The period following the end of apartheid has resulted in an increased feminization of the labor force in South Africa (Casale & Posel, 2002). The interesting question now is whether this increase in income accruing to females has resulted in a shift in intra-household balance of power with consequent implications for household behavior. Interest in this issue has been heightened by the recent Canadian evidence of Dosman and Adamowicz (2006) which suggests that an increased income by one partner does not necessarily lead to increased influence by her/him in the household’s decisions. The traditional analysis of household behavior did not assign any role for the relative income of the resource recipients in the household or of the different sources in determining the household’s various outcomes. However, relative income is expected to influence intra-household allocation of resources as argued by Becker (1973) in his theory of marriage and subsequently in the bargaining theories of the household (Manser & Brown, 1980; McElroy & Horney, 1981). In further developments in the literature on intra-household behavior, there has been a spate of “collective household” models that also allow relative income to influence household outcome. Pollak (2003), who provides a chronological survey of the models of intra-household behavior, traces the origin of this literature to the pioneering work of Becker (1973). Pollak (2003) identifies the resource pooling hypothesis as a crucial feature of Becker’s altruist models. In the words of Pollak (2003, p. 131), “Becker’s altruist model implies resource pooling.......hence, evidence against pooling is evidence against the altruist model”. The results of the present study, that are generally supportive of resource pooling in post-apartheid South Africa, should be seen in this context. Browning, Chiappori, and Lechene (2006), however, warn that “income pooling is neither necessary nor sufficient for a unitary model” (p. 5). Such a model is defined by these authors as one that portrays “the decisions of a many person household as though the household had a set of stable and transitive preferences”. There is now a large literature that tests the traditional model of altruist household behavior. While the earlier literature was based on bargaining theories with the focus of those studies on Slutsky conditions, the recent strand of this literature is within the collective framework with the resource pooling hypothesis adopted as the testable proposition of altruistic behavior. As Pollak (2003) has pointed out, the emergence of the test of resource pooling as the “crucial empirical issue” is the dividing line that separates the earlier bargaining models from the recent developments in the literature on intra-household models. We show that in order to investigate the changes to household behavior in post-apartheid South Africa, the recent advances on intra-household resource allocation can be put to good use. The origin of the empirical literature on resource pooling within the household can be traced back to the work by Thomas (1990) and Schultz (1990). As pointed out by Schultz (1990) and further discussed by Lundberg, Pollak, and Wales (1997), a key limitation of much of this literature is that in lumping together all non-labor income under “unearned income” and conducting pooling tests based on this heterogeneous item, the literature overlooks the fact that unearned income consists of different components (for example, asset returns, public and private transfers) that have different sets of determinants and recipients, with different behavioral and welfare implications. This paper tackles this issue by treating (a) social pensions and (b) remittances received, previously lumped together under unearned income, as separate resource inflow variables, disaggregated by the gender of the recipient. The remaining constituents of unearned income, namely, non-farm self employment, agro-pastoral activities and other income (for example, non pension welfare payments), have been aggregated into a resource inflow category called non-wage income. Analysis is conducted using two household survey data sets from South Africa. Besides providing us with the gender disaggregated information on resource inflows that we require, the South African data is of special interest for two other reasons: (a) private remittances and social pensions are significant sources of resource inflows into the South African household, and (b) the 1993 and 1998 surveys of households in Kwazulu-Natal provide us with a panel that allows an examination of key behavioral and welfare changes during the first five years of post-apartheid South Africa. We build on the work done using the 1998 data by Maluccio (2000), Maluccio, Haddad, and May (2000) and Maluccio, Thomas, and Haddad (2003). The social pension program in South Africa has recently attracted a great deal of attention (see Bertrand, Mullainathan, & Miller, 2003; Case & Deaton, 1998; Duflo, 2003; Edmonds, Mammen, & Miller, 2003; Jensen, 2004; Maitra & Ray, 2003, 2004). However, much of this analysis (with the notable exception of Edmonds et al., 2003) is based on the 1993 data. This paper updates the evidence and extends our earlier work (Maitra & Ray, 2003) by disaggregating the various resource inflows based on the gender of the recipient. We find evidence in favor of resource pooling by the income earners within a household. The present South African evidence differs from most existing evidence that is generally supportive of the idea that relative income has a significant impact on expenditure patterns. The South African evidence acquires added significance from the fact that the test results are generally robust between the two surveys. There have been several significant changes in expenditure allocation during the initial 5 years of post-apartheid South Africa, though not much of it can be attributed to changes in the intra household balance of power. For example, a decline in the budget share of food may be due to a combination of rising household affluence and increasing educational levels of the head of the household.",8
4.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-006-0012-5,The labor supply of married women and spousal tax deductions in Japan—a structural estimation,December 2006,Hideo Akabayashi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The magnitude of the possible negative effect of a progressive income tax on labor supply has been intensively examined by economists over the years, worldwide. In policy settings in the United States, the calculation of social welfare loss due to a discouraged supply of labor underpinned tax and welfare reforms in the 1980s (Hausman, 1981). In academia, the methodological issues in estimating labor supply parameters have generated a vast literature in which several different methods have been developed (Blundell & MaCurdy, 1999). The first purpose of this paper is to address this issue based on a structural model of labor supply of married women using Japanese cross-section data. To my knowledge, this is the first formal attempt to estimate the Japanese female labor supply by fully considering the national income tax system. The second purpose is to test the implications of the standard household model by exploiting the nature of the cross-spouse income tax system in Japan. This is possible due to the unique restrictions placed on married women by the Japanese tax system. The third purpose is to evaluate the effects of proposed policy reforms on the labor supply of married female in Japan based on the estimation results. Unique and complicated issues involving the Japanese income tax system and female labor supply have emerged from the Allowance for Spouses (AS) legislation and its amendment, the Special Allowance for Spouses (SAS).
Footnote 1 This legislation established a very special treatment of spouses who, for national income tax purposes, are viewed as dependents of a household’s primary earner. If a spouse (usually wife) earns income below a threshold level, the primary earner (usually husband) becomes eligible for the spousal deduction. Moreover, for a range of earnings, the amount of deduction decreases at a rate of approximately one yen for every one yen increase in the spouse’s earnings, making the primary earner’s taxes dependent on their own marginal tax rate and the earnings of their spouse. The AS/SAS has been at the center of income tax reform debates in Japan for two decades, since it is widely believed that the AS/SAS has prompted married women to work for limited days per year in order to reduce their husbands’ income tax. There is another special condition for married women under the national pension system, as is described fully in Sect. 2. Given a decline in the Japanese population in the near future, these special conditions placed on married women and their families have been argued as impediments to the efficient utilization of women’s human capital. The main contribution of this paper is to combine two lines of research for evaluating this unique Japanese policy: the structural estimation of labor supply under a nonlinear tax schedule and testing implications for intrahousehold allocation mechanism. Combining these two lines is necessary to evaluate the effects of the AS/SAS on female labor supply when there is no option for an experimental approach. A number of previous studies, reviewed in Sect. 3, estimated the magnitude of the negative effect on female labor supply caused by those policies, but no study has paid close attention to the underlying intrahousehold allocation mechanism that can influence the way the AS/SAS affects the behavior of married women in Japan. As will be clear, the AS/SAS offers a unique restriction on the decision-making of married women under the unitary and Pareto models of household with egoistic utility (Chiappori, 1992), which this paper fully exploits. The standard unitary household model (Becker, 1991) assumes that the household allocates its resources based on a single (stable) household utility function and a single family budget constraint. Although several previous papers have tested and rejected the unitary household model using data from various countries (Lundberg, Pollak, & Wales, 1997; Schultz, 1990; Thomas, 1990), there remain difficulties in interpreting the results, especially when the only available data are cross-sectional. Most of the papers test the existence of income pooling with a null hypothesis that the non-labor income of any member must have an equal effect on the allocation of goods and time within a household. However, there is little reason to believe that measured unearned income is exogenous to unobserved productivity or preferences that may affect labor supply behavior and other resource allocations.
Footnote 2 Furthermore, it is sometimes hard to define unearned income at the individual level. Several attempts have been made to explicitly incorporate an intrahousehold transfer mechanism or joint labor supply decision in the female labor supply model. Following the seminal works by Hausman and Ruud (1980) and Lundberg (1988), Van Soest (1995) structurally estimated a joint labor supply model incorporating several policy distortions in the family budget constraint. Hoynes (1996) also structurally estimated the choice of hours of work in two-parent families under the AFDC–UP.
Footnote 3 Both papers assume the unitary model with a discrete choice space.
Footnote 4 Fortin and Lacroix (1997) estimated a flexible household labor supply model that encompasses both the unitary and Pareto models as special cases, without considering income tax. Compared to these previous works, this paper estimates a structural model with a nonlinear budget constraint, tests the implications of the unitary household model with a linear labor supply equation using a restriction created by the AS/SAS, provides interpretations of the empirical results based on the Pareto efficiency criteria, and conducts policy simulations based on the estimates.
Footnote 5
 Compared to the empirical strategy of using unearned income to test the unitary household model, there are even some advantages to using the AS/SAS. First (assuming the individual tax brackets and budget constraints are measured correctly), changing marginal tax and deduction rates can generate variations in budget constraints more exogenous than variations in unearned income, which is arguably endogenous even without measurement error. Particularly, the variation in the AS/SAS deduction for a husband is large only within a range of a wife’s budget constraint, thus facilitating the identification of the model. Second, although in reality both unearned income and labor earnings are subject to measurement errors, variations in the implicit tax rate on a wife’s earnings through the AS/SAS, determined by the husband’s marginal tax rate, should be less affected by the original measurement error for earnings, since the marginal tax rate is fixed for a certain range of income. Third, by using the AS/SAS as a source of identification of the model, one can directly estimate and naturally interpret its policy effect on labor supply, as we will see later. There are, however, several disadvantages in the empirical strategy taken here, mostly due to the common weakness in the structural estimation strategy and data availability in Japan. I shall examine and discuss possible sources of bias due to those disadvantages, and provide my own assessments. The empirical strategy and results, nonetheless, demonstrate the importance of model selection and the usefulness of intrafamily redistribution policies as a source of variation for testing the validity of the underlying household model, making an addition to the literature on the structural evaluation of tax and social security policies. The next section provides background information on the Japanese tax and national pension system. In Sect. 3, I review studies on the effect of the AS/SAS on married female labor supply in Japan. Section 4 introduces a simple unitary household optimization problem with egoistic individual utility under the Japanese income tax system. It predicts a testable restriction on the observed married female labor supply; the rate at which the husband’s after-tax income decreases as the wife’s earnings increase should have the same impact on her labor supply as the rate of her own personal income tax. Section 5 describes the data used in the empirical analysis. The empirical strategy and identification issues are discussed in Sect. 6 in full detail. I separate the after-tax wage effect into the effect from the change in the wife’s own marginal tax rate and the effect from the change in the husband’s net-of-tax income due to the changing spousal deduction. Identification of the two separate effects is possible as the variation in the wife’s marginal tax rate results from her wage rate and hours of work over her entire budget constraint, whereas the variation in the husband’s after-tax income comes from his income and his eligibility for the AS/SAS only within the range of his wife’s gross earnings in which the AS/SAS deduction is phased out. Section 7 reports the empirical results and the interpretations. The results mostly reject the implication of the standard model; it is found that the husband’s decreasing deduction tends to have a larger negative impact on his wife’s labor supply than her own income tax. It is also shown that, with additional conditions, the results contradict the implications of a Pareto model that nests the unitary household model. Therefore, Japanese households seem to inefficiently allocate wives’ hours of work. Finally, I simulate the effects of proposed tax and social security reforms using the estimates obtained on various subsamples. It is found that the choice of household model affects the simulation results and that the currently proposed reforms have a smaller effect on the married female labor supply than previous studies have claimed. Section 8 provides the conclusion.",27

Hammitt,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Over the last century, both developed and developing countries have implemented a wide range of social insurance programs.Footnote 1 The introduction, expansion and reform of these programs raise important questions about the effects of the programs on the behavior of economic agents. One important question is the extent to which these programs crowd out private precautionary behaviors, such as saving, purchasing private insurance, or the entry of other household members into the labor force. Understanding the motivations for household precautionary behaviors and the relationship with insurance has important policy implications. If precautionary motives are significant, economic models that ignore them, such as simple life-cycle models will tend to miscalculate the optimal size of government policy. Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995) demonstrated the importance of accounting for precautionary savings to explain the effects of asset-based, means-tested social insurance on patterns in wealth accumulation. In the presence of precautionary motives, government policy may have unintended effects on individuals’ welfare. For example, it may increase efficiency by pooling health risks through insurance rather than relying on individuals’ precautionary saving, since those who reduce consumption today may not necessarily be ill in the future.Footnote 2
 While using theoretical models incorporating precautionary motives to explain economic behaviors when social insurance programs are introduced is appealing, the limited empirical work that is available provides mixed evidence about the strength of precautionary motives.Footnote 3 The difficulty that researchers typically face is that the variation in insurance programs owned by individuals is inevitably correlated with the individuals’ unobserved preferences. For example, those who are highly risk-averse are more likely to have better health insurance and engage in various precautionary behaviors. Instrumental variables based on arbitrary exclusion restrictions (such as occupation or education) may provide no solution since these variables are likely to be correlated with personal preferences. This paper contributes to this emerging literature by providing empirical evidence on the impact of a significant change in social health insurance on households’ precautionary behaviors in Taiwan. Specifically, we will examine the effects of health insurance on households’ savings, purchase of accident insurance, and spousal labor supply. We exploit a unique natural experiment. In March 1995, the Taiwan government inaugurated National Health Insurance to cover health expenses for the entire population. Prior to implementation, there were three major health insurance programs—Government Employee’s Insurance, Labor Insurance, and Farmer Health Insurance, which were tied to employment status. Only Government Employee’s Insurance provided coverage to the insured’s spouse, children and parents. The introduction of the comprehensive NHI coverage had a smaller impact on households in which at least one spouse worked in the government sector and could obtain insurance coverage for the entire household before NHI. By comparing changes in behavior between households with no government employees and households with at least one government employee, we are able to identify the impact of NHI. This is a difference-in-differences strategy. Our difference-in-differences strategy is similar to Chou and Staiger (2001) and Chou, Liu, and Hammitt (2003). Chou and Staiger (2001) use the Survey of Family Income and Expenditure from 1992 to 1997 to analyze the impact of NHI on labor force participation among married women in Taiwan. They find that labor force participation of married women declines by about 4% point after the introduction of the NHI. Chou et al. (2003) estimate the impacts of NHI on saving behavior of households in Taiwan. Their results suggest that the precautionary motive is an important determinant of household saving and consumption behaviors, and that NHI reduces savings by an average of 8.6–13.7%. Nevertheless, our study differs from Chou and Staiger (2001) and Chou et al. (2003) in three major ways. First and foremost, we employ a unique data set to exploit the underlying variation in medical benefits across households within treatment and control groups. Unlike the difference-in-differences method, this strategy allows us to take full advantage of the variation in insurance benefits within households at one point in time and to calculate the elasticity of response to the change in insurance benefits. Neither Chou and Staiger (2001) nor Chou et al. (2003) directly assessed the impact of insurance benefits on household behaviors. Second, since insurance benefits could vary because of underlying tastes, the natural experiment described above allows us to use the husband–wife joint employment status as an instrument for insurance benefits and thus to identify the causal relationship between insurance and household’s precautionary behaviors. In contrast to Chou and Staiger (2001) and Chou et al. (2003), we consider multiple treatment groups to reduce the importance of random variation in a single treatment group. Two factors suggest these instruments are likely to be valid. For one, the dramatic expansion of National Health Insurance significantly increased the insurance benefits for households with no government employees. Furthermore, the expansion of NHI is very likely uncorrelated with households’ behaviors. As detailed below, although the development of NHI was predicated on concerns about rising health-care costs and access to care, the timing of implementation was determined by political factors unrelated to changes in health-care markets. Finally, we use the data spanning from 1993 to 1999 which allows us to estimate a long-run labor force response to the NHI as opposed to the short-run response estimated by Chou and Staiger (2001). Our analyses are based on the Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (SFIE) from 1993 to 1999. This survey contains individuals’ labor market status together with detailed information on consumption and saving. The survey also contains information on insurance benefits received by each household. Our results suggest that households have strong precautionary motives. Therefore, the introduction of comprehensive health insurance significantly reduces households’ savings. However, private purchase of accident insurance and the entry of other family members in the labor force are not found to be related to the precautionary motives.",12
4.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-006-0009-0,Incentives to cooperate and the discretionary power of courts in divorce law,December 2006,Bruno Deffains,Eric Langlais,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper studies the effects of discretionary power of judges in divorce litigations. The main question is to know if the probability of cooperative bargaining increases when judges makes decisions which appear as random for the parents. This problem is particularly acute in most common law and civil law countries concerned by the introduction of scales of child support. Considering that child support is the object of disputes in a great number of divorce cases, legislators are interested in evaluating whether alimonies have to be fixed by the imperium of the judge or if it could be efficient to impose precise rules of calculus. Some countries have already introduced scales of child support. Some of them have chosen indicative systems (Canada, United States...), but others like England have already decided to impose strict rules, so that the establishment of child support appears to be an administrative task more than a true court decision. Of course, the determination of child support is generally based on allocative (costs of children) and/or redistributive (resources of parents) grounds, but it seems important to consider the problem of cooperation between the two parents. It is surprising to note that this problem has not received much attention in the literature devoted to economics of the family even though it is an important question from a law and economics perspective
Footnote 1 Exceptions concern the effects of the content of divorce rules on the behavior of parents (e.g. Mechoulan, 2005 considering no-fault divorce). But the way the rules are enforced by the courts is not considered. One can consider that the introduction of scales of child support could generate more transparency and more predictability. This means an improvement in parents’ information in divorce cases. In other words, precise rules reduce information costs of litigants and adjudicators during the trial. The intuition is that when matters are more difficult to predict, parties’ expectations over the outcome of the adjudication are more likely to diverge. As a result, parties to a dispute will tend to settle less often and the litigation rate will increase. In contrast, precise rules should facilitate cooperative settlement. Moreover, considering divorce law, it is important to note that parental cooperation is important not only during litigation, but also after the courts’ decision because it could increase collection of child support payments and the participation of non-custodial parents in the education of children (Oldham & Melli, 2000). Empirical research confirms that divorce law negatively impacts children’s welfare as a consequence of the reduction in monetary and time contributions of the non-custodial parent (Del Boca & Ribero, 2003). With visitation and direct expenditures, child support transfers fixed by the courts have to be considered. The first intuition is that it could be important to limit the discretionary power of judges to facilitate cooperation between parties. However, from an analytical point of view, this is not so easy to demonstrate. The economic analysis of legal dispute resolution generally explains the choice of the parties between cooperative (agreement) and non cooperative (judgement) solutions via strategic behaviors (Shavell (1982), Cooter, Marks, and Mnookin (1982), Bebchuck (1984)...). Informational asymmetries can explain why a great number of conflicts end up in trial even though a cooperative surplus exists. Using an approach in which models determine the probability that the conflict is resolved through trial rather than negotiation, it is possible to show that when informational asymmetries are reduced, cooperation increases. Therefore, in the case of divorce law, one could argue that the determination of precise guidelines for child support could reduce the asymmetries of information between parents. We aim to challenge this argument. If informational asymmetries are of great importance in many circumstances, it is sometimes doubtful that informational problems uniquely occur (if at all) between the parties at trial. In divorce cases, for instance, it appears that neither party has an informational advantage with respect to the issue of a dispute settlement at trial. However, both are in a situation of uncertainty in the sense that the decisions of the parties depend on their subjective expectations regarding the decision of the judge. Such situations may occur for example when the legal rules are complex or ambiguous (Kaplow, 1995). Another example is provided by the cases where courts change their way of thinking, leading to an evolution of the jurisprudence that individuals have not yet understood because they hold on to expectations not fully updated (Viscusi 1995). In this spirit, we suggest a new way of thinking about cooperative behavior in litigation games like divorce. While ignoring informational asymmetries between parties, we explicitly deal with another kind of informational problem resulting from the non observability of the judge’s type or action by both parties, who can do nothing but assign an expectation regarding the judge’s behavior. Moreover, in contrast with the assumption made in the literature, we assume that the parties at trial are no longer risk-neutral decision makers, but that their preferences are of a more general nature, an asumption in line with the axioms of the Dual Theory (DT thereafter) of Yaari (1987). Introducing this DT assumption is both meaningful and powerful for several reasons. In contrast to the usual purely subjectivist optimistic approach, it enables us to consider a context in which both parties have some objective information (probabilistic) with regard to the behavior of the judge that they may use in assigning their own individual beliefs. At the same time, while being in a strategic context in which the common knowledge assumption is required, the DT of Yaari provides us with sound, axiomatically founded but simple arguments to rationalize the disagreement in individuals’ beliefs: these are not pure probabilistic decision weights, but they reflect the preferences of the individuals and specifically their risk attitude. Section 2 presents a basic model of the discretionary power of judges. We show that with Yaari decision makers, the same information about the judge’s behavior generates different beliefs with regard to the court’s decision. Section 3 analyzes divorce as a cooperative game between parents. We compare strict rules versus discretion in the determination of child support. Demonstrating that the more uncertain the judge’s behavior, the higher the incentives to cooperate, we prove that the uncertainty of the outcome at trial cannot per se explain the failure of cooperation between parents. On the contrary, it should increase the incentives to cooperate. Of course, this result is not inconsistent with redistributive goals in the sense that more uncertainty could imply higher amounts of child support. Finally, Section 4 discusses the optimal degree of discretion which may maximize the gains of cooperation for the parents. We show that the question of the optimal level of judge’s discretion is a classical problem of risk sharing : probabilities have to be set so that the less risk averse parent bears a larger share of the risk. Section 5 concludes and suggests possible extensions of the paper.",6

Decker,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Several facts suggest that the health care received by the poor in the United States is substantially inferior to that received by the non-poor. Lower-income people have higher mortality rates than higher-income people at most ages and for most causes of death (Kitagawa & Hauser, 1973; Menchik, 1993). Of course, poor people are likely to face more risk factors than the non-poor, causing the health of the poor to be inferior even if they receive the same quantity and quality of medical care as others. Nevertheless, an important step in exploring reasons for unequal health outcomes in the United States is to identify any differences in access to health care, and the reasons for those differences. Clearly, one source of unequal access is incomplete health insurance coverage. In 2003, about 43% of the non-elderly poor in the U.S. were covered by Medicaid, approximately 26% of the poor had other health insurance, and 31% were uninsured (NCHS, 2005). Several studies suggest that the uninsured obtain less health care than the privately insured (Buchmueller, Grumbach, Kronick, & Kahn, 2005; Burstin, Swartz, O’Neil, Orav, & Brennan, 1998–99; Hadley & Holahan, 2003; Newacheck, Stoddard, Hughes, & Pearl, 1998). What is less clear, however, is whether Medicaid effectively equalizes access to health care for its recipients. One reason for questioning the effect of Medicaid on access to health care is that Medicaid in most states pays substantially less for health services than do Medicare and private health insurance companies. For this reason, it is not clear whether Medicaid patients receive the same care as individuals who are privately insured. This paper examines the extent to which Medicaid provides recipients with access to the same type of physician care as that enjoyed by those with private insurance, and whether this access depends on the level of fees that Medicaid pays to physicians. Because states have wide latitude in setting physician reimbursement rates, the amount paid to physicians by Medicaid for an office visit varies greatly. For example, the average Medicaid fee for a sample of primary care visits varied from $25 in Rhode Island to $108 in Alaska in 2003 (Zuckerman, McFeeters, Cunningham, & Nichols, 2004; See Fig. 1). I test whether those on Medicaid have access to care that is more similar to that received by those with private insurance in states with higher Medicaid reimbursement relative to states with lower reimbursement. I use data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) on the use of office-based physician care. This data represent one of the few sources of information on the care of both Medicaid and non-Medicaid patients. Results imply that higher Medicaid fees increase the number of private physicians, especially in medical and surgical specialties, who see Medicaid patients. Higher fees also lead to visit times with physicians that are more comparable to visit times with private pay patients.

Evidence from Denmark,June 2007,Jens Bonke,Hans Uldall-Poulsen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"All the different intra-household decision-making models implicitly make assumptions regarding income pooling. Thus, the unitary model assumes either that individuals act as if they were maximizing a social welfare function (Samuelson, 1956) or if a dominant individual is managing the households yielding some income pooling (Becker, 1991). The non-unitary models including so-called cooperative models (Browning, Bourguignon, Chiappori, & Lechene, 1994; Chiappori, 1988, 1992; Manser & Brown, 1980; McElroy & Horney, 1981) and non-cooperative models (Browning & Lechene, 2001; Grossbard-Shechtman, 1993; Lundberg & Pollak, 1993; Lundberg & Rose, 1999) assume that household decisions and thereby the level of income pooling depend on preference factors as well as on distributional factors (Browning & Chiappori, 1998). The preference factors are the same as those in the unitary model, whereas the distributional factors are factors influencing the decision process through a “sharing rule” (Browning & Chiappori, 1998). A number of studies have found the relative income of spouses to be an important distributional factor (Attanasio & Lechene, 2000; Browning et al., 1994; Lundberg et al., 1997; Lundberg & Rose, 1999; Thomas, 1990; Ward-Batts, 2003), while Browning et al. (1994) found the relative age of spouses to have a significant impact on the outcome of the decision process within the family. The literature on household behavior therefore suggests that a number of factors need to be considered if we are to explain a household’s choice of distributional regime, and thereby the level of income pooling. The most obvious reason to pool resources is the existence of public goods, children, etc., which requires spouses to coordinate their economic behavior. Moreover, a skewed distribution of income will give altruistic spouses an incentive to pool some of his or her income with the partner. Finally, the incentive for pooling resources can derive from the perceived gains from specialization (Lundberg & Rose, 1999), in case of a gender gap on the labor market. However, exploiting the gains from specialization might imply that one of the spouses supplies less time to the labor market, and thereby decreases his or her option value of leaving the marriage, see Orsini and Spadaro (2005). Most individuals will therefore be reluctant to make such an offer before they are certain that the relationship will prevail, which is somehow confirmed by Stratton et al.’s (2005) finding of a positive relationship between duration of marriage and degree of specialization in household production. Among factors inhibiting the pooling of income resources are egotism, which makes the spouse with the highest income reluctant to pool his or her resources. Also, a spouse with a high preference for individuality will prefer a distributional regime whereby he or she is not forced to coordinate economic decisions with the partner. Incentives for pooling resources will thus reflect both individual characteristics and household conditions. Individual characteristics (e.g. the spouses’ relative income) will influence the taste for individuality, while household conditions (e.g. the presence of children) will determine the suitability of/demand for an income pooling regime. The various theories mentioned above suggest that the differences between spouses’ income, education, upbringing and occupation influence the household decision-making process, including the choice of income distribution. However, the relationship between resources and the proportion of income pooling is somewhat ambiguous. First, the causal relationship between income distribution and actual income pooling remains unclear. While the distribution of income will influence incentives to pool resources, the decision to pool resources could also lead to a skewed distribution of income if the couple attempts to exploit the gains from specialization. Moreover, the impact of a skewed distribution of income on the incentives to pool resources depends on the emotional relationship between spouses (e.g. egotism, altruism). If spouses are egotistically inclined, a skewed distribution of income would make the higher-earning spouse reluctant to pool resources. On the other hand, if spouses are altruistically inclined, a skewed distribution of income would increase the incentive of the higher-earning spouse to pool resources. Thus, a clear relationship between income distribution and the proportion of income pooling does not exist. Second, it would be important to establish a causal relationship between relative education and income pooling. Thus, in case of differences in spouses’ education, one might believe that gains from specialization imply a positive relationship between educational difference and the proportion of income pooling. However, if the spouses are egotistical, the higher-educated spouse may be reluctant to pool incomes. The same arguments may hold for differences in occupational status of spouses. Therefore we don’t expect a clear relationship between occupational status and educational difference and the proportion of income pooling. The predicted impact of age (and age differences), relative autonomy in buying, and upbringing of the spouses is not clear either.
Footnote 1 The literature on marital power indicates that individual resources vary with the social settings in which the spouses have grown up. Therefore, although both age and upbringing could influence the choice of distributional regime, the specific impact of these factors is hard to predict. A skewed distribution of power could provide an incentive to pool resources or as an incentive not to pool resources. It could also simply result from a household’s using an income-pooling regime to benefit from specialization. The suitability of/demand for an income-pooling regime will differ widely across households. A newly wed couple with no public goods such as a car or house will have different reasons for coordinating economic affairs than will a couple who has purchased a number of public goods during a long marriage. Likewise, the existence of children also affects the demand for income pooling because children can be considered a public good. A household with children would most likely have a greater need to coordinate its economic affairs, and thus find an income-pooling regime more appealing, than would a childless couple. Another factor that might affect the proportion of income pooling is past partner experience (see Heimdal & Houseknecht, 2003, who show that type of relationship and previous divorce affect the income organization within the family). Thus, income pooling might be due to a learning process, so that a previously married spouse could be either more or less reluctant to accept income pooling. Likewise, some individuals who previously have been married are likely to be wealthier or poorer, suggesting that spouses of remarried individuals could be more or less reluctant to pool resources. The effect of past partner experience on the probability of income pooling is therefore also difficult to predict. Finally, we emphasize two other factors likely to have a major impact on the probability of income pooling: the duration of marriage and the amount of household resources (e.g. public goods, including children). The duration of marriage will influence the incentives to exploit the benefits of specialization, while the existence of (more) public goods will influence the proportion of income pooling to better coordinate the household’s economic affairs. The discussion therefore suggests the following two hypotheses regarding the proportion of income pooled: Income pooling will correlate positively with the existence of public goods in a household. Income pooling depends positively on expectations of continued marriage and, thus, on the marriage career of the spouses. We do not distinguish between cohabitation and marriage, as cohabitation in Denmark is often a prelude to marriage. This is in contrast to the US, where a more marked distinction in specialization among partners exists between cohabitants and married couples (Stratton et al., 2005) and thus in the degree to which they act cooperatively (Nordblom, 2004).",20

Chiswick,Paul W. Miller,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper examines the determinants of computer usage, with a special emphasis on the differences between immigrants and the native born, and also whether there are differences in the impact of computer usage on the earnings of these two groups. It uses a within-household public good approach to model the demand for computers. It also looks at whether the inter-relationships among computer skills and the other skills, such as educational attainment and proficiency in the dominant language of the country of destination, are associated with the labor market success (earnings) of immigrants. Thus, it is able to consider whether computer use is associated with destination language proficiency, in this application English. Moreover, it considers whether part of the considerable wage premium to destination language skills among immigrants (see in particular Chiswick & Miller, 1995) could be associated with better computer literacy among those with dominant language proficiency.Footnote 1 These analyses are conducted using data from the recent (2001) Census of Population and Housing in Australia.
Footnote 2
 The research builds on the model of immigrant labor market adjustment proposed by Chiswick (1978). This attaches considerable importance to the favorable selectivity of economic migrants.Footnote 3 This selectivity has been shown in analyses of the labor market outcomes of immigrants in many countries, and across different time periods, to be associated with more rapid growth in earnings for immigrants than for the native born. Part of this more rapid growth in earnings is due to immigrants’ post-migration investments in destination-specific human capital, such as language skills, that are complementary to other forms of human capital, including that acquired in the country of origin (Chiswick & Miller, 2003). A more intense use of computers, which might also be associated with the favorable selectivity of immigrants, could be another factor that gives rise to the immigrant post-migration adjustment phenomenon. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the conceptual framework for the study of the incidence of computer/internet use. The focus on family decision-making means it has an intellectual heritage in common with Baker and Benjamin’s (1994) study of immigrant labor supply. Section 3 provides details on the data set used, and contains a number of cross-tabulations that illustrate the considerable variation in computer/internet use across adult males in Australia in 2001. Section 4 presents and discusses estimates of multivariate models of the determinants of computer use for males in Australia in 2001. These analyses identify differences in computer usage between the foreign born and native born, and relate these to the standard model of immigrant adjustment (e.g., Chiswick, 1978). Section 5 examines the links between the use of computers and earnings. The multivariate human capital earnings equation used in this analysis facilitates examination of the independent effects on earnings of schooling, duration in the destination, dominant language skills, and computer use. Summary comments and policy implications are contained in Sect. 6.",24

Evidence from labor supply,June 2007,Sonia Oreffice,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"This paper examines the effect of abortion legalization on household labor supply. Most abortion and birth control technology studies have focused on substitution effects through decreased fertility (e.g., Levitt & Donohue, 2001; Levine, Staiger, Kane, & Zimmerman, 1999), including increased human capital accumulation, wages, and labor supply of women (Angrist & Evans, 1999; Goldin & Katz, 2002). However, such a shift in spouses’ fertility decision rights may also have generated an income effect, by affecting the balance of power within the couple, thus altering the allocation of resources within householdsFootnote 1 in which the wife is fertile. In particular, according to models of collective household behavior, if abortion legalization increased women’s bargaining power within the household, one would expect a reduction in wives’ labor supply and an increase in husbands’ labor supply. The fact that the predicted effect on female labor supply differs starkly from the one shown in the literature, and the presence of an additional impact on husbands, offer an ideal opportunity to examine the bargaining power effect of abortion legalization. The effects of abortion legalization are identified using state law changes in California, New York, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii in 1970 and the change in federal law in 1973. Although 12 other states legalized abortion between 1967 and 1970, abortion was permitted only under restrictive circumstances such as danger to the life of the mother and rape (Merz, Jackson, & Klerman, 1996). I follow convention and ignore legalization in these states. My identification strategy consists of estimating the effects of legalization on husbands’ and wives’ labor supplies for households that were married prior to the onset of legalization. Prior to Roe v. Wade, the effects of legalization are identified by comparing changes in the labor supply behavior of households in states that legalized abortion with the changes in labor supply of households in other states. Additional identification occurs with the passage of Roe v. Wade, which affected only households in states that had not yet legalized. The bulk of the empirical work in this paper examines changes in labor supplies of married couples using data from the March and June Supplements of the Current Population Survey (CPS) over the period 1968–1979. I also use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) as a robustness check. In principle, it is possible to identify relative changes in intrahousehold bargaining power by comparing labor supplies in households married prior to and households married after the onset of legalization. However, such a comparison runs into tricky selection issues. Selection issues, while not entirely avoidable, are considerably mitigated when investigating changes in behavior in households that were formed prior to legalization. To foreshadow the results, abortion legalization significantly decreased the labor supply of married women in their fertile age by 83 annual hours and significantly increased their husbands’ labor supply by 34 annual hours. In addition, the theory provides a number of other predictions. First, abortion legalization should have no effect on couples with strongly held religious beliefs against abortion. Second, abortion legalization should have little impact on couples who regularly use contraceptives. Third, to the extent that households from the upper part of the income distribution would have been able to obtain abortions more readily even when they were illegal, the effects of legalization should be less evident. The empirical evidence is consistent with these predictions. A number of alternative explanations are considered. There may have been a reduction in the demand for women’s labor in states and at times during which abortion was legal. There could have been an increase in the availability of contraception, in female long-term wages and labor market opportunities relative to men. Divorce laws may also have increased women’s bargaining power or divorce rates may have been affected by abortion legalization. Increased generosity in welfare programs would also have increased the bargaining power of lower income married women, by enhancing the value of single motherhood, or decreased their labor supply by creating disincentives to work. I argue that these phenomena cannot consistently explain my results, given their time and state patterns, my intra-household bargaining predictions, and empirical evidence. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical framework. Section 3 describes the empirical specification and data. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Section 5 considers alternative explanations for the findings. Section 6 concludes the paper. ",28

Lessons from time-use surveys of major English-speaking countries,September 2007,Nancy Folbre,Jayoung Yoon,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"How much time do parents devote to the care of their children, and how is the quantity of parental time affected by factors such as family income, education, and paid employment? The advent of new large-scale time-diary surveys administered to representative samples of national populations makes it possible to answer such questions with some precision. But quantitative precision can conceal conceptual ambiguity. In this paper, we explore several inconsistencies in the temporal categorization of child care and explain their relevance to the measurement of differences and trends in parental child care time. We begin with a general overview of the conceptual issues at stake, illustrated by a comparison of coding categories used in the recent time-diary surveys of four major English-speaking countries: Canada (1998), Australia (1997), the United Kingdom (2000), and the United States (2003). Lack of consensus over the appropriate boundary between child care as a primary activity (“what were you doing?”) or a secondary activity (“were you doing anything else at the same time”) has spilled over into inconsistencies in the measurement of child care as a primary activity. Inconsistencies are even greater in broader measures, whether these are based on reports of a secondary activity or stylized questions regarding time “looking after children” or time in which children were “in your care.” Our comparison of the Canadian and US surveys, which both used stylized questions designed to capture supervisory responsibilities, shows that small differences in wording led to significant differences in the reported results. The second section of the paper examines characteristics of primary child care activity and supervisory child care in the American Time Use Survey 2003. Focusing on married or cohabiting adults living in households with at least one child under the age of six but no child over age 12, we explore the distribution of these types of care, their overlaps, and their density (defined as the ratio of children to adults present during a reported care activity or responsibility). We show that weekly and seasonal variations in primary care activities differ from those in supervisory care. The relationships between maternal work hours and these two types of child care time also differ. These results suggest that analysis of primary child care activities alone provides an incomplete picture of the temporal demands that children impose.",66

For instance, during these 15 years, the LFP rate of married women ages 25–29 rose from 33%–58% in the labor force, an increase of 25% points. In contrast, in the next 15 years—from 1980 to 1995—the LFP rate for this age group grew by only 11% points, to 69% of the labor force. Furthermore, between 1995 and 2005, the LFP rate of married women ages 25–29 decreased slightly to 66.5%. Likewise, during the same 10  years, the LFP of married women ages 30–34 decreased by 2.5% points. Economic explanations of such historical trends in female labor supply have principally focused on the effects of wages, income, educational attainment, and the number of children born to potential labor force participants. In this paper, we argue that historical fluctuations in cohort size, due principally to the changing number of births in adjacent cohorts, cause fluctuations in sex ratios—the ratio of men to women—that affect marriage market conditions. We predict that such fluctuations in sex ratio help explain female LFP rates. Additionally, we predict that sex ratio effects (regional and at the cohort level) will be stronger among women with less education. Both predictions, consistent with both Demand and Supply and collective economic theories of marriage, are tested using individual data from Current Population Surveys for the U.S. as a whole and for each of its four regions (Northeast, Midwest, South and West) covering the 1965–2005 period at 5-year intervals. Our analysis expands on previous analyses of changes in women’s LFP over time by Pencavel (1998) and Grossbard-Shechtman and Granger (1998) that are also based on the analysis of Current Population Survey (CPS) data. Pencavel (1998) documented considerable variation in women’s LFP rates across cohorts and the limited explanatory power of fluctuations in wage and income—both variables typically included in economic models of labor supply. Using time-series aggregated CPS data for the period 1965 to 1990, Grossbard-Shechtman and Granger (1998) showed that the women experiencing the most rapid increases in LFP had been born in a growing cohort, i.e. a baby-boom.
Footnote 1 Using aggregate CPS data, and similar aggregate data for Japan, Fukuda (2006) utilizes an innovative Bayesian cohort model that allows simultaneous estimation of age, period, and cohort effects on female labor force participation. While cohort effects in both countries were substantial—exceeding the size of period effects in their magnitude—the U.S. had larger cohort effects on female LFP than Japan. We add to these studies by including cohort-level sex ratios in our analysis, by allowing for regional variation, and by expanding the time span of the analysis to 2005. Additionally, we examine how sex ratio effects on women’s LFP rates differ by educational attainment. Finally, we carry out the analysis for both married women and for all women regardless of marital status to address variations in the sex ratio effects according to women’s marital status.",44

Doyle Jr.,H. Elizabeth Peters,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"When parents are suspected of child abuse or neglect, their children may be placed with foster families. Each year in the U.S., over 800,000 children spend time in foster care (US DHHS 2006). But despite the fact that over 20 billion dollars are spent each year providing homes and services to children in out-of-home care (Bess et al. 2002), the number of non-relative foster homes is decreasing (Committee on Ways and Means 2000). Between 1984 and 1990 the number of non-relative foster families declined from 147,000 to 100,000. This decline has been attributed to the rise in two worker families, increases in geographic mobility, and other demographic trends (Hegar and Scannapieco 1995). The decrease strained the foster care system and led the GAO to declare a foster care crisis (GAO 1995). Testa and Rolock (1999) argue that increasing wages to attract professional foster homes is one way the shortage of family foster homes will be dealt with in the future. Currently, one-third of foster children are placed with relatives as a means to relieve the foster parent shortage. The aim of this paper is to estimate the impact of changes in subsidies—the monthly amount states pay foster parents to care for foster children—on the quantity of foster care services provided. One innovation in our approach is that we exploit the idea that states do not appear to set market clearing rates, as evidenced by the foster home shortage in the 1980s and 1990s. In states with excess demand for foster care services, variation in foster care subsidies will trace out the supply curve. We develop a reduced-form model of the relationship between foster care placement rates and the monthly subsidy, and estimate it using within-state variation from 1987 to 1995. Past empirical investigations of this relationship provide some evidence that higher subsidy rates increase the quantity of labor supplied to the foster care market (Simon 1975; Campbell and Downs 1987; Chamberlain et al. 1992; Doyle 2007; Paxson and Waldfogel 2003). This paper provides new evidence and, for the first time, explicitly controls for factors which affect demand and supply in the foster care market. The results suggest that the relationship is positive, but only up to a point. For states with high subsidy rates, there appears to be little relationship between the subsidies and placement rates, consistent with the idea that at high subsidy rates some states may have excess supply of foster homes. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background on the demand and supply of foster care services. Section 3 describes the data and offers a first look at the subsidy-foster care placement relationship. Section 4 discusses the identification strategy and presents the empirical model and results. Section 5 offers some conclusions.",22

The insurance system allows mothers and fathers to take parental leaveFootnote 1 and temporary parental leave.Footnote 2 The temporary parental leave insurance compensates parents financially when they have to be absent from work in order to take care of their sick children. As with the parental leave insurance, the reimbursement rate is 80% (see note one), with a ceiling at a yearly income of 273 thousand Swedish krona ($1 ≈ 7 krona). The temporary parental leave insurance covers parents of children 0–12 years old for up to 60 days a year.Footnote 3 When it comes to both parental and temporary parental leave, women take the majority of the compensated days, but there is a large difference in the distribution of compensated days between men and women. During the nineties, women took on average 90% of the compensated days of parental leave, whereas the corresponding figure is 65% for the compensated days of temporary parental leave (hence forward “tpl”). Gender equality is thus much more prominent when it comes to tpl, in spite of the government’s efforts to induce fathers to take more parental leave.Footnote 4 A lot of research concerning factors influencing the distribution of parental leave and the effects of parental leave on labour market outcomes has been undertaken.Footnote 5 However, researchers have tended to neglect tpl. One possible explanation for tpl having a more equal gender distribution than parental leave might be that the former is influenced by cultural and biological factors to a lesser extent than the latter. Thus, it is sometimes argued that, on average, women have a higher productivity than men in parental leave, e.g., since only mothers can breast-feed.Footnote 6 When it comes to tpl, however, both parents’ productivities may be more equal. If there is gender equality, a child gets healthy equally fast regardless of whether the mother or the father takes care of him/her, which seems likely for the most common children’s illnesses. Under this assumption, we investigate the factors influencing the decision making process behind the distribution of tpl within the household.",11

After assuming that we do not know the moment at which the dissolution of marriage takes place, the objective of each agent is to maximize the discounted value of a flow of utilities \(\sum_{t=1}^\infty {\delta ^{t-1}} W_j (U_j ,U_k ); (j\neq k, j,k=w,h), \) where δ denotes the discount factor, common to both agents, and W

 The utility of each agent takes the following general specification: in such a way that utility depends on the consumption of one private good, x

j
, and on the contribution made by each spouse to the provision of a household public good, in the production of which he/she is specialised. Thus, g

j
 and g

k
 denote the available quantities of two household public goods provided by spouse j and spouse k, respectively. In this way, the preference structure considered is in line with the Lundberg and Pollak (1993) separate spheres framework, where the spouses produce different types of household public goods. These decisions, in terms of domestic production and, in consequence, in terms of labor supply, may affect the spouses’ bargaining power. This introduces some difficulties in the sustainability of agreements, since it could be costly for spouses to commit to efficient solutions (Iyigun 2005). In this context, and taking into account that the main objective of this paper is to analyse the effect of the bargaining power on the sustainability of the agreements, we assume that both individuals have identical preferences, with bargaining power and income levels being the only sources of asymmetry between the agents. In the development of the non-cooperative equilibrium, each agent decides, given the decisions made by the other player, both the consumption of the private good and the contribution to the household public good. In this case, the solution of the one-shot game will be given by the Cournot-Nash equilibrium.Footnote 3 Formally, each individual must solve the following conditioned optimization problem: where P

j
 is the price of the household public good provided by j, Y

j
 is the income of individual j (we assume Y

 > Y

w
) and, without loss of generality, the price of the consumption good is normalized to one. The solution of that problem is given by both the amounts of the private good and the public good: with the level of welfare associated with that combination being: We should note that the repetition of the game gives rise to multiple equilibria, some of which must represent Pareto-efficient solutions. Indeed, both agents might implicitly create some strategy that avoids all possible deviation from an optimal solution, and which guarantees the achievement of Pareto-efficiency as a Nash equilibrium in the one-shot game. One of these possible strategies consists of penalizing the agent who deviates unilaterally from the agreement. More specifically, we adopt a relatively simple, but nevertheless commonly employed, punishment scheme, namely the so-called trigger strategy, according to which the quantities of private and public good revert forever to non-cooperative levels following a deviation from the efficient solution on the part of one of the agents.Footnote 4 The threat of punishment through the return to the non-cooperative solution is credible, and guarantees the sustainability of solutions which are more efficient than the Cournot-Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, and again for the sake of simplicity, we consider the case of stationary trajectories,Footnote 5 arguing that a stationary trajectory is sustainable in a sub-game perfect equilibrium if, for all j, the following conditions are satisfied: \(W_{j}^{C} - W_{j}^{N} \ge 0\) and \(\frac{W_{j}^{C} }{(1-\delta )}\ge W_{j}^{Ch} +\delta \frac{{W}_{j}^{N} }{(1-\delta)}, \) where W

C

 and W

Ch

 denote the levels of welfare obtained by agent j in the Pareto-efficient solution derived from the Nash-bargaining agreement, and in the deviation equilibrium, respectively. Note that the second of the restrictions can be expressed in the following form: where \(\bar{\delta}_j\) is the critical discount factor of individual j. Thus, the sustainability of the optimal solution requires that the discount factor, common to both individuals, is greater than or equal to the corresponding critical factor. In other words, the higher the value of that critical factor, the lower the sustainability of the Pareto-efficient equilibrium, given that the set of discount factors which guarantees the sustainability of the agreement will be smaller. In every bargaining solution the contributions to the household public good are always Pareto-efficient. Being that t is an internal transfer from one spouse to the other, specifically, the husband transfers an amount of income to his spouse, then the set of efficient solutions is determined by the following problem: From the first-order conditions, and satisfying the second-order conditions, we can deduce the levels of private consumption and the provision of the public goods, as well as the optimum level of transfer t*: Substituting such values in the objective function, we obtain the utility possibilities frontier W

Footnote 7 That is to say, they choose the stationary trajectory of amounts that maximizes the product of the utilities normalized by the levels associated with the non-cooperative equilibrium. Formally, the equilibrium can be obtained from the solution to the following maximization problem: where β ∈ [0,1] denotes the bargaining power of the husband, and (1 − β) represents that of the wife. There are various factors which determine the value of the said parameter (see Agarwal 1997). For example, in certain societies there are legal restrictions that limit women’s control over property, which have a negative influence on their bargaining power. Similarly, various institutional practices, such as the refusal to grant loans to a woman without the consent of her husband, or cultural norms such as the concept of honour and submission to the will of the husband, can suppose greater bargaining power for men than for women. From an individual point of view, each spouse can rely on individual factors of bargaining power, such as education or his/her physical strength. By analogy, in marriage each spouse can employ strategies that increase his/her bargaining power. Nevertheless, such a possibility is beyond the scope of this analysis and, in its place, it is assumed that parameter β is given exogenously. The first order condition for this problem satisfies: where: is the welfare level of the husband that, introduced in the utility possibilities frontier, determines the spouse’s welfare level associated with the bargaining solution: where: Furthermore, if one of the agents decides to unilaterally deviate from the agreement, then he/she must choose the combination of the amounts of both the private good and the public good that solve the following problem: If it is the husband who deviates from the bargaining solution, we obtain the equilibrium in deviation: where the associated level of satisfaction is: Assuming that it is the wife who unilaterally deviates from the agreement, the levels of both private consumption and provision of the household public good are: with the welfare level being:",2

The shifting impact of housework on economic inequality,March 2008,Cathleen D. Zick,W. Keith Bryant,Sivithee Srisukhumbowornchai,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"While the economic value of housework has been recognized by family economists for many years (Reid 1934; Warren 1940; Wiegand 1954; Wilson 1929), it was not until the path-breaking work of Becker (1965) that more mainstream economists acknowledged that households enhance their access to goods and services by spending time doing both housework and market work. Today, there is general agreement that the time spent by household members cooking meals, laundering clothing, gardening, etcetera enhances economic well-being. This recognition has led to an international literature seeking to incorporate housework and other non-market work (e.g., volunteer work) into a system of national accounts that document the economic activities of countries (see for example, Ironmonger 1996; Ironmonger and Soupourmas 2003; Landefeld and McCulla 2000; Lutzel 1996). A smaller literature has arisen that asks whether housework, when valued monetarily and added to household income, markedly changes the distribution of economic well-being. If low income households do more housework than high income households, and if the per hour value of low income households’ housework is similar to that done by high income households, then housework makes the income distribution more equal. If, on the other hand, low income households do less housework than more affluent households or if the per hour value of housework is positively correlated with money income, then housework may well exacerbate income inequalities. While economists define economic well-being conceptually to be the household’s access to goods and services, empirically it is almost always measured by money income.Footnote 1 Money income provides a fairly accurate indicator of access to goods and services that can be purchased in the marketplace, but it fails to measure access to goods and services that are a result of household production. Such an omission means that empirical estimates of household economic well-being based solely on money income are biased if money income and household production are correlated. Money income inequality has been rising in the United States since the late 1980s (Cohen et al. 2002). If the amount of housework done has been constant through time, then adding the value of housework to money income would not affect this trend toward greater income inequality. But, researchers who have looked at trends in housework find that American women’s time spent in housework has substantially declined over much of the past century while American men’s housework time has risen modestly (Aguiar and Hurst 2006; Bryant 1996; Robinson and Godbey 1997; Sayer 2005). In this paper, we examine whether the decline in the total amount of housework done by American women and the rise in housework done by American men have ameliorated or exacerbated the rising inequality in money income. Using time-diary data, we compare how adults’ housework time influenced households’ real access to goods and services at two points in time, 1975–1976 and 2002–2003. We also assess the extent to which any change in income inequality is associated with the socio-demographic changes that have occurred over the past quarter century. To do this, we decompose the change in economic well-being into: (a) socio-demographic shifts in marital status, race/ethnicity, age, number of minor children, and women’s education levels and employment behavior, and (b) changes in preferences, household technology, and labor markets. By using data from 1975–1976 and 2002–2003, we assess change over a time period when the United States experienced considerable shifts in both these socio-demographic and economic characteristics.",9

Grawe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In their seminal economic contribution to our understanding of the “quality–quantity trade-off” in fertility (the negative relationship between number of siblings and child achievement), Becker and Lewis (1973) and Willis (1973) (hereafter, BLW) emphasize the role of resource limitations. The key feature of the model is a budget constraint in which number of children and per capita child quality interact. This interaction creates positive correlations between quantity of children and the shadow price of quality and between quality of children and the shadow price of fertility. The BLW model allows for both temporal and financial inputs into child human capital. However, because BLW assume a constant opportunity cost of time invested in children the quality–quantity trade-off does not result from temporal constraints alone.Footnote 1 Credit constraints are essential. This emphasis on financial constraints carries through to discussions within the subsequent empirical literature (See, for instance, Ermisch and Francesconi 2001; Iacovou 2001). There is certainly good reason to think carefully about the possible connection between observed family size effects and credit market failure. However, it seems equally wise to distinguish evidence of resource constraints (broadly) from evidence of financial constraints. In the following section, an extension of the BLW model is presented. The extension allows that either/both financial and temporal limitations cause the quality–quantity trade-off. The section concludes by identifying an empirical test, which distinguishes the two resource constraints. If financial constraints explain family size effects, such effects should be absent among high-earning families (who are presumably unconstrained) and increase as parental income decreases. Section 3 describes the National Child Development Study data used in Sect. 4 to implement this test. When adult measures of child achievement are used, the results provide weak evidence in support of both financial and temporal constraint interpretations. However, the results based on child achievement are entirely at odds with the financial interpretation and wholly consistent with a temporal constraint. Section 5 considers study limitations and the final section concludes by noting the importance of differentiating financial from temporal resource constraints.",7

Historically, their lead in this arena originated decades ago when the state started intervening in trying to alleviate the conflicts between motherhood and work life. In a detailed study of family-friendly policies across OECD countries, the Nordic countries led on most of the indices (OECD 2001). At the same time, these countries have succeeded in maintaining a high rate of female labor force participation without reducing fertility to the low levels characterizing many other European countries. Thus, the Nordic countries seem to be better prepared to tackle the future challenges for welfare states posed by an ageing population. Nordic countries have traditionally also been considered leaders with respect to equal opportunity and women’s position in society and the labor market. Scandinavian women were among the first to get equal pay by law, though not necessarily in practice. They have also had extended rights to receive social income transfers compared to women in most other countries because of means testing against individual rather than family income for many income support schemes, and also because taxation schemes in some of these countries have been, at least since the 1970s, based predominantly on individual and not family income.Footnote 1
 The high labor force participation rate of women has gone hand in hand with the expansion of the welfare states. The large increase in public services directed to child care (besides extensive services related to care for the elderly and the disabled) implied that women were able to leave the home and enter the labor market, often employed in the public sector in care jobs but now for a salary instead of doing unpaid housework. The expansion of the welfare state has increased the tax pressure in these countries to the highest level in the world, but the Nordic countries are still among the richest in the world. Although the ‘Nordic model’ has succeeded in maintaining a high rate of female employment, we conjecture that certain ‘boomerang’ effects of family-friendly policies have arisen with regard to women’s position in the labor market. Generous parental leave schemes at high compensation rates and long leave periods allow mothers to take considerable time out of work in connection with childbirth and to return to their previous jobs due to job rights and a high provision of publicly subsidized day care. The widespread take-up of these schemes exclusively by mothers, however, may be the reason for an emerging deterioration of women’s position in the labor market in these countries. For instance, Swedish and Danish women have experienced a complete stagnation of the gender wage gap and considerable child penalties on wages after the introduction of such schemes. The high participation rates of women and the large proportion of children in non-parental child care may also have consequences for the welfare of children and families and the development of children’s cognitive skills. Further, the Nordic model is costly i.e. the proportion of GDP which is allocated to relieve women from their duties at home is high and from a public finance perspective, long and generous parental leaves and high-quality public day care constitute a rather expensive solution at a time when public budgets are under pressure due to the ageing of the population. In this paper we present an overview of the impacts of family-friendly policies in Nordic countries. We draw some policy implications of the effects of these schemes on gender equality, which is a generally accepted goal of most governments worldwide. We evaluate the ‘Nordic model’ with respect to the two modes of child care i.e. parental care facilitated by fairly generous maternal and parental leave schemes or non-parental publicly provided care. Our questions for discussion are: Is the ‘Nordic model’ worth the cost if effects on child development and welfare are taken into account? Is there a trade-off between family-friendly policies and family welfare, and have there been serious boomerang effects of family-friendly policies on women’s position in the labor market? In answering these questions we restrict the discussion to the leave and child care systems (see Jaumotte (2004) for a recent and comprehensive analysis of the female labor supply effects of schemes such as taxation of couples and subsidies to child families in OECD countries). In the rest of the paper, we first briefly describe the historical evolution of child care and leave policies in the Nordic countries. Next, we present effects on female labor supply and employment of the use of family-friendly measures. Then we examine the consequences for equal opportunity and other outcomes, such as fertility, family welfare and the cognitive skills of children. Finally, we analyze the financial costs and benefits of public child care and leave schemes and conclude with an overall assessment.",140
6.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,30 January 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-007-9026-x,"Gender preference, biased sex ratio, and parental investments in single-child households",June 2008,Michael C. M. Leung,Junsen Zhang,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Unbalanced sex ratio at birth (SRB) has been common in Asian regions (Zeng et al. 1993; Gu and Roy 1995; Park and Cho 1995, Eberstadt 2004). For example, excessive SRB has been a persistent phenomenon in China since the 1980s.
Footnote 1 Overall SRB in China reached 116.9 in 2000. Particularly, the SRB in the Provinces of Guangdong and Hainan rose to 130.3 and 135.6, respectively, according to the fifth census released by the National Bureau of Statistics.
Footnote 2 Biasness in higher orders of birth also prevailed in Taiwan and Korea, as well as, in some parts of India.
Footnote 3 Oster (2005) pointed out that a biased SRB could be due to an epidemiological reason, such as high prevalence of Hepatitis B, in countries such as China and India. The practice of gender selection, however, is another common reason for a biased SRB. It was estimated that millions of female fetuses had been aborted in Asia (Miller 2001). Preference for sons is believed to be an underlying motivation for such selection.
Footnote 4
 Preference for sons in China is deeply rooted and dates back to the origins of ancestral worship more than 4,000 years ago (Lee and Wang 1999). According to Bernhardt (1995), only sons could carry the family name, claim inheritance, and perform rituals to honor family spirits. Daughters were also disadvantaged since their marriages were dependent on the dowries.
Footnote 5 Miller (2001) pointed out that preference for sons was largely due to the dowry payment system that prevailed in the Indian marriage market. Daughters were thus perceived culturally inferior, as net economic and emotional losses, and some parents regulated the sex ratio and the size of the family by practicing female infanticide. Preference for sons may also be responsible for differential parental investments by gender. According to the Human Development Report (2003), the ratio of school enrollment for girls relative to boys was consistently lower in almost all developing regions. In addition to the preference for sons, lower educational investments in girls by parents might also result from higher opportunity costs of sending them to school in developing regions; for instance, daughters tended to engage more in daily family activities. Labor market discrimination against women also directly discouraged parental investments in daughters. Despite the fact that preference for sons and a biased sex ratio prevail in China, there has been a tremendous improvement in gender equality in education over the last decade. According to survey data from the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Science, overall parental investments in sons and daughters were similar. However, single-girl households on the average spent 2.55% more on children’s education than all households with children. In addition, single-girl households spent significantly more on children than single-boy households (Yueh 2006). An obvious long-term effect of an unbalanced SRB is marriage market squeezes.
Footnote 6 A marriage market crowded with single males will inevitably lower their chance of marriage. As a consequence, it will raise the likelihood of parents receiving elderly care from their unmarried sons in their old age. Taking into consideration parental altruism toward children, as well as exchange between parental investments and children’s services, we focus on the relationship between preference for sons, biased sex ratio, and parental investments. In this article, the notion of parental investments can be broadly interpreted as investments in human and social capital that ultimately enhance the chances of a child’s marriage. Besides human and social capital, investments in health that enhance the chance of a child’s survival are also considered. Previous studies on investments in children by Becker (1960, 1962, 1965), Mincer (1963), Willis (1973), Becker and Lewis (1973), Leibowitz (1975), Becker and Tomes (1976), and Becker (1991) emphasized household’s choices of quantity and quality of children in unitary utility models. Studies by Gronau (1970), Freiden (1974), Keeley (1974, 1979), and Grossbard (1978) instead emphasized the notions of specialization, exchange, and marriage formation, as well as marriage market equilibrium. McElroy and Horney (1981), Manser and Brown (1980), Chiappori (1992), Pollak (1994), and Lundberg and Pollak (1993, 1996) emphasized the allocation within marriage under either cooperative or non-cooperative bargaining between parental caregivers. Thomas (1990) pointed out that allocation of resources within households is important to the health formation of children. Specifically, children would have better health outcomes when mothers controlled resources within a family.
Footnote 7 Other related literature includes Edlund (1999), who addressed the relationship between son preference, marital status, and sex selection but did not emphasize investments in children; Peters and Siow (2001), who investigated premarital and health investments in children; and Siow and Zhu (2002), who investigated the implications of differential fecundities on parental investments. Choo and Siow (2006) estimated a transferable utility model of the marriage market, showing the negative correlation between the legalization of abortion and the value of marriage. This article contributes to the current literature by linking parental investments, gender preference, and marriage of children. This paper treats expenditures on children as investment decisions motivated by exchange and altruism under a unitary utility model of households. Instead of modeling differential investments in children within a household in which preferences and distribution of power among parents are important, we focus on parental investments in single-child households. In the context of single-child households, the interpretation of the parental preference for a child’s gender must be refined. In households with two children, parents may prefer sons to carry their family names but prefer care from daughters, especially when they become old. In single-child households, however, parental preferences for a child’s gender and services become overlapped. In the context of single-child households, there must also be a mechanism linking parental investment decisions in sons and daughters; otherwise, these investment decisions are independent. A plausible candidate for such linkage is the marriage market in which a sex ratio plays an important role. These features will be emphasized throughout the article. Furthermore, focusing on single-child households also enables us to analyze the situation in China, where a one-child policy is enforced in cities and children are implicitly required by law to take care of their parents. How would preference for sons affect parental investments in children when a one-child policy is enforced? This article considers four aspects of the determination of parental investments, which include the discrimination against females in the marriage market, the preference for sons and children’s services, an increase in sex ratio in the marriage market, and an endogenous sex ratio, which is determined by health investments in young children. The article presents a model in which a child’s chance of marriage is a function of parental investments in the child. Parents value a child’s marriage and they choose parental investments prior to the children’s marriage in a competitive marriage market. Parental investments in sons and daughters are then related via the marriage market by positive assortative matching, and are eventually determined by Nash equilibrium. We subsequently consider the impacts of a preference for sons and a higher sex ratio on the amount of investments made by parents.
Footnote 8
 This article shows that parental investments in children will be increased when parental preference becomes son-biased. However, a rise in the sex ratio (perhaps due to son preference) renders conflicting effects on the level of parental investments in sons and daughters. It is possible that parental investments in sons increase and correspondingly parental investments in daughters decrease due to a rise in the sex ratio. However, it is also possible that even in the presence of a preference for sons a rise in the sex ratio will result in an increase in investments in daughters. Furthermore, it is also theoretically possible that a rise in the sex ratio may either trigger more or less investments in both sons and daughters. Hence, when a son-biased sex ratio is driven by a preference for sons, no definite conclusion can be drawn on its effect on parental investments in children. When health investments precede other forms of parental investments, a preference for sons induces a higher sex ratio, which in turn creates convoluted effects on other forms of parental investments in children. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the details of the model. Section 3 describes the model’s equilibrium concept. Section 4 considers the implications of a preference for sons and a biased sex ratio on parental investments in children. Section 5 considers health investments that influence the sex ratio and the effect of son preference on health investments and other forms of parental investments before children marry. Section 6 concludes and highlights issues arising from the introduction of heterogeneous children.",7

The effect of obesity on cohabitation and marriage in the USA,June 2008,Sankar Mukhopadhyay,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The formation of marital and cohabiting unions in the United States has changed significantly over the last few decades. While marriage rates have fallen, more and more people now live together in a `marriage like’ cohabiting relationship. Since 1960 there has been a dramatic increase in the number of “persons of opposite sex sharing living quarters (POSSLQ),” increasing from 439,000 in 1960 to 5,368,000 in 2006, an increase of more than 1,200% (U.S. Census Bureau 2007). At the same time, there has been a rapid rise in the labor force participation rate for women, and this increase implies that the potential gains from trade have diminished for both men and women. This paper examines the nature of mate selection in both marital and nonmarital unions. We consider both cohabitation and marriage. Marriage is the traditional union, but cohabitation is on the rise. Although cohabitation represents a significant relationship commitment, it is not equivalent to marriage.Footnote 1 On average, cohabitation tends to be shorter than marriage, and there is usually much less investment in relationship-specific capital (e.g., children). Given the differences between marriage and cohabitation, mate selection processes may differ significantly between the two.Footnote 2
 In examining what men and women value in selecting mates, we focus on obesity as a proxy for physical attractiveness.Footnote 3 Of course, focusing on attractiveness without accounting for other characteristics like economic resources, social/family background, or health may be misleading. Grossbard (1993) hypothesized that people often pay their spouse a “quasi wage” for their spousal labor. This “quasi wage” may be paid in the form of access to income or commitment to the relationship. She also observed a gender asymmetry, i.e. men are more likely to “hire” women for spousal labor than vice-versa. The dramatic increase in the labor force participation of women has reduced many women’s need for access to a husband’s income, so the primary incentive marriage now provides to women may be the man’s long-term commitment to the relationship and to raising children. Women’s labor force participation may also imply that men cannot expect the same degree of domestic service from marriage anymore. To address these possibilities, we control for income as well as a variety of other factors as we seek to understand whether obesity status affects the two genders differently in the two different forms of union formation, a result which would suggest a different preference structure. Several researchers have found evidence that obesity adversely affects the probability of marriage, especially for women (Averett and Korenmann 1996; Fu and Goldman 1996; Gortmaker et al. 1993). There is also some evidence that dating is less likely for heavier girls (Cawley et al. 2006). The literature on the impact of economic resources on marriage is much larger, although an overwhelming number of studies have found a positive association between economic resources and marriage. In this paper we look at the first entry into either a cohabiting relationship or marriage, allowing us not only to better understand the mate selection process, but also to learn about the preference structure of men and women regarding these two forms of union. Using NLSY97 data we find that, while both obese men and obese women are less likely to enter into a cohabitating relation, only obese women are less likely to get married. Income, on the other hand, positively affects all relationships and all genders symmetrically. This suggests that even though women are less likely to accept an obese man in a cohabitating relationship, they are not less likely to accept an obese man in marriage. Thus it seems that women care about a man’s appearance, but are willing to trade it away to get married. This suggests that women perceive marriage as a special form of union, providing extra utility (e.g. from children). Men, however, do not appear to perceive a comparable extra utility from marriage, so obese women are less likely to get married.

Malo,Fernando Muñoz-Bullón,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The historic increase in women’s participation in the labor market has been widely documented (Mincer 1962). In spite of this, women not only spend less time overall in the labor market than men, but they are also less likely to work continuously (Mincer and Polachek 1974, 1978; Corcoran and Duncan 1979; Goldin 1989; Hill and O’Neill 1992). Thus, it is not only important to consider women’s total work experience during their life course, but also their intermittent attachment to paid employment. For instance, the following two scenarios are rather different: a 45-year-old woman who starts work at 30 and then works continuously for 15 years; a same-aged woman who starts work at 16, leaves the labor market at 21, returns at 35, and then works for an additional 10-year period. While the first case is an example of continuous labor market attachment following a delayed entry into the labor market, the second is an example of a typical career break due to marriage or childcare. This article examines the relation between labor market breaks for family-related reasons—i.e., leaving work to have a baby or to care for children or the home—and women’s occupational prestige. Sicherman and Galor (1990) recommend using occupational prestige scores to measure career mobility, since they unambiguously increase (decrease) with higher (lower) job quality. Thus, using these scores avoids the typical problem associated with wages: an increase in wages arising from occupational mobility might reflect a transition to a job with negative characteristics compensated (partially or totally) by a higher wage (i.e., a transition to a worse job). Information on prestige scores is provided in the British Household Panel Survey. The second and third waves of this survey include retrospective information on the whole range of employment statuses—including unemployment and inactivity periods—from the first job held to the year 1993. This allows us to analyze women’s employment histories during the twentieth century in Great Britain (the North of Scotland is excluded from the survey). Thus, these data are particularly suitable for studying the association between family-related breaks and women’s labor careers. A significant challenge for the literature on intermittent interruptions in the working career is to disentangle the effects of family-related quits on women’s careers—here, the occupational prestige—from the effects of choosing an occupation in anticipation of future family-related quits. Women, because of their choices regarding household activity, may choose careers that make frequent interruptions easier. This may involve lower-prestige occupations. Gronau (1988), among others, has studied this ‘chicken-or-egg’ problem. We deal with this version of the endogeneity bias by assuming that individuals have rational expectations about their future careers. We use the observed ‘future’ family-related quits as a proxy for women’s expectations when choosing their ‘current’ occupations. Our results show that the average occupational prestige of women’s careers is lower for women who take a break from work than for those who work continuously. Nevertheless, we find evidence of an endogeneity bias, suggesting that women’s choice of jobs is affected by their expectations of family-related quits. Thus, in anticipation of future career interruptions women are initially more present in lower-prestige occupations, and this explains the negative correlation between their occupational prestige and their family-related breaks. The rest of this article is as follows. The next section presents a review of the literature on women’s family-related mobility. In the third section, we describe the main characteristics of the database, and present a detailed descriptive analysis. Section 4 presents the econometric estimations. The final section summarizes the main conclusions of the article.",12

6.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,19 March 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-008-9030-9,A demographic analysis of the family structure experiences of children in the United States,September 2008,David M. Blau,Wilbert van der Klaauw,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Many children growing up in the United States in recent decades have spent a significant part of their childhood living in non-traditional family structures. Major increases in divorce, out-of-wedlock childbearing, and cohabitation have resulted in rapid growth in the prevalence of alternative family structures, such as living with the biological mother and the biological father in a cohabiting (unmarried) relationship, the biological mother and a step father, and the biological mother and no man. An important question of interest to social scientists, policy makers, and parents is how growing up in alternative family structures affects children, compared to the traditional experience of being raised by married biological parents. A large literature spanning several disciplines has analyzed the effects of children’s family structure experiences on psychological, social, demographic, and economic outcomes, both during childhood and subsequently in adulthood.Footnote 1
 An important issue raised by such studies is what determines the family structure experienced by children during the course of their childhood. Factors that influence family structure may also have a direct impact on child outcomes, making it difficult to infer causality from correlations. But the family structure experiences of children are of independent interest as well. The proximate determinants of family structure are fundamental demographic behaviors: incidence and timing of childbearing, cohabitation, and marriage. A key point recognized in the literature is that the interaction between childbearing and marital behavior determines the family structure experienced by children. There are many studies of the demographic behaviors that influence family structure, but most of these studies do not draw implications from their findings for the family structure experienced by children. This is because the latter requires an integrated analysis. For example, divorce presumably affects children differently if they were alive at the time of the divorce compared to being born after the divorce. Similarly, the impact on children of a cohabiting versus a married relationship between a child’s biological parents may depend on whether the child was born before or during the cohabitation. The impact on a child of being born out of wedlock is likely to depend on whether the mother and biological father subsequently marry or cohabit, and if so, how soon after the birth of the child. A handful of studies analyze the implications of marital and childbearing behavior for the family structure experiences of children. But these studies have taken a limited perspective because they typically analyze only a subset of the relevant behaviors. For example, some studies focus only on divorce (Waite and Lillard 1991) or formation of formal unions (Upchurch et al. 2001), while others focus only on children who were born out of wedlock (Brien et al. 1999; Aquilino 1996; Carlson et al. 2004). An important issue in analyzing demographic behavior from the perspective of children is the identity of the man with whom a mother lives. A woman who has given birth to a child outside of a co-residential relationship is at risk of entering a co-residential relationship with the father of the child and with other men. When analyzing relationship formation from the mother’s perspective, this distinction is rarely made (Graefe and Lichter 1999 is an exception). It could be important for the durability of the relationship, and thus important to analyze from the mother’s perspective. But it is critical for understanding the family structure experiences of children born outside of a co-residential union. In this paper we provide a more comprehensive demographic analysis of the family structure experiences of children than has been reported in previous studies. We jointly analyze transitions among co-residential union states defined by single, cohabiting, and married, together with childbearing and the identity of men from the perspective of children: biological father or stepfather. Modeling transitions into and out of cohabitation, marriage, and single status jointly with childbearing behavior provides a richer picture of family dynamics than does analyzing marital behavior in isolation. And modeling the identity of men from the perspective of children provides a unique perspective on transitions of children among living arrangements. The analysis uses data from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). These data provide detailed histories of the relevant demographic events, and unlike many other surveys, provide information on biological and non-biological fathers for each child.Footnote 2 These data have been used in many previous analyses of family structure, but we exploit the richness of the data more fully than in previous studies, particularly the information on the identity of men from the perspective of children. The most striking finding of the analysis is the large difference between the children of black and white mothers in time spent living with the biological father. Children of non-Hispanic white mothers spend 74% of their childhood years living with their biological mother and father on average, compared to 33% for children of non-Hispanic black mothers. Children of Hispanic mothers are closer to whites at 65%.Footnote 3 It is also notable that the distribution of time spent living with the biological father is heavily skewed for children of black mothers: the median is only 0.3 years, and 49% of children of black mothers never live with the biological father. The distributions are much more symmetric for the children of white and Hispanic mothers. Surprisingly, estimates of the duration of childhood spent with both biological parents have not been presented previously in the literature. An important source of the difference between blacks and whites is the role of the mother’s status at the time of conception. For both groups, the mother’s marital status at birth plays a dominant role in determining time spent with the biological father during childhood. However, if the mother was single at the time the child was conceived, the percent of childhood spent with the biological mother and father together is 46% for whites, and 14% for blacks. The black-white difference results from the fact that “shotgun” weddings and cohabitations are much more common for whites than for blacks (Manning 2004; Manning et al. 2004). Another important source of the difference is the higher propensity of black women to conceive children outside of a co-residential union. We find that controlling for the mother’s family background and educational attainment does not reduce the black–white gap in the proportion of childhood spent with both biological parents by very much.",6

Loughran,Ashlesha Datar,M. Rebecca Kilburn,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It is widely assumed among social scientists that children are born with some set of endowments that have the potential to significantly impact their long-run educational, labor market, and health outcomes. Endowments are typically broadly construed to encompass genetic and prenatal influences that result in basic differences in mental and physical capacities between children at birth. It is also widely accepted among social scientists that parental investment has the potential to reinforce or compensate for these endowments. The theoretical and empirical literature on parental investment focuses almost exclusively on how parents allocate specific investments between their children conditional on their children’s endowments. This literature typically finds evidence that parents reinforce endowments, allocating relatively more resources to their higher-endowed children (Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1988; Pitt et al. 1990; Behrman et al. 1982; Behrman et al. 1994; Datar et al. 2006), although at least one study presents evidence that parental investment compensates for low endowments (Conley et al. 2003a). However, many investments that parents make in their children are shared wholly or in part among all their children. For example, neighborhood choice (and, hence, school quality), family structure, completed family size, parental labor supply, and the availability of books, learning materials, and other technologies in the household are likely to affect more than one sibling. A priori, we have no reason to believe that the potential for such household parental investments (i.e., investments available to all siblings) to impact child outcomes is any more or less than the potential for child-specific parental investments (i.e., investments targeted at particular siblings) to impact child outcomes. From a policy perspective, the impact of household parental investment on child outcomes and how it responds to endowments is relevant since many public policies are concerned with raising aggregate levels of investment in children (e.g., raising family income, encouraging family formation) rather than directly affecting the allocation of parental investment within the household. Since we cannot comprehensively account for household parental investments with specific variables available in nationally representative data sets, like the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-Child file (NLSY-C), which we use here, nor can we directly measure endowments, we employ an indirect approach in this paper to assess whether household parental investment reinforces or compensates for endowments. This approach compares estimates of the impact of birth weight, which we treat as an observed correlate of endowments,Footnote 1 on child test scores derived from ordinary least squares (OLS) and sibling fixed-effect models. Noting sibling fixed-effect models control for both common endowments (i.e., endowments shared in common among all siblings) and household parental investment, we then argue that, if we can control for common endowments in our OLS model, the difference between OLS and fixed-effect coefficient estimates on birth weight can be attributed solely to differences in household parental investment correlated with birth weight and test scores. The sign of this difference in estimated OLS and fixed-effect birth weight coefficients tells us whether household parental investment reinforces or compensates for low birth weight. The key assumptions necessary for this inference are that observed variables in our data control for common endowments, and that OLS and fixed-effect estimates of the impact of birth weight on child outcomes are equally biased by the failure to control for specific endowments (i.e., that part of a child’s endowment that is particular to him or her) and child-specific parental investments. We must further assume that birth weight is measured without error.Footnote 2
 The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we specify an empirical model of birth weight and child test scores and then use that model to explain how the response of household and child-specific parental investment to birth weight can bias estimates of the impact of birth weight on child outcomes derived from OLS models. Section 3 develops the intuition behind our test for compensating or reinforcing household parental investment by examining recently published estimates of the short- and long-term effects of birth weight derived from data on twins. Section 4 then specifies a sibling fixed-effect model of child outcomes and birth weight and delineates the key assumptions we must make in order to interpret the difference between OLS and fixed-effect models as evidence of whether household parental investment reinforces or compensates for low birth weight. We discuss how we implement our empirical model using data from the NLSY-C in Sect. 5 and present our empirical results in Sect. 6. We conclude in Sect. 7.",7

This paper focuses on the fact that, with a very few exceptions, empirical studies of the impact of migration on income and poverty have tended to overlook an important component of this impact, namely the change in household size. Such an approach is justified when migration is taken as given and the focus is on the impact of remittances once migration has taken place. A different though related issue that has been examined in the literature is the income and poverty impact of migration, which includes the positive impact of remittances as well as the loss of income migrants earned before migrating. It is here that changes in household size play an important role and must be incorporated in the analysis. This paper estimates the impact of migration on poverty for three poverty measures: the share of the population below the poverty line, the average distance of the poor’s income from the poverty line, and the average of the squared distance from the poverty line. The analysis considers four groups of migrant households: those with internal, international, internal and international, and internal and/or international migrants (the latter group consisting of all migrants). Based on household surveys, I show in the case of Ghana (Albania) that migration’s impact on income that corrects for the change in household size fluctuates between 2.7 and 4.5 (2.5–3.8) times the uncorrected impact. The corresponding figures for the poverty impact fluctuate between 2.6 and 4.4 (1.1–2.5). These figures illustrate the importance of taking the migration-induced change in household size into account in the estimation of migration’s income and poverty impact. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 examines how existing studies in the poverty and in the migration literature have dealt with household-size related issues. Section 3 examines analytically how migration’s impact on income and poverty changes when its impact on household size is taken into account. Section 4 looks at aggregate international migration data for Ghana and Albania. Section 5 derives the results empirically and compares them with those obtained by Taylor et al. (2003). Section 6 examines how temporary migration and household composition issues affect the results. Section 7 concludes.",5

Jepsen,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"It has often been recognized that two of the three basic outcomes examined in this issue—wage differentials in earnings and couple formation—are causally related. Which is the chicken, and which is the egg? Are individuals with more attractive traits more likely to form couples, or does being in couple enhance individual traits? The question can be asked more precisely if the problem is defined more rigorously. This is often called a wage premium. We define a coupling earnings differential as the difference between what an individual earns if in-couple and what that person earns if single: where ΔE stands for differential in earnings between the two couple states for individuals of gender i, sexual orientation k, and possibly in couple with a partner j; IC stands for ‘in-couple’ and includes marriage and/or cohabitation; and S stands for ‘single.’Footnote 4 These coupling differentials can be defined more narrowly, such as married vs. single, or more broadly, such as cohabiting vs. living alone. The rational individual chooses to be in-couple based on a comparison of the benefits of being in-couple and those of staying single. Define B

IC
 as the net benefits of being in-couple (IC) with an individual j versus remaining single (S): where B

Sik
 are the benefits of being single. The individual’s extra benefits of being in-couple versus staying single are a function of the individual’s disposable income in both coupling states. Next, we define disposable income for an individual in-couple. It is assumed for simplicity that for a coupled individual disposable income originates solely from two sources: earnings from the labor market and intra-household transfers from the partner: where DI stands for disposable income, E for earnings, and QWT for intra-household transfers from one partner to the other (explained in further detail below). These transfers can be positive or negative and may be correlated with earnings. If benefits B vary with DI in each coupling state they are also a function of earnings in each state: where ΔE stands for differential in earnings between the two couple states and Z denotes all relevant factors beyond those related to individual disposable income. In turn, the decision to participate in a couple (married, whether registered or not) is a function of benefit function 2′. Therefore participation in couple P with a potential partner j is a function of the additional earnings ΔE. More formally: Note that the Z vector in Eq. 4 differs from that in Eq. 2′. It follows that whether a person is in couple or not (P equal to one or zero) is a function of the coupling differential in earnings ΔE

ICSijk
. At the same time, as evident from Eq. 1, the degree to which an individual’s earnings E benefit (or suffer) from being in couple is a function of whether the person is in-couple and if so, of the characteristics of partner j. The existing economic literature, especially that on wage premia, is attentive to the possible dual causality here. As a result, econometric models of wage premia typically include an equation estimating selection into coupling. When analyzing other outcomes related to coupling, such as individual consumption, the existing literature rarely relies on the same theoretical framework.Footnote 5 Here we integrate distribution aspects of coupling into the same system of equations defined for the same representative individual. The following equation applies to individual outcome A, let us say own consumption by an individual in couple. This outcome is a function of the individual’s disposable income DI. where Y denotes a vector of factors other than own income influencing the outcome, including the partner’s earnings. We then replace DI with its components described in Eq. 3 and obtain: Equation 5′ states that a distributional outcome, such as consumption by one member of a couple, is a function of an individual’s labor market earnings, intra-household transfers from one partner to the other labeled QWT, and a vector of other factors Y′, including the partner’s earnings. Following Grossbard-Shechtman (1984), we assume that in a representative couple one partner (the principal household worker) performs more of the household production.Footnote 6 It is often the case that this individual’s partner (likely to be the principal earner) compensates the principal household worker by transferring access to part or all of her earnings. To emphasize parallels between labor relations in firms and in couples, transfers to the principal worker (the equivalent of a worker in a firm) from the other partner (the equivalent of an employer) are called Quasi-Wage Transfers. This theoretical framework helps us see how all the themes addressed in this special issue are intertwined. Next, we look at some of the results presented in the following mostly empirical articles.",24

Graham,Jason Barr,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"As recently as 1970, more than 70% of all households in the United States were headed by married couples; by 2000 less than 52% were married couples, and by 2005 this percentage appears to have fallen below 50%. While a large portion of this decline can be attributed to the growth in one-person households and single-parent families, another contributing factor is likely to be the growing number of households headed by unmarried couples, both opposite sex and same sex. Until recently, however, the direct causal relationship (if any) between married and unmarried couples could not be studied in any detail because there was no national count of the number of unmarried couples until the 1990 Census (Casper et al. 1999). Since then, social scientists, political pundits and even the general public have speculated about potential causal links between the decline in marriage and the growth in the number of both heterosexual couples who choose not to marry and homosexual couples who cannot marry. The most dramatic example of the belief that marriage has suffered directly from a growing presence of unmarried couples—in this case, same sex couples—has been the debate surrounding recent federal and state efforts to define and defend marriage. In response to a ruling by the Supreme Court of Hawaii favorable to gay couples, Congress passed and President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in September 1996. DOMA defines marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman for purposes of all federal law and further decrees that states need not recognize a marriage from another state if it is between persons of the same sex. To date, 44 states have enacted their own DOMA laws, and 26 states have gone even further by amending their state constitutions to prohibit same sex marriage.Footnote 1
 Behind this marriage protection legislation is the widespread but often unstated belief that allowing same sex couples to marry would undermine traditional marriage. Perhaps surprisingly, there is no peer-reviewed social science evidence either for or against this belief. What little evidence does exist comes mostly from political pundits and journalists such as Gallagher (2004) and Kurtz (2004). For example, Kurtz has argued that demographic data from Scandinavia “prove the case” that extending marriage-like benefits to same sex couples has caused a decline in marriage rates and marital fertility. Responding to Kurtz, Eskridge and Spedale (2006) examine in detail the legislative history of same sex registered partnerships in northern Europe and argue that marriage in Nordic countries has not suffered from the legalization of same sex unions. Badgett (2004) also uses European data to refute Kurtz and goes even further by arguing the direction of causation may actually be in the other direction, concluding: “changes in heterosexual marriage made the recognition of gay couples more likely.” To date, no advocate on either side of this debate has used US data to examine potential causality between same sex unions and traditional marriage. One reason for this omission has been (until recently) a lack of consistent, nationally-representative data over time on unmarried couples in general and on same sex couples in particular who, due to social stigma and their small numbers, are difficult to count. The annual March Current Population Survey has been counting both opposite sex and same sex couples since 1996, but it does not report the number of same sex couples in any of its official publications (presumably because there are so few).Footnote 2 The 2000 Census revised the methodology by which it counts same sex couples, which makes direct comparisons with 1990 difficult. Fortunately, a new large-scale annual Census Bureau survey known as the American Community Survey (ACS) has been counting unmarried couples on a consistent basis since the late 1990s. In this paper we use state-level data from the 2000 Census along with ACS data from 2000 to 2006 to study changes over time and space in the geographic distribution of married and unmarried same sex and opposite sex couples. We test one specific measure of causality between living arrangements known as Granger causality as modified for use with panel data (Greene 2003, pp. 551–555). Based on these tests, we can reject hypotheses that an increase in same sex couples has Granger caused either a decline in marriage or (except for one case) an increase in heterosexual cohabitation. There is mixed evidence whether opposite sex couples can be said to have Granger caused more same sex couples, but stronger evidence that marriage and heterosexual cohabitation are interrelated. The results of our statistical analysis do not address the marriage debate head on, since no state permitted same sex couples to marry until Massachusetts did so in 2004. Even still, we believe our analysis advances the debate to the extent that the presence of more same sex unmarried couples, whose relationships have been found to be similar to heterosexual couples (Kurdek 2004; Jepsen and Jepsen 2006), represent many of the same threats to traditional marriage, real or imagined by opponents of homosexual marriage. Furthermore, states with more same sex couples are likely to exhibit greater tolerance toward gays and lesbians generally and to experience greater political pressures in favor of the legal recognition of their relationships.Footnote 3 Rauch (2004) has argued that the secular decline in marriage in the United States has been caused not by same sex married couples, but by the increased presence of same sex unmarried couples, whose largely successful efforts to obtain domestic partner benefits in the workplace have reduced the incentives of opposite sex cohabiting couples to marry. Our statistical analysis can be viewed as a direct test of the Rauch hypothesis, and our results offer little support for it. The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the decennial Census and annual ACS data on couples. Section 3 speculates on possible reasons why homosexual and heterosexual living arrangements might be related. Section 4 exploits the time series dimension of the panel data to test whether the presence of same sex couples can be said to be the cause or the effect of the living arrangements of opposite sex couples. Section 5 summaries our findings and suggests avenues for future research.",6
6.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,24 October 2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-007-9022-1,Is there a ‘marriage premium’ for gay men?,December 2008,Madeline Zavodny,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The possibility of same-sex marriage has become a much-discussed and polarizing issue in the US in recent years. Beginning with Vermont in 2000, a few municipalities and states have recognized civil unions or some other form of legal partnership by homosexual couples. In 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex marriage. Meanwhile a number of other areas have taken measures to block the possibility of same-sex marriages, and Congress has debated amending the Constitution to ban same-sex marriages. Despite all the media attention given to same-sex marriage, little is known about the possible economic impact of such unions.Footnote 1 One potential effect is that gay men who marry might earn a “marriage premium” similar to the substantial premium—about 10–20%—observed among married heterosexual men compared with otherwise observationally similar unmarried men. There are several reasons why marriage can lead to higher earnings for men. First, marriage may promote specialization within couples. Becker (1991) argued that men have a comparative advantage in market work while women have a comparative advantage in home production. The marriage premium among heterosexual men is often attributed to such specialization between husbands and wives (e.g., Chun and Lee 2001; Gray 1997). Marriage also might raise men’s earnings if it causes other behavioral changes that increase productivity, such as greater commitment to an employer. Employer discrimination in favor of married men would also cause marriage to lead to an earnings premium even absent any productivity effects. However, marriage may be positively correlated with earnings because men are positively selected into marriage. Characteristics that make men more productive at work may also be attractive to potential spouses. The literature has reached differing conclusion on how to apportion the male marriage premium between these various causes (e.g., Antonovics and Town 2004; Cornwell and Rupert 1997; Dougherty 2006; Ginther and Zavodny 2001; Hersch and Stratton 2000; Korenman and Neumark 1991; Krashinsky 2004). Some of these theories may carry over to marriage, or more generally cohabiting partnerships, between gay men. In particular, positive selection into partnerships may occur among gay men as well as among heterosexual men. Specialization, in contrast, seems less likely to result in a substantial premium for partnered gay men because specialization implies an earnings premium for one partner but a penalty for the other. In addition, as discussed below, the degree of specialization may be smaller for homosexual couples than for heterosexual couples. Lack of legal gay marriage in most areas means that few gay men currently benefit from any discrimination in favor of married men. But it also seems unlikely that any such positive discrimination would apply to gay men even if same-sex marriage became widespread.Footnote 2
 Theory suggests that same-sex cohabiters specialize less than married heterosexuals but is somewhat ambiguous as to whether same-sex couples specialize less than unmarried opposite-sex cohabiters. Married heterosexual couples should be the most likely to specialize given their legal standing, ability to benefit from any comparative advantages due to gender, and high likelihood of having children. Among unmarried heterosexual couples, the choice to not legalize their relationship might signal lack of specialization; however, opposite-sex couples might specialize more than same-sex couples because they can reap any comparative advantages due to gender differences. Same-sex couples may be the least likely to specialize because they lack legal standing in many areas, cannot benefit from gender differences (Badgett 2001; Jepsen and Jepsen 2006), and—particularly among male couples—are not as likely to have children (Black et al. 2000). However, because same-sex couples cannot marry in most areas, unmarried partnership status does not serve as a signal for them like it does for opposite-sex cohabiting couples, so gay cohabiters might actually specialize more than heterosexual cohabiters who have chosen not to marry. Empirical results generally indicate that specialization is greatest among married couples followed by unmarried heterosexual couples, with homosexual couples engaging in the least specialization. Badgett (2001, p. 157) concludes that same-sex couples “display much less specialization either within the household or between household and the labor market” than do opposite-sex couples. Kurdek (1993) reports that gay couples do specialize in certain tasks within the household but that they split household responsibilities more equally than married couples. Consistent with more specialization within marriage, Jepsen and Jepsen (2006) find that married couples are less alike in terms of labor market activity than unmarried cohabiting couples. In addition, they find that differences in labor market activity within same-sex cohabiting couples are sometimes similar to those among roommates whereas opposite-sex cohabiting couples consistently have greater differences in labor market activity than roommates. This suggests gay cohabiters specialize less than heterosexual cohabiters.Footnote 3 Jepsen and Jepsen (2002) also find that members of male same-sex couples tend to be more alike than members of opposite-sex married or cohabiting couples in terms of earnings even though they are less alike in terms of race, age, and education.Footnote 4
 Previous research typically finds that there is an earnings premium among cohabiting men (e.g., Cohen 1999; Daniel 1992). This premium, which is relative to men not living with an opposite sex partner (a sample that would include gay men in most studies), is smaller than that among married men. Studies attribute the cohabitation premium more to selection than to specialization (Light 2004; Stratton 2002).Footnote 5 If specialization does not significantly contribute to earnings among men in opposite-sex couples, it seems unlikely to boost gay cohabiters’ earnings since they appear to engage in less specialization than opposite-sex couples. There is little evidence on how earnings among cohabiting gay men compare with other men’s earnings. In the only previous study that directly examines whether partnered gay men have higher earnings than otherwise comparable non-partnered gay men, Booth and Frank (2004) do not find a significant difference between the earnings of partnered and non-partnered homosexuals and bisexuals in a sample of British academics that includes both sexes. Studies using US data suggest that men cohabiting with a same-sex partner have lower earnings than married men, while results for men in same-sex cohabiting couples versus men in different-sex cohabiting couples are mixed (Allegretto and Arthur 2001; Clain and Leppel 2001; Klawitter and Flatt 1998). In addition, average household incomes are lower among same-sex male cohabiting couples than among married couples but higher than among opposite-sex cohabiting couples (Carpenter 2004). Cohabiting gay men (and cohabiting heterosexual men) appear to more likely to work part-time and less likely to work full–time than married men (Tebaldi and Elmslie 2006). There are several studies of the relative earnings of gay men that do not focus on partnership status. This research fairly consistently concludes that gay men earn substantially less than other men with similar observable attributes in the US (e.g., Badgett 1995; Berg and Lien 2002; Black et al. 2003; Carpenter 2007a).Footnote 6 Researchers differ on the causes of this earnings gap, with, for example, some attributing it to sexual orientation discrimination (e.g., Badgett 1995) and others to gays clustering in traditionally female occupations (e.g., Blandford 2003).Footnote 7 Another potential explanation is differences in unobserved labor-market traits. As Black et al. (2003) discuss, gay men may devote fewer resources to accumulating human capital and making other career-related investments because these men do not expect to form a traditional household with one partner specializing in market production and the other specializing in non-market production. Because most gay men may not expect to support a partner and children, they may have less incentive to focus on human capital accumulation and market production. However, the results in Carpenter (2005) are at odds with these previous findings. Using data from a survey conducted among California residents in 2001 that included self-reported sexual orientation, Carpenter does not find a difference in hourly earnings between gay men and heterosexual men; some results do indicate lower earnings among bisexual men. He concludes that earlier findings of lower earnings among gay men may be due to pooling men who are behaviorally gay and behaviorally bisexual. Other potential explanations for the difference in results include the more recent time frame of the sample Carpenter uses and its exclusively California composition, either of which might be associated with less discrimination against gays. Interestingly, Carpenter does find that gay and bisexual men earn less than heterosexual men when not controlling for marital status. Similarly, Allegretto and Arthur (2001) and Carpenter (2004) both conclude that the marriage premium, not differences in returns to observable characteristics, is the main cause of the observed gap in household income between gays and heterosexuals, although neither study includes non-cohabiting gay men. This study uses data from the General Social Survey and the National Health and Social Life Survey to examine whether gay cohabiting men earn a premium like married men and cohabiting heterosexual men. The results indicate that, controlling for observable characteristics, cohabiting gay men do not earn significantly more than other gay men or more than unmarried heterosexual men. The article then examines whether gay men are positively selected into cohabitation based on observable characteristics; lack of such positive selection could explain the apparent lack of a return to cohabitation among gay men. The article also uses data from the 2000 Census to examine the relationship between men’s earnings and their spouse or partner’s education and annual hours of work in order to examine differences in specialization and assortative mating between heterosexual and gay couples.",29

This “lesbian advantage” has been found for adult women in the United States (Black et al. 2003; Clain and Leppel 2001, and others), adult women in the United Kingdom (Arabsheibani et al. 2005), and young female college graduates in The Netherlands (Plug and Berkhout 2004).Footnote 1 It has also been found across several different methods for identifying lesbians in social science data, including: self-reported sexual preference (Plug and Berkhout 2004), the presence of a same-sex unmarried partner (Clain and Leppel 2001, Jepsen 2007), and the presence of recent same-sex sexual behavior (Black et al. 2003). As such, the lesbian income advantage is one of the most strikingly robust findings in the economics literature on sexual orientation.Footnote 2
 Far less attention, however, has been paid to whether sexual minority women experience a similar “advantage” with respect to non-pecuniary economic outcomes such as satisfaction with and stress regarding their work and personal lives. It is certainly possible that any pecuniary advantage experienced by lesbians in the labor market could directly reflect or translate into more satisfaction and reduced stress in various spheres of women’s lives. However, non-pecuniary economic outcomes need not be related to sexual orientation in the same way as wages or income. Lesbian women, for example, may have higher earnings or incomes in part because they have chosen jobs that pay a compensating differential for other unobserved and unpleasant job attributes, and this could have spillover effects into other areas of women’s lives besides pecuniary economic performance. One likely reason there has been little systematic study of these outcomes is that most social science data that allow for identification of sexual orientation generally do not include information on these alternative outcomes. In this paper I provide new descriptive evidence on the relative economic performance of young lesbians in Australia using confidential data from the Australian Longitudinal Survey of Women’s Health (ALSWH). These data are unique in that—unlike most sources used in the existing literature on sexual orientation and income—the ALSWH includes many more assessments of non-pecuniary economic performance than are typically measured. In addition to personal income, my data also provide information on: distressing workplace harassment, difficulty in finding a job, the experience of losing a job or experiencing decreased income, as well as overall satisfaction with and stress about life achievements associated with one’s work and career. These previously unstudied aspects of economic well-being allow me to paint a more comprehensive picture of the relative economic position of sexual minority females compared to heterosexual females. I am also the first to provide evidence on relative economic performance of lesbians in Australia—a country that provides an interesting and informative point of comparison to the existing literature because of its fairly progressive social attitudes and its history of local, state, and federal antidiscrimination protections on the basis of sexual orientation.Footnote 3
 My empirical methods are straightforward and involve multivariate regression analysis with detailed controls for demographic, family, and health characteristics that may be correlated with a minority sexual orientation and economic outcomes. I find consistent evidence that young lesbian women fare worse than similarly situated heterosexual women in Australia along almost every dimension related to economic well-being. Specifically, I find that lesbian women report lower incomes than heterosexual women, a differential estimated to be about 30% or more on average. Expanding the focus beyond income, I also find that compared to otherwise similar heterosexual women, young lesbians in my sample are significantly more likely to report that they have: (1) experienced distressing harassment in the workplace; (2) had difficulty in finding a job; (3) lost a job; and (4) experienced decreased income. Moreover, these differentials are large: compared to the mean probability of experiencing distressing workplace harassment, lesbians are 2.5 times more likely to report that they have been subject to this negative treatment. Finally, I find consistent evidence that lesbian women report significantly more stress related to work and money compared to heterosexual women, and I also find that lesbian women are significantly less satisfied with their achievements pertaining to work and career. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides a brief review of the literature documenting a lesbian economic advantage. In Sect. 3 I describe the data and present the estimation framework. Sect. 4 presents the main results, and Sect. 5 concludes.",55

In the last 20 years, research has suggested that intrahousehold bargaining power—the ability of individual family members to drive household decisions—affects how money is managed and used by families. Concurrently, a growing body of social science research has compared the formation and experiences of married couples with unmarried couples—including both different-sex and same-sex partners. This article builds on these literatures by examining the effects of individual bargaining power on family money management and how it differs by marital status and sexual orientation. Differences between married and unmarried, different-sex and same-sex couples color debates about evolving state and federal laws governing marriage, divorce, taxes, inheritance, and parenting rights. Conceptions of family life for various types of couples have influenced the structure of public policies, and, in turn, these policies create different legal frameworks for family finances across marital status and sexual orientation. Beyond the influence of state institutions, how couples manage money reflects individual and family characteristics, the intrahousehold bargaining power of partners, social and cultural influences, and the levels of trust and interdependence within couples. The system for managing and holding money chosen by a couple may later affect who has access to money and how the money will be used. Intrahousehold bargaining models seek to explain family decision-making and money management, and their predictions are critically important to understanding the effects of public policies or changing labor markets on individual and household behavior and well-being. This article uses data from the U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances on joint and individually held liquid assets to compare money management for married, unmarried different-sex, and same-sex couples. The results show that married couples are much more likely to hold money jointly than are other couples, even after accounting for the effects of individual and family characteristics. However, many couples of all types hold money in joint accounts, especially those in longer term relationships and those living with children. Proxies for bargaining power help predict whether money will be held individually for unmarried different-sex and same-sex couples, but not for married couples. I first review research on intrahousehold decision-making and on family money management. I describe the data, sample, and empirical strategy, and then turn to results.",21

Romich,Kwok Ping Tsang,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Economic models of the family treat children either as “goods” in the consumption vector of their parents or as agents with autonomous preferences who are capable of full economic independence. In a developmental trajectory between the infant and the near-adult we know that there are children who have well-defined preferences, who are developing communications and formal reasoning skills, who are capable of productive work and independent action, and who still rely on their parents for guidance and support, but economic theory does not accommodate them easily. During late childhood and early adolescence, children acquire a level of autonomy about their own activities and spending at rates that vary depending on their own traits and abilities, the preferences and resources of their parents, and their environment. As children begin to make choices about how to allocate their time between homework and television, and about how and when to spend their money, they become economic agents engaged in constrained optimization. We know very little about the process by which children acquire this agency; this paper provides a first look at child decision-making autonomy from an economic perspective. The balance that is struck between parental authority and child independence in choices about children’s own activities is potentially important for developmental outcomes. Parental restrictions can curtail risky behavior and promote investments in child human capital, but children develop self-confidence by taking independent actions and judgment by experiencing their own mistakes. A gradual transfer of decision power from parents to children is believed by child development experts to be better for children than either premature independence or prolonged subservience (Dornbusch et al. 1987; Steinberg et al. 1991). In this paper we develop an economic model of parent–child interaction and test its implications. Our simple non-cooperative bargaining model has a parent choosing a level of behavioral control in the face of limited resources and child demand for autonomy. Using the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child data (NLSY-C), we examine the determinants of a child’s agency within the household based on children’s reports of who makes decisions about their own activities, such as spending money and watching TV. We find that the determinants of sole decision-making by the child and shared decision-making with parents are quite distinct: sharing decisions appears to be a form of parental investment in child development rather than a simple stage in the transfer of authority. In addition, we find that indicators of child capabilities and preferences affect reports of decision-making authority in ways that suggest child demand for autonomy as well as parental discretion in determining these outcomes.",47

In a unitary model with income pooling this shift in the distribution of income within the household should not have any impact on most household decisions nor on the relative levels of welfare of the two members of the household. Several papers in the literature on intra-household allocation have suggested that various ‘outcomes’ (such as demands and child health) do, in fact, depend on the distribution of income within the household (see, for example, Thomas 1990; Browning et al. 1994; Lundberg et al. 1996; Phipps and Burton 1998). Implicit in these analyses is that a higher share of household income for one partner leads to a higher welfare for that person, see Bonke and Uldall-Poulsen (2007) for a short survey of the relevant literature. In this paper we consider this consequence directly using a survey measure of self-perceived economic well-being and information on household economic factors. We develop a simple model of the responses to satisfaction questions by married individuals and their economic position within the household (see the arguments of Hamermesh 2004 for the need of more theoretical statistical modelling when examining the objective determinants of subjective outcomes). In the associated empirical work we find that there are differences between the responses of wives and husbands. Although a number of factors are correlated with these within-household differences, the most important statistically and substantively is the distribution of income within the household. This reproduces the rejection of income pooling and provides direct evidence that the distribution of income within the household does impact on the within-household distribution of welfare (see, for example, Rogers and DeBoer 2001). In the next section we present some details about our data source, the Danish component of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) for 1994. In Sect. 3 we develop a simple (and short) theoretical model of satisfaction that allows for intra-household differences. Section 4 is a short summary of our methods. In Sect. 5 we present the results for the levels of satisfaction expressed by married or cohabiting individuals. In Sect. 6 we present an analysis of the differences between responses by married or cohabiting individuals.",48

C. Herbert Emery,Ana Ferrer,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Several empirical studies for the US establish a correlation between female labor supply and measures of marriage market conditions like sex ratios and cohort dummy variables.Footnote 1 This correlation has encouraged the development of a literature examining the relationship between marriage market conditions, intra-household allocation of resources and female labor supply. If marriage market conditions are useful for understanding female labor force participation (LFP), then we should expect that the correlation between measures of the population sex ratio and female LFP can be confirmed with studies of countries other than the US. An earlier sociology literature provided mixed evidence of a correlation between population sex ratios and female LFP using cross-sectional data for a set of countries from the 1960s and 1970s.Footnote 2 More recently, Fukuda (2006) finds evidence of cohort effects associated with sex ratio differences for female LFP in Japan, albeit they are weaker than for the US. Descriptive studies of Canadian female LFP suggest an absence of an influence of marriage market conditions on female labor supply.Footnote 3
 Canada provides a useful case to evaluate the marriage market hypothesis for female labor supply. Given the similarity of cultures and of labor supply behavior of women in Canada and the United States, and the fact that they both experienced baby-booms at roughly the same time, any explanation for changes in female LFP would be expected to hold for both countries. We follow the econometric strategies of Grossbard-Shechtman and Granger (1998)—GSG here after—and Grossbard and Amuedo-Dorantes (2007)—GAD here after—to test the prediction that marriage market conditions have explanatory power for changes in, and levels of, Canadian female LFP rates for the period 1971–2001. Following the latter paper’s estimation strategy we find that the signs of the estimated sex ratios effects are consistent with what models of intrahousehold allocations would predict but they are statistically insignificant. The estimated coefficients for the sex ratio variable are smaller than those found by GAD for the US but similar in magnitude to what they find for the US Midwest in some specifications. Counter to expectations but consistent with their estimates for the US Midwest, sex ratios have large negative effects for university educated women in Canada. The next section discusses the intuition of the marriage market explanations for female LFP patterns and empirical evidence related to that literature. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy that we apply to Canadian data. Section 4 presents the data and empirical results. Section 5 concludes.",7
7.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,23 July 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-008-9042-5,The impact of biological preferences on parental investments in children and step-children,March 2009,Naoko Akashi-Ronquest,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The composition of the American family has changed considerably in the last century. The divorce rate for first marriages has increased throughout the last century, and this trend has been accompanied by an increase in the number of single, divorced individuals and remarried couples (Fig. 1). Forty-four percent of families in the United States (US) are led by single parents, and over 70% of those who divorce remarry (Kreider 2005; US Census 2000). Consequently, the number of children in stepparent households in the US has risen. This social structure change has created tremendous interest in the effect of divorce on children’s well-being. There is substantial evidence that children in single-parent households tend to be more aggressive, noncompliant, and sexually active; further, they are likely to have lower academic performance than children in intact families (Guidubaldi 1988; Krein and Beller 1988). While little evidence of the impact of remarriage on children in the US has been reported, there is a growing recognition that biological preference, where parents treat their biological children better than their stepchildren, may affect children’s well-being in stepfamilies (Case and Paxson 2001; Gennetian and Harknett 2001; Chiappori and Weiss 2007). The number of divorced per 1,000 married women aged between 14 and 44 years and the number of remarried women per 1,000 divorced women aged between 14 and 44 years (3-year averages, 1951–1989) (Sources: Bramlett and Mosher 2001; Munson and Sutton 2005) Divorce and remarriage typically involve a measurable change in the financial circumstance of a family, and the importance of any financial losses or gains as a result of divorce and remarriage has received considerable attention (Hill et al. 2001). However, these factors have been overlooked in previous empirical studies. Whereas existing studies have placed emphasis on estimating the impact of divorce and remarriage on children’s well-being, I identify the effects of biological preference of stepparents on their child investments. Child investments involve parents’ contributions of their time and financial resources for their children’s future well-being, such as the amount of time the parents spend reading to their children and the amount of financial support the parents are willing to provide for their children’s education. A stepparent may choose to invest less in a stepchild’s education or health because the stepparent may not be as attached to the stepchild when compared with the parent of the child (Furstenberg 1987). Throughout this paper, I call this hypothesis the biological preference hypothesis. If the wife cares about her child from a previous marriage more than her new husband does, her bargaining position in marriage may affect the family’s expenditure toward the child. I use the “separate-spheres” model, which is one among many different theoretical family bargaining models, to review the determinants of the bargaining relationship between spouses (Lundberg and Pollak 1993, 1994) and to demonstrate that bargaining power in marriage is determined by each spouse’s wage rates and non-labor income, instead of total earnings (Pollak 2005). Family bargaining models show that an increase in a spouse’s wage rate or non-labor income improves his or her bargaining position in marriage. Furthermore, the marginal benefit of a parent’s wage rate on the family investment in her child is greater when the parent remarries someone who cares about the child less than the parent does. Following these implications of the theoretical bargaining model, I specify an empirical model that analyzes the effects of parents’ marital status on their child investments. The model uses data on children and their parents taken from the 1994–2004 waves of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). The model also uses the wage rates of each child’s mother and her husband as determinants of the child’s home environment, in order to account for the impact of the relative bargaining positions of parents on their child investments. To control for the possible endogeneity bias caused by each family’s unobserved characteristics that could affect its structure, the model employs the fixed-effects specification. Using the results of the model, this study will answer two questions: (1) how does parents’ marital status affect their investment in children? and (2) how does the bargaining relationship within the remarriage affect the investment in stepchildren? As predicted by the biological preference hypothesis in stepfamilies, I find that an increase in a biological mother’s wage rate has a significant, positive effect on her child investment when her husband is not the biological father of the child. The mother’s bargaining power in the marriage rises due to her increased wage rate. If the father does not care about the child as much as his wife does, then the increase in the wife’s bargaining power is expected to improve the family’s investment in the child. On the other hand, the mother’s wage rate does not affect her child investment when her husband is the biological father of the child.",11
7.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,09 July 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-008-9038-1,Sexual orientation and self-reported lying,March 2009,Nathan Berg,Donald Lien,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper undertakes an empirical investigation of statistical associations between self-reported sexual orientation and self-reported lying, bringing together two distinct literatures concerning deception (Gneezy 2005; Hurkens and Kartik 2006; Miettinen 2006; Sanchez-Pages and Vorsatz 2006; Demichelis and Weibull 2006; Wang et al. 2006; Fischbacher and Heusi 2007; Dreber and Johannesson 2008) and the economics of non-heterosexuality (Badgett 2001). A growing literature within economics connects sexual orientation to economic variables such as personal income, household income, geographical location and health outcomes (Badgett 1995; Allegretto and Arthur 2001; Black et al. 2003; Plug and Berkhout 2004; Black et al. 2002; Bloom and Glied 1992; Turner 1999). Much of this literature necessarily relies on survey data, for example, self-reported same-sex sexual contacts reported in the GSS, self-reported number and gender of roommates in U.S. Census data, or self-reported sexual orientation in other surveys. Relying on self-reports about sexual orientation raises several potential problems. One problem is that definitions of categories such as “gay” are somewhat ambiguous (Murray 1999; Chauncey 1994), with different non-heterosexuals choosing different labels and ascribing distinct meanings to those labels. Another potential problem is that truthful self-reporting about one’s sexual orientation may, in some environments, subject survey respondents to risks or other elevated levels of expected costs in the form of discriminatory treatment by employers or others outside the workplace (Berg and Lien 2002). On the other hand, a number of researchers who study dishonesty have put forward the hypothesis that people generally receive positive utility from telling the truth (Gneezy 2005; Mazar and Ariley 2006; Wang et al. 2006; Fischbacher and Heusi 2007). These two ideas—of deceit responding to expected benefits, and deceit incurring costs in the form of psychic disutility—can be combined and applied to the case of misreporting sexual orientation.Footnote 1
 The main prediction that this paper seeks to test is motivated by a straightforward cost–benefit theory of lying (Gneezy 2005) applied to survey respondents’ decisions about whether to reveal non-heterosexual sexual orientation. Holding other factors that influence individual propensities to lie constant, the cost–benefit theory predicts that non-heterosexuals are more likely to lie or falsify information whenever the expected benefit of concealing non-heterosexuality is greater than the disutility of lying. In some special environments with high degrees of acceptance of homosexuality, the expected benefit of concealing homosexual behavior might be negligible. In such environments, one would expect those small benefits of concealment to be greatly offset by the psychic benefits of being “out” or openly transmitting information in a way that takes no pains to conceal homosexuality. The expected benefit of concealing homosexuality would also be small in cases where data collectors can persuade survey respondents that their responses will remain confidential and protected with adequate measures to insure data security. There would seem to be plenty of evidence, however, to motivate nontrivial expected benefits of concealment and falsification for non-heterosexuals in many parts of the U.S. and beyond, given highly visible condemnation of homosexuality by some politicians and religious leaders in the U.S., lethal violence suffered by homosexual victims of hate crime, and indirect evidence of workplace discrimination (Badgett 1995; Berg and Lien 2002). Based on the theory that non-heterosexuals, on average, have larger expected benefits from lying about sexual orientation and therefore lie more often than heterosexuals, we investigate the empirical link between lying and sexual orientation by means of an Internet survey collected by a team of researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The advantage of these data is that they contain information about both sexual orientation and self-reported lying. Using a rich set of socio-economic controls collected as part of this survey, we estimate empirical probability models measuring the expected change in the probability of lying as a function of non-heterosexuality. We estimate separate models by gender and allow age to enter the probability-of-lying function with distinct intercepts, slopes and second-order curvature for heterosexuals and non-heterosexuals. This reveals new information about the gay-straight differential in rates of lying and how it changes as a function of age. Given a randomly selected information transmission about any topic, this gay-straight differential in the probability of lying, in turn, enables us to estimate a lower bound and ultimately quantify the much more difficult-to-observe rate at which non-heterosexuals lie specifically about sexual orientation, which is important because it can lead to significant undercounts of non-heterosexual populations. The next section specifies a simple probability model that provides a lower bound and one-parameter estimator for the probability that non-heterosexuals conceal their sexual orientation, expressed as a function of variables that can be more directly observed. Section 3 describes the empirical model and the theory’s predictions about its parameters. Section 4 describes the data, and Sect. 5 presents the main empirical results of gay-straight differentials in the probability of lying. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes with a discussion of the results, their possible interpretations, and implications for future research.",9

However, those affected tend to remain in poverty for a sizeable portion of their life-cycle.Footnote 1 The interest in the dynamic aspects of poverty is understandable since the efficacy of different policies depends on the nature of poverty. For example, if poverty is mainly a brief condition, then short-term or temporary income support programs may be appropriate. On the other hand, if poverty is a condition with a strong degree of persistence over time, then programs designed to improve labor market skills may be more effective. Within the poverty dynamics literature, most studies have focused on the probability of leaving poverty. However, the proportion of poor households in any given time period depends not only on this exit probability but also, and equally important, on the probability of entering poverty. In the welfare literature, Grogger et al. (2003) report that reduced entry rates during the late 1990s contributed as much as increased exit rates to the decline in welfare receipt in the U.S. over the past decade. They also argue that the welfare literature has focused too much on the determinants of the probability of leaving welfare and consequently has ignored another important aspect––entry into welfare. Stevens (1999) was one of the first to estimate both poverty entry and exit rates (using multiple poverty spells), and found, among other things, that total time spent below the poverty line is seriously underestimated in single-spell models (models that ignore the possibility that households that have left poverty may soon fall back into it).Footnote 2
 The current paper contributes to the poverty literature in three important aspects: First, we use data extracted from administrative records with virtually no attrition and very accurate income measures.Footnote 3 Most of the previous work on poverty dynamics has relied on survey data (Finnie and Sweetman 2003 is an exception) that may be plagued by measurement errors in important income measures. Second, we use minimum needs standards determined by both local and central authorities to assess whether a household was poor in any given year. In the literature, it is common to instead define a household as poor when net household income falls below a certain percentage of the median net household income. However, then actual income levels are irrelevant and only relative income levels matter, which may lead to counter-intuitive developments of poverty over time if, for instance, income is reduced for everyone but more so for those with higher income levels. In that case, poverty seems to have been reduced despite the fact that everyone is actually worse off. Lastly, this paper is one of the first to analyze poverty dynamics separately for natives and immigrants.Footnote 4 The immigrant-native comparison is made possible because of the cross-sectional dimension of our sample which includes over 300,000 individuals. In Sweden, as well as in many other Western countries, there are concerns about the economic well-being of immigrant families. Immigrant families are over-represented in many welfare programs and poverty rates are significantly higher for these families than for native families. The analysis in this paper will illustrate native-immigrant differences in poverty entries and exits which will improve our understanding of underlying causes for the native-immigrant poverty gap. The empirical results in this paper indicate that poverty is a persistent condition in Sweden. We divided our sample into six categories depending on the gender and immigrant status of the person representing a household, and found evidence of significant, negative duration dependence for all groups. Like Stevens (1999), our results also indicate that total time in poverty may be seriously underestimated in single-spell models. Overall, the results indicate that immigrant families spend more time in poverty than similar native families. Moreover, households with children appear to be “trapped” in poverty to a greater extent than similar households without children. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a description of the data and a definition of poverty status. The empirical model is presented in Sect. 3, while the results are presented in Sect. 4. Finally, a summary is provided in Sect. 5.",15

Gordon,Carolyn J. Heinrich,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Government has a vested interest in helping people access both stable employment and stable family environments. Strategies should not be limited to one domain when failure in either is directly linked to dependence upon the government (Stanley et al. 2003, p. 4). The work requirements and time limits put in place by the federal welfare reform of 1996 have received considerable research and policy attention. Less attention was initially paid to the healthy marriage objectives of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), even though much of the basis for the legislation and three of its four stated goals dealt with marriage. In part, this reflects controversy over whether the government should be “in the business” of encouraging healthy marriage and programs have evolved to emphasize their voluntary nature and to screen for domestic violence. In part, states’ limited immediate pursuit of PRWORA’s marriage goals also reflects a lack of prior government effort in this area. Beginning shortly after taking office, the Bush administration encouraged new demonstrations. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) used several funding streams to support programs and research, including welfare waivers in the office of child support and two large-scale random-assignment demonstrations, Supporting Healthy Marriage and Building Strong Families (Ooms et al. 2004). The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which reauthorized Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), included an annual allocation of $150 million for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008). The earliest healthy marriage efforts emphasized relationship education, although more recent efforts are attempting to integrate such education with employment support and financial management (National Healthy Marriage Resource Center 2008). Our paper presents a study of a demonstration program that sought to explore the potential of a couples approach to employment assistance. The program’s design began with the most basic couples approach—identifying couples and simply offering assistance to both partners simultaneously—and predated the focus on marriage and two-parent families in welfare reform legislation. It reflects a grassroots belief by program administrators and staff that helping both parents (rather than one) secure a job would be more likely to move the family out of poverty. We analyze the employment, earnings, and TANF receipt trajectories of the demonstration program participants and assess how they compare with two nonexperimental comparison groups. For demonstration participants, we also examine the couples’ relationship characteristics at program entry and one year follow-up. We discuss the evolution of the program over time, including recruitment challenges, and how future programs might expand upon it, such as by considering the mechanisms through which couples- versus individual-focused employment assistance may be beneficial. We begin by placing the program in the context of the economics of marriage literature, which suggests some anticipated mechanisms through which such a program might be effective, and we come back to this literature in the discussion as we consider ways in which marriage education programs might be better integrated with employment assistance for couples.",

Much attention has been devoted to the influence of unpaid market-like activities that take place in the household, such as cleaning, cooking, and home maintenance. The total time spent by women on home production activities dominates the time spent by men, with the bulk of women’s total home production time devoted to routine housework such as cleaning and cooking. There is considerable evidence that time spent on routine housework has a negative relation with wages that is not spuriously due to endogeneity or unobserved individual fixed characteristics, with the impact greatest for women’s wages.Footnote 1
 This paper makes three distinct contributions to the literature examining the relation between home production and wages. First, I provide new estimates of the relation between wages and home production of various types, using time diary data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). The ATUS provides detailed information on all activities performed over a 24-h period. Time use data may provide more reliable values of home production time than the summary measures that have been used in most previous studies of the housework—wage relation. Hersch and Stratton (2002) show that the relation between home production activities and wages differs according to whether the activity is performed almost daily or can be deferred. The great detail in the ATUS allows a thorough examination of how different home production activities that vary in flexibility of timing are associated with wages. Second, I examine whether the relation between home production and wages differs by occupation in order to provide information on the mechanism by which housework is related to wages. Occupations differ in a number of characteristics that accommodate combining market work with home responsibilities. If the negative housework—wage relation arises from either omitted working conditions correlated with housework that warrant a compensating differential, or from omitted effort, then controlling for occupation should decrease or eliminate the relation between housework and wages. Third, because wages and housework time may be determined jointly, a key concern in the literature is that the observed negative effect of housework time on wages is actually due to reverse causality. Hersch and Stratton (1997) examine the potential joint endogeneity of housework time and wages and find that housework can be validly treated as exogenous to wages. In this paper, I use the detailed time diary data available in the ATUS to provide additional evidence on whether the negative effect of housework on wages is driven by reverse causality. Specifically, I use information on time devoted to other nonmarket activities to address whether other non-home production uses of time affect wages similarly and whether any negative effect of home production on wages is spuriously induced by the 24-h per day time constraint.",51

The expected impact of leave from work on maternal employment is ambiguous. On the one hand, it allows women to have a break to care for the child and its absence could persuade some women not to participate in the labor market. It also guarantees the return to the previous job so that they do not lose specific human capital. On the other hand, it may withdraw women from the labor market for long periods, with negative implications for their future employability, wages, and career. These effects are not clear a priori (Klerman and Leibowitz 1997; Berger and Waldfogel 2004) and needed to be tested empirically. The object of this paper is to investigate the effect of statutory parental leave on mother’s post-birth employment. Previous research on this topic in the US context shows a small influence of statutory leave duration on women’s time out of labor force (Han et al. 2007; Hashimoto et al. 2004; Baum 2003; Klerman and Leibowitz 1997), while the Canadian experience indicates a larger effect (Baker and Milligan 2005). One explanation put forward is that where statutory leave is shorter (e.g. 12 weeks in US) we are less likely to observe an impact than where statutory leave is longer (from 17/18 weeks to 29/70, in the Canadian case). Besides the duration, another important aspect to take into account, when analyzing statutory leave’s effects, is the process of self-selection into jobs covered by leave-regulations (Hashimoto et al. 2004; Baker and Milligan 2005): women who have access to jobs with maternity rights may have unobservable characteristics which also affect their post-birth decisions. In this paper, I exploit the variability in policies across EU countries, in terms of length of the leave and payments during the leave-period. I compare women with similar human capital characteristics and household conditions but in different countries, and consequently subject to different leave regulations. The EC directives require a minimum of 3 months of parental leave, but permits degrees of freedom for additional time, payments, and flexibility in the timing. And, indeed, the features of statutory parental leave differ substantially across Europe: its length ranges from a minimum of 3 months to a maximum of 3 years, and the wage replacement ratio varies from 0 to 100%. The conditions required to qualify for the leave vary across countries, but women with at least 1 year of employment are generally covered. A comparative study on maternity leave’s effects has been carried out by Ruhm (1998), who compares employment rates and wages among women and men (used as comparison group) in different European countries, and shows how maternity leave’s availability is associated with an increase in women’s employment but a reduction in their relative wages. Instead, my paper focuses on the effect of statutory parental leave (the optional leave which temporally follows the maternity leave) on mothers’ return to work across Europe. Understanding the economic consequences of statutory leave for women is relevant to policy for at least two reasons. First, it is important to understand whether leave policies may be used to enhance female labor market participation, especially in countries with a low participation rate relative to the 60% set by the Lisbon strategy (Council of the European Union 2000). Second, it is important to evaluate whether they may be used as instruments to make parents spend more time with their children (Baker and Milligan 2008). Parental care, especially during the first year elapsed from childbirth (James-Burdumy 2005), has been shown to be important for the child’s development: a reduction in infant mortality (Ruhm 2004), more breastfeeding and child immunization (Tanaka 2005; Berger et al. 2005), better cognitive outcomes (Gregg et al. 2005; Ruhm 2004), and better educational outcomes (Ermisch and Francesconi 2002) have been observed. In this paper, employment decisions of mothers after childbirth are analyzed, using the European Community Household Panel and treating the data in a survival perspective. The institutional background of different European countries is presented in Sect. 2 and the methodological framework in Sect. 3. The ECHP data are illustrated in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 comprises the empirical estimations. Sects. 6 and 7 compare and interpret the results across countries. Conclusions follow (Sect. 8).",75

Non-unitary models share a common view of decision-making within the household, where final allocations, i.e. consumption and labor supply of household members, depend on their “bargaining power”. This is true whether the decision-making process can be represented by a cooperative game (Manser and Brown 1980; McElroy and Horney 1981; Lundberg and Pollak 1994), by a non cooperative game (Bergström 1997; Chen and Woolley 2001; Konrad and Lommerud 1995, 2000; Lundberg et al. 1997; Udry 1996; Ulph 2006), or is only assumed to be Pareto-optimal, as in collective models (Bourguignon and Chiappori 1992; Browning and Chiappori 1998; Chiappori 1988, 1992; Moreau and Donni 2002). Starting with the non–unitary approach, we introduce two concepts defining intra-household equality. We follow Kalugina et al. (2009) using subjective data to infer household sharing of income. Here, we moreover infer household utility distribution. Our empirical strategy consists of applying probit-type model accounting for discrete unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings refute the unitary model hypothesis regarding income pooling at the household level and support the assumptions made by bargaining models. In particular, we show that relative wages and age difference of spouses impact the sharing of income and utility.Footnote 1
 Intra household welfare distribution is analyzed in its dynamics during the transitional period in Russia. The economic transition from a centrally planned system to a market economy introduced since 1992 led to dramatic changes in the Russian economy and was accompanied by a considerable fall in individual and household incomes (Mikhalev 1998). According to official data (Goskomstat 2000), during the period 1991–1999, the GDP decreased by 37% and industrial output fell by 54%. The country suffered from high and continuing inflation. By mid 1998, the Russian economy was showing signs of recovery, but in August 1998 the country faced a severe financial crisis accompanied by a devaluation of the ruble, default on both domestic and foreign debts, and a collapse of the stock market (Lokshin and Ravallion 2000). For many Russians this crisis was reflected in a considerable real wage decline: −13.3% in 1998 and −22% in 1999 (Goskomstat 2004). Since 1999, macroeconomic indicators look better: continuous GDP growth starting in 1999 and growth in real wages and employment (Goskomstat 2008). The economic crisis seriously impacted the labor market: according to RLMS data, the wage gap between men and women increased significantly during and after the crisis (Gerry et al. 2004;Footnote 2 Glinskaya and Mroz 2000; Lacroix and Radtchenko 2009). Men often moonlighted while women increased their domestic labor supply. These behavioral changes not only have distributive impacts within households but they can also induce changes in social norms, more specifically a movement away from the emphasis on equal employment of men and women during the communist period.Footnote 3 In recent years, a significant proportion of women have withdrawn from the work force to become housewives while at the same time young women have become more active, more inclined to embrace professional careers, and more mobile in labor markets. All these trends inevitably influence intra-household relations and consequently the decision process. The next section presents the data and discusses some Russian labor market adjustments. Section 3 presents the descriptive statistics of subjective questions and validates the assumptions regarding subjective data. Section 4 introduces two concepts defining intra-household equality and consequent econometric applications. Section 5 discusses the main empirical results. Section 6 concludes.",12

Chiswick,Magnus Lofstrom,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"International migration appears to have increased in almost every decade over the past 150 years, although there were ebbs and flows across the decades. Moreover, it is expected that international migration flows will continue to increase in the foreseeable future. These movements of people have important implications for the migrants themselves and their households, as well as for the households they join in the destination and those left behind in the origin. The labor market adjustment of immigrants is important for understanding the economic well being of the immigrants and their families in the destination, and through remittances, those in the origin. It is also important for understanding incentives for migration, as a more successful adjustment discourages return migration and encourages subsequent migration by others. Their success influences the “fiscal balance” of immigration, whether immigrants pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits from the government in the destination. Moreover, the impact of immigrants on the distribution of income and the aggregate level of income of the host population depends, in part, on their status or the role they play in the labor market. The economic adjustment will determine, in part, the extent to which immigrant labor is a complement to or a substitute for physical capital and various types (skill level) of native workers, and hence their impact on aggregate income and its distribution. Thus, one of the key elements for discerning the overall impact of immigration is their labor market adjustment. This topic was itself one of the first to be studied in the modern research on immigration. The title of Chiswick’s seminal 1978 Journal of Political Economy article “The Effect of Americanization on the Earnings of Foreign-Born Men” is self-explanatory, and it served as the spring-board for what is now an extensive research literature on immigrant labor market adjustment in the US and many other destination countries across the globe. While many research questions about immigrant labor market adjustment have been answered over the past three decades, the research has also raised new and challenging questions. The asking and addressing of research questions is a never-ending process, yet progress is made as our understanding of issues has deepened. This volume is intended to address additional questions regarding the labor market adjustment of immigrants. In the six papers many research questions are answered, but, as is the case in any good research, additional questions do emerge. The composition of immigrants in receiving countries changes over time. This has been shown to be both an important and controversial factor affecting not only the labor market adjustment of immigrants but also the impact of immigration on native, and other immigrant, workers’ employment outcomes?. The first two papers build on the labor market integration literature and resolve paradoxes in immigrant adjustment by emphasizing the importance of period effects and the distinction for earnings of the difference between the “price” and “quantity” of human capital. In both instances an increase in immigration depresses the relative earnings of new immigrants (the “price” effect) compared to earlier cohorts of immigrants more established in the destination and the native born. In “Testing the Immigrant Assimilation Hypothesis with Longitudinal Data”, Michael Beenstock, Barry R. Chiswick, and Ari Paltiel compare three methods for analyzing immigrant earnings, the analysis of cross-sectional data, the synthetic cohort analysis using more than one cross-section, and longitudinal or panel data analysis. They use data on adult immigrant men from the 1983 and 1995 Censuses of Israel, including a matched 1983/1995 sample. In the cross-section immigrant earnings increase at a decreasing rate with duration in the destination, as hypothesized by the theory of immigrant adjustment. Yet synthetic cross-section and longitudinal data analyses seem to contradict the hypothesized quadratic relation between earnings and duration. The authors show that the latter two methods of analysis are sensitive to the very strong “period effects” in Israel. The apparent rejection of the immigrant assimilation hypothesis arises from the steep increase in the return to country-specific human capital that increased the earnings of long duration immigrants. This was itself a consequence of the large immigration of refugees from the former Soviet Union who had little Israel-specific human capital. The paper offers a cautionary note on the use of longitudinal data to study immigrant earnings when there are potential period effects. By taking advantage of the matched 1983/1995 sample, Beenstock, Chiswick, and Paltiel find that those who died, who left the labor force, or who could not be matched because of problems with the identification number had lower earnings in 1983 than those who had earnings in both periods. There was, however, no difference in earnings in 1983 between those who were known to have emigrated and those who remained in the Israeli labor market. This selective sample attrition affects the assessment of immigrant earnings assimilation in synthetic cohort and longitudinal data analysis. In “The Quantity and Quality of New Immigrants to the US” Sarah E. Bohn addresses whether the quality of more recent immigrant cohorts, as measured by earnings shortly after arrival, has declined over time. Looking at immigrant cohorts from 1970 to 1990 using US Census data, Bohn shows that the “quality” of immigrants has hardly changed, but that the decline in the rental “price” of a unit of quality has been largely responsible for the decline over time in new immigrant earnings. Bohn attributes this decline in the relative “price” to the increased labor market competition that new immigrants face from the increased size of immigrant cohorts in recent decades. This competition would have depressed initial earnings, giving the appearance of a decline in quality, and steepened the earnings-duration profile. The roles of job search and job turnover have not previously been addressed in the economics literature seeking to explain migration decisions. These factors are also likely to be important determinants of both the fiscal impact of immigration and immigrant labor market adjustments. Silvio Rendon and Alfredo Cuecuecha use several data sets, including data from the Mexican Migration Project and the Census of Mexico, in “International Job Search: Mexicans in and out of the US.” They model jointly job search, savings behavior and migration of Mexican nationals to and from the US. They show that many Mexicans tend to migrate when young, save while in the US, and return home at an older age. The propensity to return home is greater when they are wealthier (greater savings from earnings) and when labor market conditions in Mexico improve relative to those in the US. Increased migration costs reduce Mexican migration. Greater job mobility, such as a higher probability of finding a job, also increases migration rates. In their simulation subsidizing return migration would decrease the number of older Mexican migrants living and working in the US, but would actually increase the incentive for younger Mexicans to migrate to the US. These findings also contribute to the immigration literature on the sensitivity of migration flows to macro economic conditions. In light of the recent observed slowdown in the growth of the immigrant population in the US, this is a topic currently receiving attention in the media. Another dimension of the labor market adjustment of immigrants, and the determinants of their earnings, is the number of hours they work in a week. A longer workweek raises current earnings, and may increase future earnings to the extent that it increases on-the-job training and promotion opportunities. Fernando A. Lozano studies this issue in “Understanding the Workweek of Foreign-Born Workers in the United States” through a comparative analysis of foreign-born and native-born men (age 25–64) in the 1994–2006 Current Population Survey. The analysis focuses on those who worked very many hours in a week—50 or more hours. The immigrants were found to be less likely than the native born to work very long hours, and the nativity gap in the proportion working such long hours was greater among the more educated and salaried workers. Further analysis suggests that immigrants are less likely to work very long hours if they have a higher probability of return migration. Thus, in the Lozano study the more skilled and those more likely to remain appear to make greater investments in a long workweek. These findings do appear to be inconsistent with the usual proposition that immigrants with a high expectation of return migration have an incentive to work long hours in the US because their wages in the US are so much higher than their wages will be when they return to their country of origin. That is, they respond to the higher temporary wage by a greater labor supply. Further research will help clarify the discrepancy. Do local characteristics which do not directly affect the local labor market conditions impact employment outcomes of immigrants? This issue is addressed by Anna Piil Damm and Michael Rosholm in “Employment Effects of Spatial Dispersal of Refugees.” Denmark had a policy of randomly distributing refugees across the country in order to reduce the propensity of refugees to form ethnic-specific enclaves or concentrations. The authors study the location and employment behavior of refugee men age 30–59 during the period 1986–1998. They first examine the propensity for the refugees to move from their initial assigned location. They find that relocation rates are lower among refugees assigned to more populous areas, areas with more immigrants in general, and areas with more immigrants from their country of origin. They refer to places with low relocation rates as having high “place utility.” They expected to find that high place utility would lower the reservation wage and hence shorten the time to accepting a job offer. In fact, no such effect of co-nationals is found. They do, however, find that local labor market conditions matter: refugees assigned to high unemployment rate areas take longer to find their first job. Curiously, they find that an increase in the proportion of votes the right-wing parties received in the last local election reduced the length of time to the first job. This raises an interesting direction for future research: What is the effect on immigrant adjustment of the political environment in which they settle? The final paper in this volume is a comparative analysis of immigrants’ earnings in two destinations. Augustin de Coulon and Jonathan Wadsworth’s study is “On the Relative Rewards to Immigration: A Comparison of the Relative Labor Market Position of Indians in the US, the UK, and India.” The focus is on the relative position in the wage distribution of male and female Indian full-time employees in the three locations. The Indian immigrants experience an incredible increase in their real wages in both the US and UK, which explains their migration since rates of return to migration are related to the absolute wage gain relative to costs. The migrants do, however, experience a decline in their relative position in the wage distribution compared to statistically identical men and women who remained in India. What is less obvious, however, is the extent to which the relative position in the wage distribution, controlling for the wage differential or rate of return from migration, matters in the migration decision. This would seem to be another topic worthy of further research. The six papers in this Special Issue represent new and innovative contributions to the literature on the economics of immigration. These include papers on fundamental household decision making, such as labor supply behavior, and the returns to the household’s decision to migrate. Other papers show how the assessment of an immigrant’s adjustment and impact can be sensitive to both exogenous and endogenous factors, including the migration of earlier and contemporaneous peoples. The consequences of immigration are deep and widespread, with many implications for both the household economy and the aggregate economy. Some of these consequences will be explored in a future Special Issue of this Review on the Economics of Immigration.",4

Chiswick,Ari Paltiel,Male,Male,Male,Male,"From the dawn of research on the immigrant assimilation hypothesis (IAH) concerning the economic adjustment of immigrants in the destination country, an important role has been played by duration in the destination (Chiswick 1978a, 1978b, 1979). The earliest studies (for example, Hanoch (1961); Kuznets (1973)) used cross-sectional data to analyze the effect of duration. However, from the beginning there was an awareness of the potential biases in using cross-sectional data to infer dynamic or longitudinal behavior (Chiswick 1980). The ideal solution seemed to be to use longitudinal (panel) data, by following the same immigrants over time, rather than comparing at a point in time different cohorts of immigrants who arrived in various time periods (cross-sectional data). However, longitudinal data on the earnings of immigrants were scarce (Black et al. 2003). To overcome this obstacle, Borjas (1985) proposed applying the “synthetic cohort methodology” (SCM), which uses a succession of cross-sections from the US Census to construct synthetic panel data. SCM does not compare the same immigrants over time because of re-migration, death and sampling issues, but at least it goes some way to controlling for cohort effects.Footnote 1 Methodological doubts about SCM have arisen in part due to findings obtained from longitudinal data. The overall impression from longitudinal data is that SCM estimates of immigrant earnings assimilation may be biased upwards due to selective exit as a result of death or return migration of those who receive lower earnings. Chiswick (1980, pp. 347–354) was perhaps the first to test the IAH regarding earnings using longitudinal data through an analysis of the earnings of adult men in the National Longitudinal Survey. Although the immigrant sample size was small, he found a faster earnings growth from 1964 to 1973 among the foreign born than among the native born white men aged 44–56 in 1965. The earnings advantage of the immigrants was 3.2% (t = 0.52) in 1965 and 12.1% (t = 1.79) in 1973. Borjas (1989) tested the IAH using longitudinal data for immigrant scientists and engineers in the US during 1974–78. He found little evidence of earnings assimilation in these longitudinal data. However, since the average duration in the US in the sample was 19.2 years, it is arguable that by 1974 they had already completed their assimilation. Moreover, due to selective exit from the data of those who dropped out of this occupation as they became managers, the effect of duration on earnings was biased downward. Hu (2000) compared SCM estimates of assimilation in the US with longitudinal estimates and found that the assimilation effect weakens and even disappears in longitudinal data. Using similar data, but over a shorter time period, Duleep and Dowhan (2002) showed that the assimilation effect reappears if the starting wage is allowed to vary by immigrant cohort (see also Duleep and Regets 1997). Hum and Simpson (2000, 2004) used panel data on Canadian immigrants to show that immigrant earnings did not grow faster than native earnings. Fertig and Schurer (2007) use panel data for Germany to show that for three out of five immigrant cohorts the assimilation effect all but disappears. Finally, Lubotsky (2007) shows that SCM induces positive bias in immigrant wage growth in the US when compared with longitudinal data for two main reasons. First, SCM does not take selective out-migration into consideration. Secondly, SCM defines immigrant cohorts in terms of year of immigration. It turns out, however, that immigrants may have migrated more than once. Therefore, SCM may classify someone who migrated in year t as belonging to cohort t when in fact he migrated for the first time in N years prior to year t, or the immigrant may have entered in year t−N, left the country and then returned several years later (year t) but records year of entry as t−N. Longitudinal data sets on immigrants have become more common, or are in the process of being created, for several countries. These offer the prospect of longitudinal analyses of immigrant earnings (Chiswick et al. 2005; Chiswick and Miller 2005). However, they tend to suffer from four limitations. One is their relatively small sample size. Another is their relatively short time span, typically the immigrants are followed for only a few years. A third limitation is that they are samples only of immigrants, without a comparison group of native- born workers. Finally, longitudinal data are costly to collect, and sample attrition can be a major problem. Whether synthetic cohort or panel data are used, a potential limiting factor in the analysis is the “period effect” (Chiswick 1986). That is, to what extent is the relation between the outcome measure and duration in the destination sensitive to the particular time period. Correspondingly, the shape and slope of the “assimilation curve” may vary over time. It is shown here that period effects may limit what may be learned from longitudinal data. They may create the illusion that there is no immigrant assimilation effect when the converse is true. Indeed, period effects can even create the misleading impression that the assimilation curve slopes in the wrong direction. This paper uses a large panel sample of immigrants in Israel observed at two points in time, 1983 and 1995. This dataset satisfies several concerns raised above regarding longitudinal data on immigrants. The sample size is large and it spans a long time period. Since the data come from matched census data the problem of comparing different samples over the intervening 12 years does not apply. There is attrition in the data, but the reasons for the attrition are known—emigration, mortality and matches that cannot be made. As a result, the effects of attrition can be analyzed directly. The IAH predicts that, given everything else the same, the growth rate of immigrant earnings between 1983 and 1995 should vary inversely with duration in Israel in 1983. Since the source of these data is from the matched censuses of 1983 and 1995, empirical tests of IAH can be performed using all three methodologies, the original cross-section methodology, the synthetic cohort method, and longitudinal or panel data analysis. Indeed, like Hu (2000), Lubotsky (2007) and Fertig and Schurer (2007), it is found here that IAH is clearly corroborated by the first two methodologies, yet it seems to be rejected or weakened in the longitudinal analysis. Reconciling these conflicting results depends crucially on period effects. It is shown here that if the assimilation curve became steeper (as happened in Israel), a statistical illusion is created where the true assimilation effect is eclipsed either partially or totally, and may even be reversed in longitudinal data. There are no price effects in cross-sectional data, so that only the quantity (human capital effects) is observed. In longitudinal data with no period effects (no price changes) once again only the quantity effects are observed. If, however, there are period effects such that the price of a unit of human capital increases, in longitudinal data the increase in earnings of long-duration immigrants (a small increase but a large stock of destination human capital) can be greater than the relative increase for recent immigrants (a relatively large increase in destination human capital on a very small base). The confounding of price and quantity effects can give the appearance of the rejection of the IAH in longitudinal data. This paper is not concerned with the question that has pre-occupied numerous investigators (Chiswick 1978b; Borjas 1985; Eckstein and Weiss 2004; Friedberg 2000; Hum and Simpson 2000) whether immigrant wages converge upon native wages. Rather than compare immigrants with natives, immigrants are compared with each other. This research does not, therefore, focus on wage convergence in the cross-section but on whether the wage growth of recent immigrants exceeds the wage growth of otherwise similar immigrants who migrated earlier. To answer this question one obviously requires longitudinal data, which most probably explains why it has not previously been asked. A new type of test of IAH is proposed here by comparing the wage growth with respect to duration in the destination of more recent immigrants with that of long-duration immigrants.",26
8.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,27 September 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-009-9066-5,The quantity and quality of new immigrants to the US,March 2010,Sarah E. Bohn,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The number of immigrants in the United States skyrocketed in the latter half of the twentieth century. Both on a national scale and in local communities, the economic, social, and cultural effects of immigration are hotly debated. The characteristics of immigrants are key to understanding these effects, and changes in the type of immigrants choosing to come to the US in this most recent wave has elevated the debate to a new level. One of the commonly accepted findings about the new immigrants to the US is that they are of lower “quality”. This raises concern that they are a net economic drain and that they are less likely to assimilate. In this paper, I show that the conclusions about declining immigrant cohort “quality” based on wage differentials are overstated. I find that the increasing competition between immigrants in local labor markets can explain up to forty percent of the declining wage growth of new immigrants between 1970 and 1990, which has otherwise been attributed to declining unobserved “cohort quality”. There are two major strands of concern about the labor market impact of recent immigration, in both the research and public sphere. This paper considers the two strands jointly. First, there is concern and evidence that the labor market quality of new immigrants has declined. The decline has been attributed to both observable and unobservable characteristics (Jasso et al. 2000; Borjas 1985, 1995). Although recent evidence suggests previous findings on a widening skill gap between immigrants and natives were overstated (Smith 2006), there remains a belief that the fall in new immigrant wages over time reflects a decline in unobservable quality of immigrants. The second strand, which is perhaps more heavily researched and debated, considers the impact of immigration on wages in the US labor market. Most studies focus on the effect of immigration on wages of native-born workers. With a few exceptions (Borjas 2003; Borjas et al. 2006), these studies generally identify very small negative effects, if any, of immigration on the wages of native workers. However, recent theory and evidence suggests that the primary impact of immigration may be on the wages of immigrants, rather than native-born. This could be due to imperfect substitutability of immigrant for native workers (Ottaviano and Peri 2006; Cortes 2008), the segmentation of workers and firms by ethnicity and language (Hellerstein and Neumark 2003), or the geographic concentration of immigrants. These suggest that increased immigration may have a negative impact on the wages of immigrants. This paper estimates changes in unobserved “quality” of new immigrants accounting for the wage impact of immigration on immigrants. Building on the recent literature, this study shows that there is a powerful alternative story that can explain declining immigrant “quality”. In particular, the negative impact of immigration on wages of immigrants explains a relatively large portion—up to 40%—of the decline in cohort quality of new immigrants relative to natives between 1970 and 2000.",7
8.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,07 October 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-009-9070-9,International job search: Mexicans in and out of the US,March 2010,Sílvio Rendon,Alfredo Cuecuecha,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"International migration between two countries is a process whereby migrants cross borders bidirectionally.
Footnote 1 Mexico and the US are two neighboring countries with a particularly intensive dynamics of migration and return migration: in year 2000 Mexican migrants in the US represent above 10% of the Mexican labor force, many of which return back to Mexico.
Footnote 2 It is argued that this migration process depends basically on international wage differentials and preferences for origin. In this paper we use a model of job search, savings and migration to show that migration and return migration heavily depend not just on wage differentials or preferences, but also on job turnover and, in particular, on job-to-job transitions. To a great extent, Mexicans migrate to the US seeking job mobility, which they do not totally find in their own country. This is the first paper to explain international migration in close connection with the process of job search. We propose a model in which individuals search for jobs and accumulate wealth in two labor markets. We structurally estimate this model to match observed patterns of migration, wage growth and job turnover in Mexico and the US and analyze several potential regime changes. Our main result is that a more dynamic labor market in Mexico, assigning Mexico the US arrival rates while employed, reduces migration rates from Mexico to the US to very low levels. Migration from Mexico is caused by faster job mobility, the speed for moving to better paid jobs, not just by higher wage levels in the US.
Footnote 3 This decrease in migration is substantially larger than the one produced by a comparable increase in wage offers in Mexico.
Footnote 4 On the other hand, doubling migration costs from Mexico to the US reduces the highest migration rates from 19 to 5%, while subsidizing return migration in $300 reduces the highest migration rate from 19% to just 15%. Thus, increasing migration costs is shown to be effective in decreasing migration from Mexico to the US. These new results come from analyzing jointly migration turnover and job search dynamics. So far, migration has been explained by mechanisms based on international wage differentials,
Footnote 5 which only generate one-directional migration (Sjaastad 1962) To explain return migration the literature has extended these mechanisms to allow for incomplete information, heterogeneity in preferences for origin, and higher returns to capital or human capital in origin countries.
Footnote 6 These type of migrants are typically called target savers (Massey et al. 1993) and these models life cycle explanations (Yang 2006). Thus, the literature has evolved to analyze migration using dynamics models that allow for bidirectional migration over the life cycle. An important aspect studied by these models is the concept of social networks formed by migrants, which was first noted by Piore (1979). Piore study of Mexican migrants in the US describes how individuals that migrate illegally from Mexico to the US help each other in the migration process, starting from the crossing of the border, and then with job referrals and sharing living expenses in the US. Massey et al. (1987) showed the importance of migrant networks by finding that knowing individuals in the US increases the migration probability. Munshi (2003) also showed that Mexican migrants with networks have better wages and higher probability of being employed. The importance of social networks has been confirmed for other Latin American immigrants in the US (Massey and Aysa 2005). Recent analyses, however, have found that migrant social networks do not work always with the same efficiency and that their results over migration depend on specific factors particular to the communities where the migrants originate (Garip 2008). For some authors, what matters is not only the social network but the social capital embedded on it. According to Putnam (1993) the social capital is defined as the norms, trust and networks that can improve efficiency in the society by facilitating coordination and cooperation. Under this interpretation, social networks can some times also deter migration (Banerjee and Newman 1997). This is because sometimes social capital needs of strong ties and reciprocity mechanisms that requires that the participants be present and near from each other (Coleman 1990; Faist 2000). All dynamic economic models of migration that have included networks focus their attention in the formation and impact of social networks formed by migrants (Delechat 2001; Angelucci 2002; Haslag et al. 2004; Colussi 2006; Kennan and Walker 2006; Gemici 2007). Delechat finds that the probability of working in the US increases with the own personal US experience, as well as with the existence of family migrant networks and larger migration prevalence in the community. Angelucci (2002) estimates a dynamic model of migration in which higher migration costs will deter some people from migrating, but it will also increase migrants’ duration in the US. Haslag et al. (2004) propose an overlapping generations model in which individuals can invest in the formation of social capital, which depends on the number of people from the family that are in the US and in the investment they made in the network. The network here provides not only with job offers in the US, but also with transfers when old. Colussi (2006) estimates a dynamic general equilibrium model of migration and finds that the existence of networks generates an S-shaped migration process, in which migration first increases at an increasing rate and then slows down. He also shows that increasing migration costs increase migration levels as individuals stay longer in the US. Kennan and Walker (2006) propose a model of migration to several locations with specific income prospects; thereby, migration dynamics is conceived of actually as a process of search for the best geographical match. Gemici (2007) estimates a model of married couples’ migration and employment decisions, finding that migration events tend to occur mostly as a response to men’s opportunities. In our model, agents look for jobs and accumulate wealth in one country, but can move to the neighboring country paying a monetary cost of migration. We estimate this model by Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) to match observed migration and return migration, job search outcomes and turnover in both labor markets. Data come from the Mexican Migration Project (MMP), Mexican and American employment surveys (ENEU and CPS) and the census. Using the recovered behavioral parameters of the model we perform simulations of counterfactual scenarios, characterized by US arrival rates while employed in Mexico, a higher wage offer distribution in Mexico, higher migration costs from Mexico to the US and a subsidy to return migration to Mexico. Our main variables of interest are migration rates and flows between Mexico and the US. These experiments, which are not obvious to implement in a reduced form approach, are very straightforward to carry out in a structural framework. We also introduce the concept of a retention wage, the lowest acceptable wage to stay in the current location, in interaction with the reservation wage, the lowest acceptable wage to accept a job. When agents are initially in Mexico, they accumulate wealth to pay the migration cost. Once they can pay it, they move to the US and stay there until they have saved some level of wealth. Once this target is accomplished, agents return to Mexico. Only agents of high wages and high levels of wealth stay in the US. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section explains and characterizes a model of job search, migration and savings; Sect. 3 describes the different datasets used, as well as the criteria chosen to select the sample and the moments used in the estimation. We also present descriptive statistics for these data. Section 4 details the estimation method, a simulated method of moments. Section 5 discusses and interprets the estimation results and provides goodness of fit tests. Section 6 performs counterfactual experiments of improvements of labor markets in Mexico, characterized by higher arrival rates while employed and better wage offers in Mexico, and variations of migration costs. Finally, Sect. 7 summarizes the paper’s main conclusions.",15

Lozano,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Today, foreign-born workers shape the United States’ labor market. The US Census Bureau reports that more than 30 million people currently living in the US were born abroad. Not surprisingly, economists have paid considerable attention to this group, and previous work spans from their labor market performance (for example Chiswick 1978, Borjas 1985, 1995 among many others) to their fertility decisions (Gordon and Macintosh 2007). Nonetheless, little attention has been paid to the length of the workweek of foreign-born workers, and whether it differs from that of the native-born. While the conventional stereotype in the popular press is that immigrants tend to work very long hours (for example DeConto 2006 or Porter 2006) this issue has yet to be examined in depth. Simultaneously, economists have been interested in understanding the consequences of workers’ long hours of work, and showed substantial evidence that working long hours is an important determinant of future earnings growth. For example, using data from the US and Germany, Bell and Freeman (2001a) show that hours of work are positively related to a workers’ earnings growth and future promotions. Further, and in a different paper, Bell and Freeman (2001b) show that American workers perceive that hours of work in the present will determine their earnings in the future. Similarly, Bratti and Staffolani (2007) use British household data to show that higher hours of work are positively correlated with an increased probability of attaining a promotion, even after controlling for worker heterogeneity. Perhaps, this is because long hours of work may work as a signal of the worker’s commitment to the firm and effort. Not only do long workweeks relate to future earnings and other labor market opportunities, but understanding the supply of hours is important to understand overall worker’s welfare. Failing to account for weekly hours of work may distort welfare analyses. For example, as Johnson and Kuhn (2004) point out, if high income earners tend to supply longer hours, then increasing earnings inequality may overstate welfare inequality as leisure is a normal good. Finally, and as Kuhn and Lozano (2008) point out, understanding the trade off between leisure and market labor is important as this allows us to better understand the quality and rhythm of someone’s life. The goal of this paper is to document and explain any differences in the number of weekly hours of work between foreign-born and native workers. Following Kuhn and Lozano (2008), I focus on one dimension of labor supply: workers supplying 50 or more hours per week (I will refer to these workers as those supplying long hours hereafter.). This contrasts with the previous literature on immigrant labor supply, which concentrates, for example, on family labor supply (Baker and Benjamin 1997; Blau et al. 2003) or annual hours of work (Blau and Kahn 2005). My results show that differences in the workweek between immigrants and natives differ across hourly and salary paid workers: after controlling for demographic characteristics, hourly paid immigrants are as likely to work long hours as their native counterparts, but long hours differences still persist among salary paid workers. Given this—perhaps surprising—result, I present two empirical results that potentially explain these differences: (1) Within occupation native-immigrant’s differences in hours of work are greatest in occupations where earnings differences between these groups are greatest; (2) Immigrants are less likely to supply long weekly hours in occupations where the residual earnings dispersion (net of demographic characteristics) is greatest. The first result is not surprising, and is consistent with traditional labor supply models where hours of work depend on the worker’s contemporaneous earnings. But the second result is, since earnings inequality is not typically associated with traditional labor supply analyses, and has only recently been adapted by labor economists (see Bell and Freeman 2001a, b or Kuhn and Lozano 2008). The basic argument for using inequality as a determinant of labor supply is that hours in period t will be positively associated with earnings in period t + 1, perhaps because longer workweeks raise the worker’s future position on the within occupation earnings distribution. A wider spread of the earnings distribution will in turn increase the incentive to supply long hours. As in the previous literature, I assume that the within occupation earnings inequality is a good approximation for the slope of a worker’s lifetime earnings, and this is an important metric as it captures the future rewards from working long hours. Heuristically, this is not different to tournament theory (Lazear and Rosen 1981) in a work setting where workers’ rewards are determined by the workers’ relative outcomes, or to efficiency wages (Fehr et al. 1998) where higher wages are used to exert optimal effort from the worker. Again, the basic intuition is that as the within occupation earnings inequality widens, so will the incentive to supply long hours. Further, these incentives will differ between hourly paid and salary paid workers: hourly paid workers’ input is verifiable by the employer and can be rewarded on concurrent compensation, but such is not the case for salary paid workers, where individual output is observed only in the long run and effort not verifiable by the employer (Fama 1991). If earnings inequality does capture the future stream of a worker’s income, then this metric should be at least as important to determine an immigrant worker’s labor supply as the contemporaneous wage is. If an immigrant worker perceives a positive probability of job separation because of either temporary or permanent return migration to the source country (Borjas and Bratsberg 1996; Lubotsky 2007), or further migration within the host country (DaVanzo 1983), then the expectation of future migrations will change the slope of the worker’s lifetime expected earnings and thus change the incentives to supply long hours. Intuitively, my argument follows the results presented either by Borjas (1982), Dustmann (1993) or Cortes (2004). Borjas explores the rate of economic mobility of Hispanic immigrants in the US and argues that Cuban immigrants—political refugees—are more likely to invest in the host economy because they face higher costs of return migration than other immigrants do. Dustmann argues that temporary migrants are less likely than permanent migrants to invest in host-country specific human capital, and using German data shows that temporary migrants show flatter earnings assimilation profiles as years in the host country increase. Cortes (2004) shows that refugee migrants—with longer expected time horizon in the host country, and thus higher incentive to invest in host country skills—have steeper wage assimilation profiles than economic immigrants and work on average more annual hours. The results in this paper are similar to those in this literature: differences in hours of work between salary paid immigrant and native workers persist in occupations with wide earnings inequality. This suggests that an immigrant worker’s shorter expected time horizon in the source country attenuates the incentives to supply long workweeks. This paper highlights the importance that occupation characteristics have on an immigrant’s time allocation between market labor and leisure. Particularly important is the ability to accrue future rewards from working long hours today. To the extent that current hours of work determine future labor market outcomes, it is important to consider any differences between immigrant and native workers in their incentives to supply long hours, as these will most likely determine the workers’ future prosperity and immigrants’ earnings assimilation profile.",5

Recent empirical studiesFootnote 1 have tested the analysis of the absolute gains to emigration, embedded in the extended Roy model of self-selection, Borjas (1987, 1999), by comparing wage levels of similar individuals in both the host and the origin countries. Grogger and Hanson (2008) have broadened this approach by distinguishing between the factors that determine the decision to emigrate from the factors that determine the choice of destination country of migrants. In our paper we argue that an individual’s relative position in the wage distribution may also be an argument in the decision making process. The literature on life satisfaction and well being, Clark and Oswald (1998), Clark et al. (2008), has for some time argued that relative incomes are relevant alongside absolute income levels in optimising behaviour. Given this we suggest that location decisions could depend not just on a comparison of potential wage levels but also on the relative purchasing power, or status, that moving to the host country may command compared to that foregone by moving. A relative wage focus can therefore reveal whether any wage gain from immigration is accompanied by a movement up or down the wage distribution compared to the counterfactual had no move taken place. While the absolute income gains are expected to be large for most immigrants from a developing to a developed country, any negative changes in purchasing power that accompany those absolute gains could become a significant, potentially offsetting, factor for the decision to migrate. Differences in the levels of labour demand or supply, between source and host country will affect the assimilation profile of immigrants and hence both an immigrant’s wage level and their position in the wage distribution in the host country relative to that in the source country. As such the positional ranking may be higher or lower in the host relative to the sender country. If the cross-country transfer of skills is inefficient, then immigrants may be matched to jobs that are not suited for their qualifications. This would mean that immigrants would appear lower down the wage distribution of the host country, other things equal, than had they remained in the sender country. Extending this argument to several potential host countries, any differences in supply or demand patterns across different hosts should mean that similar immigrants might be observed at different points in the various host wage distributions. This could also be generated by differences in immigration policies or in other labour market institutions across countries, which may have differential effects on the quality of a job match and hence an individual’s position in the wage distribution. In what follows, we take immigrants from a single source country, India, and compare their positional rankings in the wage distribution of two host countries, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US), to the counterfactual position in the wage distribution in India. The two host countries are important destinations for Indian immigrants, together accounting for a quarter of the total annual outflow of all immigrants from India and a much higher fraction of the outflow of skilled emigrants. Indians now comprise the third largest ethnic grouping of immigrants in the US and the largest group of immigrants to the UK. Also, despite the common language, differences in wage inequality, labour market institutions, the rate of assimilation, sectoral distribution and immigration policies all make comparison of outcomes in the two countries insightful. However concentration on absolute gains alone makes it harder to assess the full extent of the consequences of the decision to emigrate.Footnote 2
 Section 2 outlines the theoretical framework to our study, while Sect. 3 outlines that data used in the study and the institutional features surrounding immigration of Indians to the US and to the UK. Section 4 offers results that despite large absolute income gains suggest the typical immigrant also experiences a significant fall in their relative ranking in the wage distribution compared to the position similar individuals achieve by remaining in the origin country. Section 5 concludes.",5

Reichman,Hope Corman,Ofira Schwartz-Soicher,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Prenatal care is one of the most frequently used health services in the United States, according to data from the 1995 National Medical Ambulatory Care Survey (Schappert 1997; Kogan et al. 1998b). Standard prenatal care, which involves a series of encounters during the gestational period, educates women about pregnancy, monitors medical conditions they may have, tests for gestational health problems, and refers expectant mothers to services such as support groups and social services (March of Dimes 2009). Owing largely to expansions of Medicaid for pregnant women in the late 1980s and early 1990, prenatal care has become quasi-universal, with 92–96% of mothers giving birth in the US in 2006 receiving at least some prenatal care (Martin et al. 2009). However, there is variation in the timing of initiation of that care. For example, 17% of births in 2006 occurred to mothers who initiated care after the first trimester of pregnancy. The rates of late and no care are higher among mothers who are young and poor (Lia-Hoagberg et al. 1990). Economists have been studying the production of infant health for several decades. Prenatal care (usually the timing of initiation) has been a key input of interest, and the outcomes studied have typically been infant mortality, birthweight, or low birthweight. A recent study by Reichman et al. (2009) also investigated whether an infant is born with an abnormal health condition. Much of this literature is reviewed by Conway and Kutinova (2006) and Reichman et al. (2009). Most recent studies of the effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes have found very modest or no effects. For example, Reichman et al. (2009) found that first trimester care reduces birthweight by only 20 g, and Evans and Lien (2005) found that prenatal visits do not have a significant effect on birthweight overall, but have a positive effect among mothers early in their pregnancies. The finding of a small or no overall effect of prenatal care is consistent with findings from a recent descriptive study with extremely rich data (Reichman and Teitler 2005) and a recent review in the medical literature indicating that few features of prenatal care would be expected to increase birthweight at the aggregate level (Lu et al. 2003). Overall, the evidence that early or frequent prenatal care improves birth outcomes is less than compelling. A key methodological challenge in estimating the effect of prenatal care on birth outcomes is the potential endogeneity of prenatal care (i.e., the estimated effects of prenatal care use may reflect unobserved characteristics of mothers that are associated with both prenatal care use and the birth outcome). Many studies in the economics literature have used instrumental variables techniques, which have become increasingly sophisticated in terms of model specification and testing, with prenatal care price or availability measures as instruments. Other studies, such as Evans and Lien (2005) have exploited natural experiments (in this case, a bus strike in Pennsylvania). The latter approach, while conceptually appealing, can be applied only under special, somewhat idiosyncratic, circumstances and may not result in findings that are generalizable. Reichman et al. (2009) employed a third approach—using rich data to accurately characterize prenatal care and to proxy theoretically important but typically unobserved variables. The authors were able to assess the sensitivity to different measures, data sources, and model specifications (including instrumental variables models). For example, they found that the difference between self-reported first trimester prenatal care and that based on detailed information recorded in medical records was substantial, and that using the self-reports overestimated the effects of first trimester care on birthweight. Prenatal care may have long-term effects on mothers’ health behaviors, use of pediatric health care, and their children’s health by increasing awareness of how their behaviors and environment can impact the health of their child or by connecting mothers to the health care and social service systems, sometimes for the first time. Postnatal smoking and breastfeeding may be particularly influenced by prenatal care, as those behaviors are universally emphasized in prenatal care protocols (USDHHS 1989). Referrals to counseling or smoking cessation treatment have become typical features of contemporary prenatal care (USDHHS 1989), and there is evidence (much of it based on randomized controlled trials) that prenatal smoking interventions are effective in reducing smoking during pregnancy (Dolan-Mullen et al. 1994; Melvin et al. 2000; Klesges et al. 2001) and in reducing postpartum relapse among mothers who quit smoking during pregnancy (Fang et al. 2004). There is also evidence that prenatal breastfeeding education increases breastfeeding. For example, Kistin et al. (1989) found, in a randomized controlled trial, that prenatal breastfeeding education and counseling increased rates of breastfeeding among urban, black, low-income women. Data from the 2002 Prenatal Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) Surveillance Report indicate that, in the 27 PRAMS states combined, over 70% of mothers reported that, during the course of their prenatal care, a health care provider or worker counseled them (beyond offering printed materials) on the harmful effects of smoking during pregnancy, and that over 80% reported that their prenatal care counseling included a discussion of breastfeeding (Williams et al. 2006). Postnatal smoking and breastfeeding are important behavioral outcomes because children who are exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke are at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, asthma, and ear infections (USDHHS 2006), and human milk decreases the incidence and/or severity of a wide range of infectious diseases and appears to be protective against many other health conditions, including sudden infant death syndrome, diabetes, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, and neurodevelopmental delays (AAP 2005). Connection and exposure to the health care system through prenatal care may also encourage the use of pediatric care. Descriptive studies have found that children whose mothers have less than adequate prenatal care utilization (based on an index that takes into consideration the month care began and the number of prenatal care visits given gestational age) have significantly fewer well-child visits by age 6 months and are significantly less likely to have adequate immunizations than children of mothers who have adequate prenatal care (Kogan et al. 1998a), and that early prenatal care is positively associated with the number of well-child visits in the first two years of life (Freed et al. 1998). Of course, these associations cannot be interpreted as causal effects. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends eight routine visits to a pediatrician during the first year of life, with a set schedule of assessments for various developmental milestones, screenings, and immunizations (AAP 2008). As far as we know, no previous studies in the economics literature have examined the effects of prenatal care on pediatric health care utilization or parenting practices that could affect children’s health and development. In fact, very few studies (in any literature) have considered potential broader impacts (beyond the birth outcome) of prenatal care. One exception is a recent study by Conway and Kutinova that used data from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey to examine the effects of prenatal care on women’s health. The authors found that receiving early and adequate prenatal care leads mothers to maintain a healthy weight and may reduce lengthy maternal hospitalizations (Conway and Kutinova 2006).",33

It is unclear, however, how much, if at all, this has contributed to an increase in consumers’ surplus or the welfare of households with small children. Theory suggests that, in a competitive market, the entry of new firms increases consumers’ surplus; however, this may not be true in a market with a differentiated service such as childcare. For example, childcare services may differ with respect to quality, proximity and flexibility, making it unlikely for them to be exactly identical products for diverse households. In such a market, the overall effect of entry on the welfare of households is unclear. On the one hand, it has been shown that the price of service can rise with the entry of service providers (Greenhut et al. 1985; Satterthwaite 1979). Entry, therefore, could yield a negative effect on consumers’ surplus. On the other hand, new service providers within a local market are likely to increase proximity to providers and reduce transportation costs. This might offset the negative effect of an increase in the price of service.Footnote 1 In addition, if new providers offer previously unavailable services with quality and flexibility, this might mitigate the cost of the search for a provider that satisfies a household’s preference.Footnote 2 In the case of childcare, if the benefits from better matching and the proximity to service providers dominate, an increase in the availability of childcare could mitigate perceived difficulty in the search for providers. This could in turn improve households’ life satisfaction.Footnote 3 Moreover, such benefits could be particularly large in a market with few providers. For example, the emergence of the first few providers is likely to have a greater impact on the range of available service attributes (proximity, quality and flexibility) compared to the entry of, say, the 11th provider in a market.Footnote 4
 This study provides empirical evidence on the relationship between the availability of service providers and consumers’ surplus, measured by parents’ perceived search costs and life satisfaction, focusing on the market for childcare. For parents with small children, the structure of the childcare market is likely to be a critical component affecting their subjective well-being.Footnote 5 To the author’s knowledge, this is the first study which examines this relationship in the childcare market.Footnote 6 The aim of this paper is not to test the above mentioned pathways through which the availability of care providers might affect consumers’ surplus, but rather to reveal the overall relationship, utilizing new panel data from Australia on the number of center-based childcare places per 100 children within a household’s residential area. The focus on center-based care is likely to be appropriate, given the increasing interest in education-oriented services (OECD 2006).Footnote 7
 My empirical strategy exploits the rapid supply growth that happened in Australia between 2001 and 2006, during which the number of center-based care places grew by 69,122, or 26% (AIHW 2007).Footnote 8 Utilizing this variation, I estimate the community-level fixed effects model, controlling for year effects, state-level trends and a rich array of household and community characteristics. Thus, my estimates show whether a cohort of parents (with a child aged from 0 to 4 years) within a certain community exhibits outcomes different from a previous cohort within the community when it experiences a disproportionate increase in the availability of center-based care relative to the state-level average change. The results show that increased availability of center-based care is associated with a decrease in perceived difficulty in finding ‘good quality care,’ and an improvement in mothers’ satisfaction with the amount of free time available. The results are also suggestive that these findings are not due to endogenous migration by households or endogenous entry by providers. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section describes the institutional settings in the childcare industry in Australia followed by an explanation of the data. Section 4 illustrates my empirical method and Sect. 5 discusses the results. Section 6 provides concluding remarks.",15

8.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,13 June 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-010-9096-z,Parental employment and time with children in Spain,September 2010,Maria Gutiérrez-Domènech,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Over the last century, many countries experienced a significant rise in female labor force participation, especially women with young children. Spain was no exception and female activity rates have increased notably in the last two decades. Freeing up maternal time for paid work has clear advantages such as maintaining mothers’ human capital and increasing the levels of investment in children’s education (Hansen et al. 2006). But the rise in maternal employment has led to debate regarding whether this trend may have an impact on children’s development by changing the time that they spend together. Within this framework, the distinction between time spent covering essential needs and time spent on educational activities is also important since the degree of human capital transferred to children may be different across types of care. For example, Zick et al. (2001) show that more parental involvement in reading/homework activities (Educational Activities) decreases behavioral problems and improves the grades of children. Hence, learning more about the association between parental time and socioeconomic characteristics will definitely be useful to evaluate the extent to which more mothers in paid work may affect future children’s cognitive results. Following this line, we analyze whether there is a significant difference in the amount of childcare time and the type of childcare between working and non-working parents for the Spanish case. The paper also examines whether childcare time allocation varies across other parental characteristics such as education, origin and job. The study is based on a time use survey carried out in the period 2002–2003. For the analysis, childcare is classified as follows: Primary Childcare when the main activity was reported to be childcare, Secondary Childcare when childcare was mentioned as a secondary use of time, and Passive Childcare in which a parent reported any activity (cooking or other) “with children” under 10 years old present. Primary Childcare is subsequently divided into Essential Needs Activities (e.g. feeding) and Educational Activities (e.g. reading). We focus on individuals aged 17 and over who are married or live with their partner and who have at least one child under the age of 17. Although there is extensive literature on this topic for Anglo-Saxon countries, studies for the Spanish case are scarce. The Spanish labor market is characterized by its lower degree of flexibility compared to other countries. For example, job timetables often involve very long lunch breaks and late finishes. This can clearly impose certain obstacles to parents spending time with their children. In terms of childcare availability, funding for under 3 years old is rather limited with some subsidized public nurseries. Children older than 3 years can attend state schools that are practically free of charge. In general, research finds that childcare time spent on educational activities tends to be rather similar or even higher for mothers in paid work than non-employed mothers (Nock and Kingston 1988). Similarly, some studies show that the increase in mothers at work over time has not been accompanied by a significant drop in childcare time (Bianchi 2000; Bittman 1999; Booth et al. 2002; Sandberg and Hofferth 2001; Gauthier et al. 2004). The most likely explanation is that mothers in paid work have reduced the time spent on household and leisure activities, and fathers have also started to get more involved in child rearing (Bianchi et al. 2000; Craig and Bittman 2005; Craig 2007). The relatively weak relationship between parental employment and childcare time spent on educational activities may help to explain why empirical evidence on the effect of mothers’ employment on children’s future outcomes is inconclusive (Greenstein 1995). These studies use data on mothers and children collected over a long period of time and mainly focus on the UK and the US where this sort of data is available. An overall interpretation of this literature suggests that there are negative effects on cognitive results when mothers return to work before the child is 1-year-old (Han et al. 2001; Belsky 2001; Brooks-Gunn et al. 2002; Ermisch and Francesconi 2002). However, in Gregg et al. (2005) the interdependence between the quality of parental care and the quality of non-parental care is highlighted in determining the overall impact of maternal employment. Whether a child is disadvantaged by maternal employment depends on the quality of the care the child receives compared to what would be provided by the mother. In fact, other family characteristics such as parental education tend to be more important elements for child outcomes (Shonkoff and Phillips 2000) than the employment status. The main findings of this paper are the following. First, time spent on Educational Activities is similar between working and non-working parents. Second, there are big differences between mothers and fathers in the allocation of childcare time. Third, the higher the level of education, the longer the time spent on Primary Childcare, for both fathers and mothers, and for both working and non-working individuals. Finally, we find that, for the same number of hours of work, individuals who end their working day after 6 p.m. spend significantly less time on all types of childcare.",40
8.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,30 March 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-010-9093-2,Home-leaving decisions of daughters and sons,September 2010,Maria Concetta Chiuri,Daniela Del Boca,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"A general feature of transitions to adulthood in contemporary developed societies is that young adults tend to study longer, to enter the labor market, leave the parental home, cohabit, marry, and become parents later. Recent data show striking differences in the timing of leaving home for adult children across Europe. In Finland and Denmark, children leave the household between 18 and 22 after which a very negligible proportion still cohabit with their parents. At the other end of the spectrum, in Southern countries, a negligible proportion leaves the household between 18 and 22 and most of them remain home until 30. The so called “latest-late” pattern of transition to adulthood (Billari and Kohler 2004) is linked to the rising age at which young adults complete their education and enter the labor market, leave home, form a union and give first birth. Given the similarities of human capital accumulation, one could expect that young women’s transition to adulthood would not be different from that of young men. Recent analysis of education attainment by gender has shown in fact that women finish school earlier than men (Cammelli 2005). In spite of the differences between countries, a common pattern emerges across countries studied: young women leave home earlier than men (2–3 years). The difference in age young adults that leave the parental home by gender can be certainly in part correlated to the difference in age at first marriage. However, the number of children leaving parental home at the time of the first union has declined and is more than 50% only in Southern Europe and less than 25% in the North (Billari et al. 2001). In our paper we aim to analyze gender differences in a comparative framework and explore whether and where institutional factors characterizing the labor market and the mortgage market have different impacts on daughters and sons’ probability of leaving parental home. No research to our knowledge has specifically focused on these aspects. Given the differences in home leaving decisions across countries, we use the European Community Household Panel (ECHP henceforth), a large international dataset on households. We complement this information with indicators of local marriage, labor markets, mortgage markets imperfections and social expenditures invested in youth. While other papers on home-leaving decisions have considered men and women separately in a tangential manner (Aasve et al. 2001; Le Blanc and Wolff 2006), for us the gender differences are the primary focus. Relative to previous work, we explore this dimension by including in our empirical analysis also measures of labor market, mortgage market and youth policies characteristics. We find some important differences in these institutional effects on home-leaving across genders. Why is it important to analyze home-leaving decisions separately for women and men? For women a late transition to adulthood implies a delay in cohabitation, marriage and fertility. Southern European countries have the highest median age at leaving home as well as the highest median age at parenthood, and fertility is among the lowest, with a clear trend towards further postponement. The average age at first birth is also important because it influences the total number of children a woman might have as well as the population size, and it may affect birth weight and birth defects. For men a slower transition to adulthood may be also critical for the household division of labor, meaning that they accumulate little experience of sharing household chores with partners with potential effects on their wives’ labor supply, career and fertility, especially in countries where child care services are less widespread and/ore more expensive. Recent time use data show that Southern European husbands contribute less to housework and the excessive burden on women and that can be considered strongly correlated with low fertility (Rosina 2004). The results of our empirical analysis show that men are more irresponsive than women to changes in labor and mortgage markets. The design of labor market policies that are intended to promote mobility (going where the jobs are, for example) may well wish to take into account these types of differences. In Sect. 2 we review the recent literature and discuss the objectives and implications of our research. In Sect. 3 we describe the data set and the characteristics of the sample. In Sects. 4 and 5, we present our econometric strategy and discuss the empirical estimates. Section 6 provides conclusive remarks.",50

8.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,13 January 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-009-9086-1,"Marriage: for love, for money…and for time?",December 2010,Victoria Vernon,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Marriage conveys many tangible economic benefits. Spouses can take advantage of household economies of scale, reducing their per capita housing and energy costs by sharing common spaces and furnishing, lowering their transportation costs by sharing automobiles, and economizing on food costs by buying in bulk and by cooking more meals at home. Marriage is distinguished from other joint living arrangements by community property rights that extend equal ownership of all acquired assets to both spouses. Married couples end up pooling their incomes and savings, becoming more diversified against future shocks and earning higher expected returns due to their increased tolerance for risks. Along with these financial benefits, married couples also enjoy economies in time when compared to their single counterparts. It takes roughly the same amount of time to cook a meal for two people as it does for one person, freeing the time of the spouse not doing the cooking. Housecleaning and childcare have comparably high economies of scale as well. When children are present, married couples often choose a highly specialized division of labor where one spouse allocates her time to childcare and home production while the other spouse allocates his time to the market. In fact, the institution of marriage evolved to shelter this particular outcome. My interests are the economies in time arising in marriage and the distribution of these gains by gender and income. How much time, if any, do married couples save in household activities, and which of these activities (food preparation, housework, childcare or other chores) afford such economies? Are the resulting gains of leisure distributed equally among men and women? How do these economies in time differ for lower- and higher-income families? Some insights are available from the emerging time use literature, but no previous study focused on these questions in particular. It is important to understand the relationship between family composition and the allocations of non-market time. If married couples spend less total time in work and gain more leisure, then the welfare of married households may be underestimated by the conventional expenditure-based equivalence scales as are often used for measuring the incidence of poverty. On the contrary, if married couples work more in total and enjoy less leisure than do singles, then their welfare may be lower than the traditional equivalence scales suggest. An analysis of household production may also help us better understand the time gains from marriage and losses from divorce. If marriage causes time saving in tedious tasks and permits more leisure, then we see gains from marriage of “quality time.” And, if these benefits are not shared equitably between spouses, this may help explain a rising share of single-adult households.Footnote 1
 Using data on single and married adults from the American Time Use Survey 2003–08, I estimate married women in higher-income households work 33–34 min less in total at home and for pay each weekday than do single females of comparable income. Among lower-income households, the total work of married women with children is 15–34 min more each day than for single women, and women without children work 37–48 min more than do singles. Among each group (level of income, presence of children), married women work fewer hours in the market than single women, ranging from 18 min fewer per weekday for lower-income women without children to 3 h fewer for higher-income women with children. For men, the results are diametrically opposed. In lower-income households, married men work significantly more in the market than do single men, 83 min more per weekday without children and 110 min more with children. In higher-income households, the marriage effect for men is less dramatic, 13 min more market work per weekday without children and 35 min more with children. Interestingly, married couples do not spend less combined time in household production when compared to single adults, rather a combined 44–78 min more each weekday. As for the unpaid work, married women prepare the meals, and higher-income couples spend 12–21 min more, combined, in food preparation than do single adults of comparable income level. Married couples also spend significantly more time in housework than do single adults, from 16 weekday minutes for higher-income couples without children to 39 min for lower-income with children. The paper offers several explanations for why economies in household production are found to be either small or non-existent for married couples. Simple calculations using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey illustrate that by spending extra time in household chores couples generate valuable quality services, and hence achieve a higher standard of living. Finally, in terms of leisure, lower-income married women tend to use their gain of leisure time for personal care while higher-income married women tend to use theirs for active leisure. Time gains from marriage, accompanied by meaningful improvements in legal protections for married women, make the declining incidence of marriage paradoxical from an economic viewpoint. This paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, I review the recent literature on time use in marriage. In Sect. 3, I describe the dataset and the sample, and in Sect. 4 the regressions estimates from the data. In Sect. 5, I discuss the results in the context of gender equity, traditional roles and the declining incidence of marriage.",19
8.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,27 March 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-010-9092-3,"Consumption, time and the environment",December 2010,Mario Cogoy,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In modern industrial societies people allocate a significant fraction of their disposable time to consumption activities. Time is an input as necessary as are commodities, since no pleasure, or ‘utility’, can be derived from consumption without making use of a portion of the permanent flow of time, and the pattern of combination of time and commodities significantly determines the outcome (Becker 1965, 1976; Michael and Becker 1973; Gronau 1977, 1986; Juster and Stafford 1991). On the other hand, the present pattern of affluent consumption significantly contributes to global environmental degradation and, for this reason, an understanding of time use may also shed some light on the behavioural structure determining the environmental impact of consumption. The necessity of preventing environmentally disrupting effects of affluent consumption in modern industrial societies has been recently addressed in a vast body of literature on ‘sustainable consumption’ (among others: Cosmas 1982; Heiskanen and Pantzar 1997; Princen 1999; Spangenberg and Lorek 2002; Jalas 2002; Kletzan et al. 2002; Sanne 2005; Fuchs and Lorek 2005). One of the main results of such studies is, that the environmental impacts of consumption are basically determined by structural factors, conceptualised as ‘lifestyles’ by some authors (Cosmas 1982; Schipper et al. 1989), or ‘consumption patterns’ by others (Fuchs and Lorek 2005). For this reason, a simple shift to ‘greener’ commodities will only marginally (if at all) reduce environmental impacts, if structural determinants of behaviour remain unaffected. There can be little doubt, that the pattern of combination of time and commodities basically affects lifestyles and consumptive behaviour (Schipper et al. 1989; Jalas 2002; Sanne 2005; Cogoy 2007). Time is physically limited, compared to the abundance of commodities, made available by the progress in technology and productivity. The result is a bias towards hectic lifestyles (Linder 1970), time-scarcity, and a rising commodity-intensity of consumption. The recent awareness of environmental constraints on consumption suggests that a change in lifestyles will necessarily imply a shift in the pattern of combination of time and commodities. Although such a shift certainly requires a change in cultural and psychological attitudes (Douglas and Isherwood 1978; Shove 2004), there are also good economic arguments for advocating a reshuffle in time-commodities combinations under environmental pressure. This paper presents an economic model of time use in consumption under environmental constraints. It attempts to integrate two dimensions of consumptive behaviour into a unified framework: (a) the choice of lifestyles, and therefore of patterns of time-commodities combinations, and (b) the environmental impacts of consumption. The intention is to develop some analytical tools, which can help to describe the economic mechanisms linking environmental constraints to the choice of lifestyle patterns. The relationship between time, consumption and the environment also depends on the level of technology and may change therefore as human capital accumulates. These changes obviously influence the quality of the environment, and its use as a receptacle of consumptive outputs. The functional relationship between technology, time, commodities and the environment is discussed in the next section. Section 3 studies the effects of environmental constraints on consumption in a static setting, where human capital is exogenously given. It is shown, that a bias towards time scarcity and higher commodity-intensity arises from exogenous increases in productivity, as long as environmental conditions do not strictly constrain economic activities. With further exogenous increases in technology and productivity, however, environmental constraints reduce time scarcity and the commodity intensity of consumption. It is also shown, that “tight” environmental constraints may set a limit to desirable levels of human capital accumulation. Section 4 extends the analysis to a dynamic economy and introduces the effects of discounting into the picture. Discounting plays a complex role, since time-allocation is a two-dimensional problem in this model. On the one hand, consumers face the familiar decision on how to allocate time between work and consumption. On the other hand however, consumers must also decide how much time to spend in research and human capital accumulation, since research is a time-consuming activity. This means, that not only future environmental damages are discounted in time-allocation decisions, but also future benefits from higher levels of human capital and technology. This gives rise to a complex pattern of discounting effects, which is described in Sect. 4. Finally, Sect. 5 summarizes the economic determinants of changes in consumption styles, which can be derived from the more detailed discussion in Sects. 3 and 4. The purpose of the paper is to describe the optimal state of society in a static and in a dynamic equilibrium. In a decentralized market economy however, the social optimum may, or may not be attained, depending on the structure of markets, and on the presence of externalities and of market imperfections. I prefer to focus on the social optimum in this paper, because this allows to better understand the issues at stake. The study of market failures in this field, and the design of economic instruments, suitable for correcting them, could be addressed in the course of further research.",4

Parental time is one of the resources that deserved particular attention in the literature, which has documented a positive association between parental time and children outcomes later in life (see for example early work by Leibowitz (1974)). Research on this issue has most frequently relied on available data on children’s outcomes (such as biometrical and health parameters, school attainment or income later in life) and parents choices, being constrained by lack of information on the children’s choices and their own inputs into investment in human capital. As such, it has been criticized for being too focused on the impact of family decisions and circumstances, while not taking into due consideration the impact of “the choices that children make given the investments in and opportunities available to them” (Haveman and Wolfe 1995, 1836). Even though a wide strand of literature has dealt with inter-generational transmission of preferences or endowments, little attention has been devoted directly to the role of time use (see the overview in Juster and Stafford 1991). Parents may have a direct influence on the children’s behavior by, first of all, influencing preference formation by the child (see Fernandez et al. (2004)). General models of parental investment in children stress its impact on the offspring’s human capital, material assets and social capital and Becker and Tomes (1986), Leibowitz (1974), Cunha and Heckman (2007) and Apps and Rees (2002) specifically underline the role of time invested by parents in shaping the children’s endowments. Lundberg et al. (2009) shifted the focus of the literature from parents’ decision to the child’s decision; while Calvó-Armengol and Jackson (2009) argued that the correlation between parents and children behavior may result from network externalities. Disentangling which of these channels leads parents’ decision on time allocation to have an impact on adolescents’ time allocation, using the available data, is not a feasible endeavor. Unobservable factors (such as genetics and the social environment) are potentially associated with both the parental decision and children’s decisions, precluding causal statements on the impact of parental time. This work aims at documenting that there exists a link between parental time allocation and youngsters’ time allocation, which moreover varies across countries, with implications for human capital acquisition by the children. We add to the previous literature by exploring a different link between parental time use and children outcomes, as it concentrates on the decisions by youngsters themselves. We analyze the impact of time use by parents on time use by their adolescent children, considering three types of activities selected for their impact on human capital accumulation and the potential influence received from parents’ behavior: studying and reading; socializing; and watching television. Study time is by consensus considered an investment in human capital. A traditional view of the allocation of time by students would consider that time outside “compulsory activities” such as school attendance and personal tasks (care, sleeping, etc.) could simply be split into time spent usefully—i.e., doing homework and studying—and the remaining time, all assigned to leisure or not directly useful activities. However, human capital includes components other than formal knowledge, namely personal interaction skills and other non-cognitive skills (see extensive recent work by Heckman and co-authors, in particular Heckman et al. (2006)). We therefore go beyond the decision on the allocation of time to study, considering as well time devoted to socialization/networking at young age. TV watching is most often portrayed as having a negative impact on children outcomes (Frey et al. 2007; Vandewater et al. 2006) and for this reason we also analyze it. We adopt a cross-country perspective that takes advantage of the harmonization of time use data provided by the Multinational Time Use Study (MTUS) project. Relying on this multi-member household time use micro data, we run fractional regression and double hurdle models, where the parameters of interest concern the effects of time allocation by parents on time allocation by youngsters, controlling for a number of observable individual and family characteristics. We are aware that a wide array of unobservable genetic and environmental factors are potentially associated with both the parents’ and the children’s time allocation, rendering difficult causal statements on the impact of parents’ time use on children’s time use. This issue will deserve discussion throughout the article. Section 2 presents the data source and Section 3 provides descriptive statistics. Section 4 presents the empirical model and Section 5 discusses its results, before concluding comments are presented in Section 6.",42

Approximately 16% of the US workforce was foreign born in 2007, a proportion that more than doubled since its 7% share in 1980 Lofstrom (2009). Over the same time period, self-employment grew strongly and immigrants continued to increase their share of business owners.Footnote 1 Figure 1 reveals an increase of close to 7.5 million business owners from 1980 to 2007 and that immigrants’ share of self-employment increased from about 6.6% to approximately 17.4%.Footnote 2
 Self-employment levels by nativity and
foreign born self-employment share , 1980-2007. Source: 1980, 1990 and 2000 US Census; 2005–2007 American Community Survey Although many immigrants are highly educated and skilled, immigrants also represent a rising large share of the country’s low-skilled workers, defined here to be those with no more than a high school diploma. Table 1 shows that while the immigrant proportion of the college educated workforce increased from 7.1% in 1980 to 15.2% in 2007, the immigrant share of skilled workers remains roughly equal to the overall proportion of immigrants in the US workforce. However, over this period the share of immigrants in the low-skilled segment of the labor force more than tripled, from 6.7 to 20.4%, making low-skilled immigrants considerably over-represented among the least educated workers. Relatively little is known about the labor market performance of this large and growing group of immigrants. Low-skilled workers in general do not fare well in today’s skill intensive economy and their opportunities continue to diminish. Given that individuals in this skill segment of the workforce are more likely to have poor experiences in the labor market, and hence incur greater public expenses, it is particularly important to seek and evaluate their labor market options. From the perspective of immigrant workforce integration, economic contribution and policy, it is also of importance to know specifically how low-skilled immigrants perform in the labor market. In this paper we focus on the labor market performance of low-skilled self-employed immigrants. Self-employment has been argued to be an important stepping stone for economic assimilation among immigrants (e.g. Cummings 1980) and self-employed immigrants have been found to do better than their wage/salary counterpart (Lofstrom 2002). It is however unknown whether the relative success among immigrant entrepreneurs hold among the ones with relatively low schooling levels. The research question we seek to answer is whether self-employment is an economically rewarding option for low-skilled immigrants. We address this issue by comparing low-skilled immigrant entrepreneurs to low-skilled immigrants working in the wage/salary sector as well as low-skilled native born business owners. A large number of business owners in the US are low-skilled. In 2007, 6.9 million business owners did not have any education beyond high school, representing about 40% of the total number of self-employed (Lofstrom 2009). Importantly, foreign born entrepreneurs play an increasingly important role. This is evident in recent data which show that the entire net increase from 1980 to 2007 of about 1.1 million low-skilled self-employed workers is due to immigrant entrepreneurs (Lofstrom 2009). In fact, there are fewer native born low-skilled business owners today compared to 1980. This is not due to a decrease in the low-skilled native self-employment rate. In fact, the self-employment rate for both native born low-skilled men and women increased from 1980 to 2007, from 10.1 to 11% and 3.9–6.1%, respectively for men and women (Lofstrom 2009). The self-employment rate among the low-skilled foreign born population increased over the same period from 9.8 to 10.5% among men and remarkably from 4.2 to 10.6% for women. It is clear from this that self-employment now plays a particularly important role among low-skilled immigrants, especially foreign born women who are now slightly more likely to be self-employed than foreign born men. The economic returns to self-employment have previously been rather extensively examined. Studies from the 1980s find that potential wages and wage growth of entrepreneurs are higher or not significantly different from the wages and growth of paid employees (for example, Brock and Evans 1986; Rees and Shah 1986 and Evans and Leighton 1989). However, Hamilton (2000) finds that most entrepreneurs have both lower initial earnings and lower earnings growth than they would receive in paid employment. He finds that earlier results indicating relatively high returns to self-employment may be influenced by a handful of high-income entrepreneurial “superstars”. The observed higher average earnings may thus not characterize the self-employment returns of most business owners. Surprisingly, existing research on low-skilled self-employment, and the performance of low-skilled entrepreneurs, is scant. Exceptions include two papers by Robert Fairlie (2004, 2005). Fairlie (2004) studies young less-educated business owners and finds that after a few initial years of slower growth, the average earnings for the self-employed grow faster over time than the average earnings for wage/salary workers. Fairlie (2005) defines disadvantaged differently and focuses on family background (parents’ education). He finds some evidence that disadvantaged self-employed business owners earn more than wage/salary workers from disadvantaged families. Also relevant is Holtz-Eakin et al. (2000) who find that low-income self-employed individuals moved ahead in the earnings distribution relative to those who remained in wage/salary work. This paper contributes to the limited existing research on low-skilled immigrants and low-skilled entrepreneurship in several ways. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to analyze the labor market performance of low-skilled immigrant entrepreneurs in the US. We also build on Fairlie’s research by separately comparing and analyzing the earnings of low-skilled immigrants and natives. Furthermore, we include individuals of all working ages (defined here to be ages 18–64).",21

Sinning,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Due to the increasing relevance of international migration, the economic performance of migrants has become an important factor for both immigration and sending countries. In the receiving countries, the economic situation of the foreign-born population and the economic and societal integration of immigrant minorities into the host-countries’ society have become a matter of intense debate among economists and policy makers (Fertig and Schmidt 2002; Zimmermann 2005). At the same time, the economic situation of migrants affects their remittances, which have grown to the largest source of external funding in many emigration countries (World Bank 2006a). The economic literature on the performance of immigrants concentrates predominantly on the analysis of earnings and employment status (Chiswick 1978; Borjas 1994; Bauer et al. 2005). Only a few studies have examined wealth accumulation patterns of immigrants in their home countries (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2006), although migrants’ savings in their country of origin may represent a substantial or even the major part of their overall financial transfers (Brown 1994). An investigation of such a long-run indicator of economic well-being may be relevant, because the capacity of immigrants to accumulate wealth in their home countries does not only reflect their economic performance in the host country, but also allows drawing inferences about their future economic situation. According to the World Bank (2006a), remittances exceeded $US 233 billion worldwide in 2005. Moreover, recorded remittance flows to developing countries have doubled between 2000 and 2005, indicating a substantial increase in payments of migrants to their families in the source country. The traditional development literature has largely focused on the size and potential impact of migrants’ remittances (Adams 1992; Durand et al. 1996). In addition, a sizeable theoretical and empirical literature has revealed that a variety of motives may induce migrants to send remittances to their countries of origin (Lucas and Stark 1985; Bernheim et al. 1985; Cox 1987; Cox and Rank 1992; Cox et al. 1987; Ilahi and Jafarey 1999; Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2006). Germany, a major immigration country in the European Union, represents an excellent example for the analysis of the importance of migrants’ savings in the home country and their remittances. During the 1960s and early 1970s immigration to Germany was characterized by labor migration, mainly from South European countries (such as Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey and Yugoslavia). West Germany pursued a policy of active “guest worker” recruitment to fill an acute shortage of low-skilled labor. Although the guest workers were expected to return to their countries of origin after their contracts expired, many of them decided to stay in Germany permanently (Bauer et al. 2005). These immigrants were typically very different in education, cultural background and motivation to their high-skilled European counterparts that migrated to the United States after the Second World War. Since about 1.5 million immigrants in Germany will reach retirement age within the next 15 years, their savings (both in Germany and the country of origin) and their return intentions may have a strong impact on the German pension system. Even though the majority of the foreign-born population does not originate from developing countries, immigrants residing in Germany remit a substantial part of their income. In 2004, remittance flows from Germany amounted to $US 10.4 billion (World Bank 2006b). A sizeable part of these transfers consists of savings-related remittances of temporary migrants (Merkle and Zimmermann 1992). Despite its importance, only a few studies consider savings as a relevant part of migrants’ transfers to their home country. This paper aims at providing empirical evidence on the relative importance of the determinants of migrants’ transfers to their countries of origin, paying particular attention to return intentions. In the empirical analysis, which is based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), the determinants of savings in the country of origin and payments to family members and other persons to the source country are being examined. The paper contributes to the existing literature in several respects. First, while most of the studies on remittances concentrate on migrants’ payments to developing countries, the analysis focuses on remittances of migrants from traditional labor-exporting countries, such as Turkey, Italy and Greece as well as refugees originating from former Yugoslavian countries. Second, in addition to migrants’ payments to family members in their countries of origin—which are typically addressed by the literature on remittances—the analysis of German data allows an explicit consideration of migrants’ savings in their home countries as a relevant part of their overall transfers. Bauer and Sinning (2009) demonstrate that immigrants—especially those who intend to stay in Germany permanently—save considerably less than comparable natives. This in turn may result in an increased utilization of the German social security system by immigrants. Against this background, this paper investigates the savings behavior of immigrants in their countries of origin. Third, a double-hurdle model is applied to assess the effects of relevant determinants on the individual decision to send transfers to the country of origin and the amount of transfers. Finally, utilizing information on migrants’ return intentions, the gap in financial transfers between temporary and permanent migrants is decomposed into a part that may be explained by differences in observed characteristics and a part attributable to different coefficients.
Footnote 1
 The empirical findings reveal that return intentions positively affect financial transfers of immigrants to their home country. Moreover, while the effect of the household size on migrants’ transfers to the country of origin turns out to be significantly negative, remittances are higher if close relatives live in the sending country. The estimates further suggest that both savings and remittances vary substantially across countries of origin. The estimates of a decomposition analysis reveal that only a small part of the gap in financial transfers between temporary and permanent migrants can be attributed to differences in observable characteristics, indicating substantial behavioral differences between the two groups. Finally, the relatively low savings rate of permanent migrants in their countries of origin suggests that the German welfare system may face additional unforeseen burdens in the coming years.",52

But what is even more noteworthy is that while Mexico ranks first in Latin America with respect to per capita GDP, it lags behind the Latin American average in terms of health care expenditures. On average, health care expenditures account for 6.8% of GDP in Latin America (WDI 2005), a slightly more generous amount in comparison to Mexico’s 6.1%. While Mexican families with members employed in the formal sector generally receive health care services through Mexico’s social security system, the unemployed, informal and self-employed workers and their families (referred to as the uninsured) are relegated to obtaining basic and often incomplete health care through the Ministry of Health. To partially address deficiencies in proper access to health care services, the Mexican government implemented PROGRESA (now called Oportunidades) in 1997 in selected areas of the country. PROGRESA offered cash transfers to poor families in Mexico conditional on their participation in health and nutrition programs. Specifically, families enrolled in PROGRESA were required to participate in prenatal care programs, well-baby care and immunization, nutrition monitoring and supplementation, and preventive health care programs.Footnote 3 While the size of the covered population, as well as the list of illnesses and medicines covered by government programs have been rapidly expanding,Footnote 4 this form of insurance still fails to provide the same coverage provided to formal sector workers and their families. Consequently, it is reasonable to ask the degree to which remittances impact health care expenditures. In analyzing the role that remittances may play in the provision of health care, it is important to consider the relationship between migration and health. A small literature addresses health outcomes among households in which some members have migrated. A number of the studies conclude that migration of a household member results in poor health outcomes for the non-migrating family members. Using the MMP, Kanaiaupuni and Donato (1999) attribute increases in infant mortality to family separations. The transmission of habits and lifestyles (social remittances) that may be incompatible with healthy outcomes may further disadvantage health in families with migrating members (Levitt 1997). Finally, migration may contribute to poor health outcomes in communities that experience much out-migration on account of the importation of communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis or HIV (Perez-Stable et al. 1986). While these studies speak to the unfavorable impacts of migration on health outcomes, many studies also note that migration has the potential to improve health outcomes for the families that remain behind. For instance, Levitt (1997) argues that improved health behaviors can also be remitted “socially” leading to improved health outcomes. Likewise, Frank and Hummer (2002) measure higher birth weights in families with a migrant member—possibly due to the acquisition of positive health behaviors from migrants. In addition to migration, monetary transfers or remittances can affect health by relaxing liquidity constraints that would otherwise restrict access to health care. Kanaiaupuni and Donato (1999) argue that, despite the initial disruptive effects of family separations, over time, as migration becomes “institutionalized” and the household receives monetary remittances, infant mortality significantly drops. In the same vein, López Córdova (2004) takes advantage of variability in remittance receipt rates across Mexican municipalities and concludes that remittances lower infant mortality rates. Hildebrandt and McKenzie (2004) link increased birth weight and lowered infant mortality rates to both monetary remittances and health knowledge, whereas Duryea et al. (2005) conclude that the acquisition of better housing infrastructure (e.g. improved housing, water and refrigeration of food) via remittances is crucial in reducing infant mortality. Also looking at the impact of remittances in Mexico, Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2007) and, more recently, Valero-Gil (2008), find that remittances raise health expenditures in Mexico. Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2007) take a first look at the ENIGH data to examine how remittances affect household expenditures on specific health care services, from routine primary care to hospitalizations. Using instrumental linear regression methods, they find that hospitalization expenditures display the largest responsiveness to remittance income. However, primary care expenditures are also higher among remittance-receiving households who, on average, spend between 5 and 9% of their remittances on primary care services. Yet, their analysis falls short of gaining a better understanding of whether Mexican households are likely to use remittances, as opposed to other sources of income, to purchase health care services, as well as to how these propensities to consume remittances to purchase health care services differ according to household income strata and health care coverage. Valero-Gil (2008), also using the ENIGH, estimates that one-tenth of remittances are spent on health expenditures in Mexico. Yet, his analysis does not address the endogeneity of remittances with respect to household expenditures. Summarizing, the relatively small literature on this topic appears to have focused on the link between migration and health outcomes, with only a handful of studies zeroing in on the actual link between the receipt of remittances and health outcomes. While the improvement of health outcomes is society’s ultimate goal, understanding the impact of remittance income on health care expenditures is also of great importance as it relates to a topic of considerable policy interest, i.e. how remittances are being used in developing countries. To this end, we follow up on the existing literature and further examine how remittances impact health care expenditures.",87
9.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,22 December 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-009-9084-3,Attitudes towards foreigners and Jews in Germany: identifying the determinants of xenophobia in a large opinion survey,March 2011,Michael Fertig,Christoph M. Schmidt,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"To any student of German history it does not come as a surprise that the possible existence of xenophobic or antisemitic tendencies in the German society is a continuing topic of the public debate and a frequent subject of empirical analysis. Indeed, numerous articles in well-respected periodicals are regularly concerned with this issue. Typically, the statistical investigation documents considerable heterogeneity in attitudinal responses throughout the population. Most of these articles then relate these tendencies monocausally to a specific observable factor, like education or age, and provide detailed structural explanations for this suspected relationship despite the obvious conceptual limitations of such an approach. A case in point is the debate regularly set off by an opinion survey conducted among young people in Germany on behalf of the company Shell [the so-called Shell-Jugendstudie, cf. Fischer et al. (2000)]. In this study, the opinions expressed by young respondents are presented on a semi-aggregated level, differentiated one by one by sex, age groups, personal future expectations and other characteristics. Unfortunately, this presentation does not provide an attempt at explaining the observed patterns more deeply, although structural explanations are suggested: most importantly, the authors not only claim that serious xenophobic attitudes among young people in Germany persist, but even more speculatively that these attitudes are mainly the result of the dull economic prospects of the respondents. They propose, therefore, that an adequate counter-strategy must be a program aiming at the enhancement of the education and formal training possibilities of German youth. Drawing such strong conclusions on the basis of such cursory evidence, however, must be problematic. The conceptual problems facing the empirical analysis of xenophobic tendencies are indeed substantial. The first problem arises from the definitional question of what has to be understood as a xenophobic or antisemitic attitude, and to what degree such attitudes are measurable. Since both concepts reflect fundamental issues of individual opinion neither is directly measurable. On a superficial level, one may define xenophobia and antisemitism as especially negative individual attitudes towards foreigners and Jews, respectively. Yet, it is not a question of relatively (compared to the population average) xenophobia which is typically at issue, but rather a statement about an absolute level of racism or xenophobia which is sought. Since racist ideas are typically emotional, subjective, and frequently distorted interpretation of observable facts, a possible conceptualization of xenophobia and antisemitism could depart from a notion of mistaken perceptions. Such attitudes have certainly almost always nothing to do with the “true” characteristics of the relevant groups. They are rather the result of subjective perceptions of an individual which is projecting real or imaginary characteristics of some individuals onto a complete group of individuals. Therefore, a broad definition of xenophobia and antisemitism would qualify every individual which is willing to generalize negative individual-specific characteristics to a group of individuals to which he/she does not belong himself/herself as xenophobic or antisemitic. In addition to providing such a general definition, we can characterize these concepts further. Specifically, both concepts are by their very nature relative, i.e. there is no scale to measure them absolutely (all attempts to do so in the literature are completely arbitrary). For instance, an individual may have a significantly more negative attitude towards a minority group than the average individual in a given society and may therefore be termed (relatively) xenophobic or antisemitic. However, the same individual living in an, on average, foreigner-friendly society will be easier regarded as xenophobic than the same individual being citizen of an, on average, less foreigner-friendly society. Finally, a priori it is not clear if xenophobia and antisemitism are different concepts or if they are intimately related. Adorno et al. (1950), for instance, argue that antisemitism is not an isolated phenomenon but rather part of a much broader ideological system. Nevertheless, this paper examines opinions towards foreigners and Jews separately in order to investigate if the determining factors of attitudes towards both minority groups are driven by different explanatory factors. This analysis will provide us with some indications that the determining factors of both are at least in part different. For the purposes of scientific analysis of underlying preferences and perceptions, any opinion survey without detailed background information on the respondents themselves would be quite useless. Fortunately, in Germany there exists a dataset regularly collected by the GESIS (Gesellschaft sozialwissenschaftlicher Struktureinrichtungen), the so-called ALLBUS (Allgemeine Bevölkerungsumfrage der Sozialwissenschaften), which is comparable to the General Social Survey in the United States. This opinion and attitude survey is publicly available and conducted biennially with varying focuses on different topics (for more details see Sect. 4). The 1996 wave contains a large set of questions
Footnote 1 on the perception of immigrants, foreigners and other minorities as well as standard socio-economic characteristics. Several empirical studies investigate this 1996 wave information, albeit not in the direction taken by this contribution (for more details see Sect. 2). In our own empirical application we utilize this dataset as well. Specifically, we aim at the identification and explanation of unobservable underlying factors driving those opinions towards minorities which are expressed by native respondents in the survey. Conceptually, this paper contributes to the received literature by using a structural model to explain the answers on a set of questions regarding the perception of minorities by native Germans.
Footnote 2 In this model it is assumed that in addition to observable individual characteristics, there exists an underlying unobserved attitude towards minorities which drives the distribution of answers by native respondents. This latent variable in turn is assumed to be shaped by a set of observable socio-economic characteristics of the individuals. It is the direction and magnitude of these effects on the unobservable factor which are the primary objects of our interest. In order to estimate this model it is necessary to impose appropriate identification restrictions. The restrictions employed in our empirical application are discussed in detail below. The validity of these assumptions is decisive for the interpretation of the results. However, since these restrictions are non-testable they have to be assumed to hold a priori. Naturally, without such identification assumptions a well-structured analysis of the wealth of information provided by opinion surveys like the ALLBUS is impossible. The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief survey of the received literature on the perception of foreigners. In Sect. 3 the utilized structural model, its reduced-form counterpart as well as the employed identification strategy are explained. Section 4 contains our empirical application for Germany and, finally, Sect. 5 offers some conclusions.",19

Miaari,Robert M. Sauer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The economic costs of political conflict have long been a subject of great interest to economists. The large literature in this area offers ample empirical evidence that political instability has important economic consequences. However, most of the leading studies tend to focus on the implications of political instability for macroeconomic variables such as savings, investment and growth [see, e.g., Venieris and Gupta (1986), Barro (1991), Mauro (1995), Alesina and Perotti (1996), Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), and Eckstein and Tsiddon (2004)]. Relatively few papers measure the effects of conflict on individual or household outcomes in particular markets, such as the labor market.Footnote 1
 In this paper, we contribute to the literature on the economic costs of political instability by providing a lower bound estimate of the labor market costs of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.Footnote 2 We quantify the conflict by the number of overseas foreign workers in the Israeli labor market and the frequency of closures of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The presence of overseas foreign workers is directly related to the conflict because their importation was allowed by the Israeli government in order to ease Israeli employers’ reliance on Palestinian labor flows that were becoming increasingly unstable. The Israeli government dramatically accelerated its issuance of overseas foreign worker permits starting in the mid 1990s. The focus is on the implications of the conflict for Palestinian employment rates in Israel and Palestinian monthly earnings. This is accomplished by using unique micro level data from the Palestinian Labor Force Survey (PLFS) of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS). Data from the PLFS are combined with quarterly time series data on the number of overseas foreign workers in Israel, and the frequency of temporary closures of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, between the years 1999 and 2004. Because the number of foreign workers in Israel in each quarter is likely to be endogenous, due to nonrandom immigration, we also compile quarterly data on the number of foreign worker permits issued by the Israeli government and use it as an instrument for the number of foreign workers in the Israeli labor market in each quarter [see also Friedberg and Sauer (2003)]. We do not instrument for temporary closures since they are mostly a consequence of surges in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict that have little to do with the unobserved determinants of Palestinian labor demand [see Angrist (1996)]. The results of the study suggest that there are statistically significant negative effects of the conflict on Palestinian employment rates in Israel as well as Palestinian mean monthly earnings. In our preferred specification, the estimates imply that a 10% increase in the supply of foreign workers, or a one standard deviation increase in supply, reduces the employment rate of Palestinians from the West Bank in Israel by 6.8% points. The same increase in the supply of foreign workers reduces the employment rate of Palestinians from Gaza in Israel by 5.0% points. Thus, the overall reduction in the Palestinian employment rate is close to 12% points. The estimates also indicate that an increase of one standard deviation in the supply of foreign workers reduces the mean monthly earnings of Palestinians that reside in the West Bank by 12.2% and reduces the mean monthly earnings of Palestinians that reside in Gaza by 15.8%. The results also reveal that a one standard deviation increase in the proportion of work days lost during a quarter due to temporary closures of the West Bank and Gaza Strip (roughly a doubling in the mean proportion of work days lost over the sample period), reduces the employment rate of Palestinians from the West Bank in Israel by 5.2% points. The corresponding estimate for Palestinians from Gaza is 4.1% points. A one standard deviation increase in temporary closures thus reduces the Palestinian employment rate in Israel by 9.3% points. The same increase in the proportion of work days lost due to closures reduces the mean monthly earnings of Palestinians from the West Bank by 5.9%, and the mean monthly earnings of Palestinians from Gaza by 5.3%. It is interesting to note that our estimates not only provide a lower bound on the labor market costs of a particular political conflict, but can also be put into the more general context of the economic consequences of immigration. In the immigration literature, it is rare that one finds significant negative effects of new immigrants on the employment and earnings outcomes of incumbent workers (see, e.g., Borjas (1987), Card (1990), Altonji and Card (1991), Pischke and Velling (1997), Friedberg (2001) and Card (2001)).Footnote 3 The lack of significant effects is usually attributed to problems associated with appropriately defining competing groups of workers, workers responding to immigration by moving their labor and capital to other areas, and new immigrants locating in growing local economies [Borjas (2003)]. In this paper, we can reasonably overcome some of these problems. First, we are examining data that relate to two groups of workers that truly compete in the labor market. In several employment sectors in the Israeli labor market, Palestinian day laborers are the incumbent workers and overseas foreign workers are the new immigrants. Second, the PLFS panel data include information on the employment and earnings of Palestinians that work in the Israeli labor market as well as in the local Palestinian economy, to which they are most likely to move their labor services after displacement by overseas foreign workers. Therefore, our estimates suffer less from sample-selection biases that arise when data on the outcomes of displaced individuals are not available [see Card (2001)]. Lastly, we can partially correct for biases due to nonrandom immigration by using government issued foreign worker entry permits as an instrument for the number of foreign workers in the Israeli labor force. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the PLFS data and provides a descriptive analysis of the PLFS as well as the data on foreign workers, foreign worker permits and temporary closures. Section 3 outlines the empirical strategy that we employ. Section 4 discusses the estimation results. In Sect. 5, we illustrate the extent of sample selection bias that would have arisen had post-displacement data on Palestinians in the local economies of the West Bank and Gaza Strip not been available. The last section summarizes and concludes.",32

UK household evidence on multitasking,June 2011,Anzelika Zaiceva,Klaus F. Zimmermann,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Time scarcity is a familiar phenomenon in the modern world, and doing several activities at a time is one of the strategies to cope with it. Such multitasking emerges when cooking a meal and minding children, washing dishes and listening to the radio, or eating and reading a newspaper during a lunch break. Popular press and anecdotal evidence suggest it is a widespread experience. However, this phenomenon may differ, for instance, according to gender, age, education, job types, or between the native population and immigrants or ethnic minorities. In this paper we are particularly interested in ethnic differences in multitasking behavior in households. Multitasking in home production can be viewed as an optimal choice of rational individuals to allocate effectively scarce time resources (Kalenkoski and Foster 2010). As such, this choice may differ across different ethnic groups, reflecting, among other things, different opportunity costs of time or different cultural norms. Multitasking is also a potential response to time stress,Footnote 1 as it relaxes the time constraint (Ruuskanen 2004). Since ethnic minorities are likely to have different labor market work hours and earnings (a different shadow price of time), they are likely to experience different time pressure and thus multitasking behavior. Together with other assimilation time use activities (Hamermesh and Trejo 2010), multitasking can also constitute an additional assimilation channel for ethnic minorities. Hence, it is important to understand whether this is the case, what drives such behavior as well as its implications. This paper addresses these issues by analyzing multitasking activities of natives and ethnic minorities in the UK. Simultaneous, secondary or overlapping activities, i.e. those performed in combination with the primary or main activity, in households are important. For example, in Australia about one-third of waking hours is spent on simultaneous activities and at least one-third of every activity episode recorded involves at least one other simultaneous activity (Ironmonger 2003; Floro and Miles 2003). In some countries more than 90% of the households in the sample were found to engage in secondary activities (Ruuskanen 2004; Ironmonger 2003; Gronau and Hamermesh 2001). Incorporating such overlapping activities into the analysis provides a more accurate measure of individual economic contribution than one based solely on primary activities, both to household production in general and to childcare alone (see, among others, Floro and Miles 2003 and references therein; Apps and Rees 2005, Folbre and Yoon 2007; Kalenkoski, Ribar and Stratton 2005, 2007, 2009; Kalenkoski and Foster 2008, 2010; Ironmonger 1996). It has important implications for a better understanding of the intra-household bargaining models and the division of domestic chores, productivity, gender roles and cultural norms as well as the overall satisfaction and quality of life when one is able to or is constrained to “stretch” his or her time budget. On the other hand, it is also important to note that performing overlapping activities may result in increased stress, inefficiency, divided attention, diminished quality of work and decreased productivity as well as lower overall satisfaction. For example, Coviello et al. (2010) develop a theoretical model of task juggling at the workplace and find evidence that parallel work increases the time required to complete assignments, thus reducing productivity.Footnote 2 Kalenkoski and Foster (2008) label secondary and multitasked childcare activities as a low-quality care, and Bittman and Wajcman (2000) suggest that leisure is of a lower quality if it is “contaminated” by other simultaneous activities. Multitasking behavior has been widely analyzed in other disciplines. Psychologists and neurobiologists suggest that the brain works differently when multitasking (Rosen 2008; Just et al. 2001) and even more differently for males and females (Gorski 1987). Moreover, the ability to multitask is limited, since task performance may deteriorate if an individual undertakes several tasks simultaneously, however, this can be improved by training, i.e. by increasing the speed of information processing in the brain (Dux et al. 2009). Importantly, the ability to juggle depends on the type of task, and it is easier to combine those tasks which can become routine or are not contradictory, such as walking and talking to a friend (Manhart 2004). The more difficult are the activities, the more time individuals can lose in switching from one to another, and the brain decreases its neural activity when neurons juggle two thought problems at once compared to focusing on one task at a time (Just et al. 2001; Manhart 2004). It can also lead to decreased concentration and memory problems. Overall, it may take longer juggling jobs than performing them sequentially, and, according to these studies, multitasking can save time only if the activities combined refer to relaxed, routine tasks (Manhart 2004). Sociologists emphasize the significance of gender divide when incorporating simultaneous activities into leisure time or home production time, with women generally performing more activities simultaneously than men (see, for example, Bittman and Wajcman 2000; Sullivan 1997). Anthropologists, social psychologists and sociologists argue that time perception is different in different cultures. They postulate that time is a social construction which can be viewed as monochronic (doing one thing at a time) or polychronic (using time for many activities simultaneously), and its perception vary across cultures (see, for instance, Cotte and Ratneshwar 1999 and references therein). There are reasons to believe that immigrants and ethnic minorities will have different time allocation decisions to natives. It is well documented in the literature that immigrants and ethnic minorities are often disadvantaged in the host country’s labor market and society in general, in particular in Europe, although some groups may perform well. While white immigrants in the UK perform comparatively well or even better than the native-born whites, it is the ethnic minority immigrants who experience lower labor market outcomes than natives, with Pakistani and Bangladeshi (as well as Blacks) being the most disadvantaged groups (see, among others, Blackaby et al. 2002; Simpson et al. 2006). Moreover, the employment rate of married ethnic minority women in the UK, in general, is much lower than for white natives. In addition, Muslims in the UK (Pakistani and Bangladeshi are predominantly Muslims) were found to be “different” in terms of gender gap in education, age at marriage, fertility and female employment, although convergence over time in behavior was also found and those born in the UK often had different behavior to those born in their country of origin (Georgiadis and Manning 2009). Finally, a considerable heterogeneity across non-white ethnic groups in terms of cultural preferences was also reported (Battu and Zenou 2010), and Pakistani and Bangladeshi were found to be extremely religious compared to other ethnic minorities, suggesting a persistent religiosity impact for these communities (Georgiadis and Manning 2009). Economic integration goes hand-in-hand with social or cultural integration (Constant and Zimmermann 2009; Constant, Nottmeyer and Zimmermann 2009). Ethnic and cultural identity was found to influence labor market behavior in a number of recent studies (see, for example, Battu and Zenou 2010; Constant and Zimmermann 2008). The extent of self-identification with the country of ancestry, its culture and religion as well as preferences for ethnic “goods” depend on a number of factors, including family background and structure, social environment, language, immigration and naturalization experience, experiences of racial harassment, neighborhood effects and socio-economic factors (Battu and Zenou 2010; Bisin et al. 2008; Akerlof and Kranton 2000). Whatever the factors, however, ethnic and cultural identities were found to be extremely strong. For example, Battu and Zenou (2010) report that over 80% of each of the ethnic minority groups in the UK think of themselves in terms of their own ethnic group. Bisin et al. (2008) find that Muslims integrate less and more slowly than non-Muslims and report that a Muslim born in the UK and who has spent more than 30 years there is comparable to a non-Muslim who has just arrived in the country in terms of religious identity. In this context an individual’s use of time can be viewed as constituting another dimension of individual manifestation of his or her ethnic identity; and as such, it is expected that there will also be differences between whites and non-whites (and between different non-white minorities) in their choices of how non-market time is allocated. Thus, it is important to understand how immigrants and ethnic minorities decide on their time budgets, including their multitasking decisions. Since ethnic minorities are likely to have different socio-cultural norms and preferences, as well as different costs, including the opportunity costs of time, it is also likely that they will have different time allocation and multitasking behavior. This paper focuses on ethnicity in the analysis of multitasking in households by investigating whether and to what extent native and ethnic minority men and women in the UK spend their time on secondary activities. We document the incidence of such activities by ethnic status and gender employing the 2000 UK Time Use data. We then analyze the effect of ethnicity on time spent on secondary activities and discuss several potential channels. Our main findings are as follows. We find that non-white ethnic minorities in the UK engage less in multitasking than whites. The gap is present for both ethnic minority males and females, although females in general tend to engage more and to spend more time on simultaneous activities. There are, however, important differences among ethnic minority groups, with Pakistani and Bangladeshi males spending least time on secondary activities, ceteris paribus. The effect is heterogeneous across different sub-groups, and suggests several potential interpretations in terms of the opportunity costs of non-market time, different preferences and tastes of ethnic minorities, integration, family composition, household productivity and other. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly presents theoretical literature on the allocation of time and reviews relevant empirical studies. Data and descriptive evidence are provided in Sect. 3, and Sect. 4 follows with the presentation and discussion of estimation results. Section 5 concludes.",11

Lerman,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The trends toward later and shorter marriages have contributed greatly to the changing family patterns of the last half of the twentieth century (Wilson 2002). Not only are marriages lasting fewer years, the sources of marital dissolution have shifted dramatically from less widowhood to more divorce. Today, marital instability is common in most industrial countries. Current high levels of marital instability in the US have been taking place alongside high levels of job instability. Every month, millions of workers leave one employer and take a job with another employer. It takes young workers a long time to enter a stable career and a long-term relationship with an employer. Between the ages of 18 and 30, high school graduates with no college have already worked with an average of eight employers. Even during their late 20 s, nearly half of male high school graduates experienced at least one spell of unemployment between ages 25–29 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2000). Moreover, job instability is increasing among young men (Bernhardt et al. 1999). Researchers have long pointed to the potential connections between job market problems, marriage, and divorce. Wilson (1987) tried to link weakening job market options for young men, especially young black men, to declines in marriage rates. Other studies have examined the role of unemployment on divorce (Charles and Stephens 2004; Hansen 2005). In a study of why poor women have children before marriage, Edin and Kefalas (2005) reported that the women they interviewed often cited concerns about the job stability of partners as a reason for avoiding marriage. Recent increases in job instability (Neumark 2000; Bernhardt et al. 1999; Light and McGarry 1998; Farber 1995) might have led to negative consequences for workers and thus for their attractiveness as spouses. The direction of causation can run from reduced marital stability to reduced levels of job stability. Married men lead more settled lives as husbands, potentially increasing their tenure on the job (Waite and Gallagher 2000). Some argue that the norms of fidelity and loyalty associated with marriage engender trust and inspire a long-term view that leads men to invest in careers as well as other assets (Wilcox and Nock 2006). In their roles as providers, married men are probably more likely than unmarried men to encounter and internalize norms like working hard, obedience to superiors, and getting ahead that make them better workers (Gorman 1999). Indeed, research suggests that married men work longer hours, work harder on the job, have lower absenteeism from work, and are less likely to be fired than single men (Ahituv and Lerman 2007; Bielby and Bielby 1988; Nock 1998; Waite and Gallagher 2000). Finally, marriage might make men less likely to take jobs that require geographic moves and the possible displacement of a spouse. Existing studies have typically focused on impacts running in a single direction—from a job market outcome to a marital status or vice versa. They often follow individuals through a specific transition, such as into marriage or out of marriage. In general, researchers do not extend the analysis to cover linkages between the long-term pathways in the job market and in marriage. This study contributes to the existing literature by examining the connections between job transitions, marital transitions, and wage rates. We analyze the entire sequence of annual job and marriage outcomes among young men, asking: (1) Do job stability and high wage rates increase entry into marriage and reduce entry into divorce? (2) How do entry into marriage and marital stability influence job stability and wage rates? (3) How do shocks to marital outcomes and initial wage rates affect the pathways of young men? The study examines these diverse effects based on a model in which young men make sequential choices about work and family. We use a maximum likelihood (ML) approach that takes account of self-selection, simultaneity and heterogeneity in estimating the impacts of job change and wage rates on marital transitions and of marital transitions on jobs and wages. The approach uses a special econometric tool to incorporate the entire sequence of job and marriage transitions of young men. Using the model’s empirical estimates, we simulate the impacts of shocks on the interactions between marital transitions, job transitions, and wage rates over time; in doing so, we capture a long-term marriage wage premium. The next section reviews some relevant literature related to several lines of research relevant to this paper. Sect. 3 describes the data set, displays descriptive facts that motivate our study, and explains the rationale for the indicators we use to measure marital and job stability. Sect. 4 lays out and explains the optimization model ascribed to individuals and how it connects to our empirical strategy. The multivariate results, which include both OLS estimates and those that control for unobserved heterogeneity, appear in Sect. 5. The simulations results in Sect. 6 show examples of the implications of the statistical findings for the size of the feedback effects. Section 7 concludes by discussing implications of our method and findings.",17

Taylor,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Among mature men and women, which factors most affect the decision to ask for divorce? Such factors include falling in love with someone else, abuse, outside interference by stepchildren or in-laws, sexual issues, not being there physically or in terms of marital effort, a poor match, money problems, substance abuse, and abandonment. Since I consider only those who divorce in their 40s, 50s, or 60s, I focus on individuals supposedly more mature and deliberative than those in their 20s and 30s, and, if female, mostly past the childbearing age. I am most interested in the deliberation period that immediately precedes the decision to ask for divorce. The deliberation period begins when at least one spouse becomes dissatisfied with the marriage, and ends when one or both decide to divorce. However, asking for divorce occurs prior to the legal divorce, and thus the deliberation period is but a phase of the marriage duration. In other words, the marriage duration is longer than the deliberation period—a slice of time somewhere within the marriage duration. Understanding the divorce process allows for better insight into the gestation periods of the above marital problems. The deliberation period is of prime importance since its beginning marks the point in time when the marriage starts to unravel and the end marks the time when the marriage falls apart. These two points in time are much more important in the study of divorce than are the legal times of marriage and divorce. In this study of the deliberation period, I focus on the thoughts and feelings of the decision maker, that is, the one who initiates the divorce. Does the decision maker feel that his or her spouse is emotionally abusive? Does the decision maker feel that in-laws are overly demanding or controlling? Are the stepchildren especially rebellious and noncooperative? Is money always really tight? Are there fights over political issues, such as abortion rights or the war in Iraq? Does one spouse long for the city and the other a farm? These questions get to the heart of marital strife, much more than can be captured by merely categorizing a person by his or her educational attainment, geographical region, religious affiliation, ethnicity, and so forth. Relatedly, are the parents divorced? Is the decision maker previously divorced? Consider that the decision maker may feel more comfortable asking for divorce if he or she is already familiar with the divorce process. By comparison, understanding the gestation periods for various marital problems may help couples avoid getting divorced in the first place. In his path-breaking work, Becker (1981) predicts that individuals will take a forward-looking view of how their lives will be affected by the decision to divorce. However, to my knowledge, there are no empirical studies that directly address the thoughts, feelings, and special circumstances of the decision maker as they relate to the deliberation period. For instance, Kesselring and Bremmer (2006) present recent empirical evidence that higher female earnings lead to higher divorce rates, and relatedly, Hoffman and Duncan (1988) find that the fall in women’s average income relative to financial need is close to 30% in the first year after divorce. Although these types of studies lend credence to Becker’s well-known hypothesis, they yield no insight as to which factors either slow or hasten the divorce decision. To better understand the timing of divorce, I employ data from a recent study sponsored by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). I tie in both economic and biological reasons for the behavior of the divorcees. My study is most closely related to that of Kayser (1993) who investigates the process of marital disaffection. As stylized by Kayser (1993), the divorce process typically begins with feelings of estrangement and growing dissatisfaction with the relationship. The process is usually painful since most marriages begin with the joint expectation of great marital satisfaction. I expand on this theme by focusing on the gestation periods of various marital problems. By using correlation analysis, a multinomial logit model, and a hazard model, I find that outside interference from stepchildren or in-laws is the most important factor that hastens divorce. Not surprisingly, abandonment substantially hastens the divorce decision, and for males, any type of sexual problem more than doubles the chance of asking for divorce. Differing viewpoints, that is, a poor match, also hastens the divorce decision. By comparison, for those contemplating divorce for 5 years or longer, about half stayed married because of children; about a quarter had to prepare financially; and others stated that divorce was against their culture, were uncertain about the decision, hoped the cheating would stop, had cold feet, or had family and friends against the divorce. A possible reason for the importance of outside interference follows from the work of biologist Hamilton (1964) who emphasized an individual’s genes rather than his or her optimizing behavior. Hamilton’s rule states that the costs and benefits of altruistic acts are weighted by the closeness of the genetic relationship. The rule predicts that decision makers will be less tolerant of troublemakers genetically unrelated. For other types of marital problems, insight follows from Becker’s treatise on the family. In the spirit of Becker (1981), Stevenson and Wolfers (2007, p. 40) offer the straightforward, but powerful, insight that “couples marry and stay married when the gains from marriage exceed the gains from being single.” For example, if given as a major reason for divorce, differing viewpoints substantially lessens the gains from marriage. Likewise, delaying divorce due to children is clearly an optimizing behavior that reflects the gains from marriage. Finally, Levitz’s (2009) recent article in The Wall Street Journal presents anecdotal evidence that some couples are staying together to weather the current economic downturn. There are lessons from failed marriages. Consider that 26% of divorcees say that they would have gotten to know their spouse longer before marrying, 42% would have chosen a partner with whom they had more in common, 41% would have chosen a partner with closer shared values, and 20% would have chosen a partner who was more fun or adventurous. If remarried, 34% say they are more affectionate day-to-day, 17% strike a better balance between work and home life, 15% vow not to cheat on their spouse, 13% work harder to meet their spouse’s sexual needs, 12% manage their home better, and 11% handle finances better. The lessons do not necessarily assist in forming government policy, such as whether laws should be more or less lenient in allowing for divorce, but rather suggest ways to fix or avoid toxic marital problems, many of which are years in the making.",2
9.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,09 February 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-010-9089-y,Positive and negative preferences in human mate selection,June 2011,Nicolas Gérard Vaillant,François-Charles Wolff,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Extending Becker’s seminal analysis of marriage (1973; 1974), economists have recently devoted empirical efforts to document the analysis of human mate selection. In terms of the economic theory of consumer behavior described in Lancaster (1966), each potential partner is treated as a bundle of characteristics including age, level of education, physical appearance, intelligence, etc. (Hirschman 1987; Ford et al. 1989). However, economic contributions focusing on the partner selection process from a consumer behavior analysis point of view remain scarce, Cameron and Collins (1997, 1999, 2000a, 2000b), Batabyal (2001), Le Guirriec and Vaillant (2005) or more recently Choo and Siow (2006) and Fisman et al. (2006, 2008) being exceptions.Footnote 1
 Curiously, this stands in contrast with the increasing efforts from psychologists and sociobiologists to further study the analysis of human mate selection. They usually use data from personal advertisements appearing in newspapers (Harrison and Saeed 1977; Sitton and Rippee 1986; Rajecki et al. 1991; Thiessen et al. 1993; Buss 1994; Pawlowski and Koziel 2002). Such data possess interesting statistical qualities and the personality self-descriptions in these ads seem to be rather fair (Deaux and Hanna 1984; Baize and Schroeder 1995). However, the amount of information related to stipulated preferences and personal characteristics is generally restricted by the advertiser him/herself (Pawlowski and Dunbar 1999). In particular, little is known about his/her preferences in a mate. The main results of these empirical studies are in line with evolutionary predictions on the dynamics of human mate markets (Pawlowski 2000). In conformity with the Bateman’s Principle (Waynforth and Dunbar 1995), women are expected to prefer men who are capable of investing in them and their offspring, usually from a financial point of view; this implies that women have a greater preference for slightly older men, usually accompanied by a greater earning potential. Men are more likely to pursue short-term relationships; they are therefore less demanding (Symons 1979; Buss and Schmitt 1993), unless they make up their mind to invest in a stable relationship. In this case, they should place greater importance than women in youth and health in a potential partner, in relation to reproductive values and fertility. Both economic and psychological studies have certainly advanced our understanding of what individuals are looking for in a (new) partner. They corroborate that the wish to marry has an economic dimension. Single people are searching for potential mates able to provide good companionship, who enjoy similar tastes and interests (Posner 1992). However, the previous empirical analyses have focused on stipulated “positive” preferences of advertisers, i.e., on characteristics sought in a partner. While individuals living alone have strong preferences on the desired characteristics they search for in partners, there are certainly some traits that they do not want to find during the spousal search. So far, the question of undesirable characteristics in a mate has been largely unexplored, to the best of our knowledge. At first sight, this is surprising as this information may be valuable from an economic point of view. Because of the uncertainty inherent in searching for a spouse and the uncertainty of the future quality and state of the marriage itself, risk attitudes should impact the description of what candidates to marriage consider as desirable or undesirable traits. For instance, people with a high propensity to reject some potentially “negative” characteristics in a mate should reveal an aversion towards risk. According to Spivey (2009), women are more likely to fall into that case. Experience in marriage may also play an important role in the expression of negative preferences, in conformity with evolutionary predictions on the dynamics of human mate markets. More precisely, divorced or separated women should be less discriminating and therefore less likely to assume an attitude of rejection, insofar as they have a shorter reproductive life compared to young women, often perceived by men as potential mothers capable of producing healthy children (Buss and Schmitt 1993). With respect to the role of children upon the demand for partners, women often dread potential partners who are unwilling or unable (due to time and/or money) to invest in them and their (new) offspring (Feingold 1992). At the same time, child rearing is a time consuming activity and individuals with dependent children could be less demanding, translating into fewer undesirable characteristics being rejected. So, the expression of negative preferences is expected to convey a specific strategy of marriage investment. Given the lack of empirical evidence so far on undesirable traits in potential partners, we use individual data from the file of a French marriage bureau to explore this issue. Since the data include information both on positive and negative preferences, we study whether the determinants of negative preferences differ from those of positive preferences. We consider different outcomes in our empirical analysis. On the one hand, we focus on the number of characteristics quoted respectively for desired physical and non-physical characteristics and undesirable characteristics, refusing children being treated as another specific case. On the other hand, we study the determinants of the most often quoted traits by men and women, either sought or rejected. We rely on standard econometric techniques to explain respectively the number of words and specific characteristics sought and rejected by the clients (seemingly unrelated regressions, Probit models). We evidence large differences between male and female clients and highlight the role of economic and physical characteristics of the clients on their preferences. The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. We describe the data that we use in Sect. 2. We present our results from an econometric analysis of demanded and rejected characteristics in Sect. 3. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes.",9

Despite this fact, the literature on income taxation so far has paid only limited attention to specific issues concerning withholding. Withholding is not determined by an inflexible tax schedule. In the US, for example, individuals exercise at least some control over the amount withheld by claiming (or not claiming) allowances. Even though this has no effect on the tax liability at the end of the year, the different timing of tax payments may lead to behavioral responses as it determines disposable income. For instance, as Shapiro and Slemrod (1995) have shown empirically, a change in the US withholding tax in February 1992, that reduced an employee’s withholding tax by about $29 per month, let to an increase in spending on consumption goods for about forty percent of the affected taxpayers. For married couples in Germany, the control over withholding taxes is even more pronounced than in the US. By choosing one out of basically three possible “tax class” combinations, employees can not only manipulate total withholding of the family, but also the distribution of withholding taxes levied within the family. Depending on the overall size of family income and the disparities between spouses individual income, monthly withholding taxes can vary by several hundred Euros. In most cases, however, the sum of withholding taxes can only be minimized at the cost of relatively high withholding taxes levied on the income of the second earner. As it is frequently argued, this unequal taxation may impose disincentives for secondary wage earners—typically women—to enter the labor market (see Gustavsson 1992; Spahn et al. 1992). The first aim of the present paper is to test whether married couples in Germany choose tax classes on wage income such that monthly taxes withheld are minimized. The analysis makes use of micro data from official tax returns for the year 1998. Using information from this data, a household’s total wage tax liability is calculated for different tax class combinations. By comparison with those tax payments under the tax class combination actually chosen, we identify cases in which a non-minimizing tax class combination has been chosen. As our calculations show, more than 20 percent of the households analyzed in the sample do not minimize their wage tax payments. Even though the wage tax is part of a larger individual income tax system such that total income taxes are not affected, these choices restrain current disposable income to a significant degree. In the second part of the paper we therefore discuss possible explanations for this behavior: strategic choices in order to maximize expected future transfer payments; transaction costs associated with tax class changes; forced savings; and Pareto-inefficiencies in intrahousehold-decision-making. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2 we provide a short overview of the principles underlying the German withholding tax on wage income. Section 3 describes the data used and the methodology to compute tax payments. Section 4 presents the results of the analysis. These results are discussed in Sect. 5 where we conduct some limited sensitivity analysis. Section 6 concludes.",5
9.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,05 October 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-010-9104-3,Crime and partnerships,September 2011,Michael Svarer,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The economic consequences of crime in terms of reduced employment possibilities and lower market wages have been shown to be quite substantial (see e.g. Waldfogel (1994); Freeman (1999); Western et al. (2001); and Holzer (2007) for the effects of incarceration and Grogger (1995) for similar albeit smaller effects for arrestees). A less investigated, but perhaps equally important, consequence of engaging in criminal activities is the potential spill-over to marriage market outcomes. The purpose of the present paper is to take a closer look at this issue. There are numerous payoffs to forming and maintaining a partnership, and some of these returns are economic by nature. As listed in e.g. Weiss (1997), gains from marriage include specialization gains, the possibility of sharing public goods, of coordinating investment activities, and of sharing risk. To enjoy these benefits, a necessary condition is that there is someone who is willing to marry you. This paper investigates whether the possible stigma effect of being convicted of a criminal offence affects an individual’s chances in the marriage market. This paper uses a sample of Danish males (since males by far are the most active in terms of committing crime) to investigate whether being convicted of a crime affects marriage market outcomes like finding a partner, quality of partner, and dissolution risk. An obvious empirical challenge is to identify the causal effect of conviction on marriage market outcomes. It is likely that individual characteristics, both observable in the data and unobservable, affect the process related to crime and to marriage market outcomes at the same time. To address the potential endogeneity of crime, I follow a strategy that has been used in (e.g.) the—somewhat related—literature that assesses the effects on the exit rate from unemployment of sanctioning unemployed individuals that do not comply with eligibility criteria for unemployment insurance (see e.g. Svarer (2010)). The method simultaneously estimates the process that describes criminal activity and the process of marriage market activities. It hereby exploits that timing of crime differs across individuals. Under some well-defined assumptions (which I will return to later), the model causally identifies the effect of crime on the transition rate into and out of partnerships (Abbring and van den Berg 2003). Another empirical cause of concern is the possibility of reverse causality. Difficulties in finding a partner or maintaining a relationship might affect the propensity to commit crime and hence to get convicted. To address this issue, I supplement the timing-of-events methodology with an instrumental variable approach basically using pre marriage market criminal activity as instrument for being convicted in the analysis of partnership formation and pre relationship criminal activity as instrument for being convicted in the partnership dissolution analysis. The interdependency between marriage market status and crime has been studied intensively in the sociological literature. However, the main emphasis has been on the effect of marriage on the propensity to commit crime. The conclusion from this literature is that marriage causally reduces crime (see Sampson et al. (2006)). Studies that look at the other side of the coin—the effect of crime on marriage market outcomes—are much fewer in number. Sampson and Laub (1993) look at the relationship between juvenile delinquency and adult outcomes using US data. They find that delinquency when young is associated with weaker attachment to a spouse and higher divorce propensity in adult years. Levitt and Lochner (2001), also based on US data, find no difference in marriage or divorce patterns by age 30 for youth criminals compared to non-criminals. Lopoo and Western (2005) investigate the effect of incarceration on the formation and stability of marital unions, and using US data they find that the probability of finding a partner or divorcing the current partner is higher during incarceration, but not significantly so afterwards. Neither of these studies address the issue of endogeneity, and in that sense this paper is the first (as far as the author is aware) that tries to estimate the causal effect of crime on marriage market outcomes. The study uses a large Danish register-based data set to investigate how the incident of being convicted of a criminal offence affects the probability to form partnerships, the quality of partners, and the partnership dissolution risk. The data has individual level information for 10% sample of the Danish population between 15 and 66 years old. For each individual we know whether the person has been convicted for a crime. The type of conviction and the sentence is also known. In addition, the data set includes an array of information on partnership start and dissolution and various socioeconomic variables for all individuals, their partners, and the parents of both individuals in a given couple. The sample is observed from 1990 to 2003. I find that being convicted is associated with a reduced probability of being in a relationship. In addition, I find that being convicted does not affect the transition rate into partnerships as such, but males who have been convicted face a lower chance of forming partnerships with females from more well-off families, suggesting that crime does carry a penalty in terms of forming partnerships. In relation to partnership dissolution, it is found that males who are being convicted face a significantly higher dissolution risk than their law abiding counterparts. The structure of the paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, I provide a brief discussion of the expected association between crime and marriage market outcome. Section 3 presents the data, and details on sample selection. Section 4 describes the empirical strategy and in particular under which assumptions inference is obtained. In Sect. 5, the results are presented, and finally in Sect. 6 I conclude.",5
9.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,11 July 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-010-9100-7,Effects of family planning and health services on women’s welfare: evidence on dowries and intra-household bargaining in Bangladesh,September 2011,Christina Peters,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Programs to limit fertility and provide health care to mothers and children promise to improve socioeconomic outcomes in developing countries. Evaluations of plausibly randomized family planning programs in Bangladesh and Colombia document large declines in fertility (Koenig et al. 1992, Miller 2010). Recent work also finds secondary effects on household behavior, including increased human capital investments and reduced child labor supply (Sinha 2005, Joshi and Schultz 2007). This paper demonstrates a further avenue through which family planning and health services programs can affect the welfare of individual members of the household: access to a program can alter marriage market behavior and change the dynamics of post-marriage intra-household bargaining. Although the overall welfare gains from family planning and health services interventions are likely to be large, I observe the important result that when men control access to the program, these gains may be partially offset for women in other aspects of their lives. Using a supply and demand model for marriage (Becker 1973, Grossbard-Shechtman 1993), I predict that the program will decrease the share of the marital surplus going to the wives of husbands living in program areas. This prediction is tested on the treatment and comparison groups of a plausibly randomized family planning program in Bangladesh, revealing that household adjustments to the program appear to occur not only within marriage through changes in bargaining weights but also before marriage through a dowry payment. Using multiple measures of female-decision making power within the household, probit models find that women who reside within the program treatment area (i.e. treated women) are 35% less likely than women in the comparison area (i.e. untreated women) to be able to make certain purchases without permission from their husbands or another household member. Furthermore, a difference-in-difference model indicates that the families of women who marry after the program begins pay 14% higher dowries in order to secure husbands from the treatment area. I estimate these results using the cross-sectional Matlab Health and Socioeconomic Survey (MHSS), administered in 1996 to a random sample covering 4,364 householdsFootnote 1 in the nearly 150 villages of Matlab district, a rural agricultural area of Bangladesh 55 km southeast of Dhaka (Rahman et al. 1999). Since 1977, a maternal and child health and family planning program (the MCHFP) has been operating in randomly chosen but contiguous geographic blocks within Matlab. This paper confirms that the services provided by the program not only reduce fertility rates in the treatment area when compared with the control area, but they also enhance the health and survival rates of infants and children. Because geographic location determines eligibility for the program and women typically move in with their husband’s family upon marriage, wives obtain access to program services only if their husbands reside in the treatment area.Footnote 2 Thus, the MCHFP endows men with a new asset to bring to marriage that is highly desired by women—the enhanced child quality and reduced child quantity provided by the program. A supply and demand model of marriage predicts that a couple will revise their contract in light of the husband’s new endowment to increase his share of the surplus at the wife’s expense. Much of the previous literature on marriage has implicitly assumed that this change will occur along only one margin, such as changes in dowry (Anderson 2000) or spousal bargaining power in the household (Manser and Brown 1980, McElroy and Horney 1981). However, there is no ex-ante reason to restrict changes to only one margin of adjustment. This paper follows the observations of Becker (1973) and Grossbard-Shechtman (1993) by allowing the possibility that a couple on the post-program marriage market may in fact choose to adjust along multiple margins, partially increasing the dowry payment while simultaneously giving decreased weight to the wife’s preferences over the allocation of household resources. My empirical results suggest just this mix—separating the data sample by period of marriage finds that women in post-program marriages (i.e. those marriages occurring after the program begins) both increase their dowry payments to treatment area men and exhibit decreased bargaining power within the marriage. Women in pre-program marriages show a similar bargaining power differential but no differences in dowry payments, since dowry changes cannot occur for women who married before the program begins. Meanwhile, there are no significant differences in the level of independence over purchases for women who are ineligible for direct participation in the program, including unmarried women in their fertile years and divorced women. Despite the many previous studies arguing that the comparison area villages are an appropriate control for the treatment villages, there may be concern that these results merely reflect pre-existing or unobservable differences between the two groups. Although I am limited to a cross-sectional sample of women and cannot look directly at pre-program outcomes, descriptive statistics for two pre-program cohorts indicate few substantial demographic differences between pre-program women living in the treatment and comparison areas (these cohorts include women within the dataset who are past menopause at the start of the MCHFP, and women in a pre-program census of the Matlab population). However, like all other studies using this data, it is ultimately impossible to fully account for unobservable characteristics. Despite this limitation, the availability within this dataset of explicit measures of control over household purchases provides a unique advantage over previous studies of exogenous shocks to the marital contract, which have been forced to infer changes in bargaining power through more commonly observed variables such as labor supply (e.g. Chiappori et al. 2002, Oreffice 2007). Moreover, when estimating changes in dowry payments to treatment area males, I can apply a difference-in-difference specification to control for unobservables. The data records retrospective information for all couples on dowries paid in the year of marriage (as reported by the wife interviewed separately from her husband), which allows me to find the change in dowry payments over the pre and post-program periods for the treatment area, after accounting for the corresponding change in the control area. While there are no significant differences in either the levels or trends in dowry payments paid to treatment and comparison area men in pre-existing marriages, treatment area men in post-program marriages receive dowry payments that are 1,192 taka higher than their untreated counterparts (a 14% difference). Difference-in-difference estimates confirm that treatment area males begin receiving higher dowries than untreated males in 1977, the first year of the program. Combined with the first set of results on bargaining power, this suggests that many couples respond to shocks along multiple margins of adjustment. These findings caution that when family planning and health services programs are administered such that men control access, they may appropriate the increase in marital surplus due to the program and consequently induce some unintended welfare changes for women. Despite these changes, however, Matlab women are still likely to experience substantial gains overall from having access to the MCHFP.Footnote 3
 The next section describes the data setting, the Matlab family planning and health services program, and its first-order impacts. I then provide a theoretical framework that illustrates the comparative static effects of the program endowment on female bargaining power and dowry payments, and present my empirical results.",10

Meyerhoefer,C. J. Chen,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the past quarter century China has experienced significant economic and societal changes that have given rural residents strong incentives to seek non-farm employment in urban centers. While the number of internal migrants was only around 2 million in the mid-1980s (Ping and Pieke 2003) it is estimated to be over 150 million today (Tang, Sha and Ren 2003). Given that the marginal return on non-farm activities is ten times higher than farm production (Knight and Song 2003), there is little doubt that urban employment is an attractive means of raising rural families’ standard of living. Nonetheless, it is unclear the extent to which the financial rewards from migration translate into sustained gains in socio-economic status across generations. A key issue is whether parental labor migration reduces human capital accumulation among children and adolescents. If educational attainment is lower among the children whose parents are migrants, their ability to take advantage of higher parental earnings and achieve a sustained increase in living standards may be limited. Furthermore, gender inequalities in educational investments resulting from migration could further exacerbate the gap in attainment between boys and girls in rural China (Song et al. 2006; Hannum 2003). Alternatively, the overall impact of parental labor migration on children’s education may be positive if parents re-invest their higher earnings in educational services, or other activities that promote human capital accumulation (Chen et al. 2009). Empirical evidence on the relationship between parental labor migration and children’s education in rural China is very limited, and we are aware of only one study that uses causal methods. We add to this literature using data from the provinces of Hebei and Liaoning in northeastern China, which despite their high levels of migration have not been previously studied. In addition, we consider a more comprehensive measure of educational attainment than earlier research focusing on test scores, and separately indentify the impact of educational costs on access to education. Our measure of educational attainment, the child’s grade-level lag relative to normal progress, captures the cumulative impact of reduced educational investments, including poor performance or absence preventing advancement to the next grade level as well as dropping out. Using both ordinary and instrumental variables estimation techniques, we find that the children of migrants have lower educational attainment, and that the lag in educational progress is large and precisely estimated for girls. This finding has important implications for China’s education and household registration policies. Previous research has shown that the children of unregistered labor migrants have lower enrollment rates than local or registered migrant children, and our result suggests that the educational attainment of girls left behind in rural areas is similarly limited by household registration policies. However, we also find that reducing schooling costs by half for girls in migrant families would completely offset this disparity.",72

Japan has suffered severe natural disasters and is probably more at risk than many other countries, especially from earthquakes (Skidmore 2001). Of the largest earthquakes in Japan, the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923, which struck an area that included Tokyo, caused the greatest human loss and claimed about 100,000 lives. Yet, in terms of the economic damage measured in monetary loss, the Great Hanshin Awaji earthquake (hereafter, the Kobe earthquake) was one of the largest natural disasters in human history.Footnote 1
 The Kobe earthquake struck at 5:46 a.m. on January 17, 1995, hitting an area that was home to 4 million people and that contained one of Japan’s main industrial clusters. The earthquake, which had registered 7.3 on the Richter scale, cost 6,432 lives excluding 3 missing persons, resulted in 43,792 injured, and damaged 639,686 buildings, of which 104,906 were completely destroyed (Fire and Disaster Management Agency 2006). Together with Hurricane Katrina, the Kobe earthquake was responsible for one of the largest economic losses due to a natural disaster in history. The loss in housing property amounted to more than US$60 billion, while that in capital stock exceeded US$100 billion (Horwich 2000). The purpose of this study is to examine the impacts of this large natural disaster on people’s economic responses and recovery in the affected area. In order to understand the recovery process from unexpected serious damage caused by a natural disaster, we examine how damaged durable stocks are reinvested, how a borrowing or dissaving portfolio is reallocated to mitigate the asset shocks, and how consumption insurance mechanisms for nondurables are effective against negative shocks. Concretely, we perform three sets of empirical analyses in this paper. First, we explore how the damage to durable wealth of furniture, electronic equipment, and housing are recovered, focusing on the effects of different asset shocks. Second, we investigate how an ex post borrowing or dissaving portfolio is utilized by households to weather large asset damage arising from the disaster. While we focus on the role of borrowing or dissaving which is studied widely in the literature (Rosenzweig 2001; Lee and Sawada 2007), there are other risk coping mechanisms such as private transfers (Cox 1987). Third, we examine how market and non-market insurance mechanisms are effective in coping with large unexpected asset shocks on nondurable goods expenditure. Despite the increasing number of natural disasters and the relevance to disaster management policy, the issues examined in this paper have been largely unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap in the existing literature. There are three unique features of our paper that differentiate it from the previous studies. First, there has been little research on the effect of the destruction of housing and other assets caused by an earthquake. A strand of the relevant literature is the existing studies of the full consumption risk sharing hypothesis (Mace 1991; Cochrane 1991; Hayashi et al. 1996; Townsend 1994; Shimizutani 2003; Dubois et al. 2008; Ligon 1998, 2008). Yet, except for Kohara et al. (2006) and Sawada and Shimizutani (2007a), these studies have not utilized the data on natural disasters. The destruction of housing and other assets caused by the Kobe earthquake seems qualitatively different from the kinds of shocks envisioned by the existing studies that utilize income shocks. Second, we examine three important issues: first, the rebuilding process of damaged stocks of durable wealth; second, the determinants of ex post borrowing or dissaving reallocation; and finally, the success or failure of consumption smoothing, an aspect investigated in the existing studies, against a variety of unexpected shocks caused by a natural disaster in the sense of a natural experiment of Rosenzweig and Wolpin (2000). This strategy is indispensable to depict an overview of the disaster shocks and policy implications. Third, as to the test of the consumption risk sharing hypothesis, we extend the canonical empirical strategy of Cochrane (1991) and Mace (1991) by relaxing the separability assumption across different expenditure items.Footnote 2 Our model allows us to test the validity of the separability assumption of the utility function by employing a multivariate probit model that considers the simultaneity of expenditure decisions on different items or of different portfolio reallocations. By performing these analyses, we also aim to contribute to the policy debate on the effective management of risks induced by natural disasters. Notably, economic recovery in the Kobe area was much faster than initially expected (Horwich 2000). Accordingly, lessons from the “success” in the wake of the Kobe earthquake may be crucial for designing appropriate policies to deal with natural disasters including the current devastating disaster caused by the Great East Japan earthquake.",11
9.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,02 May 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-011-9122-9,Sexual orientation and household financial decisions: evidence from couples in the United States,December 2011,Brighita Negrusa,Sonia Oreffice,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"A recent and widespread phenomenon across developed countries is the emergence of a sizable number of homosexual partnerships, accompanied by an important legal and cultural movement aimed at providing these households with the same rights and status as those enjoyed by heterosexuals. For instance, Massachusetts and Spain legalized same-sex marriages in 2004, and Iowa in 2009. Nevertheless, the economic analysis of household behavior is still centered on heterosexual families. We examine how sexual orientation and cohabiting status are associated with homeowners’ annual mortgage payments relative to house value. We show that homosexual couples, who constitute a relatively new household type, exhibit a significantly higher ratio of mortgage payments than heterosexual married and cohabiting households. This estimated positive difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals is driven by lesbian couples. We also show that the cohabiting status of homosexual couples does not drive this estimated pattern of results. Our study further explores same-sex household decision-making and extends the literature that relates housing and homeownership to sexual orientation (Black et al. 2002; Jepsen and Jepsen 2009; Leppel 2007). We consider an additional decision made by homeowners regarding the amount of annual mortgage to pay, which is regarded as an indicator of households’ propensity to save (e.g., Deaton and Paxson 1994). In this paper we provide the first attempt to measure differences in the propensity to save by sexual orientation. More generally, this study extends a growing literature on same-sex couples, which identifies both similarities and differences between same-sex and heterosexual households. Black et al. (2007) and Jepsen and Jepsen (2002) consider that families’ preferences do not differ systematically according to sexual orientation, while Becker (1991) argues that disparities between homosexual unions and heterosexual marriages are due to the lack of difference in comparative advantage between partners and to the presence of complementarities. Carpenter (2008), Jepsen (2007) and Oreffice (2011), among others, document that same-sex couples exhibit a much lower fertility than heterosexual couples. More importantly, Jepsen and Jepsen (2009), and Leppel (2007) perform empirical tests on homeownership rate differentials by sexual orientation, showing that for homosexuals the rate is lower than for married couples, but higher than for heterosexual cohabiting couples. Furthermore, they find that gay and lesbian households do not differ in this respect. However, they do not provide a framework for the interpretation of these findings and do not specifically analyze mortgages and their ratio to house value. We use US Census data for the year 2000, specifically its five-percent sample, which provides detailed demographic, income, and homeownership information on the largest available sample of gay and lesbian partners, along with standard samples of heterosexual individuals. Our empirical strategy consists in estimating the effects of being a homosexual rather than a married or cohabiting couple by comparing the ratio of homeowners’ mortgage payments to house value in cross-sections including gay, lesbian, and heterosexual couples. We focus our attention on a relevant financial decision for young home owning couples, namely their choice of mortgage payments relative to house value. US Census data do not provide any direct consumption variable better suited for an analysis of household propensity to save, and this ratio reflects the couple’s willingness to forego consumption in order to repay housing loans. Deaton and Paxson (1994), Lin et al. (2000), Lin and Lai (2003), and Tachibanaki (1994), among others, argue that if this type of contractual savings is not taken into account, the savings rate of the many homeowners paying mortgage would be significantly underestimated. Moreover, there is very little theory or evidence on heterosexual couples’ propensity to save by type of relationship (cohabiting vs. marriage), or partners’ characteristics, since in the savings literature it is customary to compare married households to singles, including cohabiting individuals in this latter category, e.g., Browning et al. 2011; Browning and Lusardi 1996. In particular, we are not aware of any study of sexual orientation and household propensity to save. Our empirical analysis reveals that after controlling for age, education and other socioeconomic characteristics of both partners, same-sex households exhibit a higher ratio of mortgage payments to house value than heterosexual households. Specifically, we find that being homosexual significantly increases the ratio of mortgage payments to house value by 2.6 units. Distinguishing same-sex households by gender, we find that lesbians exhibit 5.5 units more than both heterosexual married couples and gay couples, while the positive estimated coefficient associated to gay households is not statistically different from zero. The point estimates indicate that, relative to married heterosexual homeowners, lesbian couples pay an additional 8.7 percent of their average annual mortgage, toward owning an average value house. Next, we compare homosexual to cohabiting heterosexuals in order to explore any additional factors that may be driving this homosexual-specific differential, other than their cohabiting status. We find a negative significant coefficient of −2.78 for gay couples, while the lesbians’ positive coefficient loses significance. This result is consistent with our interpretation that household propensity to save is influenced by its gender composition and the presence of children. The subsample of childless couples confirms this pattern of results. In addition, we present empirical evidence on retirement and social security income of older households by sexual orientation and cohabiting status. This analysis shows significant differences between gay, lesbian, heterosexual married and cohabiting couples, with homosexual couples having more retirement and social security income than heterosexual couples. This evidence represents the first empirical analysis of differentials by sexual orientation for individuals 60 years of age and older. Although we do not have panel data with direct consumption variables, we believe this analysis contributes to our knowledge regarding the financial situation of gay and lesbian couples. More importantly, this study can serve as a starting point in understanding young homosexual households’ savings behavior as well as the retirement decisions of older couples. Policy-makers show a strong interest in changes in the demographic composition of the population and its living arrangements, but usually distinguish households by marital status alone. In our work we can actually disentangle several types of households, which are usually considered all in the same category in the standard economic analysis of household financial decisions (savings, retirement, etc.), and we document significant differences between gays, lesbians, heterosexual married and cohabiting couples.",15

Asthma triggers may include, but are not limited to, environmental irritants such as tobacco smoke and pollutants, household and industrial products, viruses, exercise and cold air (ALA 2005). An asthma attack is characterized by wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain or tightness and can be life-threatening (Adams 1995). Pediatric asthma, or asthma among those under 18, is the most commonly occurring chronic childhood disease. According to parental surveys contained in the the 2004 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), nine million U.S. children under 18 had been diagnosed with asthma during their lifetimes. Almost four million children experienced at least one asthma attack in the month prior to the survey (Dey and Bloom 2006). The economic costs associated with childhood asthma are numerous. Pediatric asthma resulted in more than 750,000 visits to the emergency room and 12.8 million missed days of school in 2003 and 2004, respectively (Akinbami 2006). Using data from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, Wang et al. (2005) calculate that the direct and indirect costs of asthma totaled almost 2 billion dollars in that year. Childhood asthma is unevenly distributed with respect to gender and socioeconomic status, disproportionately affecting children who are male, poor, African-American and Latino (Dey and Bloom 2006). Although male children tend to have higher rates of pediatric asthma, the prevalence of asthma among females becomes higher around puberty (Sears 1998). Also, children from single parent households, as well as those residing in the inner cities tend to have higher rates of asthma incidence and morbidity (Meyer et al. 1998). Ethnic background is correlated with asthma prevalence as well. Among African-American children, asthma incidence, morbidity and mortality are higher compared to white children. The incidence of asthma among Latinos is lower than that found among other ethnic groups. However, there is considerable heterogeneity within Latino subgroups. Mexican-American children have among the lowest incidence of lifetime asthma among all racial and ethnic groups, (10%) while Puerto-Rican children have the highest (over 25%) (Dey and Bloom 2006; Flores et al. 2005). While the origins of asthma are not altogether clear, researchers have generally concluded that asthma has both genetic and environmental/behavioral causes (Litonjua et al. 1998). This paper focuses on one behavioral component, breastfeeding, that is thought to be an important factor in the development of asthma. Breastfeeding provides numerous health benefits to infants, including reduced risk of various infections, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), obesity and other negative health conditions (Kramer 2003). Although breastfeeding is often traditionally associated with a decreased likelihood of an asthma diagnosis (Wolf 2003), the links between asthma and breastfeeding are far from clear. Many studies have found that breastfeeding has no effect on the incidence of asthma (Oddy et al. 2004), while others have found that breastfeeding actually may even increase the incidence of asthma (Sears et al. 2002). However, little of the work examining the relationship between breastfeeding and asthma closely examines how the behavioral component of infant feeding can influence the statistical relationships being estimated. That is, breastfeeding is treated as an exogenous variable affecting child health outcomes when it is likely correlated with unobservable individual (and family) characteristics that also influence asthma outcomes. Failing to control for the endogeneity of important health behaviors such as breastfeeding can lead to biased estimates of their effects. Adding to the economics and public health literatures, I explore the possible role of breastfeeding as an explanation of differences in the rates of asthma diagnosis. To account for potential unobserved heterogeneity found in the infant feeding decision, I jointly model both the decision to breastfeed and asthma propensity using the bivariate probit framework, also known as the bivariate probit model with endogenous dummy (Wilde 2000). I find some evidence that breastfeeding behavior is indeed correlated with unobservables in the error term. When this unobserved heterogeneity is accounted for, I find that breastfeeding, particularly for at least 3 months, reduces the probability of the focal child being diagnosed with asthma by age one. However, there is limited evidence that breastfeeding reduces the likelihood of an asthma diagnosis by age three. These results can be explained by the fact that many children who are diagnosed with ‘asthma’ at young ages may actually be ‘transient wheezers’ who cease wheezing at older ages. However, there are other young children who wheeze that will go on to develop full blown allergic asthma. While the wheezing in both groups has differing origins, the economic costs of wheezing-related hospitalizations during the first year of life makes this phenomenon an important area of concern (Bachrach et al. 2003). This paper will proceed as follows: Section 2 provides a brief review of the literature on breastfeeding and pediatric respiratory health, as well as the economics of child health. Section 3 describes the empirical model and the estimation methods that are used to analyze the relationship between breastfeeding and asthma. Section 4 provides a description of the estimation sample and Sect. 5 provides a discussion of the estimation results. Section 6 concludes with a discussion of the results, the implications of the findings, limitations and plans for future work.",3
9.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,27 November 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-010-9109-y,How can gender discrimination explain fertility behaviors and family-friendly policies?,December 2011,Magali Recoules,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Since the middle of the 1980s empirical studies have shown an inversion of the cross-country correlation between the female labor supply and the fertility rates in OECD countries (Ahn and Mira 2002). Now, the countries exhibiting the lowest levels of female employment are also those that have low fertility rates, and the countries that are characterized by the highest levels of female employment are also those that have high fertility rates. Some authors propose to explain these features by changes in institutional context, such as labor market arrangements and family-friendly policies (Adserà 2004; Brewster and Rindfuss 2000).
Footnote 1 Family-friendly policies differ considerably from country to country both in their type and their extent. In particular, the countries with both high fertility and female employment are also those that have high state intervention concerning family (Del Boca and Locatelli 2007). How can such differences in household decisions as family-friendly policies, fertility and the female labor supply, be explained? My paper proposes an explanation based on gender discrimination in the labor market. In particular, this paper studies the way in which gender discrimination affects the related decisions on fertility, the female labor supply and family policies. Labor market discrimination, by reducing the wage of women, influences household decisions through three direct effects. A rise in gender discrimination leads to both an increase in the specialization of women in household activities and to a decrease in the child-rearing opportunity cost in terms of earnings, as well as a decrease in the total household income. The two former effects play in favor of fertility, while the latter tends to reduce it. Moreover, the joint decrease in household income and the opportunity cost of children tends to reduce the willingness to pay for family-friendly policies which finance childcare services. By combining the effects of discrimination through shifts in female wage and in size of public spending, the model provides a U-shaped relationship between fertility and gender discrimination. If the discrimination is not too high, a drop in gender discrimination leads to a related rise in fertility, the female labor supply and family policies. This paper is based on three crucial assumptions. First, that there is gender discrimination in the labor market that leads to a gender wage gap. Thus for the same skills and working time, women receive a lower wage than men because of gender discrimination. In the literature, gender discrimination partly accounts for the gender wage gap (Becker 1957; Aigner and Cain 1977; Coate and Loury 1993; Francois 1998) and thus for the differences in child-rearing opportunity cost between spouses. Secondly, there is a childrearing technology which relates the time cost of rearing children with public policies. The efficiency of this technology plays an important role in fertility decisions. The cost of having children is affected by discrimination through two ways: shifts in female wage and in the size of family-friendly policies.
Footnote 2 Finally, family-friendly policies are assumed to be endogenously determined through a vote of agents. The economy is composed of men and women organized as couples. Each man and woman having the same preferences, all households are identical. Household decisions are determined through a two-stage decision process. The first stage refers to the size of public spending, more specifically the taxation level which is determined through a vote of agents. Each member of the couple singly chooses the taxation level that maximizes his or her indirect utility. The second stage refers to fertility, labor supply and individual consumption choices. These decisions are taken cooperatively within the couple and result from the maximization of a weighted sum of spouses’ utilities under a household budget constraint, the weights being the bargaining power of each partner. The model shows that different intensities of gender discrimination may explain the differences in household decisions across countries. Gender discrimination, by acting on the female wage, modifies the allocation of tasks within the household and implies a specialization of gender roles. An increase in gender discrimination discourages the participation of women in the labor market which implies a decrease in the childrearing opportunity cost in terms of earnings as well as a reduction of the household income. By staying at home for longer, women’s demand for public services decreases and agents vote for a lower tax rate that boosts the childrearing opportunity cost in terms of time. So a rise in discrimination has ambiguous effects on the overall cost of having children. If the efficiency in childrearing technology is sufficiently high, the solution of the model shows a U-shaped relationship between fertility and gender discrimination. For a low level of discrimination, an increase in discrimination raises the overall cost of having children and puts off the childbearing decision as the opportunity cost in terms of earnings is dominated by the other effects. Beyond a discrimination threshold the opportunity cost in terms of earnings outweighs the other effects and reduces thereby the overall cost of having children. In this case, an increase in discrimination pushes households to have more children. Hence in the first part of the U-shaped curve, a drop in the discrimination level implies a related rise in fertility, women’s employment and family policies. This relation matches empirical evidence observed in European countries. Beyond a discrimination threshold, agents choose a tax rate equal to zero since the gains given by public policies are not enough to offset their costs. In this case, the effect through shifts in female wage always prevails and a rise in discrimination stimulates fertility decisions. The model presented is based on Cavalcanti and Tavares (2010) and Galor and Weil (1996) in which the gender wage gap is due to differences in physical strength and reduces as the economy grows. The current paper suggests that gender wage discrimination be related to cultural behaviors which may contribute to explain the persistence of gender wage gap and differences in European household decisions. In particular, this paper focuses on the way in which gender discrimination may explain the positive relation between fertility, female labor supply and family-friendly policies, while Cavalcanti and Tavares (2010) are mainly interested in the link between the female labor supply and the level of public spending. The paper shows a U-shaped relationship between fertility and gender discrimination. Thus, a decrease in gender discrimination may lead to a joint increase in fertility, female labor supply and family-friendly policies. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of some empirical evidence regarding fertility rates, labor supply and family policies in OECD countries. In Section 3, a general equilibrium model with gender discrimination is developed. Section 4 presents the main results. Section 5 concludes.",3
9.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,19 December 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-010-9115-0,"Why do larger families reduce parental investments in child quality, but not child quality per se?",December 2011,Marc Frenette,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"One of the most important demographic trends in recent decades has been the incredible decline in the fertility rate in developed countries. From 1960 to 2006, the fertility rate decline by 49% in OECD countries; since 1980, the rate has declined by 22% (OECD 2009). This downward trend in fertility, as well as subsequent attempts to raise fertility through financial incentives (see Milligan 2005), has fuelled research on the impact of fertility on other outcomes. One of the areas of particular concern has been child development. According to Gary Becker’s ‘Quantity–Quality’ theory of children, the household faces a trade-off between the number of children they have and the average ‘quality’ of children (Becker 1960; Becker and Lewis 1973; Becker and Tomes 1976). Researchers then began investigating the empirical link between fertility and child quality. Using clever instruments to correct for the possible endogeneity of fertility to child quality (e.g. the incidence of twins, the sex composition of children, or China’s one child policy), they looked at measures such as educational attainment (Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1980; Angrist et al. 2005; Black et al. 2005, 2010), grade retention (Cáceras-Delpiano 2006), labour market outcomes (Angrist et al. 2005), marriage and fertility (Angrist et al. 2005), and school enrolment (Qian 2009). What has emerged from this literature is that there is no consistent negative link between fertility and child outputs. In fact, the balance of the literature points to no relationship between the two.Footnote 1
 As noted by Cáceras-Delpiano (2006), however, the true spirit of Becker’s model is that households will reduce their investments in children as family size grows. The resulting level of child quality is beyond complete control of the parents. Using the 1980 US Census, he demonstrates that increased fertility (instrumented with a twin birth on a second or later birth) exerts a negative impact on private school enrolment. The question that remained was simple, “Why does fertility reduce parental investments in children, but has no consistent impact on various measures of child output?” Cáceras-Delpiano points to one possible factor, namely the reduction in maternal labour supply suggested by theories of household allocation of labour. When faced with more children, men and women further specialize in household activities, which for men is typically paid work and for women is typically unpaid housework (Becker 1985). In addition, a new child will increase the demand for parental involvement in general (Lundberg and Rose 1999). In combination, these two complementary theories suggest an ambiguous impact of fertility on men’s labour supply, and an unambiguous decline in women’s labour supply. Cáceras-Delpiano showed that maternal labour supply does indeed tend to decline with fertility. Unfortunately, the data available only contained information on hours of paid work, so it is not clear what mothers are actually doing in the home (i.e. taking care of children or not). This study extends the work of Cáceras-Delpiano (2006) in two important ways. First, using the same twin birth strategy and a unique Canadian data set (the Youth in Transition Survey—YITS, linked to the Programme for International Student Assessment—PISA), I explore the link between fertility and a broader range of investments that are arguably linked to parental intentions for producing higher quality children (overall and non-sectarian private school enrolment, the number of computers in the home per child, and saving for the child’s education). I find a strong negative link between fertility and each of these measures of parental investments. I also demonstrate that fertility is not negatively associated with child cognitive ability (a measure of child output). Second, I consider three possible reasons for the ‘puzzle’ presented in the literature (i.e. fertility is negatively related to parental investments, but is not always related to child outputs). The first is that the literature has not definitively linked parental investments in children to their cognitive ability. In fact, quasi-causal and experimental studies suggest no link with certain measures of parental investments. The second is that there may be economies of scale associated with larger families, with respect to rearing children and selecting effective sibling interactions. I present evidence suggesting that economies of scale explain some, but not all, of the puzzle. The third possible reason follows up on Cáceras-Delpiano’s work. Specifically, recent work suggests that mothers (and fathers!) do in fact respond to increased fertility by spending more time taking care of children without pay. However, the literature offers mixed evidence on the role of parental childcare in determining cognitive ability (ranging from no effect to a positive effect). The remainder of this study is as follows. In the next section, I describe the methodology, including the identification strategy and the data used in the study. I then present the descriptive and econometric results in the following two sections. Next, I identify and discuss three possible reasons why fertility is negatively associated with parental investments in children, but generally does not lead to reduced child outputs. Finally, the study is summarized in the last section.",8
9.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,19 March 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-010-9088-z,"Religion, religiosity and educational attainment of immigrants to the USA",December 2011,Sankar Mukhopadhyay,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A large body of theoretical and empirical research has investigated the association between religion, religiosity and educational attainment in the US. However these studies are far from unanimous in their conclusions. For example some studies find a negative effect of fundamentalism on educational attainment (Darnell and Sherkat 1997; Sherkat and Darnell 1999; Keysar and Kosmin 1995; Glass 1999) while other studies (Freeman 1986; Regnerus 2000; Muller and Ellison 2001) find that participation in religious activities has a positive impact on educational attainment. Lehrer (2004) finds that women who attend religious services frequently during their adolescent years complete one more year of schooling than women who are less observant. Lehrer (2006) hypothesizes that “(a) youth who grow up with no religious affiliation (and hence have zero involvement in religious activity, at least in the institutional context) are less likely to graduate from high school than their counterparts who grow up with some affiliation; and (b) among youth raised with some affiliation, a greater level of participation in religious activity during the adolescence years is associated with a higher probability of high school graduation.” Using data on non-Hispanic white and black women from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth she accepts both hypotheses. This paper re-visits the hypotheses proposed by Lehrer. We use data on new lawful immigrants to the US from the New Immigrant Survey (NIS) 2003. The NIS has two main advantages. First, it allows us to look at a broader set of religions that includes most of the major religions of the world (previous literature has focused primarily on Christianity). Second, it allows us to extend the analysis to a demographic group that has not been addressed in previous studies. A number of researchers have tried to identify the factors that affect the economic performance of immigrants (see Chiswick and Lofstrom 2009 for a recent overview). One of the factors that have received a lot of attention is the declining ‘quality’ of new immigrants and whether the changing country composition is leading to the decline in quality (Borjas 1985; Bohn 2009). As we discuss below changes in the country composition also implies changes in the religious composition of new immigrants. The NIS data allows us to uncover the relation between religion, religiosity and investment in human capital. Although this paper does not address the role of changing religious composition in changing in ‘quality’ of new immigrants, results of this paper indicate that it might be an important area of future research. The underlying analytical framework used in this paper was developed by Becker and Chiswick (1966) and Becker (1967). We follow this framework, most closely related in form to the presentation of Lehrer (2004). The starting point in this theory is that the marginal rate of return (MRR) to education derived from each additional dollar spent on education is downward sloping (because of higher opportunity cost at higher levels of education). The optimal amount of education equates the MRR to education with the interest rate at which money is borrowed (or not lent) to invest in education. The cost of funds may be constant or increasing. Religion or religious activity can shift either the demand curve or the supply curve. Lehrer (2004) considers the following three cases. First, high-religiosity parents may have a predisposition against scientific methods and secular education (Sherkat and Darnell 1999). This may increase the perceived cost of funds (because of added utility cost), and thereby reduce optimal educational attainment. Second, a more religious environment may reduce critical inquiry and thinking (Sherkat and Darnell 1999) in children, thereby reducing their MRR to education and their optimal educational attainment. Third, more religious activity may promote more healthy and constructive behavior in children leading to an increase in MRR to education, thereby increasing optimal educational attainment. Lehrer (2004) reports evidence consistent with the third mechanism. She finds that the point estimate for MRR to education is not statistically different between the high-religiosity group and the low-religiosity group which suggests that cost of funds is flat in that region. Our results show that immigrants who are affiliated with religion do not have more schooling compared to immigrants with no religion (except for Protestant and Jewish males). The negative association between religion and educational attainment (after controlling for a rich set of background variables) is strongest for immigrants from the Muslim religion and immigrants who belong to “Other” religion. Also, the negative association between religion and educational attainment is stronger in female immigrants compared to male immigrants. We also find that high religiosity is associated with lower educational attainment. Immigrants with high religiosity have about 0.36 fewer years of education compared to immigrants with low religiosity. Again the negative association is stronger for female immigrants. We also find that MRR to education is higher for low-religiosity immigrants. This result suggests that for this group of immigrants high religiosity shifts the MRR curve to the left (the second mechanism described above). Thus our results are consistent with Sherkat and Darnell (1999) but not with Lehrer (2004, 2006).",12

Until the 20th century, primary industries in the United States and European economies were associated with agriculture, and given limited physical capital and technology, 19th century farmers typically faced a labor shortage. Therefore, a net benefit agricultural households received from larger family sizes was a larger internal labor force. The net costs of having children was the present value of expected future outlays plus parental time used in the process of rearing children, less the present value of expected monetary returns plus the imputed value of childhood services (Becker 1993, pp. 21–23). Because in traditional societies mothers and fathers have different biological endowments and human capital, these historical benefits and costs differed from their modern counterparts (Becker 1981, p. 22; Atack and Bateman 1987, p. 55). As the primary care-giver, female fertility and child-rearing, in turn, were related to household size and childhood health. The use of height data to measure living standards is now a well-established method in economics (Fogel 1994, p. 138; Deaton 2008; Case and Paxson 2008). A population’s average stature reflects the cumulative interaction between family size, nutrition, disease exposure, work, and the physical environment (Steckel 1979, pp. 365–367; Tanner 1962, pp. 1–27). By considering average versus individual stature, genetic differences are mitigated, leaving only the physical environmental influences on stature. When diets, health, and physical environments improve, average stature increases and decreases when diets become less nutritious, disease environments deteriorate, or the physical environment places more stress on the body.Footnote 1 Therefore, stature provides considerable insights into understanding historical processes and augments other historical welfare measures. It is against this backdrop that this study considers the relationship between 19th century stature and family size. Three questions are considered. First, how were 19th century US statures associated with family size? Using a demand for children model, this paper illustrates that 19th century statures were positively related with average household size. Second, how was stature related to average household wealth and inequality? Nineteenth century statures were positively associated with average household wealth and inversely related with wealth inequality. Third, what was the relationship between stature and occupation? After controlling for family size, wealth, and inequality, 19th century rural farmers were taller than workers in other occupations.",10

The cost of childbearing is estimated to have been approximately $9.1 billion in 2006 (Hoffman 2006), affecting a number of institutions ranging from the health care system, child welfare, and public sector health care to the state and federal prisons systems. It is estimated that the average child born to a female under the age of 19 receives assistance from the public sector amounting to $1,430 every year.Footnote 1 The aim of this paper is to use state-level panel data from the US to examine the impact on teen births in relation to a federal government-sponsored State Abstinence Education (SAE) program that promotes the importance and consequences of abstaining from premarital sex. Several studies have used state-level data to estimate pregnancy, births or abortions as a function of a set of determinants such as abstinence, abortion laws or some forms of sex education. For instance, the results of Levine (2003) provide strong support for an impact of parental-consent abortion laws on teen pregnancy rates, but no impact on births. Kearney and Levine (2009) find a decline in births when cheaper family planning services are made available to higher-income women. However, Paton (2002) finds no evidence that greater access to family planning services helps in reducing underage births or abortions. Many previous studies investigating the effects of various public policy interventions have relied on randomized-control trials (RCTs). Randomized experiments have a superior advantage in terms of their internal validity, which other methods such as difference-in-differences do not readily provide. If successful random assignment to control and treatment groups are undertaken, RCTs can provide accurate and useful information on observable differences that are attributable to intervention and not to confounding influences. However, controlled experiments lack external validity. These experiments tend to focus on a specific population with particular characteristics in a controlled environment and for this reason, the results cannot be readily generalized to other settings. Furthermore, a challenge for controlled designs is the potential for the control group, especially in the case of teens, to change its behavior in rather unexpected ways (Kirby et al. 1994) or for the treatment group to refuse program intervention. Although a large number of RCTs have been conducted to analyze the impact of abstinence education, population-level studies that use state-level panel data are absent. Despite the preponderance of individual-level studies, because of the shortcomings identified above, there is the possibility for the results of these studies to be overestimated and the external validity could be brought into question. This state-level analysis is designed to address the lack of external validity and to complement the work done in previous studies. Using state-level panel data, I present evidence that SAE programs supported by the federal Title V, Section 510 grants have led to a statistically significant decline in teen birth rates. I use difference-in-differences analysis where teens 15–17 years are the group targeted for the program, while 25–29 year-olds are used as the control group. The findings are robust to various model specifications, as well as to various control groups. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents background information on recent trends in teen birth rates in the US, institutional details on the Title V SAE program, analytical framework and a literature review of studies related to this research. In Sect. 3, I describe the data used in the analysis, while Sect. 4 describes the empirical strategy. The results of my findings are provided in Sect. 5, which is followed by sensitivity analyses in Sect. 6. Section 7 addresses some caveats to the research, as well as discusses some policy issues.

However, there seems to be agreement amongst social scientists that more committed couples tend to choose marriage as a contractual arrangement. At the same time, marriage ensures a certain level of commitment from the couple involved and longer-term relationships than simple cohabitation (Waite 1995), possibly by imposing costs on exit (Goldscheider and Kaufman 1996). At the same time, a more committed relationship, or a longer-lasting one, is likely to facilitate childbearing and, as a result, increase couples’ fertility (Grossbard-Shechtman and Lemennicier 1999). It is then possible to argue that the stability of marriage is one of the forces behind the fact that married women tend to have higher fertility than informally cohabiting ones. If the correlation between marriage and fertility is related to the fact that marriage is useful as a commitment device, then the introduction of alternative legal arrangements formalizing cohabitation can also be related to fertility decisions. This paper will explore to what extent the introduction of a less restrictive contract than marriage for union formalization is related to fertility. Specifically, the paper will focus on a new type of contract introduced in France in 1999, the Civil Covenant of Solidarity (Pacte Civil de Solidarité, PACS). PACS was introduced in France as a response to pressures from homosexual groups, and not from increasing demand for alternatives to formalize cohabitation from heterosexual couples. Finding a link between its introduction and changes in fertility would imply an unforeseen effect of a law of this kind, not derived from demand for legal cohabitation arrangements. The motivation for this study goes beyond the specifics of the French case. Academic and policy debate about family change in developed countries is centered around fertility and marital or partnership status. The emphasis on the subdivisions of these topics varies by countries. In the USA and Great Britain, single motherhood is an important political and academic issue of discussion, whereas in France, fertility and divorce occupy a central point of attention (Martin and Théry 2001). In general, a traditional view of the family has been disrupted in the last decades in developed countries. Families have fewer children, and more couples do not marry and have children out of wedlock. This paper aims to find a link between these two topics, and the extent to which policies affecting one of them, marital and partnership status, might affect the other, fertility. In 1999, the French government instituted the Civil Covenant of Solidarity (Pacte Civil de Solidarité, PACS). The law was mainly intended to provide a legal alternative for same-sex couples to formalize their cohabitation status under a legal contract, however, the law also allowed opposite-sex couples to sign a PACS. Surprisingly, the system was very well received by heterosexuals and, by the year 2006, more than ten percent of the new legal unions (marriages and PACS) formed in France were PACS. Theoretically, the impact on fertility of a contract of this kind is ambiguous. If PACS is a contractual arrangement that implies more commitment or ensures longer-lasting relationships than sole cohabitation, it can be related to increases in fertility. A cohabiting couple signing a PACS might increase its desired number of children in addition to sharing a household. However, as a less binding contract than marriage, in a context in which marriage is also an option for formalizing a union, the introduction of PACS could also have a negative effect on fertility rates. This depends on the extent to which couples that would marry in the absence of PACS prefer to sign the now-available less binding contract. Thus, measuring the impact of the introduction of PACS on total fertility is an empirical question that we address in this paper. This study might be useful to assess the potential effects of policies targeting legal partnerships in other countries, even when the increase of birth rates is not at the center of these policies. One case would be the introduction of domestic partnership in other European countries with low fertility rates, like Italy. Another case would be the introduction of Covenant Marriages in some states in the USA, or the extending practice of private firms of granting benefits to domestic partners (independently of the sex of the partners). This paper presents preliminary empirical evidence suggesting that PACS is related to the recent increases in fertility in France. The aggregate data on union formation, marriage and fertility showed in Fig. 1 can be useful at illustrating this. The figure graphs the Total Fertility Rate in France (births per 100 women), the total number of marriages, and the total number of legal unions (marriages plus PACS) signed between 1980 and 2006. While the relationship between these variables is not easy to interpret, given the complexity of the evolution of marriage and fertility rates over time, some key empirical facts are worth mentioning. First, before the introduction of PACS (1999), the number of marriages and fertility rates were strongly and positively correlated:Footnote 1 More marriages were accompanied by higher fertility. However, since the introduction of PACS, the relationship between these two variables has been much weaker. Surprisingly, if we define the number of legal unions as the sum of PACS and marriages, the relationship between legal unions and fertility continues to be as strong as that of fertility and marriage before the introduction of PACS. Number of Marriages, PACS and Fertility in France 1980–2006. Source: Insee Etat Civil, Minist¸ re de la Justice This phenomenon can be a result of the substitution between marriage and PACS, where women who are pregnant or want to have children may decide to sign a PACS instead of marrying their partners. However, fertility rates experienced a sharp increase since 1998, from 1.76 to 1.98 in 2006, while marriage rates only declined slightly during the same period, from 271.4 to 268.1 (in thousands). The fact that marriage rates have not abruptly declined since the introduction of PACS suggests little substitution between marriage and PACS. In the French context, PACS seems to be substituting cohabitation, and not marriage. To our knowledge, no studies have attempted to relate the introduction of PACS to changes in fertility. In order to explore the relationship between PACS and fertility, this paper will utilize the variation in the adoption of PACS across French departments. We sort departments by their adoption of PACS and compare birth rate trends before and after 1999. We show in the empirical analysis in Section 4 that birth rate trends before the introduction of PACS do not vary significantly between departments with different intensities of PACS adoption; however, after 1999 the increases in birth rates are concentrated in the regions with highest rates of pacsed
Footnote 2 women. This suggests the presence of a break in fertility trends around the date of PACS introduction, observed mainly for departments where more PACS were signed. The paper is presented as follows. Section 2 will briefly discuss the motivation for this study, stressing the importance of the fertility decrease in developed countries. It will also describe the context for the introduction of PACS in France and its main characteristics. Section 3 will explore in better detail the mechanisms through which the availability of cohabitation contracts can affect fertility decisions and will review some of the existing literature exploring the impact of marriage and divorce laws on fertility, and discuss the extent to which the introduction of PACS should be studied in a similar fashion. Section 4 describes the nature of the data used in this paper, the empirical strategy used to assess the relation between the introduction of PACS and fertility, and the results.

With respect to marriage,Footnote 1 Becker (1973) observed that “since marriage is practically always voluntary…persons marrying can be assumed to raise their utility level above what it would be were they to remain single.” However, incentives within marriage may not be aligned, allowing one spouse to increase his or her payoff at the other spouse’s expense. Furthermore, married spouses face a range of outside options other than perpetual cooperative behavior with their current spouses, and recent work is increasingly recognizing that the most relevant outside option is remarriage. Marriage markets today exhibit high and growing turnover. Chiappori and Weiss (2006) note that remarriage rates for young people have risen so far that they are equal to initial marriage rates. Consistent with these stylized facts, this paper is the first to propose an endogenous and fully stationary model of the marriage and remarriage market with infinite repetition. That is, upon divorce, spouses face a reiteration of the same problem that they initially faced (with possible evolution in the average quality of available partners). I model behavior within marriage using a public goods framework with the structure of a prisoner’s dilemma, similar to Lundberg and Pollak (1994) and Andaluz and Molina (2007). However, the cooperative payoff is random and partner-specific; some matches induce a higher cooperative payoff than others. In addition to choosing their within-marriage strategies, matched spouses also decide each period whether to stay married or to divorce and reenter the marriage market. I show that there are cooperative equilibria even allowing for this endogenous exit. I consider both a stationary model, where each match quality is drawn from the same distribution, and a dynamic model with persistent player-specific characteristics, allowing for the possibility of evolution in the quality of unmatched spouses. A surprising result is that ease of cooperation is nonmonotonic in players’ discount factors. Extremely impatient spouses are unlikely to enter into cooperative marriages because they overvalue short-term deviations from a cooperative equilibrium. At the same time, extremely patient spouses are also unlikely to enter into cooperative marriages since they face little discounting by waiting for a higher-quality match. In addition to this paper’s context in the marriage literature, the model is nested within a subset of the repeated games literature on games with endogenous exit. This paper does seem to be the first use of a model from this class in the context of a marriage market. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 presents the stationary model. Section 4 presents the dynamic model and comparative statics. Section 5 concludes and discusses extensions.",

Migration outcomes depend on the ability to cover important transaction costs such as transport or administrative expenses. Besides, the level of education may increase the likelihood of successful integration in urban or foreign job markets. On the one hand, a migrant’s relatives are often the main contributors to these expenditures. On the other hand, they also draw important benefits from migration, mainly by receiving remittances. The impact of remittances is larger than a simple distribution of migrant’s private gains. These funds allow poor households to overcome liquidity constraints (Lucas 1987; Stark 1991). They are thereby allowed to increase initially suboptimal investments in human capital (Edwards and Ureta 2003; Calero et al. 2009) or productive assets (Adams 1998). Moreover, remittances may help the recipients to cope with transitory shocks (de la Briere et al. 2002) or to afford health care expenditure (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2009). A migrant’s relatives are therefore expected to play a crucial role in migration decisions. While, in its beginnings, the economic literature on migration choices did not consider the involvement of the household of origin (Todaro 1969; Harris and Todaro 1970), it is now well established that a relevant representation of the decision-making process should include the parents (Stark and Levhari 1982; Stark 1991; Hoddinott 1994). However, how the parents’ wellbeing is introduced into the analysis and how their interaction with the prospective migrant affects the decision are not neutral. In particular, we argue that, due to the complexity of the parents-migrant interaction both before and after migration, a unitary model of the household is not appropriate. Moreover, we are convinced that even efficient bargaining (Hoddinott 1994), while clearly distinguishing between parents’ and migrants’ interests, fails to offer a complete understanding of the interaction between parents and migrants and its outcome. In particular, it ignores potential inefficiencies, which, in a context of market imperfections, is problematic. This paper develops a model of intra-household decision-making regarding investment in migration. Our aim is to show that the combination of liquidity constraints and imperfect commitment may be the source of rural households’ under-investment in migration. In the second part of the paper, we provide a set of comparative statics results and compare them with comparative statics of the first best migration decision rule, that is what a unitary model or an efficient bargaining model would have produced. The direct impact of a migrant’s liquidity constraint is mechanical and intuitive. If she is prevented from borrowing, transaction costs may not be affordable even if migration generates large private returns. However, if initial household wealth allows it, the parental contribution could relax the migrant’s constraint, provided this contribution is rewarded in the future, for instance through higher remittances. In this perspective, remittances can be seen as part of a long term migration contract with a loan component (Cox et al. 1998). However, it can reasonably be argued that repayment of the parental contribution by the migrant is subject to ex post moral hazard. The migration decision is (most of the time) one shot and the commitment issue is therefore severe. Nevertheless in this paper, two alternative assumptions are explored, either the loan is enforceable, or commitment is imperfect and therefore the loan is unenforceable. The former assumption serves as a benchmark. Under the latter assumption, we need to define the incentive compatible level of remittances. In other words, a motive for the migrant to remit has to be selected. Indeed, even if a loan is not enforceable per se, remittances are a widespread and huge phenomenon. Enforcement mechanisms therefore exist. Our main point is to show that, as soon as remittances are motivated by other considerations than a loan repayment, inefficiencies follow.
Footnote 1
 In the context of uncertainty, migration can serve the purpose of diversifying family income sources (Stark and Levhari 1982). Therefore, remittances may play the role of insurance transfers between the migrant and the parent (de la Briere et al. 2002). The insurance motive for remittances has desirable properties for this paper. First, mutual insurance creates an additional surplus compared to a migrant’s strictly private returns. This is a potential source of imperfect internalization since this surplus is not entirely captured by the migrant, nor by the parent. Second, as we show in the following section, the insurance motive is a potential source of divergence of interest over the characteristics of migration. Interacting this feature with imperfect commitment and credit constraints allows us to highlight important efficiency issues. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the general setting of the model and the insurance motive for remittances. Section 3 is devoted to the normative analysis of the household migration outcome. Several assumptions are explored, under binding liquidity constraints and with and without enforceable loan. In Sect. 4, we provide comparative statics with the aim of assessing the plausibility of the model and in Sect. 5, we conclude the paper.",4

In developed countries until only a few decades ago, and in many developing ones still today, cohabitation without marriage attracted social stigma and legal discrimination, not only on to the couple, but also on to their offspring. In some developed countries, married couples enjoy certain residual legal and fiscal advantages over unmarried ones. But why do couples marry in countries where there is no discrimination against unmarried couples, or in favour of legally married ones? A number of different explanations have been put forward in the economics literature. Grossbard-Shechtman (1982), Rowthorn (2002), and Chiappori and Oreffice (2008), view marriage as a selection device, that helps improve the ""match quality"" of the union. Scott (2002) and Wickelgren (2009) view it as a commitment device, that encourages the parties to make efficiency-enhancing, couple-specific investments after marriage. We also examine the commitment value of marriage, but focus on the efficiency-enhancing effects of division of labour between domestic (identified here with child raising) and income raising activities. Given that the person who specializes in the former will earn less than the one who specializes in the latter, neither party will agree to be the main childcarer without adequate compensation by the main earner. We show that, in the presence of credit rationing, an unmarried couple may not reach agreement on division of labour, because the prospective main earner cannot commit to compensate the prospective main childcarer at some future date, and may find it impossible or disadvantageous to carry out the compensation in full at front. If that is the case, the parties will not cooperate, and the resulting allocation will be inefficient. Otherwise, the parties will cooperate, but the allocation may still be inefficient (albeit less than without cooperation), because the marginal cost of compensating the main childcarer will rise faster than it would if the main earner could either borrow or postpone the payment. Marriage facilitates cooperation if the main childcarer can credibly threaten divorce, because it will then be in the main earner’s interest to compensate the former. This is the sense in which marriage may serve as a commitment device in the present context. Our approach allows us to relate the commitment argument to the matrimonial property regime,
Footnote 1 and to the cost of obtaining a divorce. Section 2 of the present paper sets out and justifies the underlying assumptions. Section 3 characterizes an efficient allocation of domestic resources. Sections 4 examines the choice of game and the properties of the ensuing equilibrium in the absence of the marriage institution. Section 5 does the same in the presence of the marriage institution, and examines the decision to marry. Section 6 discusses the results in light of the evidence and draws some policy conclusions.",33

When deciding whether or not to cook a meal at home, one must consider not only the cost of the ingredients used to prepare the meal, but also the time it takes to prepare the meal, serve it, as well as clean up afterwards. Since time is scarce and costly, it is important to account for the time cost of food preparation in addition to the direct cost of ingredients in the context of nutritional assistance program policy. During the fiscal year 2010, over 40 million people in the United States received benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program each month (United States Department of Agriculture 2010). The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides assistance to low-income families so they can purchase sufficient food which they might otherwise not be able to afford. Benefits received from the program are commonly referred to as “food stamps”; they allow the recipient to purchase food at grocery stores, produce markets, and other stores using a debit card system that electronically deducts money spent on groceries from the recipient’s monthly allotment. Food stamps may not be used to purchase prepared meals in the market or non-food items also available at grocery stores.Footnote 1 Therefore, when using food stamps, the recipient must necessarily incur a time cost of preparing the food at home. If a one dollar benefit is used to buy a one dollar cheeseburger at a fast food restaurant, then (excluding transportation costs, tipping, etc) the total benefit will be one dollar. If, however, one dollar’s worth of ingredients to be prepared at home are purchased at a grocery store, then the total benefit is one dollar minus the time cost of transforming the ingredients into a meal and cleaning up afterwards. The method of how the monthly food stamp allotments are determined as well as the general design of the SNAP have been criticized. Recently, the failure of the program to account for the time cost of food preparation has drawn much research interest. Specifically, the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP), which is the basis for determining food stamp allotments, has been criticized for being outdated. For example, Rose (2007) finds that the assumption that meals are prepared using only raw ingredients purchased using food stamps contradicts current US welfare policy. The excessive cooking time required by recipes of the TFP to prepare all meals from scratch discourages labor force participation of low income individuals, which is a disincentive not previously discussed in critiques of the US Welfare system (Moffitt 1992). Davis and You (2010) determined that the Thrifty Food Plan is unrealistic and ‘not so thrifty’ after all when labor costs are considered. They find that it is extremely difficult to adhere to the nutritional guidelines for preparing healthful meals, given the framework that the design of the food stamp program provides.Footnote 2 Davis and You (2009) estimated the time cost of food preparation for “typical” food stamp recipients and found that they incur a much larger share of time costs than typical non-recipients. However, these papers do not investigate the issue using data on actual food stamp recipiency status or actual food expenditures, instead conclusions about the food stamp program are drawn by examining “typical” participants as determined by individuals’ demographic characteristics and by computing food expenditures from national averages.Footnote 3 Yet, generalizing results obtained from all lower income household to the narrow question of nutritional assistance program efficacy might be dangerous. For example, the details of individual SNAP eligibility are not observed in their data, and non-participation due to the effect of stigma associated with receiving welfare (Moffitt 1983) cannot be captured in the models used. The critique of the Thrifty Food Plan in this literature is based on the idea that an individual who receives food stamps is not able to take advantage of the full benefit of the program because time costs are not considered. For example, in terms of direct cost of buying a can of pinto beans is more expensive than purchasing dehydrated beans. Due to the nature of the TFP, however, individuals receiving food stamps are required to purchase the cheaper dehydrated beans in order to meet the budget constraints imposed on them by the program. After considering the time that it takes to sort, rinse, soak, and boil the dehydrated beans, the total cost of the beans (i.e. ingredient costs plus time costs) exceeds the total cost of the pinto beans to a person who was able to simply purchase the can of precooked beans. Since Vickery (1977) it has been clear that the time dimension is very important in poverty issues. More recent research suggests that this is still true. For example, Aguiar and Hurst (2007) have found that home production has decreased in the United States in the last five decades, while leisure time has increased. However, they also note that inequality in terms of leisure has increased substantially over the same time period and suggest that wages and consumption by themselves do not adequately represent the welfare of individuals. Meyer and Sullivan (2008) studied, among other things, changes in time use of single mother headed families following the welfare reform of the 1990s. They found that time spent doing housework and food production fell sharply to accommodate for more time spent working in the market. While these results pertain to the general lower income population, these findings still underscore the importance of taking a closer look at the time cost of food preparation in the context of nutrition assistance programs. I contribute to the literature by estimating the time cost and total cost of food-at-home for food stamp recipients as well as non-recipients using a structural model of individuals’ time allocation decisions. By making use of a new data set, I am able to estimate the time cost of food preparation as well as the total cost of food that is prepared at home as the sum of ingredient costs and time costs for actual food stamp recipients. Using data on actual grocery expenditures of the individuals in my sample, I calculate the proportion of time cost in relation to total cost of food at home for food stamp recipients and non-recipients. This allows an insight into the extent of the difference in time cost of food preparation between the two subgroups. The following section develops the model used to estimate the shadow wage of household work. Section 3 provides an overview of the data used in this study. Section 4 presents the estimation and Section 5 discusses the results. Section 6 concludes.",11

(Lundberg 2005, p. 353) Whether parents treat sons and daughters differently and, if so, why, have long been questions of interest to sociologists and psychologists. There is also a vast empirical literature in economics on different treatment of sons and daughters in developing countries. As Lundberg (2005a) notes these differences can be explained by parental preferences; the source of these could be institutional. If sons and daughters are assigned very different roles in these societies, then parents may prefer sons to daughters if they think the former would have better opportunities. These different roles may also put sons in a better position to provide for elderly parents, and hence parents’ preference for sons could also arise out of their selfish concern to be better cared for when old. More recently, however, several empirical studies have found inequalities in inputs even in developed countries, using data mostly from the US: fathers spend more time with sons than with daughters (Price 2008); parents spend more time overall with sons than with daughters and mothers devote roughly equal time to sons and daughters (Lundberg 2005b);
Footnote 1 and parents invest more in sons than daughters (Behrman et al. 1986;  Lundberg and Rose 2004). Moreover, family size and composition can vary with the sex of the first-born: married parents of boys are less likely than parents of girls to become divorced or separated, and the number of children is significantly higher in families with a first-born girl (Dahl and Moretti 2008).
Footnote 2
 Lundberg (2005a) summarizes empirical studies analyzing different investments in sons and daughters and notes that these observed differences can arise as a result of preferences for sons—on the part of fathers, or both parents—or from actual or perceived technological differences in childcare depending on the sex of the child. In this paper we examine the implications for parental time with children and expenditure on children’s consumption goods in a theoretical model of household decision making when the technology for producing child quality differs for sons and daughters. Theoretical models of household decision-making have focused on specialization of spouses and very often assumed or derived complete specialization of one spouse in household production and child rearing. Pollak (2007) argues that the coincidence of efficiency and complete specialization within a household relies heavily on special assumptions about the available production technologies: in particular, non-decreasing returns to scale and/or no ""process preferences"". We start with a model of child rearing with three inputs: the time of each parent and a consumption good. We assume the child quality function is separable in the consumption good and quality time; the latter is a function of both parents’ time. The time inputs of the mother and the father are not perfect substitutes in the production function for child quality due to diminishing marginal productivity of each parent’s time. We further assume that the parent of the same sex as the child is at least as productive in raising this child as is the opposite-sex parent,
Footnote 3 and that market wages for men are at least as high as women’s market wages. Parents care only about child quality and are unbiased in their preferences for boys and girls. Within this framework we investigate the time allocations chosen by parents of sons and daughters, asking when girls receive less paternal input than boys, and if this puts girls at a disadvantage. The answer is, in general, no, so long as children are normal goods. Although girls may receive less paternal time and perhaps less overall parental time and consumption goods, their child quality is higher than that of boys when comparing households with the same distribution of initial wage rates. This is because it is cheaper to produce child quality of girls than of boys whenever the wage rate of the mother is lower than the wage rate of the father. We apply this model to explain important empirical findings in the final section of the paper. We take as given the existence of a same-sex advantage in parental childcare, and believe that there are many sources for this. At a very pragmatic level, while family washrooms and change rooms are becoming more commonplace in public spaces, in most places the only choice is male or female. After a certain age (5 or 6  years) it becomes difficult to take an opposite-sex child into a public washroom, but parents may be uncomfortable waiting outside for their child. Many activities and sports teams for children are single sex, and direct parental involvement in the child’s activity may be limited to the same-sex parent: fund-raising and phone trees may be neutral, but coaching and travel companions may not. Girl Guides advertises itself explicitly as an organization ""for girls and women"",
Footnote 4 whereas Messner and Bozada-Deas (2009) provide evidence that, when it comes to youth sporting activities, mothers are more likely to be ""team moms"" and fathers are more often involved in coaching—especially during games.
Footnote 5
 Another source of the sex-specific production function is societal norms governing gender roles. Children often accept their gender roles early and as boys and girls engage in different games parents may feel a bit embarrassed when engaging in games that are contrary to their gender expectations. Similar discomfort may arise when reading stories of a particular type or watching movies with the children and then discussing the content. Hence sex-specific production functions could be the result of parents’ gender (or sex) specific accumulation of human capital.
Footnote 6 A recent controversy in Sweden shows the tension between creating a culture of diversity in gender roles and companies catering to families who seem to be either blase about or actively embracing traditional gender stereotypes. In 2009, Landes (2009) reports that Reklamombudsmannen, a self-regulatory agency which polices marketing and advertising communications in Sweden, reprimanded Toys ‘R’ Us because in its catalogue the company “portrays children’s games and choice of toys in a narrow-minded way, and this exclusion of boys and girls from different types of toys is, in itself, degrading to both genders.” Another controversy arose in the US about Shiloh Jolie-Pitt’s haircut and dressing style with tabloids suggesting that little girls need to learn how women look by being dressed accordingly.
Footnote 7
 If parents behave as if there is a same-sex advantage, but in fact no such advantage exists, the implications for child quality are different from the results presented above. There is no change in how parents behave from the model in which a same-sex advantage actually exists, but when measuring child quality objectively rather than how it is perceived by the parents, boys may end up with a higher quality than girls. We discuss in the concluding section how different perceptions of the degree of same-sex advantage across countries can explain differences in the estimated probabilities of parents having another child after having two girls. Whether the same-sex advantage is real or imagined, the policy implications are the same: policies that reduce the opposite-sex disadvantage increase the welfare of children and parents. In Sect. 2 we lay out our basic model. We first consider a family’s utility maximization problem. Since cost minimization of quality time is necessary for utility maximization in our model, we derive the conditions for utility maximization from the ground up beginning with this first level. In Sect. 3 we compare the cost-minimizing combinations of maternal and paternal childcare for boys and girls, focussing on the relative inputs of the parents, and compare the costs of these bundles. We cast this discussion in terms of isoquants and isocost lines, and comparative advantage, providing a simple intuition for our results. We then turn to a comparison of the total parental time devoted to sons and daughters. In Sect. 4, we discuss the choice of the best combination of time and goods to produce a given child quality, and revisit the utility maximization problem. Section 5 concludes.",13

The use of contraception, abortion choices, and the timing of sexual initiation and participation decisions are not immune to the systematic influence of economic variables (Posner 1992; Akerlof et al. 1996). Infidelity, however, is a dimension of sexual behavior that somewhat resists a persuasive economic explanation and has only attracted occasional interest among economists. The pioneering contribution is that of Fair (1978) who modeled extramarital affairs within a household time allocation framework. Assuming an affair is a normal commodity, his principal prediction is that the effect of wages on marital cheating is ambiguous, depending on the relative magnitudes of the income and substitution effects of a change in the price of time. In the absence of wage rate data, Fair’s empirical investigation proxied time costs using variables on occupation and education, assuming both are positively correlated with the missing wage. The estimates produced conflicting signs for these variables, positive for occupation and negative for education, which could not be readily explained by the time allocation model except in terms of their possible inadequacies as proxies. Subsequent studies and replications have not attempted to resolve the puzzle. Indeed, the anomaly is reinforced by the fact that the negative partial correlation between infidelity and schooling also conflicts with the prediction derived from the literature in evolutionary biology (Elmslie and Tebaldi 2008). In the econometric analysis that follows, we show that Fair’s results are not simply an artifact of his selected magazine samples or the way his variables are measured. Similar results for occupation and schooling emerge using German, British and American nationally representative survey data with alternative variable definitions and specifications. The challenge is to explain these empirical regularities. To do so, this paper pursues one of the alternative modeling strategies suggested by Fair, namely, treating infidelity as an illicit act subject to sanctions if detected, a theoretical approach also adopted by Liu (2008) using a dynamic optimization model.Footnote 1 This strategy is appealing given that sexual cheating is intentional and hidden, causes harm to third parties and may incur punishment costs if detected by a wronged spouse. Historically extramarital affairs were treated as a criminal offence in many jurisdictions (Rasmusen 2002). But even in the absence of public prosecution and legal sanction in most countries today, adultery is still widely considered an undesirable act that incurs social opprobrium. In the British NATSAL survey used below of a relatively young cohort aged 18–44, 85 % of respondents expressed the opinion that extramarital sex is always or mostly wrong. Sexual exclusivity within committed partnerships then remains the dominant social expectation even among younger sexually permissive generations. Nevertheless, despite the strength of the fidelity social norm, there is in practice significant deviation from this ideal. In the eleven waves of the US General Social Survey that ask an infidelity question, 23.5 % of male respondents and 14.6 % of women report having engaged in extramarital sex during their lifetime. Modeling infidelity as an illegitimate activity allows occupation and education to have differently signed effects. The key innovation is to treat occupation as an indicator of an individual’s quality as a sexual partner, providing a measure of the benefits from an extramarital liaison. While not exhaustive of the factors that contribute to sexual desirability, it is clear that occupation is positively correlated with various socioeconomic considerations that matter in the (extradyadic) mating market. By contrast, the association of education with infidelity is ambiguous. While schooling augments social and communication skills that raise the gains from an affair, it also increases the weight placed on the expected costs of marital cheating. Insofar as education reduces the discounting of future costs this provides one channel through which schooling diminishes the demand for infidelity all else equal. A further novel contribution of the paper disaggregates extramarital relationships into different types according to their degree of regularity. This allows occupation and schooling to be differentially related to the demand for casual and repeated liaisons. In particular, we find that quality has a stronger association with more regular extramarital relations while, holding quality fixed, the negative effect of schooling is greater for casual encounters. Infidelity matters. It is not a purely private affair without public consequences. Insofar as marriages would have remained stable in the absence of cheating, this behavior is of social concern given the potentially adverse economic and nonpecuniary impacts of separation and household dissolution on children and other family members. Indeed, extramarital affairs play a leading role in the destabilization of marriages and non-marital partnerships with non-negligible harm to third parties, especially children. In the British NATSAL 2000 data used below, 37 % of respondents who had experienced the failure of their first live-in partnership identified infidelity as a contributing factor. However, its occurrence may also be a symptom as well as a cause of marital disintegration. As Cox (2008) notes, in some cases infidelity is a strategy for establishing a new match given that the existing marital relationship has failed and will dissolve independently of whether an affair occurs, though the timing may well be affected. In that instance, infidelity may not itself be economically significant in generating external costs. Nevertheless, in most countries adultery remains the most frequently cited fault ground for the dissolution of marital relationships. Even for those couples whose relationship survives the disclosure of an affair, the gains from the marriage may be diminished by this negative shock given that infidelity is a cause as well as a consequence of marital dissatisfaction. In addition, extramarital sex has potential health impacts as one of the main sources of the transmission of sexual diseases among heterosexuals, especially in developing countries. Finally it should be noted that undetected female adultery is a form of moral hazard for a male spouse since it potentially leads to cuckoldry, the involuntary investment of resources in a genetically unrelated child.",10

Some, but not all, research finds that children who grow up in non-traditional families fare worse than those who grow up with both biological parents, even after controlling for household resources and/or selection (e.g., Painter and Levine 2000 vs. Lang and Zagorsky 2001; see Ribar 2004). Often due to data limitations, most of this research is ‘compartmentalized’ in that it focuses on a limited set of family structures, by omitting or aggregating the less common forms, and a small range of child outcomes. Our goal here is to examine, in a systematic way and using one comprehensive dataset, an extensive range of family structures across a wide spectrum of child outcomes. In this way, we can learn what simplifications and assumptions are supported by the data and which nuances deserve closer attention. We construct a classification of family structures (i.e., ‘high definition’), shown in Fig. 1, that lends itself to comparisons and tests of aggregation. Such testing allows us to explore the associations across nontraditional families of (1) parental gender (e.g., living with a single mother versus a single father), (2) the presence of another adult (e.g., married vs. cohabiting vs. absent), and (3) living with a grandparent as opposed to some other non-parental arrangement. Separate analyses are undertaken for younger (ages 6–11) and older (ages 12–17) children. We further explore the role of child’s gender and race. Our classification facilitates broader tests, such as whether all ‘blended families’ or all ‘cohabiting families’ appear equivalent. These tests provide guidance as to what simplifications to Fig. 1 are supported empirically. Our analyses also provide new evidence for two little-studied but increasingly common family structures—single father and grandparent-headed families. Classification of family structures (N = number of observations in the NSAF 1999 and 2002 sample) Our study is also one of a very few to consider behavioral, educational and physical health outcomes (i.e., ‘wide angle’) within the same empirical study.Footnote 1 Most studies investigate the role of family structure on one aspect of children outcomes, such as educational achievement and/or labor force attachment, emotional/behavior problems, or outcomes such as early childbearing and marriage for adolescents or adults (e.g., Wojtkiewicz 1993; McLanahan and Sandefur 1994; Lang and Zagorsky 2001; Ginther and Pollak 2004). Physical health outcomes are typically considered separately and have received much less attention (Mauldon 1990; Harknett 2009; Bzostek and Beck 2010). Instead, most have studied the effects of income and parental characteristics and behaviors on child outcomes (e.g., Case and Paxson 2002; Case et al. 2005) or have focused on the determinants of access and utilization of health care (Case and Paxson 2001; Heck and Parker 2002; Gorman and Braverman 2008; Leininger and Ziol-Guest 2008). We also investigate the role played by both broad and outcome-specific household inputs. Exploring the role that (biological and step) parent gender plays in providing health-related and other inputs sheds new light on the stepmother findings of Case and Paxson (2001). Our high definition, wide angle approach therefore requires a dataset that has (1) a reasonable number of observations for less common family structures, and (2) information on a wide array of child outcomes and related inputs, as well as important child and household characteristics. The National Survey of American Families (NSAF) satisfies these requirements. Its large sample facilitates studying two uncommon but growing family structures that have received relatively little attention in child outcomes research—single fathers (e.g., Brown 2000; Biblarz and Stacey 2010) and grandparent-headed households (e.g., Casper and Bryson 1998; Simmons and Dye 2003); for example, the 1999 and 2002 surveys combine to provide 1,049 grandparent-headed households and 1,554 single father households, plus an additional 215 households in the relatively rare case in which a cohabiting (non-married) stepmother is also present (Fig. 1). These relatively large numbers make it possible to investigate differences across child age, gender or race/ethnicity and to explore issues such as gender-based bias in reporting outcomes and a further subdivision of ‘non-parent’ families. The NSAF is a repeated cross-section with no family histories, making it difficult to draw causal inferences and impossible to study the effects of the timing or duration of living arrangements.Footnote 2 Rather, our analyses are a ‘snapshot’ as they focus on the relationships between child outcomes and family structure at a single point in time. Our main focus is to compare across different types of non-traditional families, so the spurious correlations and selection processes at work may be different and are largely unstudied. Studying so many family structures makes dealing with the possible endogeneity via econometric methods available to cross-sectional data (e.g., matching methods, instrumental variables, bounds analyses; see Ribar 2004) impractical. While we explore further the relationships and key differences uncovered and discuss their likely sources, we do not ascribe a specific explanation. Instead, our goal here is to highlight interesting differences that appear and simplifying assumptions that are supported and, in so doing, provide guidance for future research. Our results reveal the strong role of the biological parent’s gender in nontraditional families, especially for health inputs and outcomes, and the somewhat surprising similarity between different types of non-parent families.",17

Demand systems most widely used for estimating food demand are originally developed for industrialized countries, and are reasonably based on the assumption that price and income are exogenous to food demand. However, these assumptions proved to be unrealistic for the case of low-income countries where peasant households are typically both producers and consumers of food items. Hence, agricultural household models (AHM) have been developed by agricultural economists, beginning in late 1970s, to deal with the endogeneity of household budget to food production and consumption, and to gain insights about the behavior of producer–consumer rural households. The initial goal of this line of scholarship was to develop an understanding of these households’ production and consumption responses to agricultural price policy, since policy makers in developing countries with large peasant populations had been frustrated with the peasantry’s apparent unresponsiveness to price incentives or opportunities to modernize (de Janvry et al. 1991). Since then, the AHM models have been extended to tackle a number of issues, ranging from deforestation to migration (Taylor and Adelman (2003) present an excellent review of the literature). Nevertheless, demand system equations that have been initially developed for industrialized countries are still being regularly used for estimating food demand in middle income countries like Turkey. This strategy is somewhat valid, as these countries might have majority urban populations who are price takers as consumers of food. But middle income countries typically host substantial peasant sectors as well. Hence, I question the indiscriminate application of the above-mentioned models in the analyses of middle income countries. More specifically, I aim to contribute to the existing literature by first developing a formal procedure to test if households are mere price takers, and then to test if estimated price and expenditure elasticities differ significantly after food consumption from home produce (self-produced food hereafter) is taken into account. To my knowledge, this study is the first of its kind, as it incorporates AHM’s insights to the analysis of country-level data sets in estimating price and expenditure elasticities. In this paper the empirical focus is on Turkey as an example of middle income country with a majority of urban populations combined with significant proportions of self-produced food in rural areas [among EU member states, Bulgaria and Romania, similar to Turkey, also have substantial semi-subsistence farmers (Davidova et al. 2009)]. Recent household food consumption and food demand studies pertaining to Turkey (Akbay et al. 2007; Sengul and Tuncer 2005) implicitly assume that households behave as mere price takers in food consumption. Using the 2003 household budget survey data for Turkey, however, I demonstrate that self-produced food accounts for almost 19% of the calorie intake for rural households (Sect. 4). This finding suggests that own-production is a significant source of food supply for rural households in Turkey and hence should not be assumed away. Against this backdrop, I test if the share of self-produced food in total food budget affects food consumption decisions of rural households in Turkey. I find that it does, and thus conclude that the implicit assumption of separate food consumption and production decisions is untenable in the case of Turkey. Consequently, I argue that the aforementioned studies of price and expenditure elasticities, which do not take food production’s effect on consumption into account, are mis-specified. I then re-estimate price and expenditure elasticities by utilizing a model that incorporates the share of self-produced food as well as interaction terms of self-produced food with food expenditure and prices. I find, in particular, that food expenditure (for dairy products and eggs) and price (for bread and cereals) elasticities for rural households in Turkey are significantly over-estimated when consumption from home produce is ignored. Given that dairy, egg and cereals are the items most heavily self-produced, my results resonate with the previous theoretical work and simulation exercises of de Janvry et al. (1991) and Taylor and Adelman (2003), which predict that models assuming rural households as price takers will over-estimate income and price elasticities. In the rest of the paper, I first review the literature on AHM, with particular attention to separable and nonseparable household models. Next, I develop a procedure to test for the implicit assumption of separation, since constructing a proper AHM is not possible with the dataset I employ. I then re-estimate price and food expenditure elasticities by accounting for self-produced food consumption by the majority of rural households. In Sect. 3, I flesh out the empirical model used for estimation. Section 4 presents data on food consumption with a special emphasis on self-produced food. Section 5 presents the econometric findings. Section 6 concludes the paper.",11

Child labor and schooling are conflicting alternatives, although they are not exclusive and can often be combined to some extent. Work performed by children reduces the time spent in school,
Footnote 1 as well as their educational attainment (Beegle et al. 2006; Heady 2003).Footnote 2 Models that consider work and schooling decisions in a joint framework can help to better understand their interrelationship and the factors affecting the decision between work and schooling. But simple approaches might fail to explore the gender aspects of this trade-off to a full extent because of the large heterogeneity of work, and especially the differences between market and domestic work. Studies investigating the work-school trade-off in a joint framework take two approaches with respect to different forms of work, both of which pose some problems.
Footnote 3 Those that concentrate on market work only, leave domestic work out of the choice set altogether (e.g., Maitra and Ray 2002; Pal 2004; Bacolod and Ranjan 2008). This underestimates the extent of child labor since, world-wide, most children work for their families, often performing domestic chores (Edmonds and Pavcnik 2005). It also disregards the gender aspects of child labor as it is mainly girls who perform domestic work.
Footnote 4
 Most importantly, this procedure implicitly constrains the determinants of domestic work and idleness to be the same, which masks the underlying differences in the economic incentives for working in the household or staying idle.
Footnote 5
 The second approach followed by empirical studies is to treat market work and domestic chores jointly as opposed to school attendance (e.g., Ravallion and Wodon 2000; Ersado 2005; Cigno and Rosati, 2005; Chamarbagwala and Tchernis 2010). In countries with relatively large gender disparities, such as the South Asian countries, this captures relatively well the work-school trade-off for boys, but it disregards the inherent differences between girls’ domestic and market work by assuming that both are driven by the same determinants. In the presence of systematic differences between the determinants of market and domestic work as well as domestic work and idleness, it is more appropriate to address market work, domestic work, and schooling as separate alternatives. Simultaneous estimation of the choices between market and domestic work and school attendance can also help to investigate the determinants of inactivity, specialization in a specific activity, or combination of multiple activities. Such an approach is especially well suited to capture the gender differences in the determinants of household decisions on work and school. The North Indian case offers valuable insights into the gender aspects of the work-school trade-off since gender differences in work and schooling are especially large for children in this region. School attendance of girls is considerably lower, and it conflicts mostly with their domestic duties whereas most boys are involved in either school or market work. However, there is no total specialization by gender; a still considerable number of girls works for the market, while some boys are also performing domestic chores. This allows me to investigate the gender differences between the trade-off of the gender-specific activities with schooling, but also participation in the gender unspecific activity. The present analysis is based on cross-sectional data from the 1997/1998 Survey of Living Conditions of two North Indian states, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (World Bank LSMS). It estimates jointly participation of 10–17  years old children in market work, domestic work and schooling, separately for the two sexes. The regressions condition participation in work and schooling on individual characteristics, asset ownership, household composition and educational attainment, as well as village variables on costs of schooling, proxies for cultural norms, and median wages. The participation equations form a trivariate probit model which is estimated by the method of simulated maximum likelihood. Marginal effects on the joint probabilities of different occupational choices are calculated by a parametric bootstrap procedure. By incorporating schooling, market and domestic work as separate outcomes in a multivariate framework, a more detailed picture on the determinants of child labor emerges. The results show systematic differences between the determinants of market and domestic work as well as those of domestic work and idleness for both boys and girls. Such differences would be blurred when lumping market and domestic work together and could not be captured without including domestic work explicitly in the choice set. These insights are the main contribution of this study. Factors traditionally linked to child labor seem mainly to affect the decisions between the gender specific work activity (market work for boys and domestic work for girls) and schooling. Household wealth is increasing the likelihood that girls and boys attend school only, and decreasing the likelihood of specialization of girls in domestic and boys in market work, but the gender unspecific activities are less strongly related to wealth. Similarly, preferences for schooling captured by parental education reduce more strongly the likelihood of the gender specific work activity in favor of schooling. By contrast, factors that shift the monetary incentives towards work are most closely related to participation in market related activities and tend to affect girls and boys in a similar way: Higher adult wages in the village increase participation in market work of both sexes, higher monetary costs of schooling additionally to that reduce school participation of girls and boys. A third group of factors, mainly related to cultural norms, plays also an important role in explaining gender differences in child labor, and especially in participation in the gender non–specific work activities. Girls from lower castes are more likely to perform market work, upper caste boys are more likely to do domestic chores; this reflects that accepted gender roles differ among the different social strata. Animal ownership increases not only girls’ domestic but also market work: this might also be due to the fact that girls are usually less prohibited to work within the family than outside of the household by cultural norms. The norms with respect to the economic role of females, proxied by high adult female workforce participation in the village, are important determinants of gender differences also for children: a generally higher adult female labor force participation makes girls substitute market work for domestic work, while making it also more likely that boys perform domestic chores. These latter effects are thus gender specific and do not merely reflect overall higher economic activity. Due to computational difficulties, multivariate models have not been typically applied in the analysis of child labor. The only exception to this is the work of Kambhampati and Rajan (2008) who estimate a multivariate probit model for Indian girls, and conclude that country-wide differences in the work-schooling trade-off of female children are driven by differences in cultural norms within the patriarchal kinship systems. This study differs from their work in several aspects. It concentrates on children from two North Indian states, and compares the trade-off between market work, domestic work, and school attendance for both sexes. More importantly, it specifies the probabilities of participation in activities in a more direct way and computes marginal effects of the determinants on trivariate probabilities of specific activities and their combinations. As a result, the gender differences in the determinants of specializing in one given activity or combining various activities can also be explicitly addressed. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 shortly surveys the empirical evidence on child work and schooling in India. Section 3 describes the data, Sect. 4 outlines the estimation model. Results are presented and discussed in Sect. 5, while Sect. 6 concludes.",7

The precautionary motive for saving can be multi-faceted. In fact, a recent paper by Kennickell and Lusardi (2005) explored several sources of risk that generate a precautionary saving motive. This includes income risk, health risk, business risk and liquidity constraints. By using a subjective measure of desired precautionary savings derived from the 1995 and 1998 Survey of Consumer Finance as dependent variable, they showed that besides earnings risk, which is usually the focus of the empirical literature, most other sources of risk are also relevant. Precautionary saving is closely intertwined with opportunities for risk sharing. Some authors (see, for example, Devereux and Smith 1994) suggest that more risk sharing opportunities may translate into less saving, as there are better ways of dealing with the effects of uncertainty. The idea that marriage provides some sort of risk sharing among its members is well known. Ever since Becker’s contributions (Becker 1973, 1974), households economics has often highlighted the idea that marriage engenders risk sharing among a couple. The basic idea is that transfers between spouses help smooth out a certain amount of variability in individual income streams. It might even be conceivable, as in Chami and Hess (2005), that individuals also choose to marry in order to hedge against macroeconomic risks. A fairly large set of applied studies (most commonly using micro data) show that risk sharing does seem to occur within marriages (this is the case, for example, of the works by Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1985, 1994, 1989; Rosenzweig 1988, among the others). If marriage features, as a fundamental ingredient, a certain amount of trust and information, it may also help reduce problems of moral hazard, adverse selection, and deception (as underscored by Kotlikoff and Spivak 1981) thereby impacting insurance markets. Moreover, transaction costs in marriage may be lower than those associated with formal insurance and financial instruments. As an insurance instrument, therefore, marriage would be particularly efficient. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, most stylized models of saving do not explicitly account for life-changing events such as marriage and divorce, which may have sizeable and long-lasting implications on income and consumption patterns. For example, Lupton and Smith (2003) remark that “very little theoretical or empirical work has addressed this issue” (i.e. that of a link between marriage and saving). Also, as is shown in this paper, the consequences of the disruption of the family arrangement (i.e. the collapse of marriage), are far from clear from a consumption/saving standpoint. Even those few contributions who deal with this problem do not reach unambiguous (theoretical) conclusions, at least as far as the effects of divorce risk on saving are concerned (for some contrasting implications of divorce risk on saving, see Cubeddu and Ríos-Rull 1997, and Aura 2007). In fact, opposing forces may be at work: on the one hand, divorce is costly (legal fees, etc.), and leads to a potentially very large loss of economies of scale linked to marriage. This may be perceived as a negative shock, which might bring about an increase in precautionary saving. On the other hand, in the presence of divorce prospects saving becomes riskier, as the resulting assets must be split among the couple, leading to a decrease in saving; moreover, divorce, or the risk thereof, may also decrease the return to saving for the couple, in the presence of costs cutting into the net worth of the couple, or in the presence of remarriage, thus diminishing the incentives to save. Few contributions, to date, have made an attempt to empirically assess the effect of divorce risk upon consumption/saving choices, mostly using an indirect approach. For example, González and Özcan (2008) present indirect evidence about the impact of divorce risk upon saving in the household, by considering the legalization of divorce in Ireland in 1996 as an exogenous increase in the likelihood of marital dissolution. They do find a positive relationship, resorting to a difference in difference estimation (though, we believe, with some problems in properly defining the control and treatment groups). A remarkable contribution to this literature is the work by Pierce and Finke (2006). By identifying households that will divorce over a 5 year period in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1994–1999), they show that divorce prone households save significantly more than couples remaining married, in the years before the actual occurrence of divorce. More recently, Voena (2010) proposed a model to assess the impact of different property rights regimes among spouses over the accumulation of assets in the household and the supply of labor then tests the model by using US data. Interestingly, one of the indications of the paper is that when the probability of divorce increases and assets are equally split among spouses, men tend to increase savings (and asset accumulation), to offset the possible loss of half of their assets to wives if divorce comes about. Our paper explores the consequences of family dissolution risk onto consumption and (precautionary) saving, by using a very simple theoretical model, and by estimating an empirical model that explicitly combines an estimation of marital dissolution risk with one of consumption/saving. By doing so, we contribute to the rather thin body of literature dealing with a problem that has become increasingly important, as family instability has become more prevalent. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in paragraph 2 we propose a theoretical model describing consumption/savings choices for a married couple exposed to risk of marital dissolution; in paragraph 3 we report the results of our empirical analysis on a panel of Italian households. By means of a two-stage methodology, we find that the risk of divorce reduces nondurable consumption and generates precautionary savings, with an intensity depending on household income.",13

Family, historical and regional effects on students’ alcohol consumption and subjective normative thresholds",March 2013,Liam Delaney,Arie Kapteyn,James P. Smith,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper aims to shed light on determinants of drinking behavior and the formation of subjective thresholds of acceptable or normal drinking behavior. Even in a culture such as in Ireland, where drinking is relatively common, there exists a great deal of variation in actual drinking behavior. In our sample of college students at a prominent Irish University—University College Dublin (UCD)—5% of the students do not drink at all while one in seven consumes on average more than two drinks every day yearly, with most of that drinking concentrated on a few days per week of very heavy drinking. For example, 8% of students drink 10 or more drinks on the occasions that they consume alcohol while one in five drink 7–9 drinks when they consume alcohol. Heavy student drinking is common in other countries as well. The percent of both male and female students engaged in weekly binge drinking increased steadily in the UK for the 18–24 age group over the 10 year period from 1988 to 1998 (Egginton et al. 2002) and 28% of UK students engaged in binge drinking (Webb et al. 1996). The comparable number for binge drinking in the United States was 22.8% (Wechsler et al. 2002). Our goal in this paper is not to explain the extent of drinking in Ireland relative to other countries, but rather why some Irish students drink so much more than other Irish students do. Our understanding of what influences the large variation in drinking behavior, even amongst a relatively homogenous sub-group of the Irish population such as university students, is quite incomplete. This raises a larger issue of the extent to which drinking of parents and older siblings shaped their attitudes toward and the actual behavior of drinking. In this paper, we are interested, in particular, in estimating the transmission of drinking behaviors within the family, but we also examine other more distant aspects of history that formed relevant dimensions of the environment in which these students grew up. These historical factors will include the role of English Culture, the Catholic Church, the Brewery industry, licensing laws, and the weather, all of which vary considerably across the places where students grew up. Our data allow us to estimate a very rich specification of the contemporaneous and historical factors influencing alcohol consumption. Drinking patterns of students’ family, neighborhood, and secondary schools can not only affect the amount of drinking of students, but it may also alter their subjective assessments of what constitutes ‘problem’ drinking as well. We test this possibility in this paper, and find that this is an important transmission pathway of drinking behaviors of one generation within a family to the next. A growing body of literature is pointing to the importance of subjective thresholds of normalcy of behavior in propagating population patterns of risk behavior. For example, Christakis and Fowler (2007) argue that there exist contagion effects in the spread of obesity across social networks, a finding they explain by changes in the relative normality of obesity among affected populations. Little work has been conducted examining in detail the origin of subjective appraisals of the normality of different behaviors and health states. Our study provides one of the most detailed accounts to date of how thresholds for normality of behavior are predicted by family, schooling and cultural/historical context. The data in this paper come from a survey we designed of alcohol behaviors among students at a major university in Ireland as well as regional and school data. Besides a standard set of demographic variables, this survey gathered data on actual drinking behavior of these Irish college students along with vignette based assessments of their subjective attitudes toward drinking by themselves and by hypothetical other persons. We also obtained information about drinking of their parents and siblings. By recording information about the town that they lived in at age ten and the secondary school they attended, we can also construct measures of drinking behaviors they observed as children and adolescents that extend beyond that of their immediate family members. The rest of this paper is divided into four sections. Section 2 explains the data utilized and measures employed in the study. Section 3 presents models of student drinking behaviors that we test documenting the relative influence of parental and sibling alcohol consumption and of pre-college environments on drinking patterns of the students. Section 4 summarizes estimates we obtained of the origins of the students’ subjective attitudes toward their own drinking. The final section highlights the main conclusions.",5

More recently, research is also concentrating on the effect of education on non-market outcomes like health (see Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2008; Grossman 2006 for overviews). Furthermore, researchers point to intergenerational spillover effects of education (Black and Devereux 2011; Currie 2009 provide overviews). Quantifying such intergenerational links is not only relevant regarding optimal investments into education, but also relates to social mobility. The more that a child’s outcomes are determined by its parents’ education, the less that a society can be considered to be socially mobile. Our paper investigates the effects of maternal education on child’s health and health behavior in Germany. We consider both the effects on newborns and adolescents. Therefore, we look at various outcome variables: physical health, smoking behavior, overweight, and doing sports for adolescents; low birth weight and preterm birth for newborns. We apply an instrumental variables (IV) approach that has not yet been used in the intergenerational context. We instrument maternal education by the number of her siblings while conditioning on characteristics of her parents, the child’s grandparents. For this purpose, we draw on a rich household survey, the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), containing detailed information about three generations. We argue that, given the grandparents’ characteristics, the number of the mother’s siblings generates variation in maternal years of education that is exogenous regarding her child’s health and health behavior. If grandparents are constrained in borrowing against the mother’s future earnings, the number of her siblings affects household resources available for her educational investments. Previous studies on the effects of parental education on child’s health and health behavior in developed countries produced mixed evidence (see Table 1). Currie and Moretti (2003) find maternal education reduces the risks of low birth weight and preterm birth. This finding is not corroborated by the IV-study of McCrary and Royer (2011). For teenage children, Carneiro et al. (2007) as well as Lindeboom et al. (2009) find no significant effects of parental education on the children’s health status in their IV-analyses. Other studies for Germany analyze the intergenerational correlation of health (Coneus and Spiess 2012), as well as the correlation between parental education and child health (Lamerz et al. 2005). We add to the literature by applying an IV strategy that works for the sample size of common household panels, by considering a variety of outcomes for both newborns and adolescents, and by investigating possible channels of the estimated effects. We focus only on mothers because the SOEP basically reports on the partner of the mother and not on the biological father. For newborns, we find maternal education to be associated with a reduced probability of preterm maturity. Our IV approach, however, does not indicate significant effects on newborns. For adolescents, we find strong and significant effects on health-related behavior for daughters. An additional year of maternal education is estimated to reduce the daughter’s probability of smoking by 7.4 percentage points and to increase the daughter’s likelihood of doing sports at least once a week by 7.5 percentage points. We do not obtain significant effects on sons’ health behavior. We do not find any effects on child’s physical health and overweight. We demonstrate the robustness of our IV estimates by sequentially introducing the control variables. The results are not substantially altered when we include controls for grandparents’ education, grandparent’s occupational prestige and the size of the area where the mother grew up. Also the results do not change when we control for some possibly “bad controls” (i.e. variables that are possibly consequences of maternal education) like mother’s fertility, health and health behavior. Furthermore, the results are robust to only considering mothers with one, two or three siblings as well as to more flexible specifications of the first stage. We discuss mother’s health behavior, assortative mating, household income, and child’s schooling track as possible channels of the estimated effects. Our results do not suggest that mother’s health behavior, assortative mating or household income explain the effects on adolescent daughters. When including child’s schooling track as an additional control variable, the effect of maternal education on daughter’s smoking behavior disappears. Hence, maternal education seems to affect daughter’s smoking behavior through the higher likelihood of the daughter pursuing a higher secondary schooling track. Even though early tracking is a peculiarity of the German schooling system, the mechanism at work (school quality or peer group effects) may also be relevant for other countries. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data and presents descriptive statistics. Section 3 contains a detailed discussion of our empirical strategy. In Sect. 4, we present both Probit and IV-Probit results and present sensitivity checks. Section 5 investigates channels of the estimated effects. Section 6 concludes with a discussion on the implications of our findings.",11

This is in part because a number of empirical studies have rejected the traditional unitary household model (e.g., Thomas 1990;  Lundberg et al. 1997). The theoretical development of the Pareto efficient approach to collective household models following the seminal papers by Chiappori (1988, 1992) has also enabled us to test the collective rationality under a set of fairly weak assumptions [e.g., Browning and Chiappori (1998)] and the collective rationality has not been rejected in some countries, including Canada (Browning and Chiappori 1998) and Mexico (Bobonis 2009).
Footnote 1 Blundell et al. (2005) advanced the Pareto-efficient approach to households with children. They show that the sharing rule can be identified in the presence of either separability or one distribution factor. In this note, we discuss the relationship between the Pareto-optimal allocation in the household and the allocation of private goods in the corresponding private sub-problem. We first show that the weak separability of private goods consumption from public goods consumption carries over to the household level. We then show the existence of a private sub-problem that supports the allocation of private goods in any Pareto-efficient outcome. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the household Pareto weight and the Pareto weight in the private sub-problem to move in the same direction. When this condition is satisfied, we can focus on the space of private goods to track the changes in the overall decision power and resource allocation within a household. The results presented in this note are directly applicable to the identification of changes in the resource allocation within a household. Using the analytical framework developed in this note, Fujii and Ishikawa (2012) estimate the impact of childbirth on intra-household allocation using the Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers (JPSC) dataset, which includes the measurements of consumption expenditure for the husband, wife, children, other household members and family as a whole. They find that the private goods allocation tends to move towards the wife’s disadvantage when a new baby is born. Their study also suggests that the wife may be substituting more say in child-rearing for private consumption.
Footnote 2
 This study is related to Blundell et al. (2005) in the sense that both studies deal with the intra-household resource allocation in the presence of public goods. However, the purpose of this note is not to identify the sharing rule but to provide an analytical framework that allows us to identify the factors that affect the Pareto weight. This study is also different from Browning et al. (2010), who propose a way to estimate the indifference scales in a collective household, because we do not try to compare the welfare levels of individuals in different types of households. In the next section, we formalize the intra-household allocation problem and derive the main results. Section 3 concludes.",2

Such recognition has raised considerable public concern over this issue, leading many researchers to examine the quantitative effect of taxation systems on female labor supply (Eissa 1995; Blundell and MaCurdy 1999; Smith et al. 2003; Stephens and Ward-Batts 2004; LaLumia 2008).Footnote 1 It is well known that, given the relatively inelastic male labor supply, women are likely to face higher tax rate on their market work under joint taxation systems, so that a move towards individual taxation can encourage women to take part in the labor market.Footnote 2 Gustafsson (1992) confirms this effect of taxation systems on female labor supply by comparing married women in Sweden where its tax unit is based on individual incomes, and German married women who face the same tax rate as their husbands under the joint taxation system. Her study also identified having children as a key factor in deterring married women from supplying their time in the labor market.Footnote 3
 An influential theoretical work of Apps and Rees (2004) analyzes the effect of taxation systems on female labor supply and fertility outcomes using a common-preference model of the household. They showed that in the presence of bought-in childcare, a revenue-neutral tax reform from joint to individual tax can achieve both improvements in female labor supply and fertility rate and that this positive relationship between two variables depends on the preferences for children in the household. Recently, economists have begun to employ bargaining models in their studies of household responses to tax policies. Alesina et al. (2011) have demonstrated in a model, where individuals’ elasticities of labor supply are determined in consequence of bargained allocation, that taxing women’s labor supply less than that of men leads to an increase in female labor participation. Pollak (2011) explores the effect of joint taxation on the economic power balance of married couples.Footnote 4 Although their studies with bargaining models have introduced multiple family members as decision units into the policy analysis of taxation systems, they do not consider household fertility decisions associated with female labor supply. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of a change in tax systems on the female labor supply and fertility rate in a model which takes into account intra-household preference heterogeneity and the effect that tax reform brings on the couples’ balance of power simultaneously. For our purpose, this study has two distinct features in the tax analysis of two-earner households. One feature is that the family members negotiate the distribution among themselves in the presence of conflicting parental preferences over the number of their children.Footnote 5 Indeed, there is a growing literature which has found some differences between the ideal number of children of husbands and wives even in developed countries, and the fertility decisions are studied based on this heterogeneity (Thomson et al. 1990; Voas 2003; Testa 2006).Footnote 6 Rasul (2008) and Hener (2010) also confirmed family bargaining with conflicting preferences on fertility goals, using Malay and German datasets, respectively. Thus, the traditional common preference approach may not be enough for the study of family behaviors including fertility choice. The other feature is that tax schedules influence the balance of power between sexes.Footnote 7 In this paper, we consider endogenous bargaining power in two ways; one is the bargaining power determined by the earning abilities of each spouse (de la Croix and Donckt 2010).Footnote 8 The second is the case where women’s economic position depends not only on net wage rates but after-tax earnings of men and women.Footnote 9 In order to incorporate the effect of labor supply decisions on bargaining power, we follow the framework of Basu (2006), which examined the relationship between female labor supply and bargaining power. We then assume that their balance of power in marriage depends on the ratio of available resources of after-tax incomes earned if they have the average number of children per household. It is shown that when wives wish to have more children than their husbands, a revenue-neutral tax reform with an increase in male tax rate and a reduction in female tax rate leads to an even greater increase in the fertility rate than the traditional result based on the common-preference model. A tax reform toward individual taxation empowers women’s bargaining position by lowering the male after-tax wage rate and increasing the female after-tax wage rate. In the case of women’s larger ideal number of children, the change in balance of power due to tax reform allows a household to reflect women’s preference more. We also demonstrated that a sufficiently high elasticity of substitution between maternal and market childcare can still improve women’s labor participation. Although the enhanced fertility due to bargaining allocation seems to reduce the female labor supply, when the elasticity of substitution of market childcare goods for maternal attention is positive and large, the tax reform even enables the achievement of increases in both fertility and female labor supply. This paper is organized as follows. An intra-family decision making model with endogenous bargaining power is presented in Sect. 2, while Sect. 3 gives main results. Section 4 discusses the extensions of our model. Section 5 contains brief concluding remarks.",2

Child support income represents 40% of total family income among poor families who receive it and 63% of income among recipient families whose total income is below 50% of the poverty line (Sorensen 2010). In the post-welfare reform era, single mothers are particularly dependent on child support to help them transition into the workforce. States also depend heavily on child support enforcement to keep expenditures on other social programs in check. Families that receive child support are less likely to apply for cash assistance (Huang et al. 2002; Huang et al. 2004; Neelakantan 2009). Furthermore, states retain child support payments paid by noncustodial parents on behalf of children who receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and use the revenue to offset TANF program costs. In 2010, $1.6 billion in child support was retained and applied to TANF and foster care expenditures (Office of Child Support Enforcement 2011). For noncustodial parents, however, states’ retention of child support lowers their incentives to pay formal support because their payments do not benefit their child. In this paper, I examine whether noncustodial fathers increase provision of in-kind support, which cannot be intercepted by the state, in response to increased retention of formal child support by states following the 1996 welfare reform. Before 1996, the federal government required states to pass through $50 of child support per month to the custodial parent instead of retaining it and to disregard this income when calculating eligibility for AFDC. These requirements, which were intended to incentivize child support payment, were eliminated as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), although states were allowed to continue pass-through and disregard programs at their own expense.Footnote 1 The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 reinstated federal support for the pass-through and disregard by allowing states to pass through up to $100 per month in one-child families and $200 per month in families with two or more children without having to reimburse the federal government for its share of TANF costs beginning on October 1, 2008. Previous research has not examined changes in informal support in response to child support pass-through polices, but it has found evidence of small declines in formal support paid after pass-through and disregard were eliminated.Footnote 2 The net effect of the pass-through and disregard policies on families’ income and children’s welfare depends on the changes in the sum of both formal and informal payments, so knowing how total support changes requires understanding whether parents substitute toward informal support. Although it would be ideal to know how the total amount of support that noncustodial parents provide to their children changes in response to increases in state child support retention, surveys spanning the welfare reform era did not collect information on the monetary amount of informal support custodial parents received. The results of this study on in-kind payments, when combined with past research on the effect of states’ retention of child support on formal support payment, give us a more complete picture of how noncustodial parents respond to child support pass-through. I use panel data from the Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD) to examine the likelihood that noncustodial fathers provide in-kind support. The SPD is the only large-scale national panel survey that spans welfare reform. Census re-contacted participants in the 1992 and 1993 Surveys of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and interviewed them annually from 1997–2002 to create the SPD panel, resulting in longitudinal data spanning a ten-year period. I compare changes in in-kind support receipt before and after welfare reform for families that did and did not experience changes in child support pass-through and disregard. The panel data permits me to control for family characteristics and unobserved father characteristics more effectively than in pooled cross-section data. Changes in state pass-through and disregard policies provide the identifying variation. I find that when the monthly child support disregard is lower by $100, the likelihood that children in low-income families receive in-kind support is higher by approximately 3.2 percentage points. In combination with previous research that has identified declines in formal support after the disregard was eliminated, this suggests that noncustodial parents substitute between formal and informal support in response to changes in pass-through and disregard policies.",3

Wehby,Allen Wilcox,Rolv T. Lie,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Maternal smoking during pregnancy has received a wide research attention for its implications for maternal and child health. Many studies have reported adverse effects of prenatal smoking on infant health outcomes such as birth weight (Kramer 1987; Evans and Ringel 1999; Lien and Evans 2005; Wehby et al. 2012) and neurodevelopment (Faden and Graubard 2000; Herrmann et al. 2008; Indredavik et al. 2007; Wehby et al. 2011c). Previous studies have also reported increases in birth weight with cigarette quitting during pregnancy (Permutt and Hebel 1989; Secker-Walker et al. 1998). Advising pregnant mothers who are smokers to quit smoking is a standard prenatal care practice. However, not much is known about the effects of cigarette quitting during pregnancy on other health behaviors that are thought to be relevant for maternal and child health. Overall, there is little research that directly assesses the effects of cigarette quitting during pregnancy on other important prenatal health behaviors such as caloric intake, multivitamin use, alcohol consumption and caffeine intake. Maternal caloric intake and weight gain affect maternal and infant health as well as childhood obesity (Crozier et al. 2010; Rooney et al. 2010; Torloni et al. 2009; Bhattacharya et al. 2007). Alcohol consumption may reduce intrauterine growth (Lien and Evans 2005; Okah et al. 2005), increase risk of stillbirth (Reddy et al. 2010), and cause fetal alcohol syndrome, which may have detrimental effects on child behavior and neurological development (CDC 2011). Multivitamin use may also improve birth weight, reduce preterm birth, and prevent certain birth defects (Wehby et al. 2009; Scholl et al. 1997). Caffeine consumption, especially high consumption, has been shown to increase the risk of fetal growth restriction (CARE 2008). Therefore, evaluating the effects of cigarette quitting on such prenatal behaviors is important for gaining further knowledge about the returns to maternal and child health from prenatal cigarette quitting. Cigarette quitting during pregnancy may influence other prenatal behaviors as it may modify maternal preferences through either biologic or psychosocial pathways. The biologic effects may result from the effects of cigarette quitting on metabolism, appetite, and exercising capacity which in turn can affect caloric intake. Successful cigarette quitting may also encourage further maternal effort to quit other risk behaviors and adopt healthy behaviors by increasing self-motivation, empowerment, and knowledge for behavioral change. For example, individuals who successfully quit smoking may gain further motivation and learn skills that allow them to adopt healthier behaviors in order to improve their and their children’s health. However, the psychosocial pathways linking behavioral changes are complex and may vary between individuals. For example, while some individuals may feel encouraged to reduce their drinking behavior after quitting cigarettes, others may compensate for a potential utility loss after reducing smoking by drinking more. Therefore, an empirical evaluation is needed to identify the average effects of quitting on other prenatal behaviors. We study the effects of cigarette quitting during the first trimester of pregnancy among women who smoked before pregnancy on their caloric intake, alcohol consumption, multivitamin use, and caffeine intake also during the first trimester of pregnancy. We account for the endogeneity of quitting using a bivariate probit model and a genetic variant that influences quitting but is otherwise thought to be unrelated to the other prenatal behaviors of interest. We find that cigarette quitting during pregnancy may increase caloric intake and multivitamin use and decrease caffeine consumption, suggesting important behavioral changes with quitting.",8

Many family members raise children and also care for their aging parents by providing time, financial and emotional assistance. These intergenerational transfers are important to each household and to society. Caring for aging parents, in particular, can be a psychologically and financially demanding activity and, since most developed societies are aging and having fewer children per household, this cost is shifting from households to national health care budgets. Formal long-term care is expensive and, in the last two decades, the US federal government has encouraged families and states to reduce the use of nursing homes by creating economic incentives to encourage community home care and time assistance by adult children. In the United States, the most popular family resource transfers are financial gifts to children (Gale and Scholz 1994) and time assistance to parents (Pezzin and Schone 1999). In 2007, nearly 45 million caregivers provided 37 billion hours of unpaid, informal care to over 13 million seniors and adults with disabilities (National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP 2008). If our society had paid for these billions of hours through formal services, it would have cost nearly $400 billion.Footnote 1 Assuming that most adult children are generally capable of providing safe and effective care with little or no training, failure to adequately support the informal care network is costly to society and detrimental to seniors. Sociologists, social workers and economists have studied the factors that affect family care decisions. Economists have approached the subject in two ways. In the 1990s, some economists used Becker’s model of the family (1975) to guide their research questions (Pezzin et al. 2007). Becker analyzed family “non-material” behavior, such as marriage and intra-family time and resource allocation, using models of rational behavior that were traditionally used to understand “material behavior”. The second approach used game-theoretic bargaining models to understand family care arrangements (Pezzin et al. 2007). Game theory is useful for analyzing intergenerational living and transfer arrangements because it recognizes the often-conflicting interests of family members who must strategically decide who will care for their elderly in the midst of competing interests. Examples can be found in Sloan and Hoerger (1997), Hiedemann and Stern (1999), Engers et al. (2002) and Pezzin and Schone (1999). The most common transfer motives cited in the economics literature are altruism and exchange (mutual gain). Becker (1981) defines motives as differential reactions to changing structural conditions and motives are important to evaluate how resource changes and related policies affect transfer behavior (Kohli and Kunemund 2003). Transfers made to children due to an altruistic motive will affect economic incentives differently than family transfers motivated by exchange. For an extensive review of the literature, see López Anuarbe (2010). Researchers who have studied these motives have not come to a consensus, in part because they use different methods and databases and ask slightly different questions. Comprehensive datasets such as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) or the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) allow researchers to test for the altruism hypothesis using cross-sectional data and for the exchange hypothesis using the longitudinal waves (Soldo and Hill 1995). Authors who consider donors to be guided by the exchange motive include Bernheim et al. (1985), Cox (1987), Cox and Rank (1992), Altonji et al. (1997) and McGarry (1999). Both the altruism and exchange theories predict a negative relationship between the potential recipient’s income and the probability of receiving a transfer or the decision to transfer. The exchange models also predict a positive relationship between the transfer probability and parental income (McGarry and Schoeni 1995, 1997, Altonji et al. 1997). However, altruism and exchange theories differ when they predict how the child’s income affects transfer amounts. The altruistic model implies a negative relationship between the transfer amount and the income level of the child, whereas the exchange model allows for either a positive or a negative relationship between the two. For instance, an altruistic parent will transfer less income to her children, the higher the offspring’s wealth level. In contrast, a parent guided by the exchange motive may still transfer money to his child even if the child is wealthy, since the motive for exchange is not to support the child but to elicit the child’s help. In fact, wealthier offspring with a higher market value on their time may require a larger “inducement” to assist their aging parent. Cox (1987) found such a positive relationship between the recipient’s income and the amount of transfers received. This result contradicts the pure altruistic motive but is consistent with the exchange motive, given that the latter allows for a positive or negative relationship between the two variables (McGarry and Schoeni 1997). The core research objectives of this paper are: (1) to provide an economic framework for examining parents’ gifts to their offspring and the time assistance that children provide to aging parents; (2) to consider not just the individual characteristics that influence each type of behavior, but also the extent to which each party’s behavior depends on the characteristics of both parties; (3) to include the effects of several public policies on these intra-generational health care decisions. My research expands on McGarry and Schoeni’s 1997 cross-sectional work, which studied the relationship between parents’ monetary gifts to their children and adult children’s time assistance to their elderly parents, and Norton and Van Houtven’s (2006) longitudinal work in which the authors argue for inter-vivos transfers as a more effective exchange mechanism (between parental monetary gifts to their children and children’s time assistance to their parents) than bequests, as the former method allows for unequal distribution of monetary resources in favor of caregiving children, while bequests are usually given in equal amounts regardless of whether children have provided time assistance to their parents or not. Using 1993 AHEAD data, McGarry and Schoeni (1997) concluded that the simple correlation between the current amount of money that parents give to their children and the current amount of help provided by their children, or whether they helped or not, is actually negative (−0.007) and only significant (at the 1 % level) in the binary case (−0.025). If parents need help from their children, they may be very sick and incurring large medical expenses, which would hinder contemporaneous financial gifts to their offspring. When the authors looked at the sub-sample of parents who already had made one or more transfers to their children, they found a positive and significant (at the 1 % level) correlation (0.043) between the transfer decision and the assistance decision, but again a negative and statistically weak correlation between the transfer amounts and hours of assistance. Although McGarry and Schoeni’s study was cross-sectional, the authors found a positive (0.05) and statistically significant correlation between the size of the gift and the parents’ expectation of receiving time assistance in the future. This positive relationship could be seen as a current investment that parents are making, should they need future time assistance from their children. Unlike most of the earlier studies of intergenerational transfers, this paper provides a theoretical frame work that formally links the behavior of the two parties, parents and children, strengthening the rationale for including the characteristics of both parties in any empirical analysis of each party’s observed behavior. Also, by using two periods only, I show how gift giving positively depends on past time assistance, as opposed to contemporaneous time assistance. By just adding one more period and lagged variables, the negative correlation reported by McGarry and Schoeni became positive and statistically significant. Current parental gift giving was also consistent with the reported likelihood of future gift giving in the previous wave and with previous gift giving. Past time assistance was also an important determinant of current time assistance, though parental gift giving did not affect offspring time assistance to their parents.This gift timing and time assistance is one topic I address. In particular, I study the relationship between parental financial gifts to children and children’s time assistance to their parents in 1993 and 1995, and control for state policies such as state gift taxes, respite care and adult daycare services, which may influence the amount and likelihood of parental gift giving and time assistance, respectively. While altruism is not discarded, my theoretical framework and results suggest that parents and children may also engage in a one-sided exchange, a result also supported by Norton and Van Houtven (2006). Parents provide more inter-vivos gifts to children who provided time assistance to them in the past, but children do not necessarily provide more time assistance to their parents if they receive monetary gifts from them. This study also has important limitations. First, some of the qualitative factors that govern family relations and decisions cannot be fully captured with conventional, quantitative variables. Families express their love, gratitude or resentment differently, in ways that reflect their cultural values and upbringing. Furthermore, some potentially relevant variables are unavailable in this specific dataset. For example, the HRS interviewers asked older households whether they had given money to their children during a specific period, the amount, and the recipient, but the reason for the gift was not recorded. Such reasons might include: children need the money, appreciation for their time assistance, a pure desire to financially assist their children, or to spend-down their estate and qualify for Medicaid long-term care. Finally, there may be some relevant factors affecting intergenerational transfers that are not identified or included in this work.",12

The year of the fire horse comes around once every 60 years. The most recent fire horse years were 1846, 1906, and 1966. Fire horse years are regarded as particularly ominous for women in Japan. According to superstition, females born in these years are believed to kill and cannibalize their husbands. Based on this superstition, fire horse women are said to have troubled marriages, to mistreat men, and to cause early deaths for their husbands and fathers (Azumi 1968; Hashimoto 1974). No such stigma applies to men born in these years. Figure 1 depicts the impact of the superstition on the cohort size of 1966. It shows the cohort sizes of the fire horse year (1966) and the surrounding years until 1970 for both males and females. The 1966 cohort size is 15 % smaller than the average cohort size between 1963 and 1965, and it is 22 % smaller than the average cohort size between 1967 and 1969. This decline in cohort size for a specific year is significant. 1957–1970 cohort size in 1970 census. Source: Japan Statistics Bureau: http://www.stat.go.jp
 This event is a natural experiment because the value of women is believed to be changed exogenously. There are two main questions we can ask. The first question is “how did people avoid having female babies in that particular year?” That is, we can ask how people responded to the superstition, which is believed to have a negative impact on the value of girls born in that year. A large body of literature has attempted to answer this question. Rolhfs et al. (2010) applied formal empirical methods to three recent fire horse years (1846, 1906, and 1966) to demonstrate the different methods people used to avoid having baby girls in the year of the fire horse. All of the literature used macro- or semi-macro-level aggregated data. The other question is “what is the impact of being born in the year of the fire horse on women’s lives?” Surprisingly, there are few attempts in the literature to answer the second question.Footnote 1 This is partially because more disaggregated data are required to answer the question. As the superstition negatively stigmatizes women born in a fire horse year, these women may be assumed to have difficulties in various areas of their lives, such as educational achievement, marriage, household bargaining, etc. However, the small cohort size in a fire horse year could benefit women born in the year by facilitating the achievement of higher education and greater bargaining power in the marriage market. We can consider the former a superstition effect, whereas the latter is a cohort effect. It is unclear a priori what should be expected because these two effects may work in opposite directions. Ultimately, these are empirical questions. This paper is the first attempt to investigate the impact on women born in the most recent fire horse year (1966) by using individual-level micro data. We use the 1993–2000 Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers (JPSC) collected by The Institute for Research on Household Economics to answer the question. Note that we can only examine the impact of the most recent fire horse year (1966) on the outcome of women born in that year. We cannot generalize to the impact on women born in previous fire horse years, such as 1906 and 1846. We use two empirical strategies based on the comparison groups for the fire horse women. The first strategy examines the women in the surrounding cohorts of the fire horse year as a comparison group. The second strategy examines the fire horse men as a comparison group. This is because the superstition applies to fire horse women but not to fire horse men. Thus, although they were born in the same year, these groups may have different life outcomes. We conduct a difference-in-difference analysis using information on the fire horse men as well as information on the cohorts surrounding the fire horse year. We find no systematic difference in important observable variables between parents of fire horse women and parents of women in the surrounding cohorts. The only observable variable that differs significantly between the parents of these groups is their area of residence. Parents living in urban areas were more likely to have a baby in the year of the fire horse than were parents living in rural areas. However, this finding may overestimate the geographical effect on fertility. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of disadvantage to fire horse women in the marriage market or the intra-household allocation of resources after marriage. The marriage rate of the fire horse cohort is almost equivalent to that of the surrounding cohorts in both 1993 and 2000. Furthermore, the educational level and age of the husbands of fire horse women are very similar to those of the husbands of women in the surrounding cohorts. The fire horse cohort seems to benefit slightly from its small cohort size in obtaining higher education, although statistical tests cannot reject the hypothesis of equal mean and equal distribution of the educational level between the fire horse cohort and the surrounding cohorts. If being born in the year of the fire horse were to give women a disadvantage, we could hypothesize that it should result in unfavorable consequences for variables related to intra-household bargaining. This is particularly true because the cohort size effect is less important after people are married, although it may work as a (pre-marriage) commitment to the allocation of intra-household resources or bargaining power for future divorce. However, we found no distortion of intra-household resources (expenditure plus saving and time allocation) caused by the superstition. The difference-in-difference analysis provided similar qualitative results. Previous literature found that the superstition of a fire horse year had a huge impact on couples’ fertility decisions. This finding implies that people strongly believe the superstition that imputes bad luck to women born in fire horse years. If many people believe the superstition, we should see an effect of this superstition on the outcome variables of fire horse women throughout their lives. However, this paper found no evidence of an impact of the superstition on various outcome variables in fire horse women’s lives. One plausible explanation is that the cohort effect worked favorably for fire horse women. Another possible explanation is that the dynamic transition in the share of each type of marriage differently affected the decisions of parents in 1966 and the performance of fire horse women in the marriage market and in intra-household resource allocation after marriage. Because the share of arranged marriages was high in 1966 (approximately 45 %), couples worried that their daughters might have difficulty marrying. However, by the time fire horse women born in 1966 entered the marriage market, the share of arranged marriage had declined to less than 20 %, and more than 80 % of first marriages were marriages for love. Fire horse women were thus likely to find their partners in ways other than being introduced to prospective marriage partners. In these cases, the negative impact of being born in the year of the fire horse may be weaker or nonexistent. These implications indicate the importance of careful attention to dynamic social and economic transitions that may occur before any cohort size effect emerges. This paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a demographic overview of the fire horse year of 1966, a simple survey of studies of fire horse women, and conceptual frameworks. Section 3 explains the dataset we use. Section 4 conducts an analysis using the sample of women. An analysis using the difference-in difference approach is explored in Sect. 5. Section 6 discusses possible interpretations of the results obtained. Section 7 states the conclusion.",4

The fact that Greece has always been a migrant-exporting country and has suddenly become a migrant-importing country raised a number of issues that ranged from dealing with racism to the formation of a proper migration policy (Cholezas and Tsakloglou 2009). Using natives as the gold standard, immigrants have always been compared to natives. In Greece, the scarce economic studies suggest that immigrants face lower wages than natives; are segregated in low status occupations, and are discriminated against in the labor and housing market (Lianos et al. 1996; Demoussis et al. 2010; Drydakis and Vlassis 2010; Drydakis 2010, 2011a). Unfortunately, however, ethnic identity and employment outcomes have not been subject to examination.Footnote 1 Ethnic identity becomes pertinent upon arrival in the host country, given that there is a sufficient cultural distance between the immigrants’ country and the receiving country. Nowadays, the multicultural environment in Greece creates many opportunities for international interactions and given the increasing diversity the concept of ethnic identity has become increasingly important.Footnote 2 Studies suggest that the choice of immigrants to be specific types of people may become a powerful decision with substantial socio-economic consequences for both the individuals and the host country. Indeed, Chiswick (1978), Chiswick et al. (1997) and Chiswick and Lofstrom (2010) show that as immigrants invest in human capital in the host country, their economic outcomes increase rapidly and can reach and even exceed the economic outcomes of natives. Given the increasing diversity in Europe today the concept of acculturation has become more and more important. In all multicultural societies, cultural groups and their individual members must deal with the issue of how to acculturate. The classical definition of acculturation was presented by Redfield et al. (1936, p. 149): “acculturation comprehends those phenomena which result when groups of individuals having difference cultures come into continuous first-hand contact with subsequent changes in the original culture patterns of either or both group”. Ethnic identity becomes salient as part of the acculturation process that takes place when immigrants come to a new society. This study aims to examine associations between ethnic identity patterns and employment levels by utilizing the Greek Migration Study (2009–2010). The Greek Migration Study contains information on various issues surrounding ethnic identity by sampling the five most over-represented immigrant groups in Greece; Albanians, Bulgarians, Georgians, Romanians and Russians. Following the Berry’s acculturation model (1980, 1997, 2006) and Constant’s and Zimmermann’s empirical framework (2008) we construct indexes that measure four possible ethnic identity patterns, namely: integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization. As Greece is experiencing immigration for the first time in historical memory it is critically important to know how immigrants perform in the labor market and affect society. Following the seminal hypothesis of Chiswick (1978) the main question under examination is whether an immigrant who is culturally well adjusted to Greece is likely to face more chances to be in the labor market than an immigrant who retains a stronger affiliation with her or his own culture? The comparative strength of the current study is immigrants’ self-reporting of ethnic identity patterns instead of indirect classifications, which can be experimental and not indicative of true ethnic identity. In the Greek Migration Study, immigrants evaluate the ethnic identity of various key cultural elements by choosing among the four acculturation scenarios to best describe their commitments. The ethnic identity measure adopted is likely to be correlated with the concept of interest, being truly assimilated, integrated, segregated, or marginalized, and is arguably better than the indirect measures used in previous research studies. Measuring ethnic identity by a simple binary variable masks differences in the meaning and use of ethnic identity among immigrants. Migrants may neither look nor feel ethnic or they may affiliate to a greater or lesser degree with the culture of the host country. The study’s outcomes will conclude that assimilation and integration provide the highest employment returns. On the other hand, marginalization and separation provides the highest employment losses. The estimated patterns suggest that the formal institutions of the Greek labor market remain the province of the Greek culture characteristics and are more accessible to immigrants with knowledge of the host country language and social capital, regardless of the individual’s additional ethnic background. There are a number of reasons why the assimilation of immigrants matters, aside from their employment rates, well-being, savings, investments and money transferred to home countries. The more successfully immigrants are employed, the higher their net economic and fiscal contribution to the host economy will be. Whilst, assimilated immigrants may be important for the attitudes of the native population towards immigrants and, therefore, may have an impact on immigration policy. Indeed, Epstein and Gang (2009) and Constant and Zimmermann (2011) suggest that since immigration is the consequence of policy, migration policy is partly responsible for the types of immigrants a country receives, their economic performance, the functioning of the economy, and hence natives’ perceptions towards immigrants. Whilst, efforts made to assimilate, time, and the degree to which the majority welcomes the minority are additional elements working to bring minorities into line with the majority. As a result, the current results have potentially important implications for post-immigration policies indicating that assimilation policies may be beneficial in terms of social welfare. The rest of the study is organized in five sections. A literature review regarding basic concepts of ethnic identity is offered in Sect. 2 and 3 evaluates how the Greek Migration Study classifies ethnic identity. Section 4 presents the descriptive statistics, the formation of identity and the estimation results. Section 5 is a conclusion.",12

11.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,15 June 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-012-9148-7,Stage-specific family structure models: implicit parameter restrictions and Bayesian model comparison with an application to prosocial behavior,September 2013,Mark Ottoni-Wilhelm,Robert Bandy,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since the first investigation of the association between a young adult outcome and earlier family structure during each childhood stage (Krein and Beller 1988), stage-specific empirical models of family structure have been increasingly used. The two most frequently used stage-specific family structure specifications are the state × stage and the event × stage specifications (e.g., Hill et al. 2001; Ermisch and Francesoni 2001; Ermisch et al. 2004; Fronstin et al. 2001). The state × stage specification is motivated by the theory that parental control is the mechanism through which family structure affects outcomes, and intends to capture this mechanism by using a set of dummy variables that indicates whether the young adult had, during the stages of childhood, spent time in various states—e.g., in a birth-mother-only family structure during adolescence, in a birth-mother–step-father structure, etc. In contrast the event × stage specification is motivated by the theory that stress associated with a divorce event or a (re)marriage event affects outcomes, and uses a set of dummy variables for change events during a stage (e.g., parents divorce in early childhood). An important but unanswered question is: For a given young adult outcome, which specification provides the better explanation, according to specification testing criteria, of associations between family structure during childhood and the outcome? Not having an answer to this question leads to two problems in the previous literature. First, in papers that estimate both state and event specifications it is not clear from which specification the substantive results should be drawn. For example, Hill et al. find evidence from a state × stage specification that living with a mother and grandparent during adolescence is negatively associated with completed education, but also find evidence from an event × stage specification that divorce and (re)marriage events during adolescence are associated (sometimes negatively, sometimes positively) with completed education. Hill et al. decide to draw substantive results from the event specification, but do not base that decision on a specification test. In fact, an adjusted-R
2 criterion would favor the state specification. Second, when papers estimate only one of the two specifications it can become difficult to reconcile results across papers. For example, to model educational attainment Ermisch et al. (2004) estimate a state specification, while Fronstin et al. (2001) estimate an event specification. While both papers find compatible results for early and middle childhood–statistically significant negative associations between attainment and living in a birth-mother-only family structure (Ermisch et al.) or divorce (Fronstin et al.)—Fronstin et al. also find a statistically significant negative association in adolescence. Had either paper estimated both the state and event specifications, and conducted a specification test, we would have clearer evidence about whether family structure during adolescence is related to educational attainment. More fundamentally, the previous literature has not realized that the state × stage and the event × stage specifications imply two different sets of parameter restrictions on the underlying model of child development. Hence, family structure specification tests can be seen as adjudicating between different sets of restrictions imposed on a common set of underlying parameters. The sets of restrictions have different substantive interpretations. The first objective of this paper is to show that any stage-specific specification of family structure imposes parameter restrictions on the underlying model of child development, and to describe the restrictions imposed by the state × stage and the event × stage specifications. In addition, we describe the restrictions imposed by two other theories. The “sequence-without-stages” specification (Hill et al. 2001) is based on the theory that the sequence in which family structure events occur affects the outcome because combinations of events affect the level of stress children experience. The “any transition × stage” specification is based on the theory that the experience of any family structure transition, regardless of kind (divorce or remarriage), creates stress in the lives of children (Wu and Martinson 1993; Wu 1996). With several competing theories offering a priori reasonable explanations about how family structure during childhood is related to young adult outcomes, specification testing becomes a prerequisite for substantive analysis. Classical specification testing can encounter nontrivial practical problems when competing specifications are non-nested and one specification does not unambiguously dominate the other, and/or there are more than two competing specifications to deal with. Both problems are relevant to the family structure literature: the state and event specifications are non-nested, and there is theoretical interest in more than just these two specifications. The paper’s second objective is to demonstrate by example the advantages of a Bayesian approach to adjudicating between competing family structure specifications: its ability to easily compare specifications when the specifications are non-nested even when the models are nonlinear, and its ability to test more than two competing specifications at one time. The example applications are two prosocial behaviors—charitable giving and volunteering. For the giving outcome Bayesian model comparison indicates that one specification is strongly preferred (any transition × stage). For the volunteering outcome no single specification among the state, event and any specifications unambiguously dominates the others. This permits demonstration of the third advantage of the Bayesian approach: we do not need to arbitrarily choose to focus on either the state, event or any-transition specifications but can use all three via model averaging to draw substantive results about family structure—volunteering associations. The paper’s innovations—linking stage-specific family structure specifications to restrictions on the underlying model of child development, describing these restrictions in terms of stage-specific effects (complementarity across stages and interactions within stages), and demonstrating the usefulness of Bayesian methods—are important because they provide straightforward procedures to handle the specification testing problems that come with the increased use of stage-specific family structure specifications. In addition, the applications are important because they are the first to use a stage-specific approach to examine the relationship between family structure during childhood and subsequent prosocial behavior in young adulthood.Footnote 1

11.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,21 May 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-013-9196-7,There’s no such thing as a free lunch: evidence of altruism and agency from household expenditure responses to child nutrition programs,September 2013,Paul Bingley,Ian Walker,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In-kind transfers are often regarded as weakly inferior to cash transfers because the cash could always be used to replicate any in-kind transfer of the same value. As a result, in-kind transfer policies are often thought to have paternalistic motivations. Such transfer programs are often administratively expensive relative to cash transfer programs. They are often provided through some agent—for example, to a parent on behalf of a child. The agent may be able to divert some of the transfer away from the intended beneficiary. Moreover, children are usually altruistically linked to their parents, and this altruism may lead to internal household redistributions that, to some extent, undo the effects of the external transfers. The Rotten Kid Theorem is the cornerstone of research on altruism in economics. One of its main empirical predictions is that redistributions between family members should not affect the distribution of family expenditure. So if, for example, a child loses its free milk, then an altruistic parent will make it up. That is, a parent who feels altruistic towards a child will increase (decrease) internal transfers to the child in the face of smaller (larger) external transfers to the child.Footnote 1
 This paper is concerned with the extent to which altruism between parents and their dependent children could undermine the objectives of policy. We also consider to what degree transfers are affected by agency considerations. We do so with the help of three UK nutrition programs: Free School Lunches for the children of poor households who attend school; Welfare Milk Tokens which can be exchanged for milk and are available for poor households with pre-school children; and Day Care Milk for pre-school children, regardless of family circumstances, while attending registered childcare institutions. These programs can be informative about altruism and agency because of their differences. It seems likely that free milk is a good substitute for the privately purchased alternative; while school lunches may be a poor substitute for market food. The loss of external milk transfers to the child(ren) would be made up by additional market purchases on milk by a perfectly altruistic parent, while the loss of free school lunches might not be replaced to the same extent. Moreover, while Welfare Milk Tokens and Day Care Milk both provide milk, they are delivered differently. The former is a transfer via the mother, while the latter is given directly to the child at the institution and we would not expect there to be any agency issue in the latter case. Importantly, two of these programs were reformed in 1988: after the reform only poor parents receiving in-work cash welfare benefits were eligible for Welfare Milk Tokens and Free School Lunches, whereas previously eligibility was for low income families who were on either in-work or
out-of-work welfare. Day Care Milk continued to be provided regardless of circumstances. Altruism undermines the effectiveness of public transfers whether they are cash or in-kind. Providing cash, or a good with close market substitutes (like milk), rather than a good with poor market substitutes (like school lunch) may allow the parents to alter market expenditure patterns to divert some of the benefit to others in the household. In addition, there may be different effects from giving milk in day care, where the authorities can ensure a child gets it, rather than giving milk to the household, where it may be consumed by any household member. We think of differences in the former (goods with different substitutabilities) as revealing altruism and differences in the latter (different delivery mechanisms for the same good) as indicative of an agency issue. Our work serves as a complement to existing research on the effects of transfers to communities. Here we examine the effects of transferring private goods (milk and food) on household expenditures which we think of as a more direct way of testing for altruism. We know of no quantitative work that considers the power of agency problems in mitigating in-kind transfer effectiveness through household spending patterns. The UK has no food stamps, but does have two programs that provide free milk, which we think of as being close to cash because almost all households with children consume milk and milk is the same regardless of whether it is free or purchased. The UK also has a further program that provides Free School Lunches, similar to the US free lunch and breakfast programs (see Manan et al. 2012). We exploit a reform that occurred in 1988 which changed the eligibility conditions for Free School Lunches and Welfare Milk Tokens, but not for Day Care Milk. Furthermore, we use the fact that Free School Lunches and Day Care Milk are only available during term time and that school summer holidays in Scotland are a month earlier than the rest in the UK. We combine these features to form natural experiments to identify the role of altruism by considering the reformed programs separately. However, we have no experimental variation in the Day Care Milk program and so we incorporate this, together with the other two programs, by estimating a structural model that allows us to test for agency, as well as altruism. This second strategy controls, parametrically, for observed differences between the treatment and control groups and makes assumptions about the distribution of unobservables to facilitate identification. In the structural model we also exploit the welfare reform to provide exogenous variation in program eligibility and levels of entitlement. That is, although Day Care Milk was not reformed, it has a target group of children of a similar age to Welfare Milk Tokens and it is just milk that is the ultimate object of each of the transfer programs. The extent to which a nutrition program is close to cash, in the sense of having close market substitutes, and how large provision is, relative to needs, are both important determinants of the scope for agency. Welfare Milk Tokens and Day Care Milk have good market substitutes, and the tokens provide a large proportion of (mean non-eligible household milk) expenditure, whereas Day Care Milk provides only a small proportion. We find that both of the milk programs crowd out private milk expenditure to a similar degree by about 80 % of their value; whereas Free School Lunches, which we think of as poor substitutes for products available in the marketplace, are estimated to crowd out private food expenditure by only 15 % of their value. We infer that agency problems are small from our finding that milk transfers have a similar crowd out regardless of the delivery mechanism. Furthermore, milk transfers appear to have similar crowd-out effects regardless of the size of provision relative to needs. Our results show that altruism is relatively more important than agency in this context.",2

The choices made by young adults are many: further education, marriage, parenthood, first job. All are interrelated and can be linked to another choice, that of a first independent home. Youth labour supply and educational choices will determine the length of the career, pension and life-time consumption. Billari and Tabellini (2010) show that Italians who leave the parental home earlier in life earn a higher income in their mid-30s. This might be due either to the fact that they tend to have longer working experience or to a negative impact of prolonged co-residence on ambitions and motivations for children who leave late (Alessie et al. 2006). The demographic transition and population evolution are also largely linked to the timing of first parenthood. The nest leaving period is also the time where family decisions can be viewed through the lenses of parental altruism. The young adult income is likely to be small compared to that of her parents and as the “child” becomes an adult she is, in a sense, getting a “utility function of her own”. As we concentrate on housing decision, we present a theoretical model which allows for two channels of parental altruism: parents can help their children either by providing their own home for co-residence or by helping to pay for another accommodation (Laferrère 2005a, b). The model predicts three types of altruism. Affluent parents will financially help their children both if they live at home with them and if they live independently: in this case a money transfer will help the children to leave the nest (standard altruism). Parents with fewer resources will be able to help their children only if they live at home with them: hence, a cash transfer under co-residence will induce the children to stay (proximity altruism). Income constrained parents will not be able to make any financial transfer to the child and, therefore, their income will have no effect on the child’s decision to leave (no altruism). In all cases, the quality of the parental home will have an effect on nest leaving: a larger and less crowded parental house and higher house prices induce the child to stay with the parents. In the empirical analysis, we take advantage of the retrospective data collected in the third wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) to test the prediction of the theoretical model in an historical perspective.Footnote 1
 We document important differences in nest leaving age by country, cohort and gender. We also distinguish different patterns of transition to adulthood that can be classified in “traditional” (low education, late nest leaving) and “modern” (high education, early nest leaving). In the econometric analysis, we relate the age at nest leaving to parental income and home characteristics, controlling for the country of residence and the birth cohort. We estimate the model by gender and distinguish for the pattern of nest leaving, whether it was traditional or modern. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 presents the theoretical model. In Sect. 4 we describe the data and the patterns of nest leaving. Section 5 offers a multivariate analysis of the family determinants of the nest leaving age, testing the altruistic model of Sect. 3. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",15

Yet a leveling-off of married women’s labor force participation rate in the 1990s, followed by a slight downturn beginning in the late 1990s, has raised new questions about the strength of women’s labor force attachment.Footnote 1 The possibility that highly educated women are reducing their labor market activity or exiting the labor force to care for their children at higher rates than their less educated peers, referred to as “opting out,” has received extensive media attention and has generated a great deal of controversy (e.g., Belkin 2003; Story 2005). Academic studies largely find little evidence that opting out is an important phenomenon.Footnote 2 But these studies provide no information on whether opting out differs by college selectivity, and, as highlighted in the media and noted by Goldin (2006) and Goldin and Katz (2008), the discussion of opting out is generally interpreted to refer to female graduates of highly selective institutions. In this paper, I show that graduates of elite institutions have lower labor market activity than graduates of less selective institutions. Because the majority of women are not graduates of elite institutions, there may be little overall evidence of opting out even though graduates of elite institutions are indeed opting out. The principal challenge in addressing this question is availability of data on a sufficiently large sample of women that includes labor market information as well as information on selectivity of college institution, such as whether it should be categorized as ‘elite.’ Studies that investigate the possibility of opting out among women in general have used data that do not provide information on quality or selectivity of educational institution (e.g., Boushey 2005, 2008; Percheski 2008; Kreider and Elliott 2009; Antecol 2011), or else consider only graduates of elite institutions. Goldin (2006) examines graduates of the 34 selective schools included in the College and Beyond data set; Bertrand et al. (2010) examine MBA graduates of University of Chicago; and Goldin and Katz (2008) and Herr and Wolfram (2012) examine Harvard graduates. Thus, despite the focus on graduates of elite institutions, there are no studies that compare the labor market activity of elite graduates to non-elite graduates.Footnote 3 Furthermore, the studies of elite graduates listed above that conclude there is no trend in opting out among elite graduates have limitations. The College and Beyond data analyzed in Goldin (2006) reflects out-of-work spells retrospectively reported in 1996–1997 from the entering class of 1976, and therefore predates the time period in which concerns over opting out arose. Goldin and Katz (2008) is based on respondents to the 2006 Harvard and Beyond survey (comprised of three cohorts of Harvard/Radcliffe graduates in periods around 1970, 1980, 1990) which requested retrospective reports of out-of-work spells of 6 months or more. Although the 2006 survey period coincides with the time period in which concerns over opting out arose, the survey had an overall response rate of 40 % and a response rate for women of 45.7 %. Bertrand et al. (2010) is based on respondents to a survey conducted in 2006–2007 of University of Chicago Booth School of Business MBA graduating classes of 1990–2006, which also requested information on out-of-work spells of 6 months or more and had a response rate of 31 % among those with known e-mail addresses. The response rates in the latter two surveys are low enough to raise concerns about possible response biases that might conceal actual trends in opting out, especially if women selectively respond on the basis of their labor market status.Footnote 4
 I examine whether labor market activity is related to college selectivity using data from the 2003 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG). The 2003 NSCG provides detailed information for more than 100,000 college graduates across the full universe of colleges and universities, including a large share who are married mothers and who have graduate degrees. To identify college selectivity, I use information on Carnegie classificationFootnote 5 available in the 2003 NSCG to group institutions into selectivity tiers by comparing by name schools in each Carnegie classification to schools in selectivity categories in Barron’s Profiles of American Colleges.Footnote 6 This analysis provides information on whether opting out is a more important phenomenon among the elite graduates profiled in the media than among the majority of the population who are not elite graduates, and therefore provides information on whether the limited evidence of opting out shown so far may relate to the small share of the population comprised of elite graduates. Although graduates of elite institutions marry later, are more likely to earn graduate degrees, and have higher expected earnings, the labor market activity of elite graduates with children is substantially lower than that of elite graduates without children, as well as substantially lower than that of graduates of less selective institutions. Most women eventually marry and have children, and the net effect is that labor market activity is on average lower among elite graduates than among those from less selective institutions. For example, the employment rate is 78 % among female graduates of the most selective institutions who are between ages 23 and 54 and is 84 % among comparable female graduates of less selective institutions. The primary difference in labor market activity by selectivity of institution arises among women who are married and have children ages 18 or younger. The employment rate for married mothers with children who are graduates of the most selective colleges is 68 %, in contrast to an employment rate of 76 % of those who are graduates of less selective colleges. Other measures of labor market activity such as labor force participation, full-time employment, part-time employment, and employment in two periods 18 months apart show similarly large disparities in labor market activity by college status. Furthermore, the disparity in labor market activity between graduates of elite colleges and less selective colleges is observed for women in three different age cohorts: ages 23–34, 35–44, and 45–54. Controls for detailed educational background, graduate degrees, current or previous occupation, number and age of children, spouse’s characteristics, and family background reduce but do not usually eliminate the disparity in labor market activity. The largest gap in labor market activity between graduates of elite versus non-elite schools occurs among those with MBAs. For example, married MBA mothers with a bachelor’s degree from the most selective schools are 30 percentage points less likely to be employed full-time than among those with a bachelor’s degree from a less selective school, controlling for selectivity of their MBA institution, current or prior occupation, spouse’s characteristics, number and age of children, and family background. This paper shows that married mothers who are graduates of elite colleges have lower labor market activity rates than their counterparts from less selective institutions.Footnote 7 Labor market exits among highly educated mothers are often interpreted as a response to inflexible workplaces that make combining family and career incompatible. But if inflexible workplaces are a primary cause of lesser labor market activity of mothers, labor market activity should not differ by college selectivity, or may even favor elite graduates. Other factors that may differ between elite and non-elite graduates, such as heterogeneity in preferences about market work, may be more influential determinants of labor market activity than inflexible workplaces.",23

Averett,Laura M. Argys,Julia Sorkin,Female,Female,Female,Female,"There is an extensive literature suggesting that marriage confers benefits to men and women in the form of increased earnings and improvements in mental and physical health and longevity.Footnote 1 In fact, empirical evidence indicates that the effect of marriage on longevity is likely to be greater than the effect of income on longevity (Gardner 2002). Yet, most of this research has focused on one or two specific measures of health or on particular health behaviors such as smoking or alcohol use and thus one can only make inferences regarding the effect of marriage on limited health outcomes. In addition, much of this research has focused solely on marriage, despite the fact that a growing number of adults choose to cohabit. Furthermore, much of the research in this area has been conducted using U.S. data. The U.S. tax code and the current U.S. health care system alter the incentives to marry (Alm and Whittington 1999) and the likelihood of obtaining health insurance (Zimmer 2007; Meyer and Pavalko 1996). Estimates of the effect of marriage on health using U.S. data are therefore specific to this institutional setting. In this paper, we extend research on the link between health and relationship status in three important ways. First, we use a single source of data to consider a wide array of health measures and indicators, including self-reported health, chronic conditions, physical limitations, a mental health score, BMI, and a number of health-related behaviors. Second, we examine not just the effect of marriage on health but the effects of relationship status defined more broadly to include cohabitation and divorce. Considering cohabitation is particularly important because although cohabiting partners are co-resident like married couples, the extent to which one cohabiting partner is willing to invest in the health of the other may be weakened by the absence of a legal commitment. Finally, we use the Canadian National Public Health Survey (NPHS), a longitudinal data set collected over eight cycles spanning the period from 1994 to 2008. An empirical study of the association between marital status and health in Canada will yield estimates in a different institutional setting. Some of these differences are related to the way in which the tax, health insurance and welfare systems are tied to marriage. In Canada health care is provided publically rather than primarily through employers as it is in the U.S. The public provision of health care in Canada means that marriage does not alter the likelihood of obtaining health insurance, eliminating any possible correlation between marriage and health occurring because of differential access to health care.Footnote 2 In addition, the U.S. tax code and welfare system provide marriage disincentives (such as the marriage tax) that are absent in Canadian policies.Footnote 3
 Perhaps as a response to these institutional differences combined with differences in social norms, Canadians exhibit different patterns of relationships compared to Americans. Most notably, a larger proportion of Canadians never marry—in 2006, 39.2% of men and 35.2% of women in Canada had never married whereas the corresponding percentages were 28.6 and 22.0% for the U.S. (Statistics Canada 2009; Statistical Abstract of the U.S 2007). Canadian data also affords the opportunity to examine the impact of cohabitation on health. Cohabitation in Canada is fairly common with nearly one in five Canadian couples unmarried and co-resident in 2006 (Institute of Marriage and Family Canada 2009). By comparison, 11.4% of couples in the U.S. were cohabiting in 2002 (Goodwin 2010). Similar to the U.S., Canada has seen a decline in marriage over time and a rise in cohabitation (Kerr 2006). There are several competing, but not mutually exclusive explanations that are consistent with a positive correlation between marriage and various measures of health status and longevity. First, the marriage selection hypothesis suggests that healthy people are selected into marriage because they make better marriage partners. According to this argument, an observed correlation between marital status and health is not causal—i.e. not a function of marriage per se but rather a function of the fact that marriage partners are chosen because they possess desirable characteristics; a set of characteristics that include mental and physical health. Lillard and Panis (1996) suggest that healthier people may have an easier time finding a partner and maintaining a relationship and so those who are healthier are most likely to be selected into marriage. A second explanation, the marriage protection hypothesis, suggests that marriage confers health benefits by encouraging healthy behaviors. Under this hypothesis, marriage improves health because married individuals have a spouse who can monitor their health behaviors, care for them when they are ill, and discourage them from engaging in risky behaviors, such as smoking and drinking (Thompson 1994; Waite and Gallagher 2000; Lee et al. 2005; Duncan et al. 2006; Ali 2011). A spouse also typically offers emotional support and provides a buffer during adverse life events. The provision of emotional support suggests a link between marriage and mental health that has been confirmed by the majority of studies of marriage and depression (Wood 2007). Married couples, by virtue of economies of scale and specialization in labor market and home production activities, have access to more material resources on a per capita basis than they would if they were single and, according to the Grossman (1972) model, these goods and services contribute to the production of health. This increased time availability due to gains from specialization and exchange allows for greater investments in health. If marriage has a protective effect, married people are healthier precisely because they are married; i.e. being married is the cause of better health. However, if marriage does improve health, the protective effect introduces the possibility that individuals in poor health are more likely to marry and less likely to divorce (Lillard and Panis 1996). Rather than the positive selection into marriage described above, this adverse selection argument introduces the possibility of a negative association between marriage and health. Another possible link between marital status and health may arise through the marriage market effect which also suggests a negative relationship between marriage and health. Because good health may be one aspect of attractiveness as a potential partner, single individuals may place a higher value on the benefits of investing in their health. Specifically, single individuals may spend more effort maintaining their health and fitness to attract a partner, and so the presence of a committed partner may reduce the need to carefully maintain one’s health and fitness and the absence of a current partner may increase investments in health. This effect has been found to be particularly pronounced for maintaining a healthy weight (Averett et al. 2008; Sobal et al. 2003; Lundborg et al. 2006). Married individuals in a stable relationship are more likely to be overweight or obese. Cohabitation may impact an individual’s health, though perhaps to a lesser extent than marriage. Cohabiters have some security in having a co-resident partner but also have a lower cost of exiting the union and therefore may behave as though they remain in the “marriage market.” Thus, cohabiting partners may feel greater pressure to maintain a healthier weight and better health across other dimensions than their married counterparts. They also may be less likely to invest in the relationship (i.e. provide the protective effect) if it is particularly time consuming and if they feel less committed to the union. One might expect that the absence of a partner implies that previously married individuals would have health outcomes similar to those of their never-married counterparts. However, research suggests that the stress associated with separation or divorce can have additional deleterious health consequences (Williams and Umberson 2004; Lorenz et al. 2006; Hughes and Waite 2009). We examine the impact of these non-partnered relationship statuses separately. Furthermore, we expect that the association between marital status and health may differ for men and women and in keeping with other research we estimate our models separately by sex. An extensive literature links marriage to health outcomes and longevity (see Kiecolt-Glaser and Newton 2001; Wilson and Oswald 2005; and Wood 2007 for recent reviews). The general consensus from this literature has been that where marriage is beneficial, these benefits accrue primarily to men. We focus our review of the literature on those studies that examine health outcomes as opposed to longevity since health outcomes are the focus of our research. The typical empirical approach in this literature is to control for selection into marital status by estimating a difference or fixed-effects model. These models examine the effect of marital status on health by comparing health outcomes before and after a marital status change. In this literature, the most widely used measure of health is “self-assessed health” in which respondents are asked to rate their health on a five-point ordinal scale ranging from ‘excellent’ to ‘very poor’. Self-rated health has been shown to be highly correlated with observed health across individuals as measured by the presence of various conditions (Ferraro and Farmer 1999), but an individual’s health scale has not been found to respond noticeably to subtle changes in health from year to year (Wood 2007). There are both theoretical issues (e.g. framing, reference bias) and econometric problems (e.g. the incidental parameters problem) associated with using this ordered discrete variable in econometric analyses.Footnote 4 Although there has been a common perception in the literature that marriage is good for health, particularly for the health of men, studies that have used self-assessed health have not always found that to be the case. Specifically, Wu and Hart (2002), using two waves of the Canadian NPHS, found that after netting out the effect of selection into marriage by estimating a difference model and after controlling for protection effects by including measures of social networks and social contacts in their models, staying married or cohabiting generally resulted in poorer self-assessed health and mental health than remaining single for both men and women. They speculate that this may be due to declining quality of the marriage over time. They also reported that the transition out of marriage reduces physical and mental health in men and increases depression among women. Williams and Umberson (2004), using three waves of the U.S. based American’s Changing Lives Survey, found that for men the transition into marriage is associated with a significant improvement in self-rated health and marital dissolution results in a decline in self-rated health for men over 50. There was no evidence in their work that transitioning into or out of marriage altered self-rated health among women. In addition to self-assessed health, a number of studies have examined the relationship between marital status and a variety of objective measures of physical health. For example, Lorenz et al. (2006) found that divorced women reported significantly worse physical health than women who had remained married, where physical health is measured by number of specific illnesses (common colds, sore throats) and diagnosed health conditions (asthma, diabetes). A link between marriage and cardiovascular disease has been confirmed by Molloy et al. (2009) who find that single men and divorced women are more likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease compared to their married counterparts. Even when the focus is on a single health outcome or behavior, the results are often mixed. For example, Duncan et al. (2006) find no evidence that entry into marriage reduces the likelihood of smoking. In fact, the study finds that women are actually more likely to smoke after entry into marriage. However, Thompson’s (1994) study, which used data from the Canadian NPHS to look at the patterns of smoking intensity and changes in marital status, seems to suggest that transitions into marriage are associated with higher rates of smoking cessation. Similarly, Lee et al. (2005) find that marriage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking among older female nurses. Duncan et al. (2006) find that marriage reduced alcohol and marijuana use particularly for men. All of these studies used fixed effects or differencing to control for selection into marital status. Past studies that examine the effect of marriage on levels of depression are largely consistent in finding that marriage is associated with reductions in depressive symptoms and that marital dissolution increases symptoms of depression, particularly for women (Kim and McKenry 2002). Furthermore, in a study conducted by McDonough et al. (2003) using data from the Canadian NPHS, married women were found to report lower levels of depression, while formerly married women fared the worst in terms of depression and long standing health conditions. In the case of weight management, studies uniformly have found a negative effect of marriage on health. Although there is evidence that thinner women are selected into marriage, recent evidence confirms that marriage leads to modest weight gain of less than five pounds for both men and women (Sobal et al. 2003; Averett et al. 2008). These studies suggest that this weight gain increases the probability that an individual is classified as overweight or obese. Cross country studies suggest that where divorce rates are higher, average BMI is lower (Lundborg et al. 2006). While the majority of the studies above have focused on marriage, a few studies have also begun to examine whether similar benefits accrue to those who cohabit. The evidence regarding whether cohabitation is associated with a similar pattern of health benefits, however, is mixed. There are a number of studies that establish that the financial and health benefits of having a partner are somewhat unique to marriage perhaps because, as we discussed earlier, married individuals are more likely to invest in relationship-specific human capital (Waite and Gallagher 2000). It may also be the case that cohabiters are more likely to be risk-takers or have different attitudes towards relationships than those who marry (Wu and Hart 2002). Research also shows that in the U.S., cohabiters behave more like singles than married individuals (Rindfuss and VandenHeuvel 1990), and Winkler (1997) reports that cohabiters do not pool all their income. In Canada, there is a provincial divide in the prevalence and nature of cohabitation. In Quebec, cohabitation is viewed as nearly indistinquishable from marriage whereas in other provinces it is still predominantly a union that does not include children (Le Bourdais and Lapierre-Adamcyk 2004; Kerr 2006). Cohabiters in Quebec have similar socioeconomic characteristics when compared to those who are married and in that sense, they are more like those who cohabit in the Nordic countries. In the other provinces, cohabiters have a comparable median income compared to married women and slightly higher levels of labor force participation, yet at the same time cohabiters face a greater likelihood of living in poverty, more similar in most ways to the U.S. (Kerr 2006). To capture these differences we estimate our models with provincial fixed effects. Despite some empirical evidence that the health benefits of cohabitation are smaller than those conferred by marriage (Kim and McKenry 2002), other research suggests that the type of union does not matter (Lillard and Panis 1996). We know of only one other study that examines the potential health benefits of cohabiting versus marriage in Canada and this study only used 2 years of data and only considered self-reported health, mental health and physical limitations (Wu and Hart 2002). Two studies are notable because they make use of methods other than fixed effects to control for selection into marriage. Lillard and Panis (1996) use longitudinal data from more than 4,000 men from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine the link between marital status and mortality. To untangle selection into and out of marriage from the protection effect of marriage they estimate a system of simultaneous equations of mortality, health, marriage formation, and marriage dissolution. This method, while appealing because it directly controls for selection, hinges on instruments that determine marital status but which are unrelated to health. They find that married persons do live longer and that there is adverse selection based on health for men (sicker men remarry more quickly) but positive selection into marriage based on unobservables. Ali (2011) use a propensity score matching methodology to account for potential selection bias. Their results show that marriage does lead to a reduction in risky behaviors, specifically drinking and drug use for African Americans. Their sample encompasses a narrower age range because they use data from the third wave of the National Longitudinal Survey of Health whose respondents are aged 18–27 years. To examine the link between relationship status and health empirically we use data from the Canadian NPHS, a longitudinal study focused on the health of the Canadian population. The survey was first fielded in 1994 and 1995 and has been conducted biennially since that time. We use data through the 2008 interview in our analyses. Although limited health-related information was gathered on all residents in selected households, one household member, greater than 12 years of age, was chosen at random to become the longitudinal panel respondent who would provide detailed health information every other year. The initial response rate for Cycle 1 was 83.6%, resulting in a participant pool of 17,276 panel respondents. We take advantage of the longitudinal nature of the survey to create a data set that includes individuals in each year that they provided complete data.Footnote 5 We include individuals who are between the ages of 18 and 80 during the sample period, yielding an initial sample of 16,230 individuals. Accounting for the missing data among these respondents leaves 15,779 individuals eligible for inclusion in our analysis.Footnote 6
 We follow an empirical approach that is often used in the literature on marriage and wages to disentangle selection effects from other potentially causal effects of marriage on earnings. Our interest lies in determining whether or not marriage confers protective health effects after selection has been netted out so we take advantage of the longitudinal nature of the data to estimate fixed-effects models as shown in Eq. 1: where the dependent variable is a measure of the health of individual i at survey t. The primary independent variables of interest are in M
it, a vector of dichotomous variables indicating the individual’s relationship status at time t. Relationship status variables are classified into one of six categories: (1) never married; (2) married; (3) divorced; (4) cohabiting; (5) widowed; or (6) separated. The omitted category in our analysis is never married. The vector X
it includes other potentially important socio-demographic determinants of health such as age and age squared, education, income, the presence of children,Footnote 7 and province of residence for each individual at time t. It is crucial to control for age in all of our models since chronic conditions and health problems typically become more common with age, and spells of marriage and particularly divorce and widowhood occur at older ages. T

t
 is a set of dichotomous year indicators. Finally, our preferred models include δ
i
, a vector of individual-level fixed effects so that our estimates are not confounded by unobserved time-invariant factors. This method estimates the effect of changes in an individual’s relationship status on changes in his health status. These models net out the fact that some individuals may be genetically predisposed to better health or have underlying attitudes toward health behaviors that do not vary over time. We recognize that fixed-effects models do not address reverse causality, and hence this model cannot account for changes in marital status that may result from changes in health or for unobservable time varying health-related factors. However, given the difficulties in finding credible instrumental variables for marital status and because we know that OLS models provide no opportunity to untangle selection from protection (i.e. causal) effects; fixed-effects models are our preferred empirical method.Footnote 8
 The Canadian NPHS is well-suited to our study since it includes repeated measures of relationship status and a wide array of health indicators and health-related behaviors in each cycle in addition to a rich set of socio-demographic variables. The use of the NPHS for our study does have some drawbacks, however. In particular, although we know the current relationship status of the respondent at the time of each interview, the NPHS does not collect information on the timing of marital events between the 2-year survey periods. Thus, we do not know what marital events occur between surveys. Within the space of 2 years, multiple marital transitions are possible—i.e. someone could divorce, cohabit and remarry in the time between surveys. A recent study by Statistics Canada notes that most Canadians marry only once, and fewer than 1% marry more than twice (NorthernLife.ca 2007). Since the NPHS surveys occur only 2 years apart, the impact of unobserved transitions is likely to be small. Tables 1a, b report the mean socio-demographic characteristics of our person-year samples by the marital status of male and female respondents at the time of each survey. The patterns that are evident in these tables are as expected with respect to age, children, income and education. Never-married individuals are substantially younger than those who are or have been in a partnered relationship. The oldest group in our sample is those who are widowed. The sample of divorced men, just over 51 years old on average, are followed closely in age by those who are currently married or separated. In contrast, the average age is 32 for the years in which we observe men who had not yet married. Respondents report higher income when married and cohabiting than in non-partnered relationship statuses.Footnote 9 Married and cohabiting men are most likely to have university degrees while for women, the highest percentage with a university degree are those who are never married. The NPHS provides only summary measures of the number of children in the household. We include a dichotomous indicator of the presence of children under the age of 12. Over one-quarter of married, cohabiting and separated women live with children under 12. Although fewer never-married women are parents living with children, nevertheless, 10% of these women have children under 12. Like women, over one-quarter of married and cohabiting men live with their children under the age of 12. However, for men, the presence of children is much more closely tied to the presence of a partner. Far fewer than 10% of divorced, separated, widowed, and never-married men live with their young children. As noted earlier, researchers examining the link between marital status and health have used a myriad of different measures of health or health behaviors, different data sets in different contexts and different methodologies in their analyses making the comparison of findings across studies difficult. Because of the rich set of health behaviors and indicators available in the NPHS, we are able to compare the association between relationship status and a variety of health indicators and behaviors using a single model specification and sample. Table 2 describes the measures of health indicators and health behaviors used in our analyses. The NPHS asks respondents to rate their general physical and mental health at the time of each survey and then to provide more detailed health information. Health indicators used in our analysis include self-rated health, mental health scores, chronic conditions and physical limitations. Respondents are asked to rate their health on a scale of one to five, ranging from excellent to poor. Because treating Likert-scale responses as a continuous dependent variable creates difficulty in interpretation, we conduct our analysis on a dichotomous indicator of poor or fair health.Footnote 10
 Mental health is assessed by a battery of questions included in the NPHS surveys that have been shown to identify nonspecific distress (Kessler et al. 2003). The K6 scale is created by summing responses to six questions about the frequency that a respondent reported feeling sad, nervous, restless or fidgety, hopeless, worthless, and that everything is an effort. Summing five possible responses, categorized from 0 to 4, to six questions yields a score that ranges from 0 to 24. The scale used in our analysis takes on higher values as the frequency of these depression-related feelings increases. We conduct our analysis using both the score itself and a dichotomous indicator of depression indicated by a score above 18 (see Table 2 for details). NPHS respondents also answer a series of questions indicating whether they have had problems due to a stroke, ulcers, cancer, bronchitis, migraines, high blood pressure, back problems, diabetes or heart disease and we conduct our analysis on an indicator of the presence of any such chronic condition, and, for those who report at least one, the number of chronic conditions reported. Each of these conditions can vary over time and may be responsive to changes in marital status. We create similar measures of physical limitations. Respondents are asked about whether they have vision, hearing, speech, mobility, dexterity, cognition, or pain problems. From these reports we create an indicator of the presence of any physical limitation and also for those with a limitation, a count of the number of limitations reported. In addition to the health indicators described above, we also conduct analyses on weight and health-related behaviors. NPHS respondents indicate their height and weight as part of the annual survey and then report how often they engage in various health-related behaviors such as exercise and the consumption of alcohol and cigarettes. We conduct our analysis of the impact of changes in marital status on changes in BMI,Footnote 11 on changes in dichotomous indicators of whether an individual is overweight or obese, and on changes in an indicator of whether or not an individual engages in regular exercise. We also examine the association between relationship status and whether the individual frequently used alcohol or cigarettes in the past year. Tables 3a, b present the means of the health indicators and health-related behaviors for our samples of men and women divided into subsamples based on their relationship status at the time of their interview. Each of the health measures is coded so that higher values indicate adverse health conditions or behaviors that adversely affect health. In general, individuals who are no longer in a partnered relationship are more likely to report poor health or engage in behaviors that put their health at risk. Specifically, divorced, widowed, and separated respondents are most likely to rate their own health as poor or fair, as compared to good, very good or excellent. Individuals who have experienced the dissolution of a relationship are also more likely to report the presence of a chronic condition and physical limitation. This pattern is consistent with a protective effect of marriage on health. However, the lower levels of poor health, chronic conditions, and limitations reported by never-married respondents suggest that these health patterns may simply reflect the substantial differences in age (and other characteristics) across relationship statuses. We examine these patterns in more detail and account for the effect of these covariates in our regression analyses.",50

Allen,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The matter of same-sex marriage is perhaps the most significant policy issue in family law since the introduction of no-fault divorce in the late 1960s and 1970s. Much of the debate is focused on the question of equality, although issues of relationship stability, consequences for opposite sex marriages, and marriage culture are often brought up. One aspect that is seldom argued is the effect a same-sex union might have on the children within that union. The absence of any discussion on children no doubt reflects the unanimous consensus in the child development literature on this question—it makes no difference. Within the last 15 years there have been over fifty empirical studies considering the effects on children of growing up within a same-sex household.Footnote 1 Despite the various differences in each study, all but a couple have the same conclusion: children of same-sex parents perform at least as well as children from heterosexual families. This conclusion, that there is no difference in child outcomes based on family structure, has played a major role in legal cases, legislation, popular culture, and professional opinions on gay family rights—including rights to adoption and marriage.Footnote 2 As Justice Walker claimed, to suggest otherwise is to risk not being taken seriously. Unfortunately, the literature on child development in same-sex households is lacking on several grounds.Footnote 3 First, the research is characterized by levels of advocacy, policy endorsement, and awareness of political consequences, that is disproportionate with the strength and substance of the preliminary empirical findings. Second, the literature generally utilizes measures of child and family performance that are not easily verifiable by third party replication, which vary from one study to another in ways that make comparisons difficult, and which differ substantially from measures standardly used in other family studies.Footnote 4 But most important, almost all of the literature on same-sex parenting (which almost always means lesbian parenting) is based on some combination of weak empirical designs, small biased convenience samples, “snowballing,” and low powered tests.Footnote 5
 This paper addresses these shortcomings by using the 2006 Canada census to study high school graduation probabilities of children who lived with both gay and lesbian parents in 2006, and to compare them with four other family types: married, common law, single mothers, and single fathers. Currently, the 2006 Canada census has several strengths compared to any other data set. First, it uses information from a country where same-sex couples have enjoyed all taxation and government benefits since 1997, and legal same-sex marriage since 2005.Footnote 6 As Biblarz and Savci note, such legalization reduces the stress and stigma of homosexuality, and encourages honest participation in census questions.Footnote 7 Second, not only does the census provide a large random sample, but married and common law same-sex couples and their children are self identified.
Footnote 8 This is an important advantage over the US census. Third, because the child and parent records are linked together, the marital status and educational levels of the parents can be controlled for when analyzing child performance. Finally, because of the relatively large sample size, there is enough power to not only separate gay from lesbian households, but also enough to examine the gender mix of same-sex households.Footnote 9
 The point estimates for high school graduation show that there is a significant reduction in the odds of children living in same-sex homes completing high school. In the case of gay parents, children are estimated to be 69 % as likely to graduate compared to children from opposite sex married homes.Footnote 10 For lesbian households the children are 60 % as likely to graduate from high school. A breakdown of performance by the sex of the child shows a more dramatic result. Daughters of gay parents are only 15 % as likely to graduate, while daughters of lesbian parents are 45 % as likely to graduate. Both sets of results are estimated with precision. On the other hand, sons of lesbian parents are 76 % as likely to graduate, while sons of gay parents are 61 % more likely to graduate. However, neither of these results are statistically significant. In general, the results for gays and lesbians respond differently to different controls, and differ from the results for the other family types. This, and the different graduation rates for sons and daughters, suggest that the two types of same-sex couples are much different and should not be categorized together in empirical work. These results survive several robustness checks. Graduation rates may be different because school attendance rates are different, yet no statistical difference in the probability of attending school across the different family types is found. In fact, the point estimates indicate children of opposite-sex married parents are less likely to attend school. Various changes in sample restrictions and controls also leave the results unchanged.",32

Luke Shaefer,Xiaoqing Song,Trina R. Williams Shanks,Unknown,Unknown,Female,Female,"The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit for low-income workers. It is mainly targeted toward low-income families with children with incomes up to about twice the poverty line. To beneficiaries, the credit represents a large, annual, tax-free income transfer. Only a few studies, though, have examined how beneficiaries allocate their EITC. Most utilize evidence from non-representative surveys of recipients (Smeeding et al. 2000; Rhine et al. 2005; Spader et al. 2005; Mendenhall et al. 2010; Romich and Weisner 2000). A few analyze nationally representative data to compare groups that include likely beneficiaries, such as single mothers, to groups that are unlikely to benefit, such as single childless women (Meyer and Sullivan 2004; Barrow and McGranahan 2000). We extend this line of research by using the Survey of Income and Program Participation’s (SIPP) topical modules on Assets and Liabilities to examine associations between the major EITC expansions of the 1990s and the unsecured debt of households of working-age single mothers, during the years 1988–1999. We utilize a difference-in-differences approach, with two separate comparisons that have been used extensively in the literature to examine the effects of the EITC. First we compare the unsecured debt of single mothers to single childless women, over time. Then we compare the unsecured debt of single mothers with two or more children (who received a larger EITC increase during our study period) to those with exactly one child. In both cases, we find evidence that the EITC expansions are associated with a relative decline in unsecured debt among households of single mothers during this period. While not direct evidence of a causal relationship, our findings are suggestive evidence that single mothers may have used some portion of their EITC to limit the growth of unsecured debt, bucking the national trend of rising unsecured debt during our study time period.",29

A common thread that emerges from all the articles is the importance of considering the gender dimension when using research results for evidence-based policy. For example, questions such as how to achieve gender equality can only be answered by looking at what goes on inside the household vis-à-vis the market. In this line, the paper by Stancanelli and Bloemen proposes increases in men’s housework as the only viable alternative to achieve real equality in a context of increasing female opportunities in the labor market coupled with market failures in the markets for childcare and household services. Reich, Boll, and Leppin offer a way to increase men’s child care by assessing to what extent parental leave policies increase fathers’ time, and what aspects of these policies are particularly relevant. Zaiceva and Zimmermann’s findings show that women’s child care is not responsive to ethnicity considerations, which supports the view that childcare time is different from pure housework: it may have an investment component that needs to be taken into consideration (Guryan et al. 2008). Addressing these questions would have not been possible without time-use diaries in which respondents report not only times in certain activities, but also when the activity takes place. The information on how individuals use their time from surveys based on stylized questions asking respondents to estimate time in activities on a “typical day” do not provide reliable answers on individual child care and leisure time. Obtaining non-biased responses on how spouses allocate their time to different market and non-market activities from these kind of data is similarly challenging. Diaries are increasingly becoming the gold standard in gathering information on time spent on market work, non-market work and leisure in a similar way that money expenditure diaries have become the preferred method to gather information on expenditure levels in the consumption literature. It is precisely because the diary gives information on timing, and not just how long the activity lasts that the paper by Jay Stewart can identify whether sleep deprivation comes in the mornings or at night. This information is crucial for the design of policies aimed at increasing children sleep. Despite these advances, important challenges remain which limit researchers’ ability to inform public policy by making use of time diary data. By not using time diary data, two of the articles in this special issue—the pieces by Matsumoto and Rahim—highlight the importance of collecting more comprehensive time diary data to answer further fundamental questions. First, there is a lack of longitudinal time diary data: most existing cross-sectional surveys can leave up to 10 years to be repeated (a nice exception is the American Time Use Survey, which runs biannually). It thus continues to be difficult to follow individuals’ use of time over long periods, and to track down the effect of a policy that takes place at a particular point in time. Similarly, detailed time diary data on activities that are not performed on a regular basis remains problematic. For example, what is the interplay between attitudes and actual behavior? Can the results in Fazeer’s paper be explained by career-oriented mothers self-selecting into more egalitarian marriages with partners who contribute more to household production, thus making it easier for mothers to continue working? Similarly, some household surveys ask for the frequency of particular activities, but generally miss issues of amount of time, timing, and when the activity takes place. Whereas Matsumoto’s paper is informative in providing an extensive margin estimate from information on how often an individual engages in pro-environmental behavior, we are left short of knowing the intensive margin- namely, how much more time? Answering this question is arguably more interesting from a policy perspective. Time diary data containing attitudinal information, and a thorough break down of activities with frequency data, could provide an invaluable resource. Some of the papers in this special issue were presented at the 33rd IATUR Conference on Time Use Research, which took place at Oxford University in August 2011. The conference reflected the multidisciplinary nature of time use research, bringing together more than 200 presenters and discussants from a variety of countries and disciplines, including a larger number of economists than had been the case at previous IATUR conferences. This issue reflects this cross-disciplinary nature of time use research and includes contributions from other social sciences, namely the papers by Geshuny and Sullivan, and Reich, Boll, and Leppin. In doing so, it identifies gains from interdisciplinary dialogue and uncovers common overlaps and complementarities. In particular, some of the economic research presented here, such as the paper by Stancanelli and Bloemen, is motivated by descriptive evidence on the gender division of labor observed in the sociological literature presented in Gershuny and Sullivan’s article. The international nature of the research also manifests itself in this issue. Most papers refer to one country, but common patterns usually found in the literature are replicated here, such as the gendered division of home labor, and the shift to home production during an economic downturn. The paper by Reich, Boll, and Leppin is the only paper using cross-country diary data. The ability to confidently compare time diary data from multiple sources across a variety of countries and spanning more than five decades is only possible thanks to the pioneering work of Jonathan Gershuny. Gershuny first started the harmonization work that eventually became the Multinational Time Use Study (MTUS) in the mid 1980s (Gershuny and Robinson 1988). The MTUS has since grown to offer harmonized episode and context information and to encompass over 60 datasets from 25 countries, including recent data from the Harmonized European Time Use Studies, American Time Use Survey, and other national level time use projects. Recent economic research documenting long-term trends in how individuals use their time in the industrialized world are now based on this valuable resource (e.g. Gimenez-Nadal and Sevilla 2012). Encouraging time diary surveys in developing countries at a representative scale remains one of the future challenges of time use research.

12.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,03 January 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-013-9234-5,"Household structure and housework: assessing the contributions of all household members, with a focus on children and youths",March 2014,Jonathan Gershuny,Oriel Sullivan,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Despite voluminous research on the domestic labor done within households it is rare to see papers which focus directly on actual household structures, describing the joint domestic labor of the whole household. In this paper we: (1) analyze separately the housework of all the members of specific types of household; (2) focus on one specific household type—couples with two dependent children—to show the combined contributions of older children and youths to household housework; (3) present a variance decomposition model which compares the effectiveness of aggregated with multi-level type composite models of household structure in the prediction of the housework time of all the household. We suggest that there are three principal reasons for the relative paucity of literature on the joint domestic labor of all the members of households, one substantive, one methodological and one data-related. First, there is a strong emphasis on heterosexual couples in research on the domestic division of labor, with the presence of other individuals in the household (such as children, spouses, or other adults) treated analytically as independent ‘environmental factors’. This focus reflects a pervasive tradition of sociological and economic theory centering on heterosexual marital relations (Ferree 2010). Heterosexual couple households have been the primary location for the development of a range of diverse theories of the household, including both economic bargaining and ‘doing gender’. This tradition embraces research on household economics, marital power, relative resources, economic exchange, time availability, and gender deviance neutralization, among others. While these perspectives are diverse and sometimes conflicting in their conclusions, they almost always share a focus on couples. The second reason lies in the daunting analytical complexity arising from the multiplicity of potential household types, combined with the variety of responsibilities attached to the different structural positions within them (e.g. mother, father, daughter, son, lodger, dependent relative). Linked to this is the third reason—the fact that the data requirement for the analysis of whole household unpaid work is very onerous, while that for the analysis of couples is far less demanding. For the analysis of couples the minimum possible information consists of a report on self and partners’ domestic labor from a single informant within a household—as in the US PSID. Any high quality whole-household domestic labor analysis, by contrast, requires information provided separately but simultaneously on the time spent in domestic labor by all the members of a household who contribute any domestic labor. Surprisingly—but sadly under-utilized for this purpose—such datasets do exist, based on large national random samples of time use data, for at least a dozen countries in Europe, and for Australia and Canada. The Harmonised European Time Use Study (HETUS—Eurostat 2009) provides data for the period 1999–2004; similar data are now emerging from the second (2009 onwards) tranche of HETUS data collection. In analysis of the UK 2000/1 UK time use survey we find that a relatively few household types—an analytically manageable subset of the full potential range—include 95 % of all household members. Our strategy in this article involves selecting the four most common of these household types (non-parent, non-couple households; single mothers; couples without dependent children and couples with different numbers and combinations of children) and describing, for each type of household, the housework contributions of each of its members. The underlying assumption is that we expect the contributions to (and burdens imposed on) unpaid household work of household members in the same structural position to vary across household types. This enables us to make a key contribution to the literature by identifying the burdens and the contributions associated with each structural position in the different types of household. An important feature of the household types that we analyze is that they include children’s and youth’s contributions to housework. Despite an early estimate by Goldscheider and Waite (1991) that children’s and youths’ housework contribution was quite substantial, summing to 15 % of all housework, there has not been a great volume of research based on large-scale data that focuses directly on this issue. Hofferth and Sandberg (2001) and Bianchi et al. (2006) included reference to children’s housework contributions as part of wider analyses of children’s time use, and papers focusing directly on the topic by Lee, Schneider and Waite (2003) and Cheal (2003) confirmed gender, age and number of other siblings as important discriminators in the analysis of children’s contributions to domestic labor. A more recent analysis of the relationship between family stress, time availability and children’s contributions to housework by Gager et al. (2009) supported these findings as well as detecting an additional factor relating to family stress. These studies indicate that being female, being older and having more siblings are associated with higher levels of contributions from children and youths. Álvarez and Miles-Touya (2012) have recently extended the scope of analysis by using household time use diary data to investigate the contributions of sons and daughters according to the gender norms of their parents. They found increased contributions, particularly among sons, in households where the father participated more in female-typed housework tasks. We propose an analytic strategy which focuses on specific types of household, treating children and others within it as equal members, both contributing to and creating overall household domestic labor. We look in particular at the contributions of older children and youths of different ages and genders to housework, rather than just the housework burden they impose on parents. In keeping with the results of previous research we show that the contributions of children and youths are substantial and should routinely be taken into account in investigations of the division of household domestic labor. The contribution we make is to focus on the comparison of the housework of households that include different household structural combinations of children and youths of varying ages and genders, illuminating the detail of their combined effects in different types of household. This analysis of the contributions of different household members within specific types of household structure is not the same as the standard aggregate multivariate analysis of household domestic labor, in which household type, and the gender and the number of household members in different age groups are included among the independent variables. We assume that the behavior of individuals holding particular structural locations within the household (e.g. mother, father, son, daughter) will vary across different household compositions—in other words that there are important interactions between household type and the structural positions of individuals within particular types of households. For example, adolescent daughters with siblings in couple households behave differently to similarly–aged daughters where there are no other dependent children, or in otherwise similar households headed by a single mother. Therefore, an aggregate model using parents as the cases and the number of children in different age-groups as independent variables in the usual way will suffer from what we term ‘interaction heterogeneity’. ‘Heterogeneity’ in an analytic model is commonly taken to mean variation due to variables not included in the model; ‘unobserved heterogeneity’ is where the sources of that variation are not even measured. We extend this terminology to refer to ‘interaction heterogeneity’; i.e. the variation due to interaction terms which are not included in the model, such as the interaction effects between the housework of siblings of different ages and genders, or the difference in the housework contributions of a teenage daughter in a parent-couple as opposed to a single-parent household. As we demonstrate, analysis of the interactions of individual structural positions adds considerably to our understanding of the domestic division of labor. This research builds upon a limited body of previous work which has included multiple interactions between household members in the assessment of household work (e.g. Abroms and Goldsheider 2002). While we focus in this paper on the most common types of UK household in order to illustrate our analytic strategy, it should be noted that this approach allows flexibility in the choice of household compositions to be analyzed, both according to the interests of the research, and as the changing demographics of households and families play out over time (Cherlin 2010). In the following sections of the paper we first select parent couple households containing various combinations of ages and genders of children and youths in order to illustrate their differing contributions within different household structures. We then set out our analytic strategy and the data we use, before turning to an investigation of the housework contributions of the different structural positions within households using a combination of disaggregated regression analyses and decomposition of variance analysis.

12.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,09 May 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-013-9182-0,"Early to bed and earlier to rise: school, maternal employment, and children’s sleep",March 2014,Jay Stewart,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"School-age children need a lot of sleep—between 10 and 11 h each night.Footnote 1 Sleep is important for children’s cognitive development and their general health, and it has been well-documented that lack of sleep leads to diminished cognitive performance and that people who sleep less are more likely to be overweight or obese (Gangwisch et al. 2005). Although there is relatively little research on the effects of sleep loss on school-age children, the studies that have been conducted have found that sleep loss is detrimental. An experimental study by Fallone et al. (2005) systematically varied the amount of time that children slept each night, and then obtained reports from their teachers. These researchers found that attention problems increased and academic performance decreased when children got less sleep. Another study (Epstein et al. 1998) found that children who started school earlier (and who got less sleep) were more likely to be sleepy and have difficulty concentrating during school compared with children who started later. In this study, I examine two factors—school and maternal employment—that can potentially affect the amount of time that school-age children sleep. A large literature has examined the effect of school start times on the academic performance of high school students,Footnote 2 but the Epstein et al. (1998) study is the only one that examines the effect on younger students. Earlier school start times can adversely affect school performance if children get less sleep or if their normal sleep patterns (which are regulated by the release of melatonin) are disrupted because they have to wake up earlier. Maternal employment can affect children’s sleep time if children stay up later to spend time with their parents after work or wake up earlier to be taken to before-school care or summer camp before their mothers go to work. An examination of the effect of school on the sleep patterns of school-age students potentially has implications for school districts’ policies on start times. So far, most of the research on school start times has focused on high school students. Although high school students need less sleep than younger children, their biological clocks are such that they prefer afternoons and evenings to mornings. Thus the early start times of many high schools conflict with teenagers’ natural tendency to stay up late and then sleep-in in the morning.Footnote 3 There is evidence that the “delayed phase” sleep of adolescents is due more to biological rather than social factors,Footnote 4 which suggests that teens do not compensate for early school start times by going to bed earlier. Thus, the effects of the later start time on academic performance can come through two channels: (1) teens get more sleep and (2) the timing of their sleep is more compatible with their biological clocks. The latter suggests that allowing teens to sleep later should improve academic performance even if they do not get any additional sleep. If we observe that school-age children sleep less because they wake up earlier on school days, then school systems may want to reassess school start times for these students as well. There has been relatively little research on the effect of maternal employment on children’s sleep patterns, but there are at least two good reasons to study this. First, if children of employed mothers sleep less, then sleep is a possible mechanism by which maternal employment affects child outcomes.Footnote 5 Most of the research on mechanisms has used time-diary data to analyze the amount of time parents spend in activities that are thought to affect child outcomes. Cawley and Liu (2007a) find that employed parents spend less time helping their children with homework and in other educational activities. And Stewart (2010) finds that full-time employed mothers of pre-school-age children shift enriching childcare activities to times that are later in the day, when children are more tired and less able to benefit from those activities.Footnote 6 Second, if mothers’ employment does affect their children’s sleep times during the school year, then later school start times may not benefit the children of employed mothers. If the children of working mothers are dropped off at before-school care on the way to work, then later start times will not result in these children getting more sleep. Instead they would simply spend more time in before-school care. The research conducted to date suggests that children with employed mothers do sleep less. Hofferth and Sandberg (2001) used the Child Development Supplement (CDS) to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to examine how much time children spend in various activities. Although their study did not focus on sleep, their regressions showed that children with employed mothers slept less than children whose mothers did not work. A study by Hale et al. (2009) examined the determinants of bed time routines. These authors focused mainly on the demographic characteristics of household members, but also included a variable for maternal employment. The coefficient on that variable indicated that pre-school age children with working mothers went to bed later than children whose mothers did not work, although the effect was rather small and only marginally significant. This study fills several voids. It is the first study that I am aware of to examine the effects of school and maternal employment on the sleep time of school-age children. In addition to looking at the total amount of time that children sleep, I look at wake-up and bed times because policy implications may be different depending on whether children lose sleep in the morning or the evening. If children lose sleep on school days because they wake up earlier, then school districts may want to reexamine their start times. But if the effect is in the evening, then it may be more appropriate to look at homework policies. The studies that examine maternal employment and child sleep consider only total sleep time (Hofferth and Sandberg, 2001) or bed times (Hale et al. 2009). By examining both wake-up and bed times, I can get a clearer picture of employment (and school) effects. I also allow for the possibility that the effect of maternal employment may be different in the summer than during the school year. It is important to distinguish between the school year and the summer, because it is possible that any effect of maternal employment on sleep is overshadowed by school effects. But even if school is the dominant influence, mothers’ work schedules may limit the benefit that students might receive from adjusting school start times. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, I describe my data, and take a first look at school children’s sleep patterns. Next, I estimate the effect of school and maternal employment on children’s sleep time. I identify the school effect by comparing school days (nights) to non-school days (nights) during the school year. Whether a day is a school day is clearly exogenous, but it is possible that children sleep longer on weekends to make up for sleep lost during the school week. Because this would bias my estimates, I examine the validity of using non-school days (nights) during the school year as a control by considering other possible comparisons. I make a similar comparison to examine the effects of maternal employment on children’s sleep. Here the case for exogeneity is less clear. Mothers clearly choose whether or not to work and likely have some control over their work schedules (at least ex ante). But the maternal employment decision can plausibly be considered to be exogenous if their children’s sleep patterns are not a key consideration. The final section concludes.",8

Zimmermann,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The integration of immigrants and ethnic minorities is one of the major concerns in many European countries. An efficient integration of ethnic minority women into the labor market is essential for fulfilling the targets of full employment and sustainable growth. In stark contrast to this goal, however, the scientific literature documents that gender differences are often more pronounced among immigrants and ethnic minorities than natives.Footnote 1 In the United Kingdom, for example, white immigrants perform comparatively well, or even better, than native-born whites. However, some ethnic minority groups often experience worse labor market outcomes than natives, with Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Blacks being the most disadvantaged groups (Blackaby et al. 2002; Simpson et al. 2006). Women fare particularly badly, with the employment rate of all ethnic minority women being generally much lower than for white natives. The existing literature indicates that this relative disadvantage might originate from cultural and religious differences. As ethnic diversity can be both a ‘burden’ and a ‘potential’, it is important to understand the integration and acculturation processes ethnic minorities experience as well as the persistence of ethnicity and factors behind ethnic identities (Zimmermann 2007). When studying the integration of immigrants and ethnic minorities, economists have usually focused on labor market outcomes or, in other cases, on health, housing decisions, fertility or family formation and structure. With the exception of work hours, immigrants’ and ethnic minorities’ use of time has not been sufficiently studied by economists (Ribar 2013). However, ethnic differences in the allocation of non-market time are important, as they may shed more light on the integration level of ethnic minorities and on the factors that affect both household productivity and ethnic identity. This paper attempts to rectify this and to fill the gap in the literature by analyzing ethnic differences in the uses of non-market time in the United Kingdom. An individual’s use of time can be viewed as another dimension of individual manifestation of his or her ethnic identity; and as such, there may also be differences between whites and non-whites (and between different non-white minorities) in how non-market time is allocated. It is important to understand how immigrants and ethnic minorities set their time budgets. Since ethnic minorities are likely to have different socio-cultural norms and preferences, gender role attitudes, productivity as well as different costs—including the opportunity costs of time—it is also likely that they will have a different time allocation behaviour. Thus, the way ethnic minorities spend their non-market time may contribute to a better understanding of the factors behind their integration. Economic integration goes hand-in-hand with social or cultural integration (Constant and Zimmermann 2011; Constant et al. 2012). Ethnic and cultural identity is found to influence (labor market) behavior in a number of recent studies (see, for example, Battu and Zenou 2010; Constant and Zimmermann 2008). The extent of self-identification with the country of ancestry, its culture and religion as well as preferences for ethnic ‘goods’ depends on a number of socio-economic factors, including family background and structure, social environment, language, immigration and naturalization experience (Battu and Zenou 2010; Bisin et al. 2008). Whatever the factors, however, ethnic and cultural identities are found to be extremely strong. For example, Battu and Zenou (2010) report that over 80 per cent in each of the ethnic minority groups in the United Kingdom think of themselves in terms of their own ethnic group. Bisin et al. (2008) find that Muslims integrate less and more slowly than non-Muslims, particularly in terms of religious identity. Muslims (Pakistani and Bangladeshi) in the UK are also found to be ‘different’ from other ethnic minorities in terms of the gender gap in education, age at marriage, fertility and female employment, although convergence in behavior over time was also found (Georgiadis and Manning 2011). Finally, a considerable heterogeneity across non-white ethnic groups in terms of cultural preferences is also reported (Battu and Zenou 2010), with Pakistani and Bangladeshi being extremely religious compared to other ethnic minorities, which suggests a persistent religiosity impact for these communities (Georgiadis and Manning 2011). To study the strength of ethnic identity and non-market time allocation behavior of ethnic minorities we employ the UK 2000 Time Use Survey, which allows us to distinguish the exact amount of minutes spent per day on different activities. In particular, we analyze the relation between ethnicity, its interaction with gender and the time spent on different activities. To this aim, we use the double-hurdle regression model, which is particularly well suited for the analysis of time use data. We hypothesize that if ethnic minority women have lower opportunity costs of time and a strong ‘ethnic’ or ‘traditionally female’ identity, they will engage more in ‘traditional’ activities, such as childcare, food preparation and religious activities. Such traditional attitudes presume women’s primary role as taking care of children and housework. This can be formulated as the 3 K model, a term that originated in Germany and stands for Kinder, Küche, Kirche, that is, Children, Kitchen, Church.Footnote 2
 The theoretical literature on the allocation of non-market time and household production goes back to the seminal contributions of Becker (1965), Mincer (1962) and Reid (1934). Becker (1965) extends the standard labour supply model to include multiple uses of time. Households in his model are viewed as both producers and consumers, and they use market goods and time as inputs in their production function to produce commodities. According to this model, individuals’ time use in different activities is affected by their wage. As immigrants often have lower wages than natives, there are direct implications for ethnic minorities’ uses of time: immigrants would face a low price on time-intensive commodities and also, for a given commodity, substitute time for money (Ribar 2013). Akerlof and Kranton (2000, 2010) extend the standard economic models by introducing identity, or a person’s sense of self, into his or her utility function. They show that identity influence labor force participation decisions, allocation of time within the household and the behaviour of ethnic minorities. According to these models, since certain ethnic groups can never fully fit into a majority’s culture, some individuals from these excluded groups may try to integrate, but at the cost of a loss in identity. The model predicts that the greater the social exclusion, the greater the possibility that individuals forgo remunerative activity, which leads to a permanent equilibrium of ethnic inequality. Finally, according to literature on the economics of religion (Azzi and Ehrenberg 1975; Chiswick 2010; Iannaccone 1998; Neuman 1982, 1986), if ethnic minorities have lower opportunity costs of time, then they will produce religious commodities in a more time-intensive manner and those with lower wages will spend more time on religious activities. Three recent studies that focus explicitly on immigrants’ and ethnic minorities’ time use are particularly relevant for our paper. A recent study by Hamermesh and Trejo (2010) examines the assimilation of immigrants in their uses of time. The authors develop a two-period model of time use of immigrants and test it empirically. Their theory is based on the fact that certain assimilation activities entail fixed costs and predicts that immigrants will be less likely than natives to engage in these activities, but once engaged they will spend more time on them. The authors find support for their theory when analyzing time spent on education, purchasing and market work, using American and Australian Time Use Surveys. The study by Zaiceva and Zimmermann (2011) analyzes the ethnicity gap in multitasking behaviour in UK households and finds that non-white ethnic minorities engage less in simultaneous time use activities than whites, with Pakistani and Bangladeshi men spending the least time on total secondary activities. Ribar (2013) provides an overview of theoretical models of time allocation and their implications for immigrants’ behaviour, and reviews the data sources suitable for time use analysis. He also examines studies that used such data to analyze immigrants’ behaviour and provides new descriptive evidence using the American Time Use Survey. This paper contributes to the literature by studying the strength of ethnic identity and traditional attitudes as manifested by time use behavior of ethnic minorities in the United Kingdom. It focuses on the ethnicity gap in the allocation decisions of non-market time, particularly for women. Despite an increasing number of studies based on time use data, more evidence on the role that ethnicity and gender play in non-market time allocation decisions is needed, and this paper provides such evidence for the UK.

12.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,07 April 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-013-9186-9,"Regional unemployment, gender, and time allocation of the unemployed",March 2014,J. Ignacio Gimenez-Nadal,Jose Alberto Molina,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper examines whether others’ unemployment has any effect on the time allocation decisions of the unemployed, and analyses the gender differences associated with these effects. Aguiar et al. (2012) argue that the home production sector is a viable margin of substitution during business cycles, allowing some degree of substitutability between market consumption and leisure. They find that roughly 30 % of the market work hours foregone due to the business cycle are reallocated to non-market production, suggesting small falls in consumption (and, implicitly, wellbeing) despite the decrease in expenditure. This reallocation of work to home production may have negative implications for wellbeing, as home production activities are associated with lower enjoyment levels than leisure or civic/voluntary activities (Kahneman et al. 2004; Kahneman and Krueger 2006; Krueger 2007). By showing the effects of aggregate unemployment rates on the time use of the unemployed, our paper sheds light on the welfare implications of the business cycle for unemployed individuals. Prior research on the macroeconomics of happiness has shown that individual well-being is related to aggregate macroeconomic variables, such as the unemployment rate, inflation, and interest rates. In particular, aggregate unemployment affects utility levels, as other studies have shown that higher levels of unemployment generally lead to lower levels of happiness in a population (Frey and Stutzer 2000; Di Tella et al. 2001; Graham and Pettinato 2001; Di Tella et al. 2003; Shields and Wheatley Price 2005). For instance, Di Tella et al. (2001) show that unemployment rates affect well-being negatively, arguing that these negative effects arise from an individual’s own perception of job insecurity: greater unemployment reduces the chances of finding work. In the case of employed individuals, Clark (2003), Luechinger et al. (2010), and Clark et al. (2010) find that regional unemployment reduces the well-being of the employed because they suffer from reduced job security (Luechinger et al. 2010). In contrast, Clark (2003) also finds that the unemployed report higher levels of well-being in regions with higher unemployment, showing that the unemployed may benefit from a “social-norm effect”: as more people become unemployed, one’s own unemployment represents a smaller deviation from the social norm, and thus the effect of unemployment on individual well-being is lower. We contribute to the literature by testing two theories to ascertain the channels through which others’ unemployment affects the time allocation decisions of the unemployed. If, according to Di Tella et al. (2001), higher unemployment rates imply that unemployed individuals may be more discouraged, we would then expect unemployed individuals to devote more time to home production activities to compensate for the loss in expenditure power (and thus smooth consumption), and more time to study as a way of increasing their chances of finding a job. If regional unemployment rates affect the time allocation decisions of the unemployed through a “social-norm effect”, we would expect to find a positive relationship between regional unemployment rates and leisure of the unemployed, as there are more individuals available to spend time in leisure activities (Jenkins and Osberg 2005). We use a sample of unemployed individuals from two cross-sections of the 2002–2003 and 2009–2010 Spanish Time Use Survey (STUS) to analyze the relationship between regional unemployment rates and time allocation decisions of the unemployed.Footnote 1 Our identification strategy for the effect of other’s unemployment on the uses of time of the unemployed comes from the time and cross-region variations of the data. We have two cross-sections and we exploit the quarterly regional unemployment rates that provide 8 observations for each of the 17 regions of Spain. The STUS provides information on individual time use, based on diary questionnaires in which individuals report their activities throughout the 24 h of the day. The advantage of time-use surveys over stylized-questions, such as those included in the European Community Household Panel, the British Household Panel Survey, and the German Socioeconomic Panel (where respondents are asked how much time they have spent, for example, in the previous week, or normally spend each week, on market work or housework), is that diary-based estimates of time use are more reliable and accurate than estimates derived from direct questions (Juster and Stafford 1985; Robinson and Godbey 1997; Bianchi et al. 2000; Bonke 2005; Yee-Kan 2008). We regress the time devoted to study, job search, household production, personal care, and leisure, on unemployment rates of the different Spanish regions (Comunidades Autonomas). We carry out the analysis separately by gender, since it is well- established in the literature that time use patterns of men and women are different. Women spend more time in household production and childcare, men devote more time to market work and leisure (Kalenkoski et al. 2005, 2009; Aguiar and Hurst 2007; Guryan et al. 2008; Connelly and Kimmel 2009; Gimenez-Nadal and Sevilla 2012). This pattern is especially the case in Mediterranean countries, such as Spain, with entrenched traditional gender norms regarding the household distribution of household labor (Sevilla-Sanz 2010; Gimenez-Nadal et al. 2012) and with an inflexible labor market where part-time employment is very rare (Fernández-Kranz and Rodríguez-Planas 2011). We find that higher unemployment rates in a region are associated with increases in the time devoted to study by men, and to household production by women, with associated decreases in the time devoted to personal care by men and leisure by women. We find no effects on the time devoted to job search. Specifically, a one-percentage-point increase in the regional unemployment rate is associated with increases of 0.05 h per day of study for men and of household production for women, while the same increase is associated with decreases of 0.07 and 0.10 h per day of personal care for men and of leisure for women. The magnitude of the above effects is economically significant. For example, comparing men living in La Rioja and Canarias, the two Spanish regions with the respective lowest and highest male unemployment rates during the analyzed years, unemployed men in Canarias (30.02 % male unemployment) devote 1.52 more hours per day to study and 1.88 fewer hours per day to personal care, compared to unemployed men in La Rioja (2.81 % male unemployment). We also find differential effects of regional unemployment rates depending on whether individuals live in couple or not, and whether the partner is employed or not. We find that the association between the time devoted to household production and regional unemployment rates is greater for unemployed men and women living in a couple, compared to their single counterparts. We interpret this result as evidence that higher regional unemployment rates decrease individual expectations of finding a job. In this situation, households try to increase their time spent on household production, allowing them to reduce the market expenditures needed to maintain their consumption. We also fail to see any association between regional unemployment rates on leisure for unemployed men, and the association for women’s leisure time is negative. These findings indicates that synchronization of activities is not the main channel through which regional unemployment rates affect the time allocation decisions of individuals and that the “social-norm effect” is not at the root of the observed effect of regional unemployment rates and time allocation decisions of the unemployed. Our results possibly indicate that other’s unemployment also has a negative effect on the well-being of the unemployed, since prior studies have found that personal care and leisure rank among the most enjoyable activities, while household production and study rank among the least enjoyable activities (Kahneman et al. 2004; Kahneman and Krueger 2006; Krueger 2007, Knabe et al. 2010). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and variables. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents our main results, and Sect. 5 sets out our main conclusions.",36

Especially in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, pressures on the environment from household activities have increased in recent decades and are expected to continue to increase up to 2020 (OECD 2001). In recent years, various measures have been taken by governments to promote sustainable consumption [e.g., those of the European Environment Agency (2005)]. Financial incentives are needed to drive individuals to engage in pro-environmental activities. However, on some occasions and in the absence of such incentives, they voluntarily spend their time and money in promoting the environment. Knowledge of such pro-environmental activities is valuable in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of environmental management systems. Although there are a wide variety of pro-environmental activities, they can be classified broadly into two categories. The first type of activity is one that incurs expenses for participation; purchasing environmentally friendly products is one such activity.Footnote 1 The second type is one that requires time and effort for participation. Differences in product prices are an important factor in choosing to undertake the first type of activity, while the value of time is an important factor in choosing to undertake the second type. If participation in the pro-environmental activities requires time and effort, an individual will compare the time cost to the benefits derived from participating in that activity. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the opportunity cost of time affects an individual’s participation in various pro-environmental activities. Most previous studies that examine pro-environmental activities analyze the effect of income on pro-environmental activities; they have ignored the effect of the opportunity cost of time. Nonetheless, there are several exceptions. Morris and Holthausen (1994) and Jakus et al. (1996) each developed a household production model that describes recycling behavior. Then, each study shows how the opportunity cost of time affects behavior. Using survey data collected in Tennessee, Jakus et al. (1996) estimate household income and unit-time requirements for recycling. Thereafter, they estimate the opportunity cost of recycling by multiplying the two estimates. They found that a household with a high opportunity cost of time recycles less. Further, Halvorsen (2008) used the contingent valuation method to estimate a household’s willingness to pay (WTP) for leaving the responsibilities of recycling to others, and then substituted it for the opportunity cost of recycling. She found that households with a high WTP tend not to participate in recycling. The aforementioned studies assume that there is only a single decision-maker in a household, after which they construct an economic model and analyze pro-environmental (recycling) activities. In contrast, a majority of studies that examine domestic labor supply analyze situations in which there are two decision-makers (i.e., husband and wife) within a household (Godwin 1991; Kooreman and Wunderink 1996). This is because there is a gender difference in the number of housework hours worked. For instance, the United States Department of Labor (2008) reports that married mothers who were employed full time spent an average of 2.1 h per day doing household activities, while married fathers who were employed full time spent only about 1.4 h. Washbrook (2007) argues that this difference exists “because the importance of social norms pertaining to gender stereotypes and innate biological differences in the capabilities of men and women may swamp the role of gender wage differences in the allocation of time” (p. 2). Although many pro-environmental activities are conducted as a part of housework, men and women spend their time differently inside the home. Consequently, we expect that their employment status, spouse’s employment status, and family structure will affect their pro-environmental activities. The use of the wage rate as a relevant opportunity cost of time has been criticized in some studies. For instance, Brown and Lankford (1992) argue that decisions about market work are made first, while those concerning household activities are made later. If the choice of work hours is constrained, then wage-rate variations are of second-order importance in household activities (Carlin 2001). Larson and Shaikh (2001, 2004) and Shaikh and Larson (2003) developed a two-constraint model and applied it to recreation demand analysis. Their model assumes that an individual makes a labor-supply decision in the first stage and chooses leisure activities to maximize utility, given in the second stage a predetermined amount of money income and discretionary time. Other studies report that the share of earnings contributed by men and women affects the amount of housework time worked. For example, Schneider (2011) writes that “Prior research has led to near unanimity among scholars that what married men and women earn in the market affects the amount of housework they do at home” (p. 845). In this paper, we study pro-environmental activities that can be conducted as a part of housework. Therefore, we expect that the share of earnings will affect the intensity of pro-environmental activities. In the first part of this paper, we develop an economic model of pro-environmental activities by using a household production framework; we then theoretically analyze pro-environmental activities. We show how the opportunity cost of time, the family structure, and environmental concerns affect participation in pro-environmental activities. In the second part of this paper, we conduct empirical analyses of four types of pro-environmental activities, using data from the Japanese General Social Survey 2002 (JGSS-2002). Our empirical results show that a spouse with a lower time cost conducts specific pro-environmental activities at home. Further, it is revealed that the number of family members and the presence of children each determine the likelihood of participation in pro-environmental activities. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops a general formulation of pro-environmental behaviors, using a household production framework. Section 3 specifies the empirical framework: we will use a Stone–Geary utility function for the empirical analysis. Section 4 describes the data used in the empirical analysis; it also presents the empirical model. Section 5 reports our empirical estimates of pro-environmental activities. The final section summarizes the implications of our analytical results.",5

Starr,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The unusually severe U.S. recession of 2007–2009 saw unemployment rates for men rise by significantly more than those for women, resulting in the downturn’s characterization as a ‘mancession’. Whereas unemployment rates for both men and women were around 4 % before the recession began, the rate for men had risen to 10.7 % by the end of 2009, while that for women peaked at 8.2 % (Fig. 1a). There was also an unexpected divergence in the labor-force participation rates of men and women during the recession, with the rate for men declining from 2007 through 2009 while that for women held up (Fig. 1b). Taken together, these gender differences in unemployment and participation rates have been taken to reflect some erosion of traditional labor-market advantages of being male and/or a shift in responsibilities towards women for ‘bringing home the bacon’ (Boushey 2009). Unemployment and labor-force participation rates for men and women, percent, 2000–2011. a Unemployment rates, by gender. b Labor-force participation rates, by gender. Source Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Population Survey, rates for men and women aged 20 years and above. The left axis is the scale for men; the right axis is that for women In contrast, a number of analysts have pointed out that in recessions the unemployment rate for men typically rises by more than that for women (Wall 2009; Sahin et al. 2010; Sierminska and Takhtamanova 2010).Footnote 1 When aggregate demand falls, spending on consumer durables, capital goods, and new construction declines disproportionally; as employment in these sectors is predominantly male, scaling down of production implies greater job loss among men than among women (Goodman et al. 1993; Rives and Sosin 2002). Yet there are several reasons to doubt that changes in labor-demand alone explain the gender differences in employment and participation observed during the recession. A long line of research going back to Woytinsky (1942) has looked for evidence of ‘added worker’ effects, wherein married women increase their labor supply when their husbands lose their jobs. Although much of this research has shown added-worker effects to be small-to-negligible (e.g. Lundberg 1985; Spletzer 1997; Cullen and Gruber 2000), some recent studies have found more appreciable effects. For example, using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Stephens (2002) found significant increases in paid work among women whose husbands were displaced from their jobs, with their extra work eventually compensating for about one-quarter of their husbands’ lost income. In their analysis of data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1968 to 2005, Juhn and Potter (2007) found that nonparticipating women whose husbands exited from unemployment were 5–6 percentage points more likely to enter the labor force than nonparticipating women whose husbands remained employed.Footnote 2
 Theories of household behavior suggest several reasons why added-worker effects might have been especially strong in the 2007–2009 recession. In the standard lifecycle theory of household behavior (e.g. Becker and Ghez 1975; Heckman and MaCurdy 1980), in which households make decisions as an integrated unit, a transitory negative shock to one spouse’s income would not drive a non-participating spouse back to work; this is because a transitory shock would only slightly reduce the household’s expected lifetime income, implying that optimal levels of consumption and labor supply would change little, and instead the gap between current income and spending would be financed by drawing down savings or running up debt. Several aspects of the 2007–2009 recession cast doubt on the relevance of this prediction for added-worker effects. First, some non-negligible part of the job loss of the 2007–2009 recession was likely associated with lower expected lifetime income, implying more appreciable labor-supply effects. Notably, with the bursting of the housing-price bubble after 2006, many jobs lost in construction, home sales, mortgage financing, manufacture of building materials and supplies, etc. are unlikely to be recreated in the foreseeable future; with workers displaced from jobs in these sectors having to shift into different lines of work, many may go years before their earnings return to pre-displacement levels.Footnote 3 Second, falling home values may have reduced some households’ sense that they could afford to have one person stay at home, prompting readjustments in labor supply as part of a ‘wealth effect’ operating in reverse.Footnote 4 Third, many households had been saving very small shares of their disposable income in the years before the recession, in part because rising home values had been inflating the value of their wealth.Footnote 5 This would have left many poorly prepared to cover their spending by drawing down savings balances. Finally, ability to borrow to support consumption also dried up rapidly after the severe ‘credit crunch’ of fall 2008, with loss of home equity against which households could borrow compounding problems of limited access to credit.Footnote 6 Taken together, these factors may have prompted households to turn to possibilities of increasing labor-supply to contend with income loss. To the extent that this was more feasible for women than men, by virtue of their skills, education and/or experience making them differentially positioned to secure employment in sectors that had not contracted (health, education, other services), this could generate added-worker effects of more appreciable magnitudes than in previous recessions. At the same time, new theoretical and empirical research on intra-household allocation, in which households are understood to behave not as ‘unitary’ entities but rather as ‘collectives’ of individuals who may have different preferences towards their own versus others’ well-being and/or unequal bargaining power, raises possibilities that observed patterns of labor-supply adjustments may reflect some shifting of the burden for supporting the household onto women, in ways that would not have been their preferred approach to handling a negative income shock.Footnote 7 Notably, some studies in this literature (e.g. Duflo and Udry 2004; Blundell et al. 2005; Bobonis 2009) explore the possibility that women may tend to care more about children’s consumption than men due to differences in ‘preferences’ or social norms.Footnote 8 In this case, job loss by a man may prompt a nonparticipating woman to go back to work, not because the couple jointly regards this as optimal, but because from the woman’s perspective, the man is responding insufficiently to the need to maintain the consumption of children; for example, he may be too discriminating in looking for another job or opt to stop looking. While such a dynamic may be held in check by the woman’s option of exiting from the marriage (Katz 1997), she may choose to accept the burden of supporting the household in the short-run due to longer-run benefits of staying married and/or because high costs of establishing separate households make it better to stay in a troubled marriage until economic conditions improve.Footnote 9
 Understanding effects of recession on intra-household labor supply is important not only for improving our conceptualizations of household behavior over the business cycle, but also for formulating public policies that protect household members against economic hardships. It is increasingly recognized that, if household decision-making is not unitary but collective, resources provided through income-support and social-insurance programs can have quite different effects on levels and distribution of wellbeing within the household, according to the form of support provided and its recipient (Duflo 2003; Breunig and Dasgupta 2005; Ward-Batts 2008). Thus, much more needs to be learned about how countercyclical increases in social benefits (e.g. unemployment insurance, food stamps, welfare, Medicaid) interact with private mechanisms for contending with income shocks (such as added-worker effects) in protecting consumption levels and access to basic services by different household members.Footnote 10
 This paper examines a set of six hypotheses implied by the above discussion, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is an annual cross-section survey which collects data on hundreds of thousands of working-age adults each year. Although the cross-section sample design means it is not possible to follow individual households over time, the large sample and minimal problems of non-response provide a basis for richly characterizing how circumstances of given types of households changed as the economy shifted from boom into recession. More specifically, we use a difference-in-difference approach to estimate how probabilities of being employed, unemployed, and out of the labor force changed for men and women between 2007 and 2009, according to whether they were married with a working spouse, married with a non-working spouse, or not married. This enables us to gauge whether outcomes for particular groups of people changed differently from those of others in ways that are consistent with hypotheses implied by the theoretical considerations discussed above. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section discusses the data from the ACS, the hypotheses to be examined, and the difference-in-difference methodology used to test them. The third section presents the main results, while the fourth section contains further extensions and robustness checks. A fifth section summarizes and concludes. In brief, the ACS data provide a good amount of evidence of ‘added worker effects’, which vary in magnitude according to women’s circumstances: they are stronger for younger versus older women, for women with children versus those without, and for women in home-owning versus renting households. While the probability of working also fell less for married-men with non-employed spouses than for similar men in other household situations, the difference-in-difference was more modest in magnitude and varied little with specifics of household circumstances. This is consistent with other research suggesting relatively low sensitivity of men’s labor-supply decisions to household circumstances due to differences in ‘preferences’ and/or social norms (Duflo and Udry 2004). There is, however, no evidence that probabilities of non-participation rose more for men with working wives than they did for other men, casting doubt on ideas that men in this situation made weaker efforts to return to work because they could count on their wives’ paychecks to support the household.",35

Concomitantly to the increase in participation, the UK has experienced a decrease in the fertility rate during the 1970s dropping below the replacement rate of 2.1 (right-hand side axis in Fig. 1). Although the two events may be unrelated, it may indicate that many women find it difficult to combine career and fertility decisions.Footnote 1 This paper examines the effect of motherhood on wages compared to childless women and finds significant negative effects in the 20 s and 30 s with the negative effect lasting up to 30 years. Female labor force participation rate and total fertility rate. Note Labor force participation rate for the UK. Total fertility rate for England and Wales. Source Office for National Statistics The relationship between fertility choices and other economic decisions has generated much empirical research among economists. In particular, many studies have found that a significant portion of the gender wage gap can be explained by a “family gap” or “motherhood wage gap”, that is, the difference in earnings between women with children and women without children (see Table 1 for a brief summary of the previous literature). As Table 1 indicates, the estimates for the magnitude of the motherhood wage gap range considerably from 0 % for Denmark (Datta Gupta and Smith 2002; Simonsen and Skipper 2006) to 33 % lower wages for mothers compared to non-mothers for the UK (Joshi et al. 1999) with many estimates in between these two extremes. The more recent literature notes the importance of fertility timing (Miller 2011; Amuedo-Dorantes and Kimmel 2005). Specifically, they find that the fertility decision is delayed by the more highly educated with an increase in earnings of 9 % per year of delay with a 3 % career wage gain (Miller 2011) and once they decide to have a child the college educated mothers benefit from a 4 % wage boost when compared to college educated childless women. This study expands the knowledge on the motherhood wage gap by examining the effect over the reproductive lifecycle rather than at one point in time. Although there are several cohort studies examining the motherhood wage gap, to my knowledge, no other paper has examined the issue over the lifecycle until completed fertility. Furthermore, this is the first study to examine the long-term motherhood wage gaps i.e. the effect 10, 20 or even 30 years after first entering motherhood. This study finds significant effects of motherhood on wages at 7.5 % at age 23 and 18.3 % at age 33 becoming marginally significant 4.6 % at age 42 and insignificant at age 51. The effect of two or more children is only significant at age 33 with 13–19 % lower wages compared to women with no children. Entering motherhood by age 23 has adverse wage effects that are still marginally significant even after 30 years of entering motherhood.Footnote 2 Women who become mothers before the age of 23 have 15.5–18.4 % lower wages 10 years later and 8–9 % lower wages 20 years later compared to women who have not entered motherhood by age 23. The long-term effects fall the longer the woman waits until motherhood with 10–12.5 % effects at age 42 for those who enter motherhood between 23 and 33. There are no long term effects for those who enter motherhood between 33 and 42.",19

Economic literature on this issue is quite limited and has shown the negative impact of unemployment both on the consumption and production side, as well as consequences on returning to the labour market. Various studies have looked at the negative effects of parental unemployment on children, in terms of educational and labour market outcomes, but the impact on partners have received much less attention. Nevertheless, this issue is important for various reasons: Poor mental health causes direct costs on individuals, in terms of labour market status and productivity. If one partner’s job loss decreases both partners’ mental health, this means that economic consequences for both individuals should be taken into account. The same idea applies to economic consequences of poor mental health on the society as a whole (i.e. treatment, rehabilitation, etc.). Worsening in partners’ mental health may result in increasing family conflicts and decreasing family stability. Negative consequences on both partners’ psychological well-being certainly imply negative effects on children. Job loss has a direct impact on well-being. A large empirical psychological literatureFootnote 1 has investigated the impact of unemployment on the incidence of low life satisfaction, depression, low self-esteem, unhappiness, and even suicide. A British study by Clark and Oswald (1994) uses cross sectional data from the first wave of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to show that unemployed people have much lower levels of mental well-being (measured through the GHQ) than those in work.Footnote 2
 This paper also casts some light on the role of income and psychological effect. Results are consistent with previous literature (see for example Kassenboehmer and Haisken-DeNew 2009; Carroll 2007; Clark and Oswald 1994; Clark 2003; Clark et al. 2001; Winkelman and Winkelmann 1998; Lindeboom et al. 2002) and show that the income shock associated with job loss is unlikely to represent the major source of the effect on the individual’s and partner’s mental health. This has some important policy implications: policies aimed at reducing the earnings shock from job losses may alleviate the financial problem, but they will be less effective if the main impact comes from other factors, such as the incidence of low life satisfaction, depression and low self-esteem. Medical and psychological literature presents some evidence of spillover effects of happiness and well-being in families and social network (see Strom 2003 for a review and Fowler and Christakis 2008), and also investigates cross over effects of unemployment in couples (see for example Westman et al. 2001), but most of these studies analyse small and unrepresentative samples, and do not directly address the potential endogeneity of unemployment. This paper adds, in various ways, to the different strands of literature mentioned above. Firstly, the impact of husbands’ job loss on the probability of partners’ poor mental health is analysed. Results complement the limited evidence on partners presented by Winkelman and Winkelmann in 1995 (using the GSOEP), by using British (and more recent) data and focusing on mental health, rather than on happiness. Secondly, the estimation of the main model has been achieved using six different specifications, including two different fixed-effects model. Furthermore, I deal with the possible endogeneity of job loss, focusing on involuntary displacements and results are stable across different models. Lastly, the existence of multiple transmission channels is analysed and I discuss the relevance of the income shock on individual’s and partner’s mental well-being. The main results of this paper show that the mental health worsens for both partners following a husband’s job loss, even controlling for a large set of individual and family characteristics and modelling the dynamics of past and initial mental health. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a theoretical framework for the analysis, Sect. 3 analyses the data and briefly presents mental health indicators. Section 4 discusses the estimation methods and Sect. 5 presents the main results. Section 6 concludes.",39

Fletcher,David E. Frisvold,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The empirical link between education and health is one of the most robust relationships in the social sciences and has been shown across many countries and time periods. Grossman and Kaestner (1997) review the voluminous literature and conclude that the available evidence supports a causal relationship. If the conclusion that education has a causal effect on health is correct, a natural question to ask is what are the mechanisms linking education and later health outcomes. Grossman (1972) suggests that education may improve productive efficiency—individuals with greater education are able to use health inputs more efficiently. Kenkel (1991) focuses on the mechanism of allocative efficiency—individuals with greater education choose different health inputs. Likewise, Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2008) suggest that education increases lead to different thinking and decision making patterns. One limitation with much current research is that education is almost universally treated as a black box—researchers typically examine the returns to an additional year of schooling or credential but rarely examine why the increase in education may lead to better health. One potentially important component of the black box of educational attainment is the quality of schooling. There is almost no current research that examines the effects of quality of education on health (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2008). In this paper, we add to the literature by estimating OLS and family fixed effects models of the effects of graduating from a selective college during the 1960s on smoking and obesity as individuals age throughout adulthood. We utilize data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), which includes measures of these health behaviors as well as IQ and health status measures during adolescence for this sample. We are also able to use the panel nature of the data to focus on several possible mechanisms, such as occupational characteristics including income, marital histories, and cognition. Overall, our results suggest that graduating from a selective college reduces the probability of being overweight in later adulthood by approximately 15 % points, but we find no consistent evidence for reductions in the probability of smoking. Although we are not able to control for all measures of individual heterogeneity such as non-cognitive traits, the results are shown to be robust to including a rich set of pre-college control variables as well as family fixed effects. We then explore several potential mechanisms that may be responsible for the estimated link between selectivity and health, including occupational characteristics, income/wealth measures, marriage market outcomes, and health at mid-life but find limited evidence that the college quality-health effect operates through these pathways. Thus, we present some of the first evidence linking college quality with later health behaviors and demonstrate that college quality influences these behaviors independent of income, occupation, or marriage.",19

Such aging of the European population, the result of declining mortality and fertility rates over the last century, has raised concerns about the social cohesion and sustainability of the welfare state (Hantrais 1999; Lee 2003). One consequence of an aging population is an increase in the demand for home care due to the limitations that elderly people experience in daily activities and the help they need for basic tasks like house cleaning and personal care (Comas-Herrera et al. 2006; Pickard et al. 2007). Such home care for the elderly may be provided by family or friends (informal care), or by professional home care institutions, often part of the welfare system (formal care). In order to obtain accurate projections concerning the abovementioned increasing costs of formal home care, public policymakers require insights into the extent to which the different informal care providers can meet the demand for home care. Evidence from previous studies shows, for instance, that informal care from children reduces the probability of nursing home entry (Charles and Sevak 2005) and is a net substitute for formal home care (van Houtven and Norton 2004; Bonsang 2008; Bolin et al. 2008a). Concerning these latter findings, an additional important policy consideration is that friends and relatives, other than children, are likely to be of a similar age to the elderly and retired, which makes policies aimed at stimulating their care provision less likely to adversely affect labor supply than when stimulating care provision from children who are usually labor market participants (Bolin et al. 2008b; Wolf and Soldo 1994). To this end, most of the existing empirical literature focuses on spouses or children, while other types of informal care providers are neglected: as mentioned by Byrne et al. (2009), multiple informal care provision is still under-studied. The main contribution of our paper is to fill this gap in the literature and to empirically analyze the care provision from friends and relatives, other than children, in addition to formal home care and informal home care from adult children. The extant literature supports the importance of our analysis. First, informal care provision from friends and relatives is quantitatively relevant. Spillman and Pezzin (2000) show that 13.1 % of elderly Americans with a chronic disability receive care from friends or relatives other than a spouse or from children. We use data on elderly individuals (aged 65 years or older) across nine European countries and show that, on average, about 30 % of the weekly hours of informal care from outside the household are received from friends, neighbors or relatives other than children. Second, the opportunity cost of providing care plays an important role in the theoretical models which economists use to examine care-giving choices. In a standard revealed preferences approach, individuals decide how much time to devote to home care on the basis of their opportunity cost, i.e. the forgone benefits due to the time spent on providing care. The opportunity cost of providing care is, therefore, likely to depend on the characteristics of each type of care provider. As van Houtven and Norton (2008) state, financial and blood ties of elderly with their children are stronger than with their friends and other relatives, but a retired friend or neighbor could find it more pleasant to spend time providing help than would a daughter of working age who, possibly, has children of her own to care for. Therefore, inferences on preferences obtained from an analysis of one type of care provider cannot be extended to other providers. Third, Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) show that the need for formal care has reduced as a result of decreased male mortality over time, which translated into a shorter period of widowhood for wives and a longer period during which the spouses took care of each other. The authors then make the more general claim that a reduction in disability rates among the elderly could expand the non-market supply of home care, since an elderly person with no demand for home care may, in fact, become a supplier of informal care. Along this line of reasoning, we argue that friends and relatives other than children may be important home care providers. In our empirical analysis we relate the hours of home care received by the elderly from different potential care providers to their health limitations and children’s characteristics. In addition to formal home care provision, and as mentioned above, we distinguish informal care provisions from adult children (including their spouses), from relatives other than children (e.g. siblings) and from friends (including neighbors). We use data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. These data are particularly relevant for our analysis since they contain detailed information on the hours of home care from different care providers. Our primary new empirical finding is that single elderly people who, ceteris paribus, rely less on children for the provision of home care, e.g., because they have only one child or their children live far away, receive more hours of home care from friends and neighbors and not only more hours of formal home care. This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the data and provides descriptive evidence of the quantitative relevance of care provision from friends and relatives; Sect. 3 discusses a theoretical framework, emphasizing the differences in opportunity cost among informal care providers, and outlines the empirical model. Section 4 presents and discusses the empirical results, while Sect. 5 summarizes the main findings and discusses the policy implications.",31

Evidence from a new international survey of bequest plans,September 2014,Charles Yuji Horioka,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There are at least three competing assumptions concerning household preferences in economics: that individuals are selfish, that they are altruistic, and that they have a desire for dynasty building. The three assumptions have very different implications for bequest motives and bequest division, so examining survey data on stated bequest motives and bequest division plans is a promising way of shedding light on which assumption holds in the real world, and comparing bequest plans in different countries is a promising way of shedding light on whether different assumptions apply in different countries. In this paper, we discuss the three alternative assumptions concerning household preferences and show that these assumptions have very different implications for bequest motives and bequest division. After reviewing some of the literature on actual bequests, bequest motives, and bequest division, we present data on the strength of bequest motives, stated bequest motives, and bequest division plans from a new international survey on bequest plans conducted in the People’s Republic of China (hereafter China), India, Japan, and the United States. We then speculate about possible reasons for inter-country differences in bequest plans and consider the policy implications of our findings. As shown in Sect. 2.1, positive bequests are consistent with all three assumptions concerning household preferences, and thus it is not possible to draw inferences about which assumption holds in the real world unless we have information on households’ motives for leaving bequests. Most previous studies try to infer households’ preferences from their actual behavior because they do not have any direct information on households’ bequest motives, but there are many econometric and other difficulties in making such inferences. The current paper makes a significant original contribution to this literature not only by presenting direct information on households’ stated bequest motives and bequest division plans but also by presenting such information on four countries (China, India, Japan, and the United States) with very different levels of economic development, cultures, etc., allowing us to see whether or not household preferences vary from country to country. To summarize the main findings of this paper, it shows using data from a new international survey on bequest plans that there are striking inter-country differences in bequest plans, with the bequest plans of Americans and Indians appearing to be much more consistent with selfish preferences than those of the Japanese and Chinese and the bequest plans of the Japanese and Chinese appearing to be much more consistent with selfish preferences than those of Americans and Indians. These inter-country differences in bequest plans may partly reflect inter-country differences in social safety nets and social norms and partly reflect inter-country differences in household preferences. These findings have important implications for the efficacy and desirability of stimulative fiscal policies, public pensions, and inheritance taxes, with stimulative fiscal policies being more effective, public pensions being more effective in raising the living standards of the aged, and inheritance taxes being less necessary in countries such as Japan and China in which households are selfishly motivated and conversely in countries such as the United States and India in which households are altruistically motivated. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we discuss alternative assumptions concerning household preferences, show that these assumptions have very different implications for bequest motives and bequest division, and review some of the literature on actual bequests, bequest motives, and bequest division. In Sect. 3, we describe the international survey on bequest plans used in this paper, and in Sect. 4, we present evidence from this survey on bequest plans in China, India, Japan, and the United States. In Sect. 5, we explore possible reasons for inter-country differences in bequest plans, and finally, Sect. 6 summarizes, concludes, and explores the policy implications of our findings.",47
12.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,17 August 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-013-9216-7,Bequests and family traditions: the case of nineteenth century France,September 2014,Luc Arrondel,Cyril Grange,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Standard economic models postulate that bequest behavior does not depend per se on parents’ behavior, or on the composition (human and non-human) of life resources. Contrary to other social sciences where “family traditions” play an important and obvious role in explaining intergenerational transfers (Mauss 1950; Lévi-Strauss 1958; Bourdieu and Passeron 1964), economics has surprisingly neglected the possibility of “retrospective” effects on bequest behavior. Standard models of bequest are based on a simplistic view of the intergenerational family with two generations, namely parents and children: either no apparent family, for the selfish life-cycler who leaves “accidental” bequests owing to random life duration (Davies 1981); or the altruistic family, headed by a benevolent patriarch driven by well-being of his progeny (Becker 1991); or even pure self-interested family relations, where intergenerational exchanges act as (imperfect) substitutes for private exchanges or contracts that should exist on ideal markets (Kotlikoff and Spivak 1981; Cox 1987).Footnote 1
 Yet the inheritance-bequest relation, i.e. the influence of inherited wealth on wealth bequeathed, is hard to explain with standard models of transfers, especially with the assumptions of altruism or exchange. Moreover, the data show a high degree of transmission of bequeathing practices from one generation to the next (Arrondel and Masson 2006). So economists interested in intergenerational transfers should pay more attention to the possibility of family tradition in bequest behavior. Family tradition could help explain some anomalies in transfer behavior. These empirical puzzles concern for example Ricardian equivalence,Footnote 2 the crowding-out effect, the role of bequests in wealth accumulation, the responsiveness of bequests to tax changes,Footnote 3 etc. Recently, to go beyond these standard models, Arrondel and Masson (2006) drew on anthropology to suggest that the concept of reciprocity, based on the gift/return-gift relation, could lead to a more satisfactory view of family links, providing new motives for transfers and more realistic norms of behavior between kin generations. More specifically, they show that indirect forms of reciprocity between generations can be viewed as an appropriate dynamic synthesis of altruism and exchange, allowing the introduction of “intermediate” motivations for transfers which better fit the data. The concept must be adapted to the succession of generations, taking a particular form introduced by the French anthropologist Mauss (1950), namely, indirect (serial) reciprocity, involving three successive generations at a time and leading to infinite chains of descending or ascending transfers between parents and children. Reciprocity differs from market exchange in that it proceeds from a set of “internal” obligations—to give, to receive, and to give back—, whether driven by family traditions, norms or collective values, group or social pressure (Kolm 2000). Moreover, if direct reciprocity still looks like a standard quid pro quo exchange between two parties, indirect reciprocity implies either that the beneficiary generation gives back to a third generation (e.g., makes bequests to one’s children “in return” for inheritance received from one’s parents), or that the giving generation will be paid back by a third generation (e.g., will receive support from their children in return for past support given to their own parents): in each case, it leads to the replication of the same type of transfer along the intergenerational chain. For instance, the way to pay back my parents for the education I received is to ensure my own children receive a proper education, and so on; of course, this process will often work through imitation or transmission of norms. Our initial motivation for extending exchange or reciprocity to three generations within this encompassing framework came from evidence on parent-to-child transfers: strong and highly significant retrospective effects, both qualitative and quantitative, have been systematically found for downward transfers and transmission practices on different data sets by different authors (Arrondel and Masson 2006).Footnote 4 Recently, Cox and Stark (2005) concluded that there exists a strong relationship between inheritance received and intended bequest in the USA, and they suggested that family traditions could explain transfers from parents to children.Footnote 5 Ribar and Wilhelm (2006) observed the transmission of elder support attitudes between generations and sought to explain it in terms of social exchange theory and role modeling.Footnote 6 Finally, there have been recent efforts among economists to move beyond describing intergenerational correlations in wealth accumulation and to measure intergenerational correlations in savings behavior (Charles and Hurst 2003). With the exception of the above works, few empirical studies until now have analyzed both bequests and inheritances, because of data limitations. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of inheritance received by individuals on the amount that they bequeath in France, after controlling by other individual characteristics. In particular, we measure the specific influence on bequests of inheritance relative to human resources, on the basis of an original and unique historical database concerning transmissions in the nineteenth century in a French département. Section 2 describes the empirical methodology used to study the role of transfers in wealth accumulation. Section 3 presents the data and some statistics about inheritances and bequests in the Loire-Inférieure département in the nineteenth century. After describing the make-up of the database, we estimate the effect of the level of inheritance on the level of bequest, after controlling for a host of other household characteristics (Sect. 4). Section 5 concludes.",7

Latinos are a diverse group by national origin, citizenship and immigration status, characteristics that strongly influence their employment prospects, asset building and retirement savings and security. The heterogeneity of Latinos in the United States is important to public policy, which too often views “the Hispanic community” as an undifferentiated group. This oversight can be especially deleterious when it comes to retirement policy affecting this important and growing demographic segment. Our research comprises the first systematic study of how Mexican-Americans specifically, as opposed to Latinos in general, are saving for retirement. Informed by a combination of economic and anthropological theories and methods, this study transcends traditional disciplinary barriers that divide our knowledge of and approaches to financial behavior. Our integrated approach takes up Amyra Grossbard’s call for a “marriage” between economics and anthropology, two fields that typically apply antithetical approaches to studying social reality. Economics “farm(s) the scientifically most reachable and more quantifiable fields of society “at the intensive margin” of inquiry whereas anthropology explores “the qualitative extensive margin of inquiry” (Grossbard (1978:33). Grossbard (1978:33) suggests that since the two disciplines have “the largest variation in intensive vs. extensive productivity (they also) have the most to gain from marriage.” Accordingly, we “marry” insights from ethnographic and quantitative research in our analysis of data from the 2003 Chicago Area Survey, which differentiates among Latinos. In particular, we seek to understand how Mexican-Americans’ collectivistFootnote 2 cultural values affect their savings behavior and their preparation for retirement. The survey did not explicitly gather data on collectivism. To compensate for this, we create proxies, which, based on our qualitative findings regarding collectivism, can demonstrate attitudes and behaviors that constitute a collectivist cultural framework. We analyze these proxies for collectivism in relation to straightforward data in the survey on savings and on retirement plan participation. Mexican-Americans are the fastest growing immigrant group in the United States and they are both younger and expected to live longer than other groups. Yet with the lowest participation in pension savings programs, they are the most insecure in relation to retirement. There is little specific research examining Mexicans-Americans’ retirement savings and assets. Differences in how Latino populations prepare, or do not prepare, for retirement can be attributed to structural economic factors, including income level, occupational sector (public or private), and access to employer-provided retirement savings plans. But these factors alone cannot fully explain these variations. For even when Mexican-American workers are eligible to participate in retirement savings plans at work, they have low participation rates. In this paper we argue that Mexican-Americans’ collectivist values influence the choices they make about how to build assets and resources differently from other Latino groups. While Latino immigrants are generally collectivist, Mexicans appear to have a higher degree of interdependence. They “invest” in people (with the expectation of future return) through contributing gifts, sponsoring ritual celebrations, services, money and time as well as affective support. They lend money to each other, and they expect to be able to get money from others when they will need it. Their collectivism is exemplified by participation in an informal rotating savings and credit association, or tanda, which serves as a reliable (low default) way to raise cash (Vélez-Ibañez 1983). People contribute to tanda when they have more than they need, and they expect to draw on tanda when they need it. In other words, they save as a community in lieu of saving as individuals. Characteristics of collectivism include structural intimacy, emphasis on group solidarity over individual aims, and the belief that the fate of any member is inseparable from that of the group. In addition, collective sharing of, and claims on, any particular member’s success and failure stem from a belief framework of a personalistic and contextual morality as opposed to universal or abstract moral standards (Falicov 2001; Hofstede 1980; Triandis et al. 1984). Mexicans realize their collectivist values within extended, intergenerational families, whose memberships typically exceed the nuclear model and may include grandparents, uncles and aunts and their spouses, nieces, nephews and cousins as well as honorary or fictive kin. These bonds span multiple households. Today, these networks are typically spread across boundaries, as societies have institutionalized transnational migration, as opposed to local production, as a family economic strategy (Hondagneu-Sotelo 1994). We believe that such collectivist behavior inhibits individual saving in the Mexican-American community more so than in other Latino communities. After all, why should an individual save for their retirement through traditional individual savings mechanisms when they are used to saving in a community setting? If our hypothesis is correct, it means that Mexican-Americans are less likely to own IRA/Keogh accounts, and they are less likely to have formal savings in general, controlling for education, age, earnings, gender, and other variables that normally predict a person’s savings behavior. We test this hypothesis by analyzing how Mexican-Americans and non-Mexican Latinos save for retirement, controlling for the usual predictors of savings behavior, and for the level of collectivism each individual exhibits. This allows us to evaluate how much collectivism impacts each individual’s likelihood of saving for retirement. Reflecting on the policy implications of our study, we suggest that collectivist values are at odds with the formal defined contribution retirement savings system, which is geared toward both autonomous individuals and higher-income workers who benefit from the tax deductions and penalizes participants who borrow or withdraw funds before retirement age. These policies are harmful to Mexican-Americans and other low-income, close-knit communities, in which people expect to be able to borrow money from members of their collectivist networks.",2

Zimmermann,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Remittances represent an enormous cash flow worldwide. In many countries with substantial internal mobility, remittances are also abundant at the national level. For instance, estimates for China show that nearly US $30 billions were transferred from urban to rural areas in 2005 (Gong et al. 2008). However, no research has explored whether and how sending money back home relates to the well-being of migrants. Given that remittances often constitute a large share of migrants’ earned income, it is expected that their utility is substantially affected. For instance, migrants may experience a loss in welfare caused by the reduction in their own disposable income. However, at the same time, migrants’ welfare may be positively influenced by transferring money to the family left behind, as this contributes towards improving the welfare of individuals for whom they care. The principal aim of this paper is to propose a systematic approach to empirically analyse the relationship between sending remittances and the utility of migrants, as proxied by their subjective well-being (SWB). The key feature of our approach is that it allows the capturing of the overall role of remittances on migrants’ well-being, i.e., including both “monetary” and “non monetary” aspects of sending remittances. Research on SWB has increased substantially in the past few years, resulting in new insights into economic phenomena that are difficult to capture when using a standard neoclassic economic approach (see the surveys in Frey and Stutzer 2002; Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Van Praag 2003; Dolan et al. 2008).
Footnote 1 Our paper contributes to this literature by documenting the existence of an important relationship between remittances and migrants’ well-being. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that provides empirical evidence about such a nexus.
Footnote 2
 After having established the existence of a relationship between SWB and remittances, we explore how such relationship provides insight into the motivations behind sending remittances.
Footnote 3 The literature has long been interested in identifying whether remittances are motivated by altruistic reasons or by the existence of implicit contracts (see Rapoport and Docquier 2006 for an overview). No consensus has been reached concerning which motivation dominates, with a number of studies arguing that both altruistic and contractual motives might be at work (see, e.g., Lucas and Stark 1985; Cox et al. 2004). We build upon such literature and elicit whether altruistic or contractual motivations prevail by testing how the relationship between SWB and remittances varies in function of the economic conditions of the family left behind in the village. A stronger positive relationship between remittances and SWB in correspondence of low levels of the income of the family back home would suggest the presence of altruistic motivations; a stronger relationship at higher levels of the income of the family left behind could on the other hand suggest that contractual motives are at work. Exploring the relationship between sending remittances and the well-being of migrants is particularly relevant in the context of China, given that it has experienced a massive migration of workers from rural to urban areas in recent decades. The most recent estimates from the 2010 census suggest that over 220 million people left their rural residence for over 6 months (National Bureau of Statistics of China 2010). Given the presence of restrictions related to household registration regulations (hukou), the spouse and children of many migrants often have to remain in the village. Consequently, and also due to the low level of social security in rural areas, remittances are vital for sustaining the family members left behind. Due to their increasing numbers in urban areas, the welfare of migrants is becoming an important agenda item for central and local policy makers in China.
Footnote 4 In addition, there are unique aspects of Chinese culture, such as a strong moral obligation to care for parents and the elderly, embodied in the Chinese traditional virtue of “xiao” (filial piety). Arguably, this is an important driver of remittances flows in China (Yue and Ng 1999). Our analysis is based on the Rural to Urban Migration in China (RUMiC), which collects data on migrants in major urban destinations. The methodology consists on estimating models in which a measure of SWB is regressed on the level of remittances. We document the existence of a sizeable positive correlation between sending remittances and migrants’ well-being, which we refer to as the marginal utility of remittances. The relationship between remittances and well-being varies along socio-economic characteristics of migrants and their migration experience. This relationship is also found to be a function of diverse family arrangements. The well-being of migrants with strong implicit family responsibilities (e.g., migrants whose spouse or children are left behind) exhibits a weak relationship with sending remittances. On the other hand, a much stronger positive correlation is found among those migrants with fewer responsibilities; in other words, migrants whose choice to remit is less constrained (e.g., single migrants with no children). With regards to filial obligations, we find that migrants who are more detached from their family back home experience relatively higher well-being when sending remittances. When exploring the reasons behind remittances, we find support for both altruistic and contractual motivations being at work, albeit with altruism being the dominant motivation. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset and the empirical strategy. Section 3 outlines the results of our benchmark model and robustness checks, followed by the analysis by socio-economic groups, migration experience and family arrangements. In Sect. 4 we explore the motivations behind remittances, while Sect. 5 provides concluding remarks.",32

Between 6 and 8 % of the U.S. population volunteered on any given day over the period 2007–2011 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2013a, b). What motivates people to give of their time? Altruism may be one reason, although image concerns are also a factor. Hwang et al. (2005) find that altruistic reasons are the most important factors for being active in voluntary associations in the U.S. and Canada. However, they also find that many people in both countries who report altruistic reasons also report selfish ones. Similarly, Carpenter and Myers (2010), using a sample of volunteer firefighters and non-volunteer community members, find that, while altruism is a key motivator in joining the volunteer fire service and engaging in training, image concerns are what encourage volunteers to respond to calls. Cappellari and Turati (2004) show that volunteering is affected by both intrinsic (i.e., altruistic) and extrinsic (i.e., selfish) motivations. Exchange may be another important reason for the giving of one’s time. Bernheim et al. (1985) show that bequests often are used as compensation for services received in life. Park (2013), however, who analyzes visits by adult Korean children to their parents, does not find a bequest motive for these visits. Focusing on inter-vivos transfers rather than bequests, Cox (1987) and Cox and Rank (1992) find that such transfers are motivated by exchange, rather than altruism. More recent evidence by Kohara and Ohtake (2011) and Lopez-Anuarbe (2013) also supports the idea that inter-vivos transfers are motivated by exchange. Kohara and Ohtake (2011) show that exchange is the primary reason that adult Japanese children care for their parents. Lopez-Anuarbe (2013) shows that parents’ inter-vivos transfers to their adult children depend positively on the time those children spent assisting their parents in the past. Another reason people may give of their time is to invest in their human capital or to signal to employers that they are worth hiring (Menchik and Weisbrod 1987; Schiff 1990; Duncan 1999; Ziemek 2006; Hackl et al. 2007). Finally, serial reciprocity may be another reason people give. According to Moody (2008), serial reciprocity occurs when recipients of generosity “give back” to society in response to what they perceive they have received from society. The condition for serial reciprocity to occur is that the original giver cannot be paid back directly and so the recipient “gives back” to society in some other manner. Although they do not use the term “serial reciprocity,” Isen and Levin (1972) present the results of experiments in which they find that students who received cookies unexpectedly while studying and people who found a dime in the coin return of a public telephone afterward either volunteered to help or actually helped someone else. However, recipients of generosity may be less generous, rather than more. Using Consumer Expenditure Survey data, Brooks (2002) finds that welfare receipt, controlling for income and wealth, negatively affects a person’s charitable giving. Specifically, he finds that a 10 % increase in welfare payments in the form of cash and food stamps corresponds to a 1.4 % decrease in giving. He suggests that this is because welfare receipt creates reliance on the government and thus eliminates a “culture” of responsibility to help others. Brooks (2004) suggests another possible mechanism, that is, because of their physical isolation, welfare recipients tend to donate informally, to family and friends instead of to nonprofit charities, so their generosity doesn’t end up in the figures on charitable giving. It is not just welfare recipients who may be encouraged to make fewer monetary contributions in light of increased government “giving”. Abrams and Schmitz (1984), using panel data on U.S. states, show that the average charitable donation in a state is negatively associated with higher total state welfare spending. Polonsky et al. (2002) show that Australian donors perceive government support of charities to be high and thus feel less of a need to personally support these charities. Most studies of welfare recipients’ generosity have focused on their monetary giving but not their giving of time. Guo and Peck (2009) are a notable exception in that they examine both the money and time contributions of welfare recipients. In their paper, they discuss whether there should be a negative effect of public assistance on recipients’ likelihood to volunteer. A negative effect would be consistent with Brooks’ (2002) “culture of welfare” explanation. A positive effect would be consistent with Brooks’ (2004) hypothesis about informal giving if recipients give time rather than money. Receipt of public assistance also might have a positive effect on the likelihood of volunteering if it encourages recipients to become more civically engaged. Guo and Peck’s (2009) empirical results suggest that, while public assistance receipt tends to suppress monetary donations, public assistance receipt may decrease, increase, or have no effect on volunteer time, depending on the specification. Peck et al. (2012) finds a positive effect of welfare receipt on volunteering, but only for specific sub-populations. Therefore, the question of whether welfare receipt affects time spent volunteering is an open one. The relationship between welfare receipt and time volunteered may depend also on whether time and money contributions are substitutes or complements. As Brooks (2002), Guo and Peck (2009), and others have found, welfare receipt reduces monetary contributions. If time volunteered is a complement to money contributions, then time volunteered should also be reduced by welfare receipt. If time volunteered is a substitute for money contributions, then time volunteered should be increased by welfare receipt. Whether time and money are complements or substitutes is not settled in the literature, however. Duncan (1999) and Kohara and Ohtake (2011) find that time and money contributions are substitutes, while Menchik and Weisbrod (1987), Brown and Lankford (1992), and Van Slyke and Brooks (2005) find that they are complements. Carlin (2001) finds that money and time donations are complements in terms of married women’s participation in volunteer activities but substitutes in terms of their volunteer hours. The type of volunteering, whether formal or informal, may matter also. Schiff (1990) finds evidence that informal volunteering, but not formal volunteering, is a substitute for monetary donations. Brooks (2004) suggests that welfare recipients tend to donate money informally to family and friends rather than formally to non-profit charities, and this difference may extend to time contributions. Edin and Lein (1997) suggest that welfare recipients’ giving tends to be more informal than among other groups, including aid for family members and providing in-kind help to those around them. Smith et al. (1999) note that donations of time, skill, and knowledge are important transfers within African–American communities. Therefore, while many studies such as Guo and Peck (2009) focus on time spent volunteering for a formal organization, informal volunteering also should be investigated as an important type of giving.",2

Davis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Food at home (FAH) is food purchased from a grocery, supermarket, or convenience store for use in home production. Food away from home (FAFH) is food bought from a food service provider, such as a full service restaurant or a fast food restaurant. From 1970 to 2010 the food expenditure share spent on FAFH in the United States increased from about 33 % to almost 50 % relative to FAH (United States Department of Agriculture/Economic Research Service USDA/ERS 2012). Nutritionists, economists, public health officials, and policy makers have become interested in these trends because FAFH in aggregate contains more calories, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium and less micro nutrients compared to FAH (see review article by Lachat et al. 2011).Footnote 1 Consequently, consuming more FAFH relative to FAH has contributed to the obesity epidemic (see review article Bezerra et al. 2012). Household production economics has emerged as a contributing explanation for these trends, even outside of the economics profession (Cawley 2004). The main household production economics explanation is that during this period the opportunity cost of time increased as women’s labor force participation rates increased significantly from about 43–60 % while men’s decreased by a smaller amount from about 80–73 % (Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS 2012) and hence home production time decreased (see Aguiar and Hurst 2007a; Ramey 2009 for empirical confirmation). Though conceptually appealing, a closer inspection of the literature reveals gaps in knowledge about some fundamental economic constructs in this explanation. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of the empirical literature on FAH, demonstrate how the results can be integrated to provide additional insights, and discuss areas in need of further research with an eye toward policy implications. The focus is on FAH and FAFH in the United States because the main nutrition welfare program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP: formerly Foods Stamps), is targeted toward FAH in general and thus understanding the FAH economics is important for policy analysis. To set the context for the empirical review, a typical household food production model is given. The empirical review demonstrates that although all the analyses are piecemeal, the results are generally robust and support the conclusion that as the opportunity cost of time increases, FAH consumption will decrease and FAFH consumption will increase. This result is useful, but deeper analyses are required in order to inform policy. In particular information is needed on three key parameters: the labor cost share, the elasticity of substitution between goods and time in FAH production, and the elasticity of substitution between FAFH and FAH consumption. The estimates of these key parameters are reviewed and the implications of their relative values explored. Several areas in need of further research are discussed in the conclusions.",32

The effects of maternal communication about sex on the sexual behavior of female adolescents,December 2014,Susan L. Averett,Sarah M. Estelle,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Although teen pregnancy rates in the U.S. are at an all-time low (Hamilton and Ventura 2012), the U.S. still has the highest teen pregnancy rate among developed countries (Centers for Disease Control 2011). Currently about one-third of girls will give birth before age 20 (National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy 2011). Furthermore, recent estimates indicate that rates of unintended pregnancy are highest amongst those aged 15–19 years old (Finer 2010). In 2008, births to teen mothers cost taxpayers (federal, state, and local) approximately $11 billion (National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy 2011). But a much wider range of concerns regarding adolescent sexual activity—including health, social, economic, and even moral ramifications—continue to motivate involvement by parents, professionals, and policy makers. A variety of programs are in place to attempt to delay the sexual debut of adolescent women and/or teach them about contraceptive use (Lindberg et al. 2006). Among these interventions are informational campaigns targeting parents and encouraging them to speak to their children about sex.Footnote 1 The Department of Health and Human Services’ “Parents Speak Up” emphasizes an abstinence-first message, for example. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, on the other hand, supports parents in providing more “comprehensive” information and even provides discussion guides for use with MTV’s popular television show 16 and Pregnant. On top of big budget campaigns like these, child-development experts advise age-appropriate and continuing dialogue between parents and children regarding sex (Bernstein 2011). Despite the widespread support for parent–child communication about sex, the effect of these conversations, and thus the efficacy of the social marketing campaigns, is unknown. The effect is difficult to ascertain because those parents who are most likely to talk to their adolescents about these issues may also be those who have the most reason to be concerned about their child’s behavior. Therefore, in this research we carefully consider the possible endogeneity of parent–child communication to adolescent sexual activity. Specifically, we use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth) to examine the influence that mother–daughter discussions (hereafter, maternal “talk”) have on a female adolescent’s decision to engage in sexual intercourse or safe sex practices (e.g., condom use). Using the AddHealth’s rich data on other aspects of parenting and parental attitudes, the adolescent’s home and school environment, and individual adolescent characteristics, we investigate the statistical relationship between talk and adolescent behavior in a sample of mother–daughter pairs. We also use a sample of sisters (and their mothers) from the AddHealth to estimate fixed effects models controlling for family-specific unobserved heterogeneity and employ an instrumental variables approach as an additional robustness check. Ours is the first research to try to isolate the effect of maternal talk on a teen’s propensity for sexual activity from other aspects of parenting including a mother’s parenting style, age at first birth, relationship status, and expectations for her daughter. Our concept of maternal talk is novel in the economics literature, although numerous social scientists have explored related issues.Footnote 2 Theoretical models in the sociological and developmental psychology literature have linked high levels of parental supervision and discipline with positive outcomes and a reduced propensity of adolescents to engage in risky behavior (Fletcher et al. 1995; Amato and Rivera 1999; Amato and Fowler 2002; Browning et al. 2005). Increased supervision and monitoring are hypothesized to limit the opportunities and incentives for engaging in risky behavior. Others have found empirical correlations that they interpret as support for these hypotheses (for example, Richardson et al. 1993; Vandell and Ramanan 1991). Expressing concern that the findings described above might be endogenous if levels of supervision are driven by unobservable parent characteristics, Aizer (2004) found that an increase in adult supervision reduced truancy, alcohol and marijuana use, theft, and fighting among school-age children. There is little empirical research in adolescent risky behavior on parental inputs other than basic parent characteristics and supervision and even less that attempts to uncover the causal relationship between parenting activities and adolescent outcomes. If a mother expects risky behavior from her child or foresees negative influences from her daughter’s peer group, she may find more incentive to talk to her child. If a parent is aware of school curricula that effectively discourage risky behaviors, she may choose to talk to her child about similar things less frequently or less forcefully. If any of these potential scenarios is true, estimation of a simple production function of adolescent risky behavior will return biased estimates of the true effect of maternal talk. Our baseline OLS regressions indicate that maternal talk is associated with a higher probability of having sex, having unsafe sex, and engaging in sexual activities outside of a romantic relationship (hereafter, “casual sex”). However, as we control for additional characteristics of the child’s school, home, and especially the daughter’s attributes and attitudes, we find strong evidence that maternal talk is likely endogenous and that the most naïve OLS models are likely biased upward with respect to the effect of maternal talk. Our sister fixed effects models provide further support that mothers do, in fact, talk more to daughters who are uniquely prone to sexual activity. We explore a variety of sexual behaviors in adolescent girls. Before discussing our model and data, we provide a brief overview of some of the consequences of adolescent sex as well as evidence that the sexual behaviors we examine are particularly salient for adolescent girls. The consequences and costs of adolescent sex are well documented, particularly in the case of unprotected sex and multiple sexual partners—behaviors that are often termed “risky.” Pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and even depression are potential costs associated with risky sexual activity. Sabia and Rees (2008) use an instrumental variables approach to find that sexually active females, especially those not utilizing contraceptives, exhibit more symptoms of depression. STDs are also of considerable concern for women. The Centers for Disease Control reports that 1 in 4 young women between the ages of 14 and 19 in the U.S. is infected with at least one of the most common STDs (human papillomavirus (HPV), Chlamydia, herpes simplex virus, and trichomoniasis) (CDC 2010). Women are more likely to contract an STD than men when they have sex with an infected partner and do not use a condom, and women who are infected are more likely than infected men to be asymptomatic, which can lead to serious health complications. Furthermore, STDs may have more negative consequences for women as compared to men. These include the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, and cervical cancer (Landry and Turnbull 1997). Sexual intercourse with condoms (sometimes referred to as “safer sex”) may have negative consequences as well. First, many teenagers do not use condoms correctly and consistently (Santelli et al. 1998). Within our sample from the AddHealth, fewer than 1 % of sexually active adolescents report using condoms at every sexual encounter. If condoms are not used at all times correctly, intercourse is not without the physical risks noted earlier. A large interdisciplinary literature suggests that adolescent sex, even when condoms are used, can lead to adverse consequences. Among the small number of causal analyses in this area, Sabia and Rees (2011) find that females have a higher probability of high school graduation if they abstain from sex. Additionally, it is clear from the AddHealth that mothers at least perceive moral ramifications as well as consequences among their child’s peer group of their daughters’ sexual activity, since they report discussing these concerns with their adolescents. While sexual intercourse might increase self-esteem among males, non-virgin females are at increased risk for poor self-esteem (Sabia and Rees 2008). We take advantage of the richness of the AddHealth data, described in more detail below, by using three measures of adolescent sexual activity each of which speaks to distinct research questions and policy debates. First, we consider whether the adolescent has ever engaged in sexual intercourse, or “has had sex.” This is our broadest measure and is directly relevant to the debate regarding “abstinence only” education and the relevance of abstinence as an alternative choice. In some cases though, parents and/or policy makers may be more concerned about “risky sex” which we characterize in two ways: participation in sexual activity outside of a romantic relationship, i.e., “casual sex,” and having “unsafe sex,” which is defined as using condoms less than “most of the time” when engaging in vaginal intercourse.Footnote 3
 To our knowledge, this research is novel within economics in its focus on parental communication. However, there are some similarities between our topic and the substantial economics literature regarding sex education. Oettinger (1999) provides a thorough theoretical framework for the myriad potential influences of sex education on teen sexual activity. He refers to three types of sexual education, “risk altering,” “utility-altering,” and “risk revealing” which provide information to teens that can help them reduce the risks of teen pregnancy, inform teens of the different utilities they might expect to follow from their various choices, and understand the probability of becoming pregnant, respectively.Footnote 4 Parental communication may be similarly varied. Some parents may address all of these topics and others only some. Intensity and effectiveness of parental communication in these dimensions can also vary. Oettinger’s theory provides a useful context to our work, but our goal is to explore the possibility that parent communication is different than sex education curricula. Maternal talk may be better targeted and more personalized, less well informed, and/or more consistent and persistent. One potentially important difference we can imagine between parent and school communication is the value-forming potential of parental communication. Like school curriculum, parents can inform teens on expected utility from various choices/outcomes, but parents may also have a particular influence on the utility a teen derives from a given choice/outcome through something more fundamentally shaping of their utility function.Footnote 5
 A more recent study by Sabia (2006) approaches similar questions about the effectiveness of sex education but with newer data and a greater variety of empirical approaches. To identify the causal relationship between sex education and adolescent sexual behavior, Sabia employs Propensity Score Matching, Difference in Differences, and Instrumental Variables. Because his focus is in-school sex education curricula, he instruments for the availability/offering of sex education with proxies for the school’s budget (hypothesizing that sex education is not as essential to the curriculum as other academic fields and is therefore likelier to be offered when budgets are higher, other things held constant.) Sabia employs a variety of empirical strategies, ultimately demonstrating that careful attention to selection on observables is not sufficient for identifying the true effect of sex education. While we hypothesize that maternal talk may be very different than institutional sex education, our empirical results that follow are consistent with Sabia’s. He concludes that, while sex education is positively correlated with adolescent sexual activity, the relationship does not appear to be causal.",5

According to the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine (2000), early childhood experiences and learning are crucial for a child’s development in terms of physical, social, emotional and intellectual abilities, extending beyond the development of the individual’s capacity for subsequent learning. Good-quality early life experiences can enhance children’s resilience and promote optimal child development. In this context, the family plays a strategic role, as it represents the most important institution for a child. A growing body of evidence supports this view. For instance, Ellis et al. (1997) show that drinking behavior, the mental health of parents, family violence and original socioeconomic status may affect the mental health and risky behavior of children. Smith et al. (1998) find that adverse socioeconomic conditions may explain cause-specific adult mortality, while McMunn et al. (2001) assert that, in the absence of specific factors (e.g., benefits, long housing tenure and maternal education), psychological morbidity exists among children of single mothers. Among sociologists, Hango (2007) emphasizes that parental involvement in the lives of children may have a lasting impact on well-being. Hobcraft (2007) finds that child development is a key pathway out of social exclusion: childhood disadvantages affect a wide range of adult disadvantages. Similar evidence emerges from Bäckman and Nilsson (2011). Recently, economists have shown an increasing interest in the study of child development and its effect on human capital formation and later outcomes (Almond and Currie 2011). According to this literature, investments at different stages of early life are vital to the formation of cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, as the skills acquired in one stage affect both initial capacities and the technology of learning at the next stage. This may produce a lasting impact on many life outcomes. For instance, Heckman et al. (2006) find that latent non-cognitive and cognitive skills explain a variety of labor market and behavioral outcomes, while Cunha and Heckman (2009) show that early interventions to promote cognitive and non-cognitive development are essential to reduce adult inequalities. In this context, family environment has a great influence on children’s acquisition of marketable skills and acts as a factor for the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage (Mason 2007). We contribute to this literature by investigating the long-term impact of family difficulties during childhood on labor market outcomes (namely, employment and wages). This investigation requires a longitudinal perspective. With this in mind, we use information from the National Child Development Study (NCDS), a unique cohort database of British individuals born in 1958Footnote 1 containing information on family difficulties in the 1965 sweep,Footnote 2 when the cohort members were 7 years old. An empirical investigation is carried out using propensity score matching (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). Moreover, sensitivity analysis is applied to take into account the role of confounding factors (Ichino et al. 2008). Our analysis provides novel evidence that experiencing family difficulties during childhood reduces adult labor market prospects. This is consistent with the findings of Goodman and Sianesi (2005), who focused on the effects of many factors in child development (including family difficulties) on cognitive and non-cognitive skills and other later outcomes. We contribute to the existing literature in finding that the negative impact of childhood family difficulties does not decline over the cohort’s working life (measured at ages 33, 42 and 51). Moreover, we address the non-mutually exclusive nature of family difficulties, i.e., the fact that some individuals experience multiple difficulties at the same time. We find that the negative impact increases with the number of family difficulties experienced. Finally, we present new evidence concerning the lasting impact of single-specific family difficulties on adult labor market outcomes. Specifically, our estimation strategy distinguishes between individuals who experience only a specific family difficulty (approximately 2/3 of the full sample) and those who experience a specific family difficulty associated with one or more other difficulties (approximately 1/3 of the full sample). Our findings indicate that individuals who experience housing and economic difficulties during childhood (either as the only difficulty or one associated with other difficulties) tend to experience a detrimental impact on adult labor market perspectives, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies. For instance, Gregg and Machin (2000) found that both financial troubles and a father’s unemployment reduce educational and labor performance and increase the risk of a child’s involvement with the police. Similar evidence emerged in Blanden et al. (2004) and Corak (2004). In a related stream of literature, Glewwe et al. (2001) found evidence of a negative relationship between early childhood nutrition and academic achievements, while both Case et al. (2005) and Smith (2009) highlighted the existence of a lasting impact of childhood health and economic circumstances on adult health, employment and socioeconomic status. Our study also indicates that disabilities of family members (both physical and mental) and family disharmony (parental divorce and/or domestic tension) negatively affect the employment perspectives of cohort members when these difficulties are associated with other family difficulties. While the study of the role of disabilities of household members is quite new in the literature (see Franck and Meara 2009, for a study on the impact of maternal depression on the cognitive and non-cognitive skills of children), several studies have focused on the effects on various life outcomes of family structure changes due to the death of one or both parent or parental divorce. Many of them found a negative lasting impact on marital or fertility status, earnings (Corak 2001), income (Corak 2001; Gruber 2004), student performance (Painter and Levine 2000), education, health and behavioral outcomes (Conway and Li 2012). Nevertheless, Sanz de Galdeano and Vuri (2007) emphasized that, disregarding the possibility of endogeneity, the detrimental impact of parental divorce on cognitive skills and student performance is overstated. From a different perspective, our findings tend to reinforce doubts about its effective negative impact on later outcomes. In fact, as anticipated above, we find that family disharmony determines negative effects on labor market perspectives only when it occurs in connection with other family difficulties, suggesting that the compound effect is more important than the individual effect. More recently, the literature on the lasting impact of child development on later outcomes has been extended to other issues. For instance, Bonke and Greve (2012) found that parental behavior (including childcare) is important for their children’s development of healthy lifestyles. Gutiérrez-Domènech (2010) found evidence that parental childcare may differ by sex and education of parents, while their working time is less important. Bozzoli and Quintana-Domeque (2010) found that maternal education affects the way in which economic fluctuations impact birth weight, with possible consequences for child development. Finally, other studies have focused on the impact of conduct disorder problems during childhood (Le et al. 2005) or bullying (Brown and Taylor 2008) on labor market outcomes. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 presents the econometric method. Section 4 discusses the main results and sensitivity analysis. Finally, Sect. 5 presents the conclusion.",4

12.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,05 October 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-012-9164-7,The consequences of own and spousal disability on labor market outcomes and subjective well-being: evidence from Germany,December 2014,Nils Braakmann,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The interrelation between economic outcomes and individual health, e.g., individual disability, permanent diseases or other types of adverse health shocks, have been thoroughly studied in the literature (see, e.g., the review by Currie and Madrian 1999, or Fischer and Sousa-Poza 2009; Kidd et al. 2000; Wagstaff 2007; Zhang et al. 2009, for recent work). Relatively unsurprisingly, the general (qualitative) consensus from that literature is the finding of a negative relationship between deteriorating individual health on the one side and wages or employment prospects on the other side. These effects are also well recognized when it comes to compensation payments, e.g., in tort cases where a loss of health was caused by the actions of another individual. Furthermore, many countries operate compulsory insurance or social security schemes that are designed to protect individuals against the income losses that may be caused by adverse health shocks. In contrast, very little is known about the potentially adverse effects of health shocks that hit other members in the respective individual’s family. If such effects on other individuals exist, however, one can make the point that they need to be quantified and potentially considered in courts, compensation payments and in the design of insurance schemes. Theoretically, effects on other individuals are clearly possible: Some individuals might be forced to increase labor supply to offset the earnings loss caused by their partner’s disability or, to the contrary, may decide to stay at home and care for him or her. The available evidence on labor supply is relatively sparse and exclusively from the US: Berger and Fleisher (1984) consider the labor supply responses of wives to their husband’s illness. Their results indicate that depending on the availability of other income sources, specifically social transfers, the wife either increases her labor supply as a result to an adverse health shock for her husband if transfer payments are not available or decreases her labor supply to care for her husband if other income sources are available. However, their results are based on data from the 1970 s, in other words from a time where female labor market attachment was considerably lower than today. Haurin (1989), using data from the NLS for 1979–1981, finds no significant effect on a woman’s labor supply when her husband’s health worsens. Siegel (2006) uses cross-sectional data from the 1992 Health and Retirement Survey and finds adjustments of the labor supply of women, whose directions depends on the specific illness the husband suffers from. Her data, however, cover only older individuals between 50 and 61 years of age whereas I also consider younger individuals.Footnote 1 There is only a limited number of studies that consider the effects of a wife’s worsening health on her husband’ labor supply. One is Charles (1999), who uses data from the first two waves of the Health and Retirement Survey, and finds evidence that men tend to reduce their labor supply in a reaction to their partner’s poor health, whereas women tend to increase theirs. However, similar to Siegel (2006), he also focuses on older individual who were between 45 and 65 years of age at the time of the first wave of the survey. Johnson and Favreault (2001) look at the effects of adverse health shocks on retirement decisions and find that a joint retirement of couples becomes less likely when one of the partners retires due to health related reasons. Furthermore, just as individual disability is known to affect measures of subjective well-being (see, e.g., Ferrer-i-Carbonell and van Praag 2002; Lucas 2007; Oswald and Powdthavee 2007; Ville et al. 2001, for disability and, e.g., Groot et al. 2004; Wu 2001, for other permanent health shocks), it seems possible that an adverse health shock to a family member of loved one might affect these measures. There is evidence that subjective well-being measures within families are correlated (see, e.g., Winkelmann 2005, and Bruhin and Winkelmann 2009) and that measures of well-being are influenced negatively by adverse events happening to an individual’s partner (see Mendolia 2012, for job loss), which can be explained by other-regarding preferences or altruism within families in the spirit of Becker’s Treatise on the Family (Becker 1991, chapter 8). Finally, a connection between a partner’s disability and individual well-being can arise through consumption: Regardless of whether one views households as single units that make production and consumption decisions jointly as in the classical models by Becker (1965) or whether one views households as a collection of individuals agents who bargain over the available resources as in Grossbard-Shechtman (2003), it seems likely that household consumption will drop after one the members becomes disabled. This effect can arise for two reasons: First, the disability of one partner will have an effect on the income available for consumption of goods and services, either through a direct income loss or through the necessity to shift consumption towards medical goods and services to cater for the disabled individuals. Second, the disability of one partner will likely impose some constraints on the amount of time available for home production, either because the disabled partner might be forced to spend less on it or because the non-disabled partner has to spend additional time on the care for the disabled (see also Anderson and Grossman 2009). In this paper I jointly consider the effects of health shocks—specifically the onset of a permanent disabilityFootnote 2—hitting the respective individuals as well as their partners. I then look at changes in subjective well-being as well as labor market adjustments through changes in employment, hours worked and wages. Using panel data from the German Socio-Economics Panel for the years 1984–2006, this paper is the first to consider reactions by both men and women and by individuals of all ages. My results indicate that while individual disability has severe negative effects on labor supply and wages, no such effects exist for a disability of the respective partner. In terms of effects on life-satisfaction I find evidence that women, but not men, are harmed by the disability of their respective partner, regardless of whether income effects are controlled for. Note that this result is similar to findings by Winkelmann and Winkelmann (1995) on the external effects of a partner’s unemployment. There is also plenty of evidence that individuals tend to adapt, at least partially, to a variety of conditions (see, e.g. Easterlin 2001, 2003, 2005 for income; Clark and Oswald 1994 for long-term unemployment and Clark et al. 2008, for a variety of social or economic events). With respect to disability the results are somewhat inconclusive: While Oswald and Powdthavee (2007) find evidence that individuals adapt partially to disability, the evidence in Lucas (2007) suggests that there is no adaption. The results in this paper are more similar to Oswald and Powdthavee (2007) when it comes to individual disability (and in fact almost identical to their secondary results in the appendix, where they use the same dataset as me). However, both women and men do not seem to adapt to their partners’ disability. While this result is hardly surprising for men as there was no effect to begin with, it is potentially relevant for women. Econometrically, my estimates rely on the assumption that a partner’s health changes are exogenous with respects to an individual’s labor supply or individual well-being. This assumption seems relatively innocuous, in particular as previous researchers have often used the stronger assumption that changes in individual disability are exogenous with respect to that individual’s life-satisfaction (see Oswald and Powdthavee 2007, for the case of disability; Wu 2001 relies on a similar argument when looking at heart conditions). Additionally, I use fixed effects as well as Mundlak–corrected random effects estimators to control for unobserved heterogeneity and control for a fairly standard set of covariates, including work- and unemployment experience, years of schooling and socio-demographic characteristics in the wage and employment estimates and additionally for labor force status in the subjective well-being estimates. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the data and descriptive evidence. Section 3 presents the estimation strategy and results for the effects on labor supply and wages. Results from the life-satisfaction regressions are presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",14

However, the anticipation of health deterioration can also affect long-term saving via the health state dependence of the utility function. If for instance, bad health decreases the marginal utility of consumption of non-medical goods, that is, if health and consumption are Edgeworth complements, an individual who anticipates a durable deterioration of his health will save less. He will save more if bad health increases the enjoyment of additional consumption, that is, if health and consumption are Edgeworth substitutes. Using stylized numerical examples, Finkelstein et al. (2008) showed that this effect, on which we concentrate in this paper, is not trivial. Even a moderate effect in change of health on the marginal utility of consumption significantly affects the optimal level of savings. An additional observation made by Eeckhoudt et al. (2007) is that, with a health state dependent utility function, saving is not only affected by the expected health level but also potentially by its expected volatility. Consider for simplicity a two-period model of saving decision. The health level of the first period is given and the individual faces a zero-mean risk on health at the second period that leaves expected health unchanged. If the individual prefers to be wealthier in the second period where he faces the health risk rather than in the first one without risk, that is, if he is cross-prudent in wealth in Eeckhoudt et al. (2007)’ terminology, he will save more for the second period. In the opposite case, he will save less. Taking correct saving decisions depends however critically on one’s ability to predict health risks. In practice, people may fail to correctly predict health risks for various reasons. They may be wrong about probabilities of deaths and illnesses (Slovic 2000; Andersson and Lundborg 2007) or about the efficiency of prevention or treatment of health problems (Etner and Jeleva 2010, 2012).Footnote 1 In this paper, we are interested in another possible error: the incorrect prediction of the change in well-being following a decline in health. There is now a large body of literature in psychology showing that individuals have trouble anticipating their hedonic adaptation to this decline. Hedonic adaptation is defined by Frederick and Loewenstein (1999) as the progressive “reduction in the affective intensity of favorable and unfavorable circumstances”. It is a common phenomenon that tends to occur after major positive or negative life events like divorce, unemployment, marriage or romantic break-up. But it is particularly striking for health problems. In a famous study, Brickman et al. (1978) showed for example that people with paraplegia are not much less happy than lottery winners. Numerous studies confirmed this remarkable ability of people to adapt to handicap or to other severe health problems (Ashby et al. 1994; Wu 2001; Albrecht and Devlieger 1999; Oswald and Powdthavee 2008). In practice, adaptation relies on many processes. People who lose mobility for example can engage in activities that need this capacity to a lesser extent. They can redirect their attention to other pleasurable dimensions of their life or reframe their health problems as a positive learning experience (Frederick and Loewenstein 1999). Before facing health problems however, the other major conclusion of the literature is that people are seldom aware of their ability to adapt. They typically overestimate the duration and affective impact of negative health events. For instance, people suffering from chronic illnesses, disability, or long-term treatment for a condition, report better mood, happiness or Quality of Life (QoL) ratings than what healthy people predict they would under similar circumstances.Footnote 2
 Recent studies have shown that this failure to predict hedonic adaptation can potentially distort health decisions (Winter and Parker 2007; Macé and Le Lec 2011). But to the best of our knowledge, no theoretical work has investigated how it can also distort saving decisions, in particular through the health state dependence of the utility function. This paper is an effort to fill the gap. Its objective is to examine theoretically how the underestimation of hedonic adaptation to health deterioration can affect long-term saving through the health state dependence of the utility function, including cross-prudence in wealth. This question matters at a general level to better understand individuals’ saving decisions related to health risk. But it is particularly relevant for any empirical investigation into the direction and the magnitude of the effect of the change in health on the marginal utility of consumption. Until now, no clear consensus has emerged from this literature. Using different methods and data, Sloan et al. (1998), Viscusi and Evans (1990), Finkelstein et al. (2008) found for instance indirect evidence of a negative effect of adverse health changes on the marginal utility of consumption. But others like Lillard and Weiss (1997) or Edwards (2008) present, on the contrary, evidence of a positive effect.Footnote 3 This paper does not attempt to solve this debate. However, because it focuses on a possible source of potential divergence between expected and observed marginal utility of consumption, it introduces another important element to take into consideration when estimating the health state dependence of the utility function. For the sake of simplicity, we will restrict our analysis to the case of exogenous health changes. To model hedonic adaptation to health deterioration, we follow Groot (2000) by making a distinction between subjective and objective measures of health. We then assume that the individual underestimates his future subjective health. We show first that in this case, the individual saves more if health and consumption are Edgeworth substitutes but less if health and consumption are Edgeworth complements. When we add a zero-mean risk on future objective health, a new effect occurs: Even if the individual correctly anticipates the probability distribution of this risk, underestimating hedonic adaptation to health changes also increases his sensitivity, in terms of utility, to health risk. As a consequence, the magnitude of the change in saving also depends on whether or not the individual is cross-prudent. These theoretical results have three implications. Firstly, they add another source of variability among observed saving behaviors: the degree to which people anticipate hedonic adaptation to adverse health changes. Secondly, they help explain the difficulty to have conclusive empirical evidence about the direction and the magnitude of the effect of adverse health changes on the marginal utility of consumption. One insight gained by our focusing on hedonic adaptation is that such estimates are likely to be unstable, depending on the ability of people to predict hedonic adaptation and, on a methodological level, on whether the measure is based on hypothetical health deterioration or is made after hedonic adaptation has taken place. Problems are exacerbated if the marginal utility of consumption does not depend monotonically on health status. Finally, and more speculatively, our results may also shed light on the reluctance of some people to dissave when they are elderly. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Part 2 presents a simple exposition of hedonic adaptation to health shocks in a utility function. The implications of hedonic adaptation for savings decisions are analyzed in a two-period model in Part 3. Part 4 discusses the implications of our results and concludes.",3

Grafova,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"One of the most fundamental results in health economics is the strong association between financial status and health. This relationship holds for a variety of health outcomes, including self-reported health status, mortality, morbidity, obesity, and smoking, as well as when a number of financial status measures are used, including net wealth, assets, insolvency, adequacy of liquid savings, and indebtedness (Drentea and Lavrakas 2000; Hurd and Kapteyn 2003; Kim and Lyon 2008; Pollack et al. 2007; Zagorsky 2004a, b, 2005). However, the question of what mechanisms shape this relationship remains unclear. The key issue is not only that health can affect financial status but also that financial status can affect health. Moreover, other factors, such as time preferences, risk aversion, and self-control may influence both financial status and health, causing a spurious correlation between them (see Cutler et al. 2011; Deaton 2002, for reviews). This paper focuses only on one part of the complex relationship: health affecting wealth. Specifically, this paper examines the financial implications of the onset of chronic conditions among non-elderly adults. Poor health can affect financial status in several ways. First, it may add to medical expenses thereby increasing total household expenditure. Smith (2004, 2005) finds that the onset of a severe chronic condition increases the out-of-pocket medical expenditures of older adults by an average of $1,720 during the first 2 years following the onset. Himmelstein et al. (2009) use a random national sample of bankruptcy filers to find that 62.1 % of all bankruptcies in 2007 were medical. Second, poorer health may also increase non-medical expenditures (Wu 2003). Individuals in poorer health may need to rely on market services rather than household production for cooking and cleaning and use transportation services instead of driving their own vehicle. Increased expenditures may lead to dissaving, debt accumulation, and financial insolvency. Third, poorer health may also affect income through lower productivity, increased absenteeism, lower rates of labor market participation, and decreased hours of work (Bound et al. 1999; Smith 2004, 2005; Case and Paxson 2010). Such a reduction in income would reduce family financial status even if expenditures remain unaffected by health shocks. Taken together these factors may cause dissaving and debt accumulation. Most of the evidence showing that health status may affect the financial status of adults concentrates on the health of older adults (Smith 1999, 2004, 2005; Kim and Lyon 2008; Lee and Kim 2008; Wu 2003; Pelkowski and Berger 2004). Very little is known about how the health of non-elderly adults affects their financial status (Smith 2004). Yet, there are potentially very important differences in the health-financial status relationship between these two population groups. For instance, health shocks may impact family financial status through somewhat different pathways for older adults and non-elderly adults due to the differences in labor market participation. Additionally, the accumulated lifetime financial consequences of poorer health are more likely to be higher for individuals who acquired chronic conditions at a working age rather than at the post-retirement age. Another potentially important distinction between these two populations could be due to differences in health insurance coverage. Health insurance may promote better health (e.g. through better access to care) and it may also protect family financial status by reducing out-of-pocket medical expenditures. Older adults aged 65 and older are nearly universally covered by Medicare and their health insurance benefits are not likely to change because of changes in their health status. By contrast, non-elderly adults have higher uninsured rates than older adults, and the value of their health insurance coverage varies greatly and can be affected by their health status. Using the 1999–2007 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), this paper examines how the onset of a chronic condition affects the total net wealth, financial insolvency, liquid assets, home equity, and non-collateralized debt of individuals between the ages of 25 and 64.",5
13.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,03 April 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-013-9184-y,Pooling of income and sharing of consumption within households,March 2015,Jens Bonke,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In economics ‘income pooling’ refers to the idea that sharing depends on who actually brings the income into the household. In economic psychology it denotes that household members pool their incomes for financial purposes and draw on this pooled income for common and individual expenditures. The two concepts can diverge. For example, household members may agree on how to spend money irrespective of who earns it, but they may also agree to keep separate accounts and pay agreed amounts from their own account. Conversely, the household members may agree to pool their incomes in a joint account, but using money from this account may depend on who generates it. Our principal interest is in whether individual income and/or income pooling (in the economic psychology sense) influences the allocation of expenditures in couple households. We also test whether individual income within the household impacts individual consumption. We expect that for couples in a pooling regime, the intra-household allocation of consumption is concentrated around equal sharing. Consequently, the partners’ relative income will have little or no impact on the distribution of expenditures. The data stem from the danish household expenditure survey (DHES) including information about for whom every item was bought (‘for the household’, ‘mainly for the wife’, ‘mainly for the husband’, ‘mainly for the children in the household’ or ‘for others’), and information about the spouses’ management of their incomes, i.e. income pooling regimes. This allows for investigating income distribution, income pooling and expenditure distribution for the same couples. The investigation here centers on Denmark, where the welfare state and family-friendly policies, in particular, have aided in increasing female employment to around 74 percent for 25–64-year-olds by ensuring long, paid maternal leave and high coverage rates of childcare institutions of around 65 percent for 0–2-year-olds (Datta Gupta et al. 2008). The high employment rates for women are related to a marked tendency towards a high degree of equality in household production (Bonke and Jensen 2012).",23

Sabia,Robert B. Nielsen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A large number of studies have found that minimum wage increases are ineffective at reducing poverty because of poor target efficiencyFootnote 1 (Sabia and Burkauser 2010; Burkhauser and Sabia 2007; Leigh 2007; Burkhauser and Harrison 1999; Burkhauser et al. 1996; Burkhauser and Finegan 1989; Stigler 1946) and adverse labor demand effects (Neumark et al. 2004, 2005; Neumark and Wascher 2002; Sabia 2008; Burkhauser et al. 2000a, b). However, little is known about the effectiveness of minimum wage increases at reducing material hardship despite policymakers’ frequent claims that raising the minimum wage will reduce consumption deprivation (Kennedy 2005; Obama 2008).Footnote 2
 Poverty researchers have long recognized important distinctions between income- and consumption-based measures of deprivation (Iceland and Bauman 2007; Mayer and Jencks 1989). While the official U.S. poverty threshold is commonly used to measure income deprivation, this measure has been found to be ineffective at predicting consumption deprivation, such as food insecurity, housing hardship, durable goods deprivation, or health insecurity (Iceland and Bauman 2007). Thus, while raising the minimum wage has been found to be an ineffective anti-poverty tool, it could be a more effective means of fighting consumption deprivation. For example, minimum wage increases may be better targeted to those in hardship than those in poverty if the share of minimum wage workers who live in material hardship is greater than the share of minimum wage workers who live in poverty. This may be the case if a number of non-poor minimum wage workers live in hardship.Footnote 3 Empirically, the effectiveness at relieving consumption-based deprivation remains largely unexplored. Using data drawn from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we estimate the effect of minimum wage increases between 1996 and 2007 on numerous measures of hardship, including poverty, financial insecurity, housing insecurity, durable good deprivation, food insecurity, and health insecurity. Consistent with earlier work using the Current Population Survey (CPS) (Sabia and Burkauser 2010), we find little evidence that raising the minimum wage is an effective anti-poverty tool among individuals of working-age (16-to-64) or among workers. Moreover, we find little evidence that minimum wage increases alleviate poverty among those who are younger and less-educated (ages 16-to-29 without a high school degree) or younger (ages 16-to-24) and black. Turning our attention to material hardship, we find little evidence that increases in the minimum wage are associated with a reduction in financial hardship, housing stress, health insurance status, durable good deprivation, food insecurity, or participation in means-tested government programs such as food stamps, housing or rental assistance, energy assistance, or public health insurance. In dynamic models that explore flows into and out of poverty and onto or off of means-tested public programs, we continue to find little consistent evidence that minimum wage increases are effective in preventing individuals from falling into poverty or participating in public programs. Instead, we find modest evidence of redistributional effects of the minimum wage among some low-skilled individuals.",33

“Often there are fundamental inequalities in gender relations within the family or the household. (...) It is quite common in many societies to take for granted that men will naturally work outside the home, whereas women could do so if and only if they could combine such work with various inescapable and unequally shared household duties. This is sometimes called ‘division of labor’, though women could be forgiven for seeing it as an ‘accumulation of labor’. The reach of this inequality includes not only unequal relations within the family, but also derivative inequalities in employment and recognition in the outside world” Sen (2001). The motivation for this study arises from a puzzling observation closely connected to Sen’s statement that, after a decade, does not appear to have lost its validity: In most European households, couples do not practice an equal sharing of paid, labor market work and unpaid, household-related work. Instead, despite their improving educational achievements and professional qualifications, women are frequently observed to devote their labor primarily to family-work. Many of them still only become active in the labor market to the extent their remaining capacities allow them to. This is one of the main reasons why even modern developed societies have failed to achieve gender equality in the labor market. Many inequalities persist and hinder female economic independence (European Commission 2010b; Esping-Andersen 2009). In this paper, I present experimental evidence on couples’ decisions on dividing paid and unpaid labor and compare their behavior to mixed-sex pairs of strangers. The main questions addressed here are whether couples divide labor more often in order to reach efficiency gains when this requires one of the partners to perform an unpaid task, and, if so, whether male and female partners are equally likely to undertake the disfavored role in absence of individual productivity differences. Most of the specific gender inequalities observable in European labor markets are interdependent with household-related work which is still predominantly provided by women (Saraceno 2011; OECD 2012). In 2012, though with remarkable differences between countries, the average rate of female labor market participation was 62.3 % within the EU-27, compared to 74.6 % for men. As the household-related workload increases, especially when entering parenthood, this employment gap usually widens: figures for adults aged 25–49 provided by Eurostat (2013a) show, when entering parenthood, women’s participation in the labor market decreases by about 10 percentage-points while men’s increases by the same amount. While the share of male inactives or part-time-employed males in the same age-group, who state “child-rearing” or other family-related duties as the main reason for not seeking (full-time) employment is well below 10 % in the EU-27, among females, this share amounts to about 40 % (Eurostat 2013b, c). Consequently, women often face additional career-penalties, such as lower wages, fewer chances for promotion, etc. (European Commission 2010a). Thus, as a result of gender-specific labor division, we observe women to give up their income autonomy more frequently, thereby becoming dependent on their partners’ income and running a higher risk of descending into poverty. Economic theory provides different accounts to explain the gender-specific patterns in labor division between couples. Family economic approaches identify structural differences in expected returns to labor market activity for men and women (in terms of wages, likelihood of promotion, etc.) as a key determinant for the households’ decision on the concrete form of its labor supply—i.e. who is going to supply how much labor. From a policy perspective, the insights offered by economic theory suggest the following: If spouses imposed equivalent opportunity costs on the household by withdrawing from the labor market in favor of household production, then either spouse will do so with equal probability.Footnote 1 We would expect to find roughly equivalent opportunity costs when partners have comparable characteristics in terms of their education and experience and if the demand side for labor does not discriminate systematically against one sex. Over the past decades, many industrialized countries have made substantial progress with respect to these preliminaries, as e.g. steady rises in female educational attainment on the supply side and affirmative action policies on the demand side show (OECD 2012). These improvements should level the opportunity costs that males and females impose on their common households when they abstain from the labor market. Yet, within the vast majority of families, we still observe a form of labor division where the women cut back from labor market participation (Bühlmann et al. 2010; Saraceno 2011). These observations inevitably lead one to question the accuracy of an economic analysis focusing on gender differences in expected labor market outcomes as the main reason for unequal labor division within couples. The answer to this question has important implications for equalizing-policy: If eliminating gender differences in expected returns to labor market activity (e.g. by raising female educational attainment, affirmative action, etc.) is not sufficient to ensure that couples’ decisions on labor division will disadvantage one or the other partner with equal probability, the structural problem of female “underachievement” in the labor market will persist. Therefore, current policy approaches to improve female labor market outcomes may promise only limited success if men’s and women’s decisions on paid-labor participation differ depending on the social context—in this case, an individual versus partnership context. The contribution of this paper is to provide a direct, experimental test of this hypothesis. To the best of my knowledge, none of the few economic experiments concerned with couples’ decision-making conducted so far focus on the participants’ decisions on labor division.Footnote 2 It is a unique feature of the experiment presented here that it allows for a careful examination of how women and men divide paid and unpaid labor if objective measures on their individual productivity (i.e. expected pay-off), and hence potential gender differences in expected outcomes, are not available a-priori. Moreover, it allows for examination of how this decision changes within two particular social contexts: together with a stranger of the opposite sex or with one’s real-life partner. To achieve this, I recruited 20 real couples and 20 pairs of strangers and asked them to play a two-stage game; paired up either with their partner or a stranger of the opposite sex. In the first stage, participants make a joint decision on how to play the game: They can both complete a performance-based paid task (task A) or have one of the players perform an unpaid task (task B), thereby tripling the pay-rate for their partner playing task A. After completing their tasks, participants are informed about their pay-offs in private and then asked to make an individual decision about what proportion of their income to pay into a common pool, where it is increased by 20 % and distributed equally between the two players. If couples maximize a joint utility function, or bargain cooperatively, they should be more likely than strangers to tolerate income-inequality and realize the efficient outcome (i.e. divide labor and play the combination A/B as opposed to each playing the paid task A individually). Furthermore, since neither men nor women know their productivity in either task, they should be equally likely to perform the unpaid or the paid task when dividing labor, irrespective of whether they cooperate with a stranger or with their partner. In order to verify that behavioral differences between familiar and unfamiliar participants cannot be attributed to a selection mechanism, I additionally collect a large number of personality trait and attitude measures that are typically thought of as driving factors for (gender-specific) differences in labor market orientation. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 sketches the theoretical accounts economic theory offers to explain the phenomenon of gender-specific labor division within couples. Section 3 contains a brief overview of the empirical, mostly experimental literature that revolves around family economics and labor division. Section 4 describes the methodology used for the experiments presented here, followed by Section 5, which provides the main results. Section 6 contains a summary of sensitivity analyses in order to verify the robustness of the findings. The discussion in Section 7 offers some potential interpretations of the results. Section 8 concludes.",13

Yet, in many western countries women still depend on their husbands’ pensions to avoid poverty in old age (Gustman and Steinmeier 1999; Sundén and Surette 1998; McGarry and Davenport 1997). Although the Nordic countries are forerunners in terms of enabling high female labor force participation through family friendly policies, gender differences in pension savings remain large. In Denmark, while 88 % of men and 84 % of women aged 30–54 years are employed,Footnote 1 the raw gender wage gap is 20 % and has remained constant over the past decade (Deding and Holt 2010). As the Danish pension system is largely financed through earnings related contributions for the vast majority of workers, these differences translate into large gaps in pension savings and, consequently, in pension income. Also, Danish women’s tendency to take long career breaks for parental leaveFootnote 2 influences their lifetime incomes and pension savings negatively. Moreover, the tax system makes it more favorable for married couples to save in a private pension plan in the higher earner’s name (because pension savings are deductible from income taxes). All in all, these factors have resulted in men’s pension savings being on average 30 % higher than women’s (Jørgensen 2007). Given the large gender differences in pension savings in Denmark, the 2006 decision of the Danish parliament to change private pension savings from being regarded as community property upon divorce to being regarded as private property appears surprising and also received a great deal of criticism (e.g., Grønborg 2006). Although the reform would lead to a substantial reduction in divorced women’s pension incomes, and although about 40 % of all marriages in Denmark end in divorce (suggesting that the reform would affect a large number of women), the reform was enacted on May 30, 2006 (Folketinget 2005), and implemented on January 1, 2007.Footnote 3 Thus there was a 7-month time-window in which couples that would be affected by the reform could respond to it without actually being affected.Footnote 4 This study analyzes the effects of the reform on married couples in Denmark in terms of two outcomes: the probability of divorce and the level and composition of pension savings. Based on a simple theoretical framework, I expect the reform to lead to an increase in the probability of divorce and to an increase in both the level of total pension savings and the share of savings in plans affected by the legal reform. To test these predictions, I employ a difference-in-differences strategy, taking advantage of the fact that some groups in the population were not directly affected by the reform. Using register data on a 30-percent sample of the total Danish population, and pension savings data to identify which individuals were directly affected by the reform, I conclude that the legal reform increased the probability of divorce between 12 and 40 % in the treatment group relative to the comparison group. Moreover, married women (in particular, those with a higher income than their spouses) increased the level of savings and the share of savings in affected pension plans. The previous literature on the influence of legislative changes on divorce rates consists of two major strands: first, studies that analyze changes in the property rights of divorce (i.e., from mutual consent to unilateral divorce legislation) and second, studies that analyze changes in the economic incentives for divorce. Going from mutual consent to unilateral divorce law changes the property rights to the marriage but not the economic incentives of divorce. Therefore, according to the Coase Theorem, such a legislative reform should not influence divorce rates as long as spouses can transfer resources either within the marriage (under unilateral law) or as a part of the divorce settlement (under mutual consent law).Footnote 5 Despite this theoretical argument, empirical studies in general suggest that going from mutual consent to unilateral divorce law has influenced divorce rates positively, although the effects are small relative to the increase in overall divorce rates.Footnote 6
 The second strand of literature investigates legislative and policy reforms that somehow influence the economic incentives of divorce. Most of these studies have investigated American policies and data. For example, Hoffman and Duncan (1995) show that the introduction of Aid to Families with Dependent Children increased divorce rates in the United States. Whittington and Alm (1997) find that couples in the United States respond to tax incentives in their decision to divorce. Nixon (1997) finds a significant negative effect of Child Support Enforcement Policy on divorce probabilities in the United States, whereas Heim (1998) finds no significant effect of this policy on divorce rates. Goda et al. (2007) use American social security data to show that couples tend to delay divorce decisions from year nine to year ten, when spousal retirement benefits after divorce are conditional on the couple’s being married for at least 10 years. Tjøtta and Vaage (2006) show that increased levels of public transfers increase divorce probabilities in Norway. As the legislative reform that this study investigates influences the economic incentives of divorce, this study contributes to this second strand of the literature by showing that a legal reform that redistributed property rights over pension savings upon divorce led to an increase in divorce rates. Moreover, this study contributes to the limited literature on the effects of policies that influence the economic incentives of divorce outside of the United States. The previous literature on intra-household savings decisionsFootnote 7 notes that husbands and wives are likely to have conflicting preferences regarding (pension) savings due to differences in e.g. age at marriage, life expectancy, risk aversion and self-control (Browning and Lusardi 1996; Browning 2000; Lundberg and Ward-Batts 2000; Lee and Pocock 2007). It follows from these gender differences in preferences for savings that the relative bargaining power of the spouses influences intra-household saving decisions. Browning (2000) uses a two-period Nash bargaining model to show that the husband’s savings increase as the wife’s relative bargaining power increases. Lundberg and Ward-Batts (2000) show that wives with strong bargaining power (measured by high relative control over income, high relative age, and high relative education) accumulate more net wealth as they approach retirement and Lee and Pocock (2007) find that the balance of bargaining power plays a significant role in determining the intra-household level and distribution of savings in South Korea.Footnote 8 This study contributes to the existing literature by investigating husband’s and wives’ responses to a legal reform that affected how savings already undertaken would be shared in case of a divorce and by showing that the intra-household economic position of the wife has a substantial influence on this response. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the Danish pension system. Section  3 provides a theoretical analysis of the reform. Section 4 describes the data, and Sect. 5 the empirical strategy. Section 6 presents and discusses the results, and Sect. 7 summarizes and concludes.",1

Most studies of portfolio choice use a single utility function to describe preferences towards risk (Ameriks and Zeldes 2004; Bertaut and Haliassos 1997; Edwards 2008; Poterba and Samwick 1997, among others). However, decisions regarding savings and investments are often made jointly within the household. This implies that such decisions are functions of the preferences household members. This unitary approach to household decision-making would not be problematic if spouses had similar preferences towards risk, and there was perfect income pooling within the household. Survey data, however, show that in almost half of the married couple households, male spouse’s risk preferences differ from female spouse’s (Barsky et al. 1997; Mazzocco 2004). In addition, empirical studies show that household decisions vary by which member of the household earns the income (Lee and Pocock 2007; Lundberg et al. 1997; Cherchye et al. 2009). As more households invest in the stock market and manage their individual retirement accounts and pensions, understanding the factors that influence financial risk-taking has become an important topic. Despite widespread interest in the general topic, there is little research on how intra-household financial decisions are made. While previous studies suggest that women invest their asset portfolios more conservatively than men, these studies also show that it is not gender alone that drives the investment decisions of men and women, but rather a combination of gender and marital status (Bajtelsmit and Van Derhei 1997; Jianakoplos and Bernasek 1998; Sundén and Surette 1998).Footnote 1 Empirical studies on portfolio choice recognize that the asset allocations of married couples are outcomes of joint decision-making (Arano et al. 2010; Säve-Söderbergh 2012; Sundén and Surette 1998; Yilmazer and Lyons 2010). In addition, experimental studies that investigate the joint decision-making show that risky decisions made by couples differ from risky decisions made separately by each partner (Bateman and Munro 2005; de Palma et al. 2011). However, we have yet to understand how two-person households combine their individual risk preferences when they decide on asset allocation.Footnote 2
 This paper presents an analysis of household portfolio choice using a non-unitary model where spouses differ in their risk preferences. The theoretical framework builds on the cooperative bargaining model of Lundberg and Pollak (1993). Each spouse is assumed to have their own utility, and the household maximizes a weighted sum of two utility functions. Each spouse’s risk tolerance affects the investment outcome to the extent of the weight of her/his utility function. The weight on each spouse’s utility reflects the relative bargaining power, which is assumed to be affected by each spouse’s control over household resources. The model illustrates that if couples make investment decisions collectively within a cooperative bargaining framework, the choice of investment in risky assets depends on the bargaining power of the more risk tolerant spouse. One testable hypothesis derived from the theoretical framework is that the household invests a larger proportion of its wealth in risky assets when the spouse with more bargaining power is more risk tolerant. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for the years 1992–2006, we show that the share of investments in risky assets, as well as the probability of holding risky assets, increases with the risk tolerance of the spouse who has more bargaining power. The risk tolerance of the spouse who has less bargaining power does not affect the portfolio composition. We acknowledge that if there is a significant correlation between a spouse’s risk tolerance and his/her bargaining power, this would bias our estimates. For instance, if the more risk tolerant spouse also gains more decision-making power through his/her willingness to take more risk, our estimates on risk tolerance of the spouse with more bargaining power would be overestimated. Labor market opportunities of each spouse are shown to affect threat points and the bargaining power (Lundberg 2005; Friedberg and Webb 2006). In traditional societies, additional factors such as restraint on women’s mobility and ownership of property affect marital bargaining power (Agarwal 1997; Lundberg 2005). However, we could not find any study that claimed risk tolerance being a determinant of bargaining power.Footnote 3 Using data from the HRS, we verified a spouse’s risk tolerance and his/her bargaining power are not correlated. These findings are discussed in Sect. 7. Our findings have important implications for financial advisors. The textbooks on financial planning stress the importance of understanding a client’s risk tolerance in order to guide them towards a successful investment program (Dalton and Dalton 2004). However, the process of risk tolerance assessment is in its early initial stages (Hanna et al. 2013). Suggestions for estimating a client’s risk tolerance include “understanding of the client and the client’s history with investment securities” and using a “questionnaire designed to elicit feelings about risky assets and the comfort level of the client given certain changes in the portfolio.” (Dalton and Dalton 2004, page 464). However, the design of these questionnaires is not dictated by the theory (Guillemette et al. 2012). Our study provides evidence that assessing the risk tolerance of a couple is even more intricate than assessing a single person’s risk tolerance. The financial advisors need to be aware that financial decisions are functions of each member’s preferences and the relative influence of each member plays a significant role on asset allocation. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sect. 2 reviews the previous literature on household bargaining and savings decisions. Section 3 illustrates the theoretical framework, and Sect. 4 explains the empirical model. Summary statistics are provided in Sect. 5, and empirical findings are presented in Sect. 6. Other possible explanations for our findings and robustness checks are discussed in Sect. 7. Finally, Sect. 8 summarizes our conclusions.",24

Wong,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Traditional economic models treat the household as a homogenous unit, where resources of all individuals are pooled together to maximize a household utility function. The decisions and outcomes of all family members are assumed to correspond directly with the household head. Empirical tests, however, reject the hypotheses set forth by these unitary models. One such hypothesis is the income pooling hypothesis (Lundberg and Pollak 1996), which predicts that household expenditure depends on total non labor income as opposed to the proportion controlled by each household member. Given the lack of empirical support for the unitary model, researchers have proposed other models of decision-making among married spouses, which account for differences in preferences and constraints. These models include independent individual decision-making models, which assume spouses act independently, but consider the resources, characteristics and prior decisions of other household members. Examples include Mincer’s models of household production and wives’ labor supply (Mincer 1962, 1963) as well as Grossbard-Shechtman’s model of time allocation after marriage (Grossbard-Shechtman 1984). The most common alternative to the unitary model for examining decisions in married households are bargaining models, which assume a mechanism for joint decision-making among spouses. Marital bargaining in these models may be cooperative or non-cooperative, however, the allocation of household resources corresponds to each spouses’ relative bargaining power. Marital bargaining power has been shown to affect household outcomes in empirical studies including saving decisions (Lundberg et al. 2003; Lundberg and Ward-Batts 2000; Lee and Pocock 2007), intrahousehold allocation (Browning et al. 1994) and labor supply (Chiappori 1992). The purpose of this paper is to develop and test an alternative approach to modeling the demand for life insurance as a joint household decision. Specifically, I investigate the impact of marital bargaining power on the size of life insurance policies purchased by married couples over the age of 50. The theoretical model developed in this paper employs a “collective"" approach (Chiappori 1988, 1992), where household economic outcomes are determined by the joint decision making of the husband and wife, whose preferences are assumed to differ from one another. Couples bargain over available resources and maximize utility through a predetermined sharing rule. This sharing rule remains unobservable and is assumed to vary with observable factors such as relative age, income and education. Tilting relative bargaining power in favor of one spouse results in the household placing greater weight on consumption in states of nature when that spouse is alive. Given plausible assumptions regarding household members’ survival probabilities and marginal utility of consumption, the model predicts that an increase in the relative bargaining power of the husband results in a decrease in the level of insurance on his own life. Correspondingly, an increase in the husband’s bargaining power is associated with an increase in the size of the life insurance policy on the life of the wife as the household insures against the lost future resources of the wife in the event of death. These predictions are consistent with those from other studies that assume an independent individual decision-making framework. For example, Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2010) found that increasing the value of work-in-household, traditionally performed in greater proportion by wives, resulted in higher relative bargaining power of wives and subsequently greater access to husbands resources. Grossbard-Shechtman (1984) also suggested the importance of the value placed on work-in-household in the determination of spouses’ life insurance benefits within the framework of an individual decision-making model. To empirically test for the impact of marital bargaining power in the demand for life insurance, as predicted by the theoretical model, I first examine whether known factors of bargaining power affect the amount of insurance covering the lives of husbands and wives, respectively. Direct tests of bargaining power are then employed using available proxies, primarily relying on unique data from survey responses querying which family member has the “final say"" regarding major household decisions. Empirical results using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) provide evidence that holdings of term life insurance are affected by the balance of power within the household. First, I find asymmetries in the effect of education on the amount of life insurance covering husbands and wives, respectively. When applying direct tests, I find evidence that the amount of insurance covering the lives of husbands decreases when bargaining power is shifted away from the wives, in a manner that is consistent with the theoretical model developed in this paper. In contrast, marital bargaining power has a substantially smaller effect on the amount of insurance covering the lives of wives. However, results when obtained using the subsample of wives with a clearer motive for insuring against lost future resources in the event of death are in greater alignment with the theoretical model. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of literature pertaining to the determinants of life insurance choice and summarizes studies examining the impact of marital bargaining power on other economic outcomes. Section 3 develops a two period model of life insurance demand augmented with collective bargaining and derives testable hypotheses. Section 4 presents the empirical framework, and describes the associated data. Results of the empirical analysis are in Sect. 5. Concluding remarks are in Sect. 6.",5

Broussard,Ralph Chami,Gregory D. Hess,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Agents that face risk and uncertainty find it optimal to seek arrangements to mitigate that risk. These arrangements could be market based, such as insurance schemes, which could be privately or publicly-provided. But, such schemes are never complete, as agency problems and other types of frictions preclude the provision of full insurance. As a result, agents continue to seek other forms of insurance, despite the exclusivity clauses in many of the formal insurance contracts. These other forms of arrangements, which are typically referred to as non-market arrangements, fall outside the market-based ones, and are used to complete or to substitute for the presence or lack thereof of market based insurance schemes. For example, family co-insurance arrangements, which include inter-vivos transfers as well as bequests, familial loans and other forms of financial assistance, are typically geared to assist family members in need—for example, see Cox (1987), Arnott and Stiglitz (1991), Altig and Davis (1992) and Bernheim and Kotlikoff (2001). Implicit in these non-market arrangements, however, is the assumption that agents involved in the co-insurance arrangements find it optimal to adhere to their ex-ante promises. That is, it is possible that promises of help made before an accident, are reneged on after the fact. Or, the presence of such transfers may induce moral hazard type problems, leading to the failure of such arrangements. Thus, the question is what mitigates such situations? Arnott and Stiglitz (1991) suggest ‘peer monitoring’ as one mechanism through which agency problems among co-insuring agents can be mitigated. Chami and Fisher (1996) show that trust may preclude the need for costly monitoring, as trust does away with the gains from such type of externalities. But trust or mutual caring are only important here in the sense that they insure that agents through such sentiments can find a match, that is a person who shares their views, ideals, or their preferences, which would help reduce the agency problem, and preclude costly negotiations or the need for monitoring. But, the question now is how can one be sure of finding that agent who shares similar preferences? In this paper, we explore this insight further in the context of self-employed agents. Such individuals present a natural example of individuals facing risk on their own, and who are in need of ways to mitigate such risk. One way could be through marriage. Hess (2004) and Chami and Hess (2005) explore theoretical and empirical aspects of individuals who attempt to offset idiosyncratic risk to their incomes through marriage. Another way in which risks to a family could be offset would be through procreation. The latter is easier to see in the context of a farmer facing risk, and where having children help mitigate that risk. Typically, the explanation given is that farmers view children as assets, who can continue to farm and produce agricultural output as the farmer ages-a task that is not easily market substitutable-when financial markets are not well developed. See Dasgupta (1995) who provides a number of examples linking the relationship between population growth and economic incentives and activity in developing economies. There is, however, another compelling reason as to why farmers, like other self-employed agents may decide to have more children. Farmers, like other family-business owners, share a very important concern, unlike other economic agents, who are employed in the market place. They are concerned with insuring that the farm or family-owned business continues and prospers, even after they are gone. Thus, succession is a major factor that motivates founders to choose a single child to inherit the business.
Footnote 1 For instance, Santarelli and Lotti (2005) find that the probability that a family firm ‘exits’, i.e. closes down, dramatically rises in its thirtieth year, which is the year when family firms often are forced to face succession issues. Qualitative evidence from their study showed that nearly all respondents stated that the family firm should be preserved by transmitting control to an heir.
Footnote 2
 Having more children, despite its costs, would go a long way to finding that person who shares the parents’ understanding of the business, or in other words, is as close as possible to a perfect match for running the business in the future.
Footnote 3 Recent papers by Mehrotra et al. (2011b) and Bunkanwanicha et al. (forthcoming) explore how owners of a family firm can increase the value of the firm through marriage. Mehrotra et al. (2011a) suggests that the relative success of family firms in Japan can be attributed to the practice of legally adopting highly qualified adults to take over the business. Similar to our paper, these papers investigate non-market mechanisms that owners of family firms employ to ensure not only the current success of the business, but also success of the business that will last after succession. It is estimated that in the US and most western economies, more than 75 % of all family firms are transferred to one child [see Gersick et al. (1997)], and that number is much higher in developing economies. Thus the business is not looked on as wealth to be shared equally among the siblings. In many cases, the parent chooses one child to run the business, where the other members are given side payments, but are not involved in managing the business—e.g., see the famous Vanderbilt case described in Clark (1966). Moreover, this motive for choosing an heir is not altruistically motivated; rather it is purely predicated on the presumption that the child with the closest match to the parent, would ensure the continued success of the business. Such a move would, in turn, maximize the value of the firm to the parent/owner, and perhaps even to his or her children if a bequest is made.
Footnote 4
 Why might a someone with a family business have more children? As discussed in Broussard et al. (2003), we hypothesize that from a non-benevolent perspective, a head of household would prefer to sell a family business to an insider, such as a child, as compared to an outsider. In short, the reason is that they are likely to get a higher price from the sale to an insider. Because of imprecise accounting practices, weak monitoring and auditing, and perhaps private knowledge of local market conditions, privately held companies are very difficult for all but insiders to correctly value.
Footnote 5 In other words, outsiders have less information about the true value of a family business, and in a situation of adverse selection, are likely to place a lower value on the business unless they share an insider’s perspective. Of course, some inside family members may also not see the true value of the business. However, the key to the hypothesis is that the probability of finding such a ‘match’ who sees the true value of the firm is increasing in family size. In other words, by having more children, a family business owner increases the likelihood that he will sell the business at a higher price. Hence, everything else equal, a family business owner will have a stronger incentive to have more children.
Footnote 6
 The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the data used in this study. In Sect. 3 we explore the empirical regularities in the data, providing simple tests of the differences in means and regression analysis to test whether business owning/self-employed parents have more children. We present more formal econometric evidence in Sect. 4, and also explore in Sect. 5 additional issues related to self-employment status and family size.",22
13.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,07 February 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-013-9179-8,Family proximity and the labor force status of women in Canada,June 2015,Janice Compton,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In this paper, I use the 21st cycle of the Canadian General Social Survey, 2007 (GSS-21) to examine the patterns of family proximity in Canada and the effect of close proximity and co-residence on the labor force participation of women aged 45–60. I argue that the relationship between proximity and labor supply is most likely due to transfers of care, and therefore focus on women and their mothers or mothers-in-law as care transfers tend to be gendered. For example, the labor force attachment of women with young children may be positively influenced by the proximity of their mothers who are able to provide childcare transfers or alternatively may be negatively influenced by their mothers’ need of elder care.Footnote 1
 I first consider the determinants of proximity. This topic has received far more attention in the US and European literature, likely due to the lack of data available on proximity in Canada. To the best of my knowledge, there is no comprehensive study of family proximity in Canada or its impact on labor market behavior. Fast et al. (2004) examine the proximity of all caregivers to the elderly, but not family proximity in general. Although demography and gerontology literatures specifically consider elder care and childcare as motives for proximity, the economic literature tends to focus on migration within the human capital model (c.f. Glaser and Tomassini 2000; Clark and Wolf 1997; Lin and Rogerson 1995; Rogerson et al. 1993, 1997; Silverstein 1995). Konrad et al. (2002) and Rainer and Siedler (2009) are two recent exceptions in the economic literature in that they focus on the need for care transfers, rather than labor market influences, as motivations for migration. Using the German Aging Survey, Konrad et al. (2002) claim that elder siblings are more likely to live away from their mothers in order to avoid the costs of caring for elderly mothers. Rainer and Siedler (2009) use a different German dataset, the German Socio-Economic Panel and find a sibling effect, but not a birth order effect, only a sibling effect: compared to adults with siblings, adults who are only children live closer to their mothers. The Canadian findings presented here are consistent with Rainer and Siedler (2009). I find evidence of a sibling effect (only children are less likely to live away from their mothers than those with siblings) but no birth-order effect (first-born children are not more likely to live far away than their later born siblings). I also observe strong regional patterns in proximity, attributable to historical migration and immigration trends in Canada. I next estimate the effect of co-residence and close proximity to mothers or mothers-in-law on the labor force attachment of adult women aged 45–60. Although I hypothesize that a primary mechanism linking proximity and labor force attachment is the availability of child care and elder care, I do not have data on transfers of care and so am unable to estimate this link directly. Instead, I include proximity categories in the labor force participation equations and rely on comparisons across samples to identify potential reasons for the relationship. This strategy has the advantage of capturing not only the effect of predicted or observed transfers of care, but also the insurance effect of care availability. For example, the availability of “back-up” childcare—the ability of mothers living in close proximity to respond to emergency calls from the school, to drive children to after-school activities or to provide grandchild care at irregular times—may increase the labor supply and productivity of women, even if they never use this childcare. The effect of family provided care on labor force attachment is a growing area of research. To date, most research has focussed on elder care (Wolf and Soldo 1994; Bolin et al. 2008; Pezzin et al. 2007; López-Anuarbe 2012). The role of intergenerational transfers of childcare has been considered theoretically by Cardia and Ng (2003) and Belan et al. (2007). Both develop overlapping generations models that allow for intergenerational transfers of care. Both models predict that grandchild care transfers from parents have positive impacts on the labor supply of women with children. A few papers have empirically tested the hypothesis using the European SHARE dataset.Footnote 2 Dimova and Wolff (2008, 2011) and Zamarro (2009) estimate the impact of grandchild care on the labor force participation of women, using proximity as an instrument for grandchild care. The authors find small positive effects of predicted child care on labor supply. The effect in these papers may be underestimated as they rely on estimates of regular transfers of childcare from mothers and therefore ignore any insurance aspect that close proximity may provide. Posadas and Vidal-Fernandez (2012) instrument grandchild care in the US with indicators for which grandparents are alive and find substantial effects of grandparent provided childcare on labor force participation of women. Finally, Compton and Pollak (2011) estimate the impact of proximity on labor supply in the US and show a substantial positive effect of close proximity, but only for married women with children. The marginal effects in the latter two papers estimated for the US are similar to those presented here for Canada. The empirical findings suggest that there is a strong negative labor market effect of living away from one’s mother, but only if there are children under the age of 15 in the household. Compared to their counterparts living in the same neighborhood or surrounding area as their mother, married women with children who live more than half a day away are less likely to work, and work fewer hours. For unmarried women, this labor market effect is found only on the intensive margin. The marginal effects are large: married women with children living away from their mothers are 15 % points less likely to be in the workforce and work 8–11 fewer hours per week on average, compared to those living in the same neighborhood or surrounding areas. While close proximity has a positive effect on labor market attachment, co-residence has a negative effect. Co-resident married women without children living away from their mothers are 26 % points less likely to be in the workforce compared to those in the surrounding area. I outline alternative explanations for the proximity-labor force attachment relationship but argue that because these results are found only for that demographic in need of childcare, the availability of family to provide care is the most likely mechanism. The possible endogeneity of proximity and labor force supply has largely been ignored in the literature on childcare until very recently. Dimova and Wolff (2008, 2011) and Zamarro (2009) use proximity as an instrument for family provided childcare, under the assumption that proximity is exogenous.Footnote 3 Compton and Pollak (2011) assess the impact of proximity on labor supply but, without a valid IV for proximity, endogeneity concerns are addressed with the use of a sample of military wives in the US Census. Since the location decisions of military households are largely exogenous, this sample should not be subject to the same endogeneity concerns. Here, I estimate an IV model that uses province of birth and an indicator for whether or not women were born in the same province as her parents as instruments for proximity. The results are consistent with previous regressions. The validity of this IV is not indisputable, however, and with such large marginal effects, it is difficult to believe that endogenous preferences do not play some role. However, the results are still relevant for policy. In particular, the findings indicate a need for policy makers to consider intergenerational transfers when designing labor market policies. For example, policies designed to increase the retirement age may reduce the availability of mothers to provide childcare, and lower the labor force attachment of the middle generation. Moreover, the regional patterns of proximity in Canada suggest that national childcare and labor market policies may yield different outcomes across the country due to patterns of family proximity. The paper proceeds as follows. The data are described in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, I discuss the patterns and determinants of proximity in Canada, with special attention to differences across geographical regions of Canada. In Sect. 4 I present regression results for the impact of proximity on women’s labor force participation and usual hours worked. I discuss alternative explanations but argue that the confluence of results across samples is most consistent with the availability of care hypothesis. Using region of birth and an indicator for whether a woman was born in the same province as one or both parents, I instrument proximity and estimate the effect using a bivariate probit model.

Such increase in the number of generations simultaneously alive creates further opportunities for intergenerational support which may take the form of financial or time transfers (Bengtson 2001; Bianchi et al. 2012; McGarry and Schoeni 1995; Soldo and Hill 1995). US Census Bureau reports indicate that the proportion of children under 18 living with a grandparent has more than tripled from 3.2 % in 1970 to 10 % in 2010.Footnote 1 There are also a considerable proportion of children benefiting from grandparent provided child care even if the grandparent does not necessarily live in the same house. Survey of income and program participation data shows that the proportion of children under five with employed mothers benefitting from grandparent provided child care as their main source of day care increased from 13.9 % in 1988 to 19.6 % in 2005 (Laughlin 2010). On average, those preschoolers were spending 24 hours per week in grandparent care. The literature on intergenerational transfers outlines several motives for family transfers such as altruistic motive where parents care about their children’s well-being (Barro 1974; Becker 1974), exchange motive where parents make money transfers in order to receive services such as old age care from their adult children (Bernheim et al. 1985; Cox 1987; Cox and Rank 1992), and warm glow motive where people get satisfaction from the act of giving (Andreoni 1989).Footnote 2 Upward time transfers have been explored in the caregiving literature in terms of old age care provided by adult children to their elderly parents (Brown 2005; López-Anuarbe 2013; Pezzin and Schone 1999; Pezzin et al. 2007, 2009). On the other hand, the literature on downward time transfers in the form of grandchild care provided by the elderly to the younger generation has mainly focused on the impacts on the parent generation. There is general consensus in the literature that the availability of grandparent provided child care increases labor force participation of young mothers (Compton 2013; Compton and Pollak 2013; Del Boca 2002; Leibowitz et al. 1992; Sasaki 2002; Maurer-Fazio et al. 2011; Posadas and Vidal-Fernández 2012). On the other hand, relatively little is known about how grandchild care needs affect the economic behavior of grandparents. Ying and Marcotte (2007) find that taking in a grandchild in the household decreases labor supply of unmarried grandparents and increases labor supply of married grandmothers. Lei (2008) finds that grandmothers are likely to help their low income children by working more to provide financial help or by providing grandchild care. Ho (2013) finds that the 1996 PRWORA welfare-to-work reforms targeting low income young mothers had indirect impacts on the related grandmothers. The latter decreased grandchild care and increased net financial transfers that they make to the low income young mothers. Co-resident grandmothers also increased their labor supply. In this paper, we explore the relationships between grandchild care needs, intergenerational transfers of time and money and grandparents’ labor supply behavior. Using data from the health and retirement study, we estimate multivariate models of grandchild care, financial transfers, and labor supply. We find that grandparents with a new born grandchild were more likely to provide grandchild care while married grandparents were also more likely to work and provide financial help to the younger generation. Those who lived within ten miles of their grandchildren were more likely to provide grandchild care and provided higher time transfers while married grandparents were also more likely to provide financial help and provided higher monetary transfers. Married grandmothers worked longer hours when a grandchild was resident in the household. On the other hand, single grandparents do not seem to adjust monetary transfers and labor supply by much in response to the birth of a new grandchild and family living proximity. Married grandparents living in census divisions with higher cost of formal child care also gave higher financial transfers to the parents. We add to the relatively sparse empirical literature on grandchild care needs and grandparents’ economic behavior. Understanding how grandchild care needs are correlated with grandparents’ economic behavior is important from a policy perspective. Policies targeting the younger generation’s work and child care decisions can have potential unpredicted repercussions on the older generation (Ho 2013; Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1994; Schoeni 2002). This raises not only the issue of potential crowding out of private transfers by public transfers, but also concerns about the repercussions on the grandparent generation. At an age where one could be anticipating the enjoyment of their later years, one could be called forth to help with grandchildren which would be resource intensive for the grandparent.Footnote 3 With the increasing involvement of grandparents in the lives of their grandchildren, it becomes increasingly important to understand how grandchild care needs are related to grandparents’ economic behavior. The paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we present our data and empirical strategy, in Sect. 3, we present our results on grandchild care needs and intergenerational transfers of time and money and grandparents’ labor supply. We conclude in Sect. 4.",49

Hyclak,Chad D. Meyerhoefer,Larry W. Taylor,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The Great Recession of 2008–2009 presented millions of Americans with a combination of bad economic developments unseen since the 1930s. During the year and a half of recession from the end of 2007, financial assets dropped in value by $9.2 trillion (an 18 % decline) and owners’ equity fell by an amazing $4.1 trillion (a 40 % decline).Footnote 1 Baby boomers nearing retirement were at an exceptionally high risk of losing their health insurance. Census Bureau estimates reported by DeNavas-Walt et al.  (2010) show that the total number of uninsured Americans aged 45–64 rose by more than 26 % from 2005 to 2009, a rate more than double the rate for all Americans. Not surprisingly, substantial decreases in consumption spending accompanied the financial distress (Shapiro 2010), and this included a decrease in spending on drugs and health care of approximately 37 % (Hurd and Rohwedder 2010). Unemployment rates for men rose significantly more than for women during the Great Recession, and to compensate for the loss in household income, married women entered the labor force when their husbands lost their jobs. On the other hand, Starr (2013) reports that in many cases the added worker effect was insufficient to replace lost income and/or reductions in housing and financial wealth. The implication is that many households needed to pare expenditures in response to economic dislocation. Moreover, Starr finds that the added worker effect was substantially smaller for those over 40 years of age. So, for older Americans, job loss was generally not well mitigated by changes in labor participation within the household. This paper further investigates the impact of the Great Recession on the well-being of older Americans. Data sources are the AARP Closer Look Baseline Survey (September 30, 2009) and the 2008 and 2009 waves of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). We employ probit regression to examine the recession-related effects of adverse job market developments, changes in housing and financial wealth, and threats to health insurance coverage among those at least 45 years old. Of special interest are the reactions of older citizens to the crisis that impair prospects for sound long-term financial and/or physical health, and actual declines in mental health attributable to the financial crisis. Consistent with the extant literature, we find significant adverse effects of job loss and reduced pay on health care decisions and on mental health. Our most important finding, however, is that lost wealth and threats to health insurance coverage have equally important negative effects on the well-being of older Americans.",4
13.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,04 October 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-013-9223-8,Labor supply and household meal production among working adults in the Health and Retirement Survey,June 2015,Richard A. Dunn,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Households allocate a significant proportion of their time and monetary resources to meal production activities. Although the choice of production method—eating at restaurants or cooking at home—depends on the marginal value of time, previous research exploring labor supply decisions and the allocation of household resources across meal production activities has generally focused on the effect of retirement. Yet, the existing literature from food psychology, economic geography and labor economics all suggest that changes in the number of hours worked while staying employed may have a very different effect on food consumption and production patterns than dropping entirely out of the labor force. Therefore, this paper adds to the literature on household meal production by estimating the effect of changes in hours worked on household time and monetary allocation to preparing meals at home and eating at restaurants.Footnote 1
 To do so, I use information on time use and household expenditures from the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS) supplement to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS). Although CAMS utilizes a retrospective survey instrument and thus is neither a time diary nor an expenditure log, its longitudinal nature offers the unique feature of collecting data on both time use and expenditure at multiple periods of time. Existing studies typically rely on a single cross-section of food expenditure and time-use (Gronau and Hamermesh 2006; Gan and Vernon 2003; Lecocq 2001); or one cross-section of time use combined with a different cross-section on food expenditure (Aguiar and Hurst 2005; Crossly and Lu 2005); or combine two cross-sections from different years to make inter-temporal comparisons (Hamermesh 2007). In contrast, CAMS is administered to a sub-panel of HRS participants every 2 years and respondents are asked to provide information about both time use and household expenditures. Hence, unobserved characteristics associated with the resource allocation decisions of households that are heterogeneous across individuals but invariant over time can easily be incorporated into the empirical analysis. A second benefit to utilizing CAMS is that beginning with the 2005-wave both respondents and their spouses/partners were asked to provide time allocation information. This is an important feature of the data as models that relax the assumption of (1) a unitary household production function and (2) a unitary household consumption function predict that differences in preferences, marginal productivities, wage rates, asset levels, and marriage market prospects can lead to differences in household-production supply functions both across and within households (Grossbard-Shechtman 2003). Thus, the CAMS data allow estimation of an econometric specification that explicitly accounts for the potential reallocation of production activities within multi-member households when one member alters their labor supply. To preview the main results, I find that single males who increased the number of hours worked spent less time preparing meals at home and less time eating at restaurants, while spending more on groceries. Increasing labor supply by 10 h per week was associated with 33.8 fewer minutes per week allocated to at-home meal preparation, 39.5 fewer minutes per month eating at restaurants, and $6.73 more per week spent on groceries. In contrast, the time and expenditure allocations of single females did not respond to changes in hours worked. Within dual-member households, increases in own-labor supply decreased the amount of time allocated to meal preparation at home for both males and females. Increasing labor supply by 10 h per week was associated with a decrease of 30.4 min per week for the former and 30.5 min per week for the latter. The time allocated to meal production by one member of the household was increasing in the labor supply of the other member, but was never statistically significant at standard levels, providing only weak evidence for intra-household reallocation of production activities. Conditional on income and asset sources, household expenditure on groceries tended to increase as the male partner in a dual-member household worked more hours, but did not respond to the labor supply of the female partner. Although documenting the correlation between changes in hours worked and meal production activities is a worthwhile addition to the literature, the value of these estimates increases if they could reasonably be interpreted as the causal effect of changes in labor supply. Unobserved permanent shocks to labor market productivity, transitory health shocks, and reporting error in the CAMS dataset are each possible sources of bias. While each of these may have small qualitative effects, I conclude that none of these alternative explanations, either alone or in concert, could account for the qualitative findings.",8

There are two mechanisms which may mitigate the benefit from these transfers to the intended recipient. Firstly, if the transfer is paid to the parent, there is an agency problem: The parent is not compelled to spend the benefit on the child. For example, Blow et al. (2012) find that unanticipated variation in the level of Child Benefit in the UK affects expenditure predominantly on adult-assignable goods, while Kooreman (2000) finds strong positive effects of the Dutch Child Benefit on child-assignable goods. (The ‘labelling effect’ of the programme’s name clearly differs between these countries—see Beatty et al. 2014). It also matters which parent receives the welfare payment, with a switch from father to mother (‘wallet to purse’) being shown to raise expenditure on child care and children’s clothing, and reduce expenditure on alcohol and tobacco, for example (Lundberg et al. 1997; Phipps and Burton 1998). Secondly, regardless of who receives the transfer, parental altruism may substantially offset the gain to the targeted household member, as an altruistic head-of-household may redistribute resources among household members so as to maximise household welfare (Becker 1974, 1981). In this case, an in-kind transfer may still benefit the child if the household is induced to consume more of the good than it would voluntarily (Currie and Gahvari 2008), or if the parent does not perceive the publicly provided good to be a close substitute for a privately provided good. For example, Bingley and Walker (2013), show that day care milk or milk tokens in the UK crowd out private expenditure on milk (an essentially homogeneous product) to 80 % of these transfers’ value, but Free School Meals (for which there is no close market substitute) only crowd out expenditure on food to 15 % of their value. Nevertheless, von Hinke Kessler Scholder (2013) finds no effect of the withdrawal of Free School Meals from some groups on their bodyweight, suggesting that targeted children receive no better an overall diet than in the absence of the programme. The extent to which the incidence of the net benefit of a transfer programme is retained by the targeted recipient is referred to as the ‘Intrahousehold Flypaper Effect’ (Jacoby 2002). In this paper we evaluate the magnitude of this effect for the UK’s Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) programme. EMA was a means-tested cash transfer of up to £30 per week paid by the UK government to students undertaking the first 2 years of full time post-compulsory education (aged 16 or 17 on 31st August at the start of the school year). Eligibility was determined by household income, according to the thresholds shown in Table 1.Footnote 1 At its peak in the 2009–2010 school year the scheme cost £580 m and served 643,000 recipients (see Bolton 2011, p. 2). EMA differs from most high profile conditional cash transfers (CCTs), such as Bolsa Família in Brazil, Opportunidades in Mexico, and Opportunity NYC in the United States, in two ways. Firstly, it is a late intervention, targeting the continued human capital development of ‘children’ (in fact young adults) beyond the compulsory schooling age, rather than school attendance or health programme participation among primary-age children. Secondly, it is paid straight to the child, rather than to the mother. Paying CCTs to the mother requires her agency, to pass the (benefits of the) transfer to the intended recipient, on behalf of the state. Because EMA was paid directly to the child, there is no agency problem. This and several other contextual features make EMA ideal to investigate the extent of crowd-out of private transfers by this public transfer, and to attribute this effect to the mechanism of parental altruism. EMA was paid in cash, which is a perfect substitute for cash transfers from parents, and for the parents’ own income. Moreover, barriers to participation were low (students needed a bank account in their name and a parental declaration of income once each academic year) and stigma unlikely to be a problem (the eligibility criteria were wide and take-up high—in our data 86 % of those apparently eligible for the highest payment, and 45 % of all students, receive EMA), so conditional on participation in full-time education the direct non-pecuniary costs associated with receipt of the benefit should be negligible. The intervention was also of a substantial economic magnitude, both for the child and the household. For example, the highest weekly EMA payment of £30 per week during term times was larger than the mean weekly earnings of teenagers in employment during their final year of compulsory schooling in the LSYPE (£27.76), and corresponds to a tax free increase in the household’s full income of up to £1170 per year, or a minimum of 5.6 % of parent’s income for those in the lowest income eligibility bracket. Altogether, this means that the parent’s transfer response to EMA should provide a clean test of whether the parent’s behaviour is consistent with that of an effectively altruistic head-of-household. The extent to which the public transfers are crowded out by family transfers is usually evaluated using data on household expenditure patterns for ‘child-assignable goods’ (Kooreman 2000; Hoddinott and Skoufias 2004; Attanasio and Mesnard 2006; Blow et al. 2012). A challenge to the identification of this degree of crowd-out is lack of (or measurement error in) data on (the value of) shared services or in-kind transfers within private households. For this reason, one approach is to focus on units of the extended family that are not co-resident, and so in which the shared services can be assumed to be zero. For example, Jensen (2003) showed that each unit increase in public pension income in South Africa reduced receipt of private transfers from the pensioner’s children living outside the home by 0.20–0.30 units. However, when considering public transfers paid to young adults, co-residence is likely to represent a significant proportion of the support received from their parents. Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1994), for example, use changes in welfare rules over time and between states to show that a $1000 increase in Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) by young women with children reduces their probability of receiving financial aid from their parents by 3.4 %, and of co-residing by 4.7 %. While this provides evidence that the net benefit of the AFDC programme is mainly captured by its recipients, the authors’ data do not enable them to identify the effective rate at which parents ‘tax’ their children’s benefit receipt. All students in our sample are co-resident with a parent,Footnote 2 but we do not have data on cash transfers made by parents to children receiving EMA, and we expect additional unobserved heterogeneity in in-kind transfers or the items that children are expected to purchase themselves. We therefore propose an alternative strategy to identify the net change in the child’s opportunity set, which does not depend on any survey instruments designed to capture intrahousehold transfers. Our identification strategy instead stems from the insight, formalised in the theoretical model set out in Sect. 2, that if parents respond to the child’s receipt of EMA by withdrawing cash and in-kind transfers of an equal value (consistent with the parent ‘fully insuring’ the child’s consumption), then the child’s opportunity set is unchanged, and he should not alter his labour supply. Correspondingly, the larger the child’s reduction in labour supply, the smaller the redistributive response made by parents, or equivalently, the greater the proportion of the EMA the child has been permitted to keep. We use data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE), deposited by the Department for Education and National Centre for Social Research (2012). We observe the labour supply and EMA receipt of a cohort of individuals in their final year of compulsory schooling (during which no-one received EMA) and first 2 years of post-compulsory schooling (during which teenagers whose parents met the income criteria were eligible to receive EMA). Our data are outlined in detail in Sect. 3, below. To pre-empt our results, estimates from linear, Tobit and logistic regression methods in both cross-sectional and panel data frameworks firmly reject a model of effectively altruistic parents. An EMA payment of £30 per week reduces teenage labour supply by between 2.4 and 3.2 h per week at the intensive margin. These results are robust to estimation on the sub-sample of non-credit-constrained households, for whom we argue participation in post-compulsory education is unlikely to be affected by eligibility for EMA. Using estimates of teenagers’ labour supply response to unearned income obtained from elsewhere in the literature (Dustmann et al. 2009; Wulff Pabilonia 2001), we calculate this to be consistent with parents withdrawing cash and in-kind transfers from the child to between 22 and 86 % of the value of EMA. While the (non-) altruistic behaviour of parents has implications for the targeting of transfers—our results indicate that the child’s welfare benefit from EMA is higher than had an equivalent transfer been made to parents—the labour supply effect of EMA has implications for the efficacy of conditional cash transfers in raising educational performance. In-school employment is widespread. In our data, 43 % of 17 year-olds in the first year of post-compulsory education are in employment. In-school employment may improve teenagers’ stock of cognitive and non-cognitive human capital (for example, financial literacy, communication skills and lower discount rates—Oettinger 1999; Light 2001) or preference for education as a route to higher-skilled work in future (Dustmann and van Soest 2007). However, by crowding out time and effort devoted to study (e.g. Kalenkoski and Wulff Pabilonia 2013) it may reduce the child’s educational performance, particularly above a moderate number of hours per week or in close proximity to high-stakes examinations (Lillydahl 1990; Ruhm 1997; Payne 2004). Hence, to the extent that EMA reduces labour supply at least at the higher end of the working hours distribution, this should feed through to an improvement in their academic and future labour market outcomes.Footnote 3
 While there are indications from hypothetical questions that EMA reduced recipients’ labour supply (RCU Market Research 2007), to our knowledge we are the first to quantify this labour supply effect using observational data. Although EMA closed to new applicants in England in January 2011, it was replaced by the ‘16–19 bursary’ programme, with a smaller budget of £180 m, and automatic entitlement reduced in scope to approximately 12,000 of the “most vulnerable” students. EMA has been retained in the rest of the UK. It will be important for policymakers to account for the labour supply effect of this scheme in considering any future reforms. The remainder of this study is structured as follows: Part 2 sets out a model showing how the labour supply response to EMA provides a test for the presence of an effectively altruistic head-of-household. Part 3 discusses the data and estimation strategy, Part 4 presents the results and Part 5 sets out the conclusions and recommendations.",1
13.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,23 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-013-9204-y,The co-movement of couples’ incomes,September 2015,Stephen H. Shore,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There is a very large literature on individual income dynamics, on how individuals’ incomes evolve over time. Much of this literature is focussed on income volatility, the variance of income changes.
Footnote 1 Recent work in this area has focused on identifying latent heterogeneity in volatility; some people may face income changes with larger variances than others (Meghir and Pistaferri 2004; Browning et al. 2010; Jensen and Shore 2011; Jensen and Shore 2012). The literature on couples’ joint income dynamics—how couples’ incomes move together—is much smaller (Lundberg 1985; Cullen and Gruber 2000; Hyslop 2001; Dynan et al. 2007; Shore 2010). Just as recent research has focussed on heterogeneity in individuals’ income dynamics, this paper considers heterogeneity in couples’ joint income dynamics; do all couples’ incomes move together in the same way? Heterogeneity in couples’ joint income dynamics could reflect assortative mating in volatility, so that individuals with volatile incomes tend to marry each other;
Footnote 2 it could also reflect heterogeneity in co-movement, so that some couples’ incomes move together while other couples’ incomes move in opposite directions. Both of these phenomenon show up in the cross-section of couples’ income changes as bivariate kurtosis (Mardia 1970, 1974, 1980), the tendency of large (absolute) income changes for husbands and wives to coincide. In years in which a husband’s earnings changes substantially (either rising or falling), his wife’s income tends to change substantially (either rising or falling) as well. However, correlated volatility can be separated from heterogeneity in co-movoment with panel data or other covariates given certain assumptions. These distinctions are important for understanding the economic effects of coupling. Positive assortative mating in volatility may be optimal given positive assortative mating in risk-aversion, as predicted by Chiappori and Reny (2006). Risk tolerant individuals may choose risky income streams for themselves, and also seek partners with risky income streams (leading to positive assortative mating on risk-aversion). Conversely, absent heterogeneity in risk-aversion, we would expect negative assortative mating in volatility, as the cost of marrying a high-risk spouse is lower for a low-risk person. Heterogeneity in the covariance of couples’ income changes is important because it suggests differences across couples in the risk-sharing benefits of marriage. Nordblom (2004) shows that some of this variation in the diversification benefits of marriage may stem from differences in legal regimes that my affect the degree of commitment and cooperation while Chami and Hess (2005) shows that there is cross-state variation stemming from differences in states’ levels of undiversifiable risk. Hess (2004) shows that such variation can predict divorce. Changes over time in couples’ joint income dynamics suggest changes in labor and leisure complementarities over the life cycle. This paper shows that early in marriage, particular when young children are present, couples’ incomes are negatively correlated. Couples’ income changes become more positively correlated as the number of years a couple has been married increases. One possible interpretation of this life-cycle pattern is that it reflects life-cycle changes in the relative importance of various economic benefits of marriage. Early in marriage, one spouse’s production may be a substitute for the production of the other; increases in income by one spouse will tend to coincide with increases in home production (and decreases in market work) for their partner. This suggests that the specialization in production described in Becker (1973) is particularly dominant early in marriage. Later in marriage, complementarity of leisure may become more important; this could explain the increasingly positive co-movement of couples’ incomes nearing retirement. This phenomenon is studied most frequently in the context of couples’ joint retirement decisions, which frequently coincide (Hurd 1990; Burtless 1990; Gustman and Steinmeier 2000; Maestas 2001; Michaud 2003; Casanova 2010). Simultaneous retirement is frequently motivated by leisure complementarities: leisure time in retirement is more enjoyable if you can share this leisure time with your spouse. These ideas are applied to couples’ income data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. In the data, wives’ income changes are approximately uncorrelated with their husbands’ income changes.
Footnote 3 However, they are not independent, as couples’ squared income changes are positively correlated; there is bivariate kurtosis, so that husbands’ large income changes (increases or decreases) tend to coincide with wives’ large income changes (increases or decreases). A “wife-swap bootstrap” test strongly rejects the independence of couples income streams, finding substantial bivariate kurtosis. This procedure is appropriate when the pair of random variables (here, husbands’ and wives’ income changes) are unconditionally uncorrelated but each spouse’s income changes may be autocorrelated (as in this case). This test is designed to measure the amount of matching that can be seen in couples’ joint income dynamics, relative to a null hypothesis of random pairing; this paper strongly rejects the hypothesis that couples’ joint income dynamics resemble what would be expected from random pairing. By comparing results for various measures of income and hours worked, much of this stems from large changes in wives’ hours (and not wages per hour) coinciding with large changes in their husbands’ incomes. Correlated volatility can explain much of the observed bivariate kurtosis; wives whose income shocks have large variances tend to be married to husbands whose income shocks also have large variances. Correlated variance parameters explain more than 28 or 90 % (depending on the measure of income changes) of the observed bivariate kurtosis. This looks like the positive assortative mating on income risk of interest to Chiappori and Reny (2006). Heterogeneity in co-movement—with some couples’ incomes moving together while other couples’ incomes moving in opposite directions—is also present. This covariance heterogeneity explains 10–33 % of bivariate kurtosis.",4

Considering that both push and pull factors contribute to the decisions of households to allocate labor between activities on-farm and off the farm, it is necessary to have a better understanding of which of these two factors plays a more important role in the observed choices of households and their members. To the extent that pull factors, such as higher wage rates, and higher returns, dominate the decision to diversify occupations and/or the choice between farm and non-farm sector of employment, economic efficiency and aggregate output are likely to be higher. Yet, in principle, higher output could also be achieved by focusing on a single occupation or sector. Household members could also specialize by all working in the same occupation or sector and increase productivity by learning from each other’s experience. If the son enters the same sector as the father, he might be able to pick up the necessary skills faster by learning from his father’s experience (Menon and Subramanian 2008). However, lack of access to credit and capital, and the presence of idiosyncratic and uninsured risks may “push” rural households and their members away from specializing in a specific sector to diversified activities. Thus, diversification of occupations and sector of employment may not always be associated with higher output or higher productivity depending on the context and the relative strength of pull and push factors. In rural areas, one important push factor is year to year variability in rainfall and associated farm-income variability. Households may engage in nonfarm activities with low risks even if these activities have low returns. In areas with poor agro-climatic conditions, risky agriculture, and no insurance markets, nonfarm activities allow households to cope with severe downturns in agricultural productivity (Reardon et al. 2006; Ellis 2004). Households pushed to diversify their activities may thus have lower returns and experience lower consumption in comparison to households that diversify due to pull factors. At the household level, diversification due to push factors may result in more income security but at the cost of a lower level of welfare and overall growth.Footnote 1
 The increased variability in rainfall that is increasingly associated with climate change,Footnote 2 implies that the prevailing risk mitigation strategies developed after years of exposure and experience with the prior climate regime may become less and less effective. Thus, it is imperative to establish empirically whether auxiliary government interventions can facilitate household adaptation to increased risks due to climatic change faced by households. If access to safety net programs, for example, is associated with a decreased role of “push factors” in the occupational choice of households participating in these programs, then there is credible evidence that expansion of the coverage of safety net programs is not only likely to protect household welfare but also enhance economic growth. Bangladesh is one of the most flood-prone countries in the world (Yu et al. 2010). The country is situated at the confluence of three major rivers—the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna and is intersected by more than 200 minor rivers. There are 54 rivers that enter Bangladesh from India alone. Over 90 % of the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna basin lies outside the boundaries of the country. Thus, flood in Bangladesh depends on the precipitation outside as well as inside its borders. Regional rainfall variability may have common effects on the probability of river-bank flooding. Climate change models predict Bangladesh will be warmer and wetter in the future. Yu et al. (2010) note that historical rainfall variability is substantial and greater uncertainty exists with the estimated magnitude of rainfall changes than temperature changes. We study how rural households cope with historical rainfall variability in order to understand how long term changes in climatic parameters such as increase in local rainfall variability are likely to affect household decisions and welfare. We focus on historical local rainfall variability and historically flood affected areas as measures of ex ante risks faced by rural households. The emphasis on long term historical rainfall variability distinguishes this study from others that look at the impacts of recent rainfall and flood shocks. We establish how historical climatic patterns such as long term coefficients of variation in local rainfall and historically flood affected areas affect the occupational selection of the rural household members. High regional rain may or may not coincide with high local rainfall. River-bank floods may mask the effects of local rainfall variability in the flood prone areas and households may make occupational choices differently in historically flood prone areas. Separate analysis of historically flood prone and non-flood prone areas shows local rainfall variability is a factor in household occupational selections only in non-flood areas. We also look at the ex post realization of consumption-based welfare associated with occupational choices that may be determined by the flood and local rainfall variability risks. We investigate whether ex ante flood and local rainfall variability risks reduce consumption welfare through occupational diversification choices. For example, if the households’ adaptation strategy of occupational diversification is as productive as occupational focus, then we expect the ex-ante flood risk indicator to have no effect on ex post household welfare. Alternately, if the household diversification strategy is less productive than the strategy of occupational focus, then households living in areas with higher climate variability are expected to have lower consumption welfare. We find that after controlling for other factors, households living in areas with high local rainfall variability have lower consumption. Further, we examine how effective the households’ as well as various policy actions are in mitigating these ex ante climate risks. The rest of the paper considers the empirical underpinnings of the basic story outlined above in greater detail. Section 2 highlights the characteristics of Bangladesh and sets the contexts of flood and rainfall variability in the country and describes the various datasets used in the analysis. Section 3 focuses on the methods and econometric specifications. Section 4 presents the main findings and results, while Sect. 5 concludes.",21

Sabia,Daniel I. Rees,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"From 1974 to 2004, the obesity rate nearly tripled among 12–19-year-olds living in the United States (Ogden and Carroll 2010). Although the adolescent obesity rate appears to have peaked in the mid-2000s (Ogden et al. 2010; Madsen et al. 2010), the consensus view among health professionals is that too many young Americans are at risk of asthma, menstrual abnormalities, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes because of their weight.Footnote 1
 Students who are overweight or obese are prone to being teased and bullied (Eisenberg et al. 2003; Janssen et al. 2004; Neumark-Sztainer and Eisenberg 2005; Wang et al. 2010). There is also evidence of a negative relationship between body weight and academic achievement (Falkner et al. 2001; Crosnoe 2007; Sabia 2007; Ding et al. 2009). A number of researchers have argued that weight-related teasing and bullying leads to psychological damage, which in turn could lead to poor performance at school (Puhl and Brownell 2001; Latner et al. 2005; Crosnoe 2007). However, the negative relationship between body weight and academic achievement could be driven by more tangible health conditions. For instance, overweight and obese individuals often suffer from sleep apnea, which could affect concentration (Scholder et al. 2010). The current study is the first to use an instrumental variables approach to estimate the effect of body weight on mental health. It is also the first to explore the connections between body weight, mental health and academic achievement. Drawing on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), the current study begins by providing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates of the cross-sectional relationship between body weight and psychological wellbeing. These estimates suggest that, among female Add Health respondents, being overweight or obese is associated with lower self-esteem and a greater likelihood of exhibiting the symptoms of depression. However, among male respondents, body weight is essentially unrelated to these measures of psychological wellbeing. Next, we take advantage of the fact that genetics play an important role in the determination of body weight (Comuzzie and Allison 1998) by using sibling BMI (body mass index) and mother’s obesity status as instrumental variables (IV). This estimation strategy has been used by economists interested in the effects of body weight on labor market outcomes (Cawley 2004; Brunello and D’Hombres 2007; Norton and Han 2008) and medical costs (Cawley and Meyerhoefer 2012), as well as by medical researchers interested in the effects on body weight on mortality (Smith et al. 2009). The IV estimates are consistent with the OLS estimates: they suggest that body weight negatively impacts the psychological wellbeing of females, but provide little evidence of a causal relationship between body weight and male psychological wellbeing. Finally, we examine the relationship between body weight and academic achievement, as measured by high school grades, whether the respondent graduated from high school, and whether the respondent graduated from college. IV estimates suggest that, among female respondents, body weight is negatively related to all three of these measures. In contrast, there is little evidence that body weight impacts the high school grades of male respondents or their probability of high school graduation. Between 7 and 30 % of the estimated relationship between body weight and female academic achievement can be explained by depression and low self-esteem. We conclude that, although other factors are clearly at work, depression and low self-esteem can keep overweight and obese females from reaching their full academic potential.",29

For example, one of the key objectives of the “making work pay” agenda in the United States, Canada, and Britain has been to boost in-work benefits offered to low-income parents (especially single mothers) through more generous amounts of tax credits, lower withdrawal (phase-out) rates, and substantial childcare subsidies. Examples include the policies implemented through the American Earned Income Tax Credit, the Canadian Self-Sufficiency Program, and the British Working Families’ Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit. Despite the popularity of these reforms among policy makers, however, the ways in which they may affect the overall welfare of low-income families is often not fully understood. In particular, little is known about behavioral responses to tax-benefit reforms that have an adverse impact on child well-being in lone parent families. A growing body of empirical research documents that changes in tax and benefit policies can have or have had unfavorable effects on single mothers’ well-being (e.g., Bitler et al. 2002, 2005; Francesconi and van der Klaauw 2007; Baker et al. 2008; Grogger and Karoly 2009; Brewer et al. 2009) as well as on a wide array of their children’s outcomes (e.g., Gennetian et al. 2002, 2005; Baker et al. 2008; Herbst and Tekin 2008; Grogger and Karoly 2009; Gregg et al. 2009). There is still insufficient appreciation for the ramifications of such unintended or unanticipated consequences of welfare reform. The contribution of this paper, therefore, is to provide a new theoretical setup that can coherently explain these undesirable effects and can also deliver testable implications on child welfare and on the strategic interaction between divorced parents. Our study is based on the seminal contributions by Weiss and Willis (1985, 1993) and Del Boca and Flinn (1995). These studies, which treat labor supply decisions and post-divorce incomes of former spouses as exogenous, provide a formal analysis of the noncooperative behavior of divorced parents in terms of child support transfers and expenditures on children. We build on these earlier studies by (i) modeling the labor supply decision of the custodial parent and (ii) explicitly incorporating the tax-benefit program. We then focus on the effects of tax-benefit policy changes on divorced parents’ labor supply, consumption and child support transfer decisions and on child well-being in single parent households. We posit that child well-being is determined by the combination of purchased goods and parental time, which in the case of single parent households reduces to the time allocated by the custodial (lone) parent only. For simplicity, the time devoted to the child by the noncustodial parent is assumed to have no effect on child well-being. In this environment, divorced parents make three decisions in a one-shot noncooperative game with a sequential two-stage structure. First, the noncustodial parent chooses the amount of child support payment to transfer to the custodial parent, and the then custodial parent decides over both child good expenditures and the allocation of time between market work and childcare. Each parent has preferences defined over own consumption and child welfare. Child welfare depends positively on expenditures and the amount of time the child spends with the custodial parent. One hour spent away from the custodial parent (for instance, in formal daycare, while the mother works) is assumed to contribute less (is less productive) to child welfare than one hour spent with the mother. Child welfare therefore is a local public good from the point of view of both parents, although only the custodial parent gets to decide how much to spend on child goods and how to allocate time between paid work and parenting. With this setup, we first characterize the noncooperative behavior of divorced parents in terms of child support payments, time allocated to parenting, and child good expenditures. Because the noncustodial parent does not bargain with the custodial parent over the expenditure and time allocation decisions, it is not feasible for the ex-spouses to reach a Pareto efficient allocation of their resources. As a consequence, the noncustodian provides less than efficient child support transfers. The custodian, instead, not only spends too little on child goods, but also devotes too much time to market work and too little to childcare. Thus, the inefficiencies that arise in our framework are threefold and correspond to the three parental decisions under analysis: on the custodial side, child quality suffers because of inefficiently high levels of labor supply and inefficiently low expenditures on child goods, and on the noncustodial side child support payments are suboptimally low.
Footnote 1
 Using this framework, we then investigate the impact of policy reforms that are meant to improve lone parents’ well-being. We document that more generous government transfers provided to custodial parents (in the form of, say, income support or child tax credits) increase well-being of both custodial and noncustodial parents as well as that of their children. This is a straightforward result. A new result, instead, emerges when we look at the effect of increasing the custodian’s effective wage, through either greater childcare subsidies or lower withdrawal (phase-out) rates or both. While standard theory suggests that an exogenous increase in the effective wage rate should raise lone mothers’ well-being (although not necessarily that of their children), in our model it can reduce the utility of divorced custodial parents and depress the welfare of their children. This is because an increase in the mother’s effective wage reinforces the inefficiencies induced by noncooperation. That is, such an increase further depresses child support transfers from noncustodial fathers and accentuates over-work among custodial mothers. This greater labor supply is the net effect of a direct substitution effect (i.e., the opportunity cost of not engaging in paid work goes up) and a strategic multiplier effect (i.e., a response to the reduced child support transfer from the noncustodian). There are circumstances (that we shall characterize later) in which these effects interact so as to offset the positive income effect to depress divorced parents’ utility and child welfare. This finding provides an important insight that has been overlooked so far: welfare policies that subsidize childcare expenditures or reduce withdrawal rates, which are most certainly intended to improve the conditions of working single parents and their children, could actually have the reverse effect. However, our model also suggests that increases in the quality of non-maternal child care reduce the adverse effects that the provision of child care subsidies may have on children and their parents. From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that policies aimed at increasing the effective wage of lone parents should be accompanied by efforts to improve the quality of non-maternal child care. In an extension of our basic model, we show that these implication are robust to the inclusion of issues of compliance with child support awards imposed by external institutional agents (e.g., courts or judges). The remainder of the paper is as follows. The next section discusses the links of our contribution to the relevant literature. Section 3 sets up the basic model, while Sect. 4 provides the main equilibrium analysis and illustrates the effects of tax-benefit changes on divorced parents’ and children’s well-being. Section 5 explores an extension of the basic model in detail, i.e., compliance with court-mandated child support orders by the noncustodial parent. Section 6 relates our theoretical results to some of the existing empirical evidence and discusses some ideas for future research. For the sake of brevity, all proofs and some mathematical derivations are not presented here, but can be found in Francesconi et al. (2008).",3

We expect that time spent together may vary due to several factors even for couples who experience no change in employment status. In addition, the hypothesized relationship is not necessarily linear in nature. For example, during periods of macroeconomic decline, couples may spend more time together as they experience time windfalls from lower labor market activity. However, if time with a spouse is a normal good, then couple time together may also rise during periods of economic boom as households experience greater levels of disposable income and substitute market expenditures for home production. Specifically, we examine the reduced-form impact of state unemployment rates on the time couples who have children spend together. We focus on couples who have children to gain insight into how the dynamics in American families are affected by business cycles. Previous research suggests that the time couples spend together has important implications for the well-being of the members of the couple, as well as their children. For example, couple time together may promote marital stability. Recent research suggests that, on average, U.S. divorce rates decline during recessions (Amato and Beattie 2011; Hellerstein and Morrill 2011; Schaller 2012), while Kingston and Nock (1987) and Johnson et al. (2006) find that when a couple spends more leisure time together, they report higher marital satisfaction. However, not only leisure time but all time together may be important, as Hallberg (2003) finds that couples who have children enjoy less shared leisure time but more shared domestic work, but total couple time together is the same regardless of whether there are children in the household. Thus, for example, if couple time together rises during recessions, this may at least partially explain the drop in divorce.Footnote 1 Furthermore, we are interested in what promotes or hinders time together generally, as previous studies have documented that people report greater satisfaction from doing activities in the presence of their significant other, regardless of the type of activity (e.g., Sullivan 1996).Footnote 2 In addition, Glorieux et al. (2011) argue that the time partners spend together could be used as an indicator of social quality time. Previous time use literature explains how the business cycle affects the total leisure and home production activities of individuals. In a study examining the effects of local business cycles on individuals’ time allocation decisions, using time diary data that preceded the Great Recession, Burda and Hamermesh (2010) find that individuals who lose their jobs reallocate the majority of their time toward leisure activities rather than household production activities. However, when instead they consider all individuals who experience an increase in local unemployment rates, they find that the reduction in market work from the economic contraction is completely offset by an increase in household production. This suggests that local economic conditions affect the time use both of individuals who directly experience job loss and of those who remain employed. Using Spanish time diary data, Gimenez-Nadal and Molina (2014) examine the effect of others’ unemployment on the time use of unemployed individuals. They find that higher regional unemployment rates are associated with increased home production and decreased leisure for unemployed women. They attribute these changes in time allocation to the reduction in the probability of finding a new job and the desire to smooth consumption. Aguiar et al. (2013) explore how individuals spend surplus time resulting from reductions in market work during the Great Recession. They find that about 30–40 % of the forgone work hours are allocated to home production activities, while about 50 % are allocated to some type of leisure activity. We seek to understand how the time that couples who have children spend together varies over the business cycle. The total effects on simultaneous leisure could differ from previous researchers’ findings on total leisure, as Barnet-Verzat et al. (2011) find the presence of children affects joint leisure and not alone leisure. Our sample includes non-married couples with children, but we refer to them as “couples” or “spouses” throughout for simplicity. Some examples of potential mechanisms through which business cycles could affect couple time together include reduced time spent in labor market activities, pressure on families due to tightened financial constraints, teenager labor market activities, changes in childcare arrangements for younger children, and/or shifts in the timing of work hours. We use data from the 2003–2010 American Time Use Survey (ATUS), combined with U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data on state-level unemployment rates, to capture economic conditions, including the large negative employment effects occurring during and in the aftermath of the Great Recession. The first outcome that we consider is the number of minutes a couple spends together. Our model includes both state and year fixed effects in order to exploit the variation in unemployment rates between states over time in order to identify the relationship between state unemployment rates and couple time together while controlling for national trends and time invariant differences across states. Allowing for a somewhat flexible functional form, we present specifications including linear, quadratic, and cubic polynomials in state-level unemployment rates. We find a significant and robust U-shaped relationship (i.e., quadratic) between couples’ time together and the state unemployment rate. If we compare couple time together when the state unemployment rate is 5 % with the time couples spend together when the state unemployment rate is 10 % (the national unemployment rate increased from 5 to 10 % during the Great Recession), we find that couples are spending less time together at the higher unemployment rate. However, as the unemployment rate rises above about 9 %, we see couple time together increase. We find that changes in shared leisure time explain most of the variability in couple time together. Thus, we find an interesting and previously undocumented non-linearity in the effect of business cycles on couples. We do not explicitly consider the effects of an individual’s or spouse’s job loss, because job loss may not be exogenous to intrahousehold time allocation and we seek to understand how macroeconomic conditions affect couple time on average. We do, however, explore whether our results differ for couples where both spouses are employed at the time of the survey (dual-earner couples). We find nearly identical patterns when we consider only dual-earner couples, which suggests that the results are not driven entirely by those experiencing a job loss. This is not entirely surprising, because Glorieux et al. (2011) found that the difference in the time that single-earner couples and dual-earner couples spend together is relative small (3 percentage points) and attribute this to the fact that it is difficult to do things together when one partner is at work. We hypothesize that our results may be due at least partly to the time and timing of work and conclude the paper by exploring these possible mechanisms for the observed variation in time spent together. A reduction in jobs with desirable work schedules during periods of economic contraction may hinder the ability of couples to synchronize their time at work, thereby limiting their time spent together (Barnet-Verzat et al. 2011; Hallberg 2003; Hamermesh 2002; Glorieux et al. 2011; Kingston and Nock 1987). Consistent with the time couples spend together, the results suggest that mothers work more weekend hours during moderate economic downturns, resulting in less time available to spend with their spouses.",17

Since the transfer is deposited into the mother’s bank account, one would suspect that power dynamics between spouses have shifted for the recipients. In the Northeast of the country, however, family structure is often not the nuclear model; the prevalence of single motherhood makes the question of bargaining power between spouses irrelevant for many families. Still, as extended families live together, there are plenty of intrahousehold relationships that remain to be analyzed. Of interest is that of teenage mothers who live with their mothers, a family structure not yet covered within the economic literature. Locals report that historically a teen mother would marry, but now the single teen mother is more socially acceptable and she often does not move from her own mother’s house. Understanding the families of teen mothers is important because of their prevalence and vulnerability. While Brazil’s teen birth rate is not much different than in previous decades, total fertility for the population as a whole has fallen below replacement (Cavenaghi and Diniz Alvez 2011), causing births to adolescents (19 and younger) as a percent of total births to rise from 12 % in 1986 to over 20 % in the last decade (Gupta and da Costa Leite 1999). Only 25 % of 16- and 17-year-old girls with children remain in school compared to 80 % of the rest of the population (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios 2006) suggesting that these young mothers will not be earning as much as mothers who postpone childbearing. This, in turn, puts the welfare of their children at risk as the women face lower lifelong earnings. In addition, adolescent girls who live in poverty are almost twice as likely to become teen mothers. One tool for preventing intergenerational poverty transmission is the conditional cash transfer, which provides financial support conditional on young children receiving vaccines and health check-ups and older children attending school. Brazil developed the first program of this kind and currently Bolsa Familia reaches more than 11 million families. The Bolsa Familia transfer is always given to the household matriarch, but she may not be the best target when considering her grandchild’s welfare. Biologically, we would suspect the teen to be most invested in the baby’s welfare as the closest blood relative in the household. Yet with the teen having engaged in ‘deviant’ behavior by becoming pregnant, it is quite possible that her mother does not trust her. Thus the same questions regarding family decision making and its impact on child welfare usually posed to husband and wife also apply in this context. In this paper I address the standard intrahousehold questions applied to this family structure: which household model best approximates the behavior in these families, and does the teen or her mother have more interest in the teen’s child’s well-being? I use economic games to answer this question, as standard methodology cannot be applied in this case. In a game testing the unitary model, on average these individuals do not change their valuation of a product when income ownership changes hands, and they tend toward cooperation in a trust game, though they are not full surplus maximizers. In light of these relatively harmonious findings, I suggest that the current targeting is efficient. The contribution of this research to the intrahousehold literature is twofold. First, I use the tools of experimental economics to develop a new game to mimic the income separability test. This game reveals if there is evidence of bargaining power in the relationship. Paired with a trust game, these two games together allow for a characterization of the parent–child relationship into unitary, cooperative, non-Pareto-optimal, or other. This is an alternative methodology to the standard consumption analysis of demand modeling, and it can be applied when not all the requirements are met for determining income separability of demand such as when the nature of the family relationship is particularly endogenous (as in the parent–child relationship) or when there is a lack of exogenous income. Thus these new tools provide flexibility for the researcher, allowing for economic insights in situations that otherwise would be impossible using the standard demand method. The second contribution of this work is insight into the relationship of teen mothers and their mothers, one that has not been widely studied within economics. This relationship impacts the welfare of the teen’s child, and can have important implications for government programs that attempt to influence the child’s well-being. Sociologists have addressed this relationship between adolescent mothers and their mothers in the United States. Apfel and Seitz (1991) report that in the majority of the inner-city black families surveyed, the grandmother assisted the teen in her parenting; much less frequently was the teenager the sole care-giver or did the grandmother take over all the parenting duties. A grandmother may be limiting her support strategically, as Hotz et al. (2005) show that parents of teen mothers give less in financial transfers to adolescents who have a younger sister than to those who do not have a younger sister to discourage the younger sister from repeating the event. This restraint, however, brings up concern for the infants’ well-being. Emotional support from grandparents is correlated with teen mothers being more nurturing toward their children whereas teen mothers without that support behave less so (Oyserman et al. 1994). This positive effect on behavior is important because, in the United States at least, teenage mothers are less nurturing than their elder counterparts. Perhaps for this reason, children of teenage mothers fare worse than others academically and tend to repeat the fertility trends of their parents (Card 1981); a grandparent’s presence may help to temper these unfortunate results. Echoing some of these findings, a Brazilian grandmother revealed that she faced inner tensions between wanting to help her daughter and grandchild and wanting to teach responsibility and allow her daughter to face the consequences for her actions. These concerns lead to questions about which recipient would be best for a transfer intended to benefit the child. This family context requires an alternative approach to intrahousehold analysis. Income pooling cannot be tested if there is no exogenous income to pool; as will be explained later, these families are quite poor and their unearned transfers may be related to selection bias. Furthermore, the parent–child relationship, with the parent influencing the child as she is raised, will eliminate the possibility of almost any sort of income as being exogenous. Exogenous expansion of conditional cash transfers is an exception, but when this study was implemented, Bolsa Familia had been in existence for 4 years, and was preceded by a similar program; selection bias would be a concern. Applying the games within this context reveals important insights for conditional cash transfer targeting in Brazil. Facing a high teen pregnancy rate closely correlated with poverty, it is urgent to address the needs of the adolescents’ children. Potential misalignment of preferences between mother and daughter raises the question regarding whose preferences best favor the teen’s child. While current policy assigns the welfare transfer to the grandmother, the family matriarch, perhaps the teen has a closer biological interest in her child’s well-being. The results of the games indicate that this is not a concern among the families in this study so there would likely be no extra benefit for the child in changing the targeting. The families were recruited from a grass-roots organization in Salvador, Brazil, so they are not representative of the population as a whole, but their characteristics are well-aligned with those of the general population; their participation in such an organization indicates their social connectivity so they indeed may be the type of family that actively seeks to enroll in a conditional cash transfer program. The outcome of these games paints a picture of a family that is fairly harmonious but not perfectly so. The bargaining game that parallels the test of income separability failed to reject the unitary model, but an additional test reveals the teen to have more influence over the joint valuation when she owns the endowment. In the trust game, Pareto optimality was rejected, yet a high degree of trust was still evident. The additional information from qualitative survey questions supports this conclusion. This is somewhat comforting, as the reassignment of the stipend to the teen would raise additional concerns about incentivizing teen motherhood. I test the three household models most widely found in the intrahousehold literature. The unitary model considers a household to be a single consumer, with harmonized preferences or one individual making the decisions for the family (Becker 1981). With respect to policy, this result implies that the targeting of the transfer to any specific individual in the household would not change the outcome. The unitary model is rejected if income separability is found: demand differs depending on who is receiving the income (Browning et al. 1994). Bargaining models can also be categorized based on efficiency. By definition, households are collective (cooperative) if efficiency is realized. Non-cooperative (inefficient) families still hold potential for an increase in utility without making anyone any worse off (Lundberg and Pollak 1993; Carter and Katz 1997). Though the intrahousehold models were originally developed within an inter-“genderational” context, with little adaptation they can be conceived as intergenerational; it is simple enough to conceive the collective and non-cooperative models with parents and children as family members. Since we are dealing with parents and children, it is safe to assume that at one point in time the parent was making the decisions for the family as in the unitary model. This model still holds true if the parent remains in this dictatorial role now that the teen is grown, or if teen and parent are in such agreement that preferences are in consensus. Though not dictatorial, the rotten-kid theorem also results in a unitary outcome. With a self-interested child, the parent is making final decisions regarding income distribution for the household; income distributed to the child rises as total family income rises. Therefore the child still finds it in his best interest to maximize total family income, achieving Pareto efficiency.Footnote 1 A parent–child relationship characterized by the rotten-kid theorem would fall under the unitary model, and bargaining models would apply as a child becomes more independent, with proverbial teen rebellion having a non-efficient outcome. Typically, consumption data is used to test income separability and Pareto efficiency, but the analysis is credible only if the income is exogenous. For this study, using unearned income is not feasible. The parent–child relationship, with the parent influencing the child as they are raised, will eliminate the possibility of almost any income as being exogenous. Many analyses take advantage of conditional cash transfer programs as exogenous shocks impacting consumption: Mexico’s Progresa (Bobonis 2009), Bolsa Familia (Braido et al. 2012), Romanian (Sahn and Gerstle 2004) and British (Lundberg et al. 1997) child allowances, among others. Unfortunately, the timing of my study occurred 4 years after Bolsa Familia had been established; selection bias would be a concern. Alternatively Pareto efficiency can be tested using distribution factors (power variables influencing how decisions are made) instead of income (Bourguignon et al. 2009). Yet distribution factors are not necessarily exogenous, especially in the case of parent and child; parental decisions in raising the child will affect the child’s bargaining power as she grows older. Udry (1996) takes another approach entirely by using supply side data; the Pareto efficiency of husbands and wives is tested by examining marginal yields of gender-specific crops considering different inputs. We could not measure the Pareto efficiency of parenting, though, since all family members contribute to child well-being. Thus I turn to experimental economics. Experimental games have long helped economists better understand family dynamics. One of the first studies to examine the economic relationship between husband and wife in the laboratory finds couples’ behavior to be cooperative in decision-making (Corfman and Lehmann 1987); preference intensity is a stronger predictor of the decision made than bargaining power. Bateman and Munro (2005) also performed an experiment on household behavior, finding that individual lottery preferences are similar to the couple’s joint lottery preferences. In the field Hoffman (2009) staged an experiment in Uganda discovering that usage of mosquito nets varies based on the gender of the recipient in the family. Ashraf (2009) looks at husband and wife banking in the Philippines to find that expenditure choices differ when made public or kept private. In Zambia, choices about injectable contraception change when the decision is made by the woman alone or if the husband is present (Ashraf et al. 2010). In Brazil, Bursztyn and Coffman (2012) also find an inefficient outcome in that parents choose a lower-valued conditional cash transfer that requires their children’s schooling attendance over a higher-valued unconditional transfer. Berry (2011) finds evidence that Indian children’s educational attainment differs whether incentives are offered to the child or the parents. Several studies have used trust games to evaluate cooperation between family members. Most find some degree of inefficiency. Iversen et al. (2011) use the dictator and trust games with variations in payoffs in Uganda to test intrahousehold bargaining models between husbands and wives and they reject any one model as dominant. They find that spouses in Uganda frequently do not maximize surplus, with an average contribution rate of 79 % for both women and men. In a similar study between spouses in Ethiopia, Kebede et al. (2011) find contribution rates are much lower with an overall average contribution rate of 56 %. Mani (2011) also finds Pareto inefficiency between married couples in rural India. Given an “investment” opportunity, when the individual had less control over the gains, on average only 70 % of the contribution would be to the high return investment which went to the spouse. The other 30 % was retained in a low return investment for the self. In the parent–child context in the US, Peters et al. (2004) test the rotten kid theorem in a common pool game. When participating with family, children (averaging age 11) give 56 % of their endowment, while parents contribute 84 %. Children give 5 % less than when contributing to a common pool shared with strangers while parents give 12 % less. However parents consistently give over 20 % more than children, whether paired with their own children or strangers’ children. This literature largely points toward an expectation of Pareto inefficiency and bargaining in the household. I use two complementary experimental games that help characterize populations and households into the different models of household decision-making. A bargaining game parallels the aforementioned demand analysis on a small scale by comparing a participant’s willingness to pay for a product (as elicited using the Becker–DeGroot–Marschak mechanism) when the participant is given a transfer as opposed to when the other player receives a transfer. The presence of a single utility function for the family can be rejected if these willingnesses-to-pay differ with endowment ownership. Using a child development toy as the product allows for insight into which family member places a higher value on the child’s welfare. Additionally, a trust game tests for Pareto efficiency in income maximization; results from this game provide information on cooperation and efficiency that is not available in most standard demand analyses. Teen and mother play these two games, each of which tests a separate aspect of intrahousehold interactions, and each game has two main outcomes. In the trust game, surplus maximization can be rejected or accepted and the bargaining game tests the unitary model. The total four possible outcomes align with characteristics of different household models as illustrated in the table below (Table 1). The experimental results indicate that this population of teen mothers and their mothers falls into the “other” category, which does not have a clear corresponding model, as an over-arching model has not been proposed to account for the other possibilities these principal models do not cover. On aggregate, these families exhibit no evidence of bargaining, and while the sample does not achieve surplus maximization, they still exhibit a high level of trust with almost all being contributed in the trust game. The findings suggest that the current targeting of Bolsa Familia policy is efficient, implying that changing the recipient of the stipend from household matriarch to the teen would not result in a better outcome for the teen’s child.",3

Such responses in health behaviors have been posited as one mechanism for the observed, yet controversial, procyclical variation in mortality and morbidity (Granados 2005; Ruhm 2005). In this study, we focus on alcohol use, and make a new contribution to the mixed results within this literature by exploiting a natural experiment from Iceland to study how a macroeconomic collapse impacts drinking behaviors across gender and types of drinkers. We furthermore study two possible labor-market mediators; changes in individual income and work hours by using a comprehensive individual panel data, in an attempt to understand how much of the behavioral response to a macroeconomic collapse can be contributed to individual factors as opposed to society-wide effects. The net effect of business cycles on alcohol use suggests alcohol to be a normal good at the macro level. That is, during economic downturns, aggregate measures show that people consume less alcohol as they do of other normal goods (Ruhm and Black 2002; Ruhm 1995; Johansson et al. 2006; Dee 2001; Ettner 1997; Kruger and Svensson 2010). However, when heterogeneous responses among different individuals are taken into consideration, the direction and magnitude of the relationship between drinking behavior and the macro economy is ambiguous and has been shown to be subject to type of drinking (Ruhm and Black 2002; Xu 2013; Dee 2001) and even type of beverage (Ogwang and Cho 2009). Binge drinking, in particular is a type of drinking that the literature lacks consensus on with regard to responses to a recession. It is of particular interest to shed light on this type of drinking during recessions because if this type of drinking is reduced during recessions it could partly explain the reduction in mortality rates during economic downturns reported in numerous studies (Gerdtham and Ruhm 2006; Granados 2005; Neumayer 2004; Ruhm 2000).Footnote 1 This pro-cyclical fluctuation in mortality rates has raised many questions since unemployment is generally considered to be bad for health on an individual basis (Gerdtham and Johannesson 2003; Lewis and Sloggett 1998; Martikainen and Valkonen 1996). Various explanations for the pro-cyclical relationship have been proposed. The plausible role of external effects such as changes in road traffic and air pollution has been suggested, as well as mechanisms through individual budget and time constraints that could affect health behaviors, which in turn could affect health (morbidity and mortality). In fact, the four major causes of increased mortality in economic upturns are heart diseases, liver diseases, driving fatalities and homicides. Heavy alcohol consumption affects all of these causes for mortality. Any alcohol consumption, not only heavy alcohol consumption, could also affect risk of driving fatalities. It should be noted that some recent studies, however do not find a relationship between business cycles (as proxied by unemployment rates) and drinking (Jimenez-Martin et al. 2006; Charles and DeCicca 2008). Gender differences in drinking responses to macroeconomic changes have been explored to some extend but this study adds extensively to such previous results. First, by exploring drinking behaviour during an actual recession as opposed to business cycles fluctuations, and second; by conducting a mediation analysis that has not been done before across gender. Gender differences in alcohol use are well documented (Wilsnack et al. 2000) and some research reports different responses to downturns by gender. Men have shown a greater reduction in binge drinking participation than women (Ásgeirsdóttir et al. 2014) as well as in heavy drinking (Ruhm and Black 2002). However, Dee (2001) found that men increased the prevalence of binge drinking more than women during times of high unemployment rates (1984–1995). Results from Dávalos et al. (2012) did not show that their estimated increase in binge drinking during recessions varied by gender. They, like many previous studies, use state unemployment rates as a proxy for recessions with data from the National Epidemiological survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 2001–2001 and 2004–2005) and use variables that pertain to consumption in the past year like the current study. Nandi et al. (2013), using data from the 2003–2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Surveys (BRFSS), found that the small decrease in alcohol-related behaviors (measured as number of drinks past 30 days and an indicator for heavy drinker) associated with higher unemployment rates were primarily driven by men. Bor et al. (2013), using BRFSS found women to reduce any drinking past 30 days more than men during the Great recession (2008–2009 vs. 2006–2007). Just as it is essential to understand the general relationship focused on in previous research, the mechanisms through which the relationship between business cycles and drinking works need to be explored further. Different pathways have been considered in the literature; most prominent being changes in income, leisure-time or mental stress. The mental stress pathway can be broadly dichotomized into a) strain-reduction hypothesis which implies more drinking during hard times as a way to self-medicate (American Psychological Association 2012; Carrigan et al. 2008; Dawson et al. 2005), b) uncovering hypothesis which implies a reduction in binge drinking during a recession because of worries of a job loss (Catalano 1997).Footnote 2 In this study we examine whether changes in individual income and work hours explain changes in drinking behavior during a sudden economic collapse by including income and work hours as controls in our adjusted models. Although we don’t test the mental stress pathway directly in our analysis we discuss the results considering all of the three pathways. Yet another possible mechanism is through social coordination, as work-related events where alcoholic beverages are offered may be reduced during a recession. The theoretical background for focusing on income and work hours is derived from the human-capital model of the demand for health, which explains how the financial and time constraints that individuals face affect their demand for inputs into their production of their own health (Grossman 1972). Drinking can be thought of as one input in individuals’ health production since it is a behavior that affects health. Although long-term increases in income are generally beneficial for health, it is less clear whether and how a short-term increases in income, as a result of an economic upturn, can affect health. At first glance, we could expect people to drink less in a recession, if alcohol is taken to be a normal good, but offsetting factors need to be taken into consideration. As an example, the recession-induced changes in income along with fewer work hours could cause stress and increased consumption of alcohol. The net effect hinges on the relative strength of those two proposed and opposing effects; income effect versus the strain reduction hypothesis. With regard to more leisure accompanying less work, some people could turn to a time-intensive behavior, like binge drinking since the opportunity cost of such type of drinking is reduced during times of less work. However, a reduction in work hours could also induce people to spend more time on time-consuming health activities (exercise and making home prepared meals). Such activities could be compliments to other less time-consuming health-enhancing behaviors like cutting back on drinking. Empirical research is needed to disentangle the simultaneous and sometimes countervailing effects of income and work hours on drinking during macroeconomic crises, as well as other pathways that are not directly tested in the study but nevertheless discussed alongside the main results. We refer to Xu (2013) for a mathematical illustration of a derived demand for health behaviors. Previous results emphasize different pathways. Ruhm and Black (2002) found that heavy consumers drink less in downturns but light drinkers increase their drinking in downturns, which could imply dominance of economic mechanism or the uncovering hypothesis for heavy drinkers since the strain-reduction theory would predict an increase in alcohol intake during downturns. Moreover, heavy drinkers spend proportionally more of their income on alcohol than light drinkers and are therefore more likely to be affected through income reduction than light drinkers. Contrary to these findings, other researchers found that problem drinking increases in recessions (Dee 2001; Dávalos et al. 2012; Bor et al. 2013). Dee and Dávalos concluded that since both the unemployed and the employed increased their binge drinking during recessions, this response was likely to involve a pathway not only through increased leisure time but instead through economic stress or self-medication. Similarly, in a recent research documenting a rise in moderate, heavy (defined as >30 drinks per month for women and >60 drinks per month for men) and binge drinking (4+ episodes last 30 days) during the great recession in the US there was no difference in drinking behaviors between those employed and unemployed, and household income only explained 25 % of the estimated trends in alcohol use (Bor et al. 2013). Xu (2013), using a two-sample instrumental variables approach, found a negative relationship between hours of work and binge drinking but no effect of wages was found—suggesting that the mechanism of time-allocation overrides the income hypothesis. The hypothesis of mental stress as a mediator in the context of economic crisis and health behaviors or wellbeing has been explored in recent studies using Icelandic data pre to post the collapse but no or miniscule mediating effects were detected, even though different measures of mental outcomes have been used; anger and depression, as well as anxiety and poor mental health (Ragnarsdóttir et al. 2012; Ásgeirsdóttir et al. 2014). Thus we only focused on directly changed incentives as possible mediators in this analysis; that is changes in income and work hours. The identification of the empirical model in this analysis is underscored by the circumstances before and after the Icelandic economic collapse; the largest banking-system collapse relative to GDP suffered by any nation in modern history (Johnsen 2014). The three largest banks’ assets had expanded from 100 percent of GDP in 2004 to 923 percent by the end of 2007 (International Monetary Fund 2008). In early October 2008 the three banks collapsed. The prime minister of Iceland addressed the nation on October 6th, 2008, and expressed his worries of a possible national bankruptcy (Prime Minister’s Office 2008). The unemployment rate increased from 1.9 % in the 4th quarter of 2007 to 6.7 % in the 4th quarter of 2009 (Statistics Iceland 2012) and with the vulnerability of the Icelandic krona, which is one of the world’s smallest currencies, the real exchange rate fell by 36 % between 2007 and 2009. This had a significant effect on prices, especially for imported goods. For alcohol this resulted in a 22.2 % real price increase (Statistics Iceland 2013). Overall, the consumer price index (CPI) increased by 27.3 % between November 2007 and November 2009. This increase in CPI resulted in society-wide effects on purchasing power. However, the individual-level mechanisms resulting from those aggregate changes are the focus here. The short time frame, just before a sudden and unexpected economic collapse and then just after, offers the possibility of identifying the average treatment effect on the treated as everyone was affected by the crisis and confounding of concurrent trends is mitigated. This paper contributes to the previous literature, which has shown mixed results on the effects of a contracting economy on alcohol use, by exploring responses by gender and drinking patterns, using a unique data covering a period of a sudden economic collapse. We add extensively to a previous study that examined with a broad scope how the Icelandic economic collapse impacted a range of health behaviors. In that study, alcohol use was one of many outcomes, and thus explored to a limited degree using a single dummy variable (Ásgeirsdóttir et al. 2014). Here, alcohol consumption alone, is examined in greater detail than has been done before under the conditions of the Icelandic economic collapse. First, alcohol is explored at the extensive (the decision to drink) and intensive (the drinking frequency) margin. Specifically, we explore four drinking outcomes: Frequency of any alcohol consumption, frequency of binge drinking, binge drinking participation and alcohol dependence. Looking at alcohol use at the extensive margin only (heavy drinking participation) could underestimate the total effect of the economic crisis on drinking. Second, we examine in more detail differential drinking response to an economic collapse across gender since previous results suggest heterogeneous response by gender. Third, results from a more detailed attrition analyses are reported, since attrition from the survey would generally be considered of concern for external validity of the results without reporting such analysis.",13

Understanding the causes of teen childbearing is crucial for designing effective public policy. As noted by Fletcher and Wolfe (2009), among other adverse consequences, teen childbearing lowers human capital accumulation for teen mothers and affects their earnings. The causal effect of teen alcohol use on teen pregnancy is thought to be mediated through risky sexual behavior (Dee 2001; Sen 2003). Several studies report that sexually active teens under the influence of alcohol are less likely to use contraception (Markowitz et al. 2005) and are consequently more likely to experience an unintended pregnancy. If easy availability of alcohol leads to a higher likelihood of unintended pregnancy, then this increase in the number of pregnancies could result in a relatively larger increase in the number of abortions than live births, as unintended pregnancies are more likely to be terminated than planned pregnancies (Finer and Henshaw 2006). Strict restrictions on legal alcohol availability, on the other hand, should be associated with a decrease in the number of pregnancies, births, and/or abortions. This hypothesis so far has received mixed empirical support. Dee (2001) reports that an increase in the MLDA to 21 years—which represents a decrease in the availability of alcohol—reduces state level birth rates among black 15–19 year-old teens, but does not affect their white peers. Some studies suggest that risky sexual behavior depends on the intensity of alcohol intake per unit of time and the context in which the alcohol is consumed (O’Hare 2005). For example, moderate alcohol consumption in a bar has different implications than binge drinking at a home party. If more restrictions on alcohol consumption increase the likelihood of more intense drinking in a private setting where intimacy is more likely to occur, then there could be a relatively larger number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the presence of a high MLDA and a decrease when restrictions are relaxed. These are the opposite effects that many policy-makers might expect. I test the relationship between the drinking eligibility restrictions and the fertility of young women using exogenous variations in the MLDA across states in the 1970s and 1980s.Footnote 2 There are several contributions of my paper to the existing alcohol/teenage fertility literature. Unlike a few related studies that examine the relationship between alcohol consumption restrictions and fertility of 15–19 year-old teens using state level aggregate data, I use micro-level data from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). The micro-level panel permits reconciling the timing of pregnancy with the state MLDA and allows me to explore heterogeneous effects by individual characteristics. Such precision is not possible with annually aggregated fertility data. Secondly, in contrast to the literature focused on births or abortions, I model the effect on the probability of first pregnancy and the probability of termination of that pregnancy. The focus on first incidence is novel and reasonable, given that the target group of MLDA is teens and most of them who get pregnant experience this as a first time event. Thirdly, in separate analyses, I use two measures of the legal access to alcohol (the state’s MLDA and an individual’s legal eligibility for alcohol consumption/possession), which allows me to assess both the sensitivity and the consistency of results across the two measures. Finally, I analyze the effect on different subpopulation-age groups which in some instances is not feasible with aggregate data. Following the existing literature, I focus on the MLDA restrictions for beer, as it is the most popular alcoholic beverage among youth (Coate and Grossman 1988).Footnote 3 Prior to 1988, the MLDA restrictions were regulated at the state-level, with the lowest age requirement set at 18 and the highest at 21 years of age. Between 1970 and 1975, the number of states with a MLDA below 21 years increased from 18 to 39 states. However, under the threat of losing Federal highway funding, by July 1988 the MLDA was raised and set uniformly across the United States to 21. The changes in the MLDA for beer by state from 1970 to 1990 are summarized in supplementary Appendix A. Additionally, in 1973, after the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade, abortions became legal on the national level, significantly reducing the cost of unintended pregnancy for women nationwide.Footnote 4
 The empirical evaluation relies on a discrete-time hazard model using the micro-level monthly fertility data. I assess the effect of the change (decrease or increase) in the MLDA and the effect of becoming legally eligible to drink on the probability of becoming pregnant for the first time separately for 15–20, 15–17, 18–20, and 21–23 year-old white, black, and Hispanic women. Given the information on how the first pregnancy ended, the age at pregnancy, and the MLDA restrictions in the state of residence at the time of pregnancy conception, I evaluate the effect of changes in the legal access to alcohol on the probability of first pregnancy ending in an abortion. Identifying possible effects of the changes in the MLDA is of high priority in light of recent debate regarding the effects of the MLDA.Footnote 5
 The results indicate that changes in alcohol consumption restrictions have heterogeneous effects across different population subgroups. The statistical power of the estimates also varies across the considered measures of alcohol consumption restrictions: (1) the MLDA in the state of residence, which is a relatively parsimonious proxy measure of access to alcohol, typically used in the literature due to the aggregated level of the data used, and (2) a woman’s legal right to drink alcohol given both the state’s MLDA and that woman’s age, a relatively more precise measure of the variable of interest. I find that for some women the less restrictive access to alcohol reduces the probability of unwanted pregnancy. Specifically, compared to their non-eligible peers, non-poor white women who can drink legally have lower probability of becoming pregnant for the first time and also lower probability of terminating that pregnancy, indicating that there are fewer unwanted pregnancies among women who can drink legally. (A decrease in the MLDA below 21 has a similar negative effect on both probabilities, albeit the estimates are less precise). Relying on the NLSY questions on the frequency of going to bars among woman who have consumed alcohol, I provide supportive evidence that is consistent with a proposition that for this population subgroup reaching the legal age for alcohol consumption opens an alternative less risky venue for alcohol consumption (i.e., drinking at a bar) to drinking at someone’s house.Footnote 6
 The results for poor-whites, blacks, and Hispanics are mixed, making not only the interpretation, but also the identification of potential channels challenging.Footnote 7 Using a generic measure of access—the state’s MLDA—I find that a decrease in the MLDA from 21 to 18, 19, or 20 years increases the probability of becoming pregnant for the first time among black and poor white women and increases the probability of termination of the first pregnancy. This might be consistent with a conventional expectation of an increase in the incidence of risk taking under the influence of alcohol leading to negative events (e.g., unwanted pregnancies) in states with the MLDA below 21. However, for these population groups, these conclusions do not hold any longer once the alcohol restrictions measure is constructed more precisely based on both the MLDA and the woman’s age. Overall, the heterogeneity of results indicates that both the effectiveness of restrictions and the mechanism that links alcohol consumption patterns and risky sexual behavior differ across subgroups of women. The sensitivity of results to the choice of the measures of alcohol consumption restrictions could mean that the MLDA alone might not be sufficient to capture alcohol consumption behavior and one should account for the location and legality of alcohol consumption as well.",

Vitaliano,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The theory behind the ‘food paradox’ is straightforward and laid out in detail in both the Deaton and Paxson and Logan articles. Maximization of a utility function of food and housing, subject to a budget constraint, yields a per capita demand function for food. Housing is a proxy for non-food purchases, but the model is readily extended to explicitly allow for all non-food items using weighted means (Deaton and Paxson 2003, p. 1380). Multiplying by the prices per unit of food and housing gives per capita food expenditure as a function of per capita expenditure on all goods, household size, scale economies and prices. Expenditure (or consumption) is used instead of income because the Engel curve is derived from the expenditure function (Deaton 1986, p. 1774). Taking the logarithmic derivative of this function with respect to household size, denoted as n, expresses the relationship of interest as an elasticity: where pf and qf is the price and quantity of food, σh and σf are economy of scale parameters for housing and food, respectively, varying between 0 and 1. If σ = 0, the good is purely private and if σ = 1 it is a pure household public good. The parameters εfx and εff are the income and own price elasticity of demand for food, with x representing total household expenditure. The ‘food paradox’ arises because the most plausible values of σ and ε suggest that Eq. (1) should be positive, that is food consumption per capita should increase as household size n increases, holding constant per capita expenditure x/n.Footnote 5 For example, let εff = − .50, εfx = .80, σh = .75 and σf = .25, then ∂ ln(pf qf/n)/∂ln(n) = .35. Food is usually considered to be price inelastic and somewhat income elastic (0 < εfx < 1), and surely housing is more public than food, so σh > σf. But Logan (op. cit.) finds a negative elasticity in the US in 1888, 1917 and 1935, across four alternative estimation strategies.",

Evidence from Italy,March 2016,Ylenia Brilli,Daniela Del Boca,Chiara D. Pronzato,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Advocates for public intervention in child care provision offer two main arguments: (1) child care providing children’s “physical care” may support mothers’ participation in the labor market and (2) child care providing early childhood education may contribute to children’s cognitive and non cognitive development, leading to gains in the accumulation of human capital in the society. Existing research on the impact of child care supply on maternal employment has been recently accompanied by growing interest in the impact of child care on childhood development. Such studies suggest that children’s cognitive and non cognitive outcomes are largely determined early in life and that returns on investments in early childhood are higher than those on investments at later stages, especially in the case of disadvantaged children (Carneiro and Heckman 2003). Inputs from families as well as from the school system during early childhood play a very significant role in later cognitive, social, and behavioral outcomes (Heckman et al. 2006). Child care institutions are important arenas for children’s development, and expanding child care coverage is an explicit goal in many countries. In 2002, the European Union Presidency established the goal of providing “child care by 2010 to at least 90 % of children between 3 years old and the mandatory school age and at least 33 % of children under 3 years of age” (EU 2002). Exploring the roles of public child care is particularly important in Italy, since the labor market participation of mothers is much lower than in other European countries and children do less well in school than their European counterparts. In Italy, only 54 % of mothers are employed, while this value is over 70 % in the UK, France and Germany.
Footnote 1 Furthermore, according to 2006 data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), 15-year-old Italian students rank fourth from the bottom in average educational performance among advanced countries (OECD 2007). Moreover, given the large number of children from single-child families, their main opportunities for early socialization may be those provided by child care services, and investments in child care policies may also help alleviate intergenerational persistence, especially for children from low income families. Instead, OECD data (OECD 2010) show that public investment in pre-school education in Italy is among the lowest in Europe.
Footnote 2 In fact, according to ISTAT (2010), only 13 % of children aged 0–2 years in Italy have access to public child care facilities and the demand for public child care is much higher than supply in all Italian regions. When child care applications outnumber supply, the municipalities, as the main decision makers in child care policies, allocate the limited number of slots using eligibility requirements. In some municipalities, eligibility criteria give priority to children from low income families, in order to provide better inputs for their development than those received at home and to reduce disparities. In other municipalities, priority is given to children with working mothers, in order to support them in combining parenthood and work. Our paper explores the role of public child care in Italy, investigating its impact on mothers’ working status and children’s educational outcomes. We use a newly available dataset on children’s primary school performance, in conjunction with data on public child care coverage at the provincial level. Our identification strategy exploits cross-sectional variation in child care coverage across provinces to recover the effects of interests. This paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways. First, differently from the majority of studies on this issue that deal with child care policies for children older than 3, we explicitly focus on early child care for children aged 0–2 years. A policy targeted toward very young children may have different effects on both outcomes, with respect to policies focused on children in preschool ages. Concerning mothers’ employment, a policy offering external child care for children aged 0–2 may be more effective than a preschool policy in reducing the probability that mothers without alternative forms of care leave the labor market after childbirth. Concerning children’s outcomes, instead, this study allows to test whether child care for the very young has an effect on cognitive outcomes measured at primary school. Recent literature, in fact, suggests that the returns of investments made during early years are higher than that of investments made later, and early learning increases the productivity of later learning (Carneiro and Heckman 2003). Second, when considering the impacts of child care coverage on these outcomes, we take into account the potential non-linearity in child care impacts to see whether they change if the service is more rationed, i.e. less available. In the base specification, controlling for children’s and parents’ characteristics as well as provinces’ features, we find that child care availability is positively related to mothers’ participation in the labor market and to Language test scores. We find that a percentage change in public child care coverage increases mothers’ probability to work by 1.3 percentage points and children’s Language test scores by 0.85 percent of one standard deviation of the scores distribution. We do not find any effect on Math test scores. These results are robust to the inclusion of province dummies and to several sensitivity checks. Once we allow for a non-linear effect, we find that in areas where the supply of child care is more limited the effect of a percentage change in child care supply on both mothers’ employment and Language test scores is higher. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we review the existing literature concerning the impact of child care on both mothers’ participation and children’s cognitive outcomes. In Sect. 3 we describe public child care in Italy and its features, while in Sect. 4 we present a theoretical model, representing the framework for our empirical analysis. In Sect. 5 we define the empirical strategy and the issues involved in the estimation, while Sect. 6 provides a description of the data. Section 7 presents the results from the baseline estimation (Sect. 7.1) and from the specification where non-linearity is taken into account (Sect.  7.2); Sect. 7.3 discusses the sensitivity checks that we perform. Finally, Sect. 8 concludes.",70

Men are slowly increasing the time they spend on childcare, although women still spend considerably more time on childcare than men. Recent debates continue to highlight women’s struggle to maintain a successful career while raising a family (Slaughter 2012), which some argue is caused by the unequal amount of time women spend on childcare (Becker 1985; Hochschild and Machung 1989). To understand the conflict facing women in the United States, it is crucial to examine the other half of the equation: the amount of time men spend on childcare and what factors are associated with changes in the amount of childcare men perform. In this paper, I examine the change in amount of time men spent on childcare during the recession of 2007–2009. The recession of 2007–2009 provides a sudden and concentrated change in the employment opportunities of men relative to women in the United States. When the male unemployment rate for those over 16 peaked in October 2009 at 11.2 %, the female unemployment rate was only 8.7 %. I show that this lopsided shock to employment opportunities was accompanied by an increase in the average amount of time men spent on childcare. The majority of the total increase was due to a behavioral change by employed men. In particular, men spent more time on average on physical care for children, an element of childcare that men have historically performed less often than women. I use a lagged employment indicator to decompose the total change into the change that is due to behavioral change, change in the composition of each employment group, and change between employment groups. Behavioral change refers to an actual change in a man’s behavior: for example, men spending more time on childcare during the recession than before indicates a behavioral change. Compositional change refers to changes in the composition of the group. The group of employed men before the recession is compositionally different from the group of employed men during the recession. Like traditional decomposition, my technique separates total change into changes that occur within a group (e.g. employed men spending more time on childcare) and between groups (e.g. employed men who become unemployed and then spend more time on childcare). But the traditional method, which uses repeated cross-sectional data, is unable to distinguish between behavioral and compositional changes within a group. Because the recession did not affect men’s employment status randomly, the composition of the employed will be different during the recession than prior to the recession. The lagged employment indicator that I use takes this fact into account and allows for an estimation of the behavioral and compositional components of the “within” change along with the “between” change. In this way, the lagged employment indicator can provide a more nuanced picture of overall change than the traditional method of decomposition. This paper builds directly on Casper and O’Connell’s (1998) examination of father’s involvement in childcare during the 1991 recession. The authors found that more fathers in dual-earner couples were reported as care provider for preschool children during the 1991 recession than before in the Survey of Income and Program Participation. However, instead of a dichotomous outcome variable, I use the outcome measure used in studies of long run changes in men’s provision of childcare: time spent on childcare recorded in time diaries (Bianchi et al. 2006; Sandberg and Hofferth 2001; Sayer et al. 2004). That is, this paper analyzes the short run impact of a sudden change in the macroeconomic environment as in Casper and O’Connell (1998), but uses the more sensitive outcome variables often used to study long run changes in the provision of childcare. This paper also builds on Berik and Kongar (2013), who found that the gap in unpaid labor between married men and married women decreased during the 2007–2009 recession. In this paper, I link each American Time Use Survey (ATUS) respondent to their employment status in the Current Population Survey (CPS) to identify men who recently changed employment status. With this more detailed data, I decompose the total change found by Berik and Kongar (2013) into behavioral, compositional, and between group change. I find that a behavioral change among employed men accounted for 73.9 % of the total increase in time spent on childcare. However, among men who are out of the labor force, the increase in time spent on childcare is entirely due to compositional changes. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes men’s increase in childcare provision over the past decades and how men’s childcare provision changes during recessions. Section 3 describes the ATUS and the measures of childcare used in the analysis. Section 4 presents stylized facts about the 2007–2009 recession’s impact on employment and childcare. Section 5 describes the changes in the composition of each employment status during the recession and decomposes the total increase in time on childcare into behavioral, composition, and between group change. Section 6 examines time spent on other activities. Section 7 offers discussion of the results.",11

Pörtner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A child’s time may be spent on any number of activities, and the distribution across different activities has implications both for the child’s current well-being and for its future prospects. Parents’ decisions about how much time a child spends on schooling, working, doing domestic work, or on leisure activities directly impact the child’s current utility. This may also have large impacts on the child’s human capital accumulation, with a resulting indirect impact on the development of the society.Footnote 1 This paper aims to answer two questions. First, how are different time uses traded off against each other? Second, to what extent are these trade-offs the result of observable conditions, that may potentially be changed, or the result of unobservable individual or household characteristics that are more difficult to impact? Focus is especially on how parental absence affect the allocation of children’s time across different time uses. The determinants of children’s time allocation have attracted significant public interest. In response, since the early 1990s, there has been a substantial increase in the amount of research on the time allocation of children in developing countries (Edmonds 2008). One of the main difficulties in understanding the trade-off between different uses of children’s time is that the uses are jointly determined. The initial research on the trade-off between work and schooling ignored this issue and found that working caused substantial negative effects on school attendance, grade progression, human capital accumulation, and educational attainment (Patrinos and Psacharopoulos 1995; Akabayashi and Psacharopoulos 1999; Heady 2003). The later literature has predominantly employed one of two methods to address the issues of joint determination of time use: instrumental variables (IV) or some type of exogenous variation in conditions. The main problem with the instrumental variables method is that it requires one or more variables that affect, say, work but do not affect schooling, or vice versa. In addition, the results hold only for the subset of children who change behavior because of the instrument. This may explain why the IV results have been mixed, with some finding a stronger association between work and schooling and others finding a much weaker association as compared to the prior literature (Boozer and Suri 2001; Rosati and Rossi 2003; Ray and Lancaster 2004; Gunnarsson et al. 2006). The other approach exploits changes in local conditions when examining the relationship between schooling and work, such as changes in laws or programs that affect the relative cost of going to school. Using this approach, the general finding is that there has been a substantially larger increase in schooling than there has been a decrease in market work (Ravallion and Wodon 2000; Arends–Kuenning and Amin 2004; Cardoso and Souza 2004; Kazianga et al. 2009; de Hoop and Rosati 2012).Footnote 2
 Another strand of the literature has tried to understand the medium- and long-term impact of working on human capital and future earnings. The earlier literature found that individuals who began work at a younger age tended to have lower earnings as adults, except for those with no education, perhaps because of the accumulation of experience (Ilahi et al. 2005; Emerson and Souza 2011). More recent studies with a stronger focus on controlling for unobservable characteristics that might influence both later wages and the time use decision when young, have found negligible or even positive effects on outcomes such as test scores and earnings (Beegle et al. 2009; Dumas 2012). With focus primarily on child labor and schooling, domestic work has received relatively little attention (Edmonds 2008). Domestic work is, however, an important time use and should not be ignored, especially with respect to girls (Assaad et al. 2010). It has been argued that whether or not there is a trade-off between school and work depends on whether or not domestic work is included, especially for girls (Levison and Moe 1998; Levison et al. 2001). This result is, however, not uniformly supported (de Hoop and Rosati 2012). In the same vein, the prior research has paid little attention to leisure, despite the potential importance of leisure on a child’s development and his or her ability to perform satisfactorily in school (Edmonds 2008). Most of the prior research has mainly examined the participation decision, rather the number of hours spent on each (Edmonds 2008). To the extent that researchers have examined work and schooling jointly, the commonly-used method has been bivariate probit. This approach, however, has a number of potential issues, both in terms of evaluating the effects of explanatory variables and in attempting to control for unobserved characteristics (Edmonds 2008). In addition, incorporating the decision on domestic work would require the implementation of a trivariate probit, which is not straightforward. This paper makes three main contributions to the literature. First, it incorporates all possible time uses for a child—schooling, market work, domestic work, and leisure—using a data set with detailed information on children’s time use over the week prior to the survey, measured over two survey rounds. Second, it takes into account family heterogeneity and potentially endogenous variables through the use of household fixed effects. The two survey rounds provide enough variation within households and across time to estimate household fixed effects. Most of the literature have relied on cross-sectional data and have therefore either ignored the role of unobserved family heterogeneity or used an IV approach to deal with endogenous variables. This is especially important when estimating the effects of factors such as parental absence that are likely to be correlated with unobservable household characteristics and therefore biased in standard OLS estimates. Third, it takes seriously the joint nature of time allocation decisions. It models all four time uses jointly and makes use of the available time data instead of just focusing on the participation decision (Edmonds 2008, p. 3649). This is important because estimating determinants of all time uses jointly provides a new way to understand how unobservable characteristics impact time use decisions. The correlation between individual residuals across time uses and estimated household fixed effects directly shows the extent to which two time uses substitute for each other for individual and household unobservable characteristics. The results show substantial differences between boys and girls in their responses to changes in circumstances and household characteristics. Furthermore, a major advantage of using household fixed effects over what the previous literature has done is that it is possible to estimate the effects of potentially important variables, such as parental absence and land availability, on children’s time use. One place where this is important is when examining the effect of the absence of the mother. Using household fixed effects, girls are found to experience a very significant reduction in their time spent on school activities in response to their mother not being in the household, and this effect is substantially larger than what is found using standard OLS. This effect is large enough to be equivalent to dropping out completely for these girls. Boys, on the other hand, see an increase in time spent working on market related activities in response to an absent father, although this time appears to come out of leisure rather than school or doing household chores. Land ownership is found to substantially increase the time boys spend on school activities, whereas renting land reduces the time girls spend on school. Hence, the use of an estimation method that takes into account heterogeneity and correlation across time uses together with longitudinal data lead to results that are substantially different from those found when using the method employed by the prior literature. Most of this change come from controlling for household heterogeneity, but many coefficients only become statistically significant after also allowing for correlation in the residuals across time uses. Jointly estimating time use also provides an indication of how households trade off one time use against another. Interestingly, these results indicate that different time uses, such as school against work/household chores, are very far from being traded off one-to-one. In other words, an increase in time spent on work does not come directly out time spent on school but rather a combination of school, household chores, and leisure.",9
14.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,18 September 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-014-9267-4,The connection between working hours and body mass index in the U.S.: a time use analysis,March 2016,Joelle Abramowitz,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Over recent decades, the nature and duration of work has changed for many Americans. Americans have transitioned from working in active jobs to working in sedentary jobs, with the prevalence of moderate intensity physical activity occupations decreasing from 48 % in 1960 to 20 % in 2008 (Church et al. 2011). Over the same period, while average weekly market work hours per person have been roughly constant, there have been major shifts among demographic groups with, for example, dramatic increases in hours worked for women (Aguiar and Hurst 2007) and the share of employed men working more than 48 h per week (Kuhn and Lozano 2008). Further, the majority of employed men and women report working 40 h per week or more, with the distribution particularly skewed for men, as shown in Fig. 1. The full consequences of increasing work hours and changes in the nature of work are not explored in the literature. These developments could affect individuals in many ways including their weight and health. The figure shows the distribution of usual weekly work hours by sex in the 2006–2008 ATUS. As can be seen in the figure, the majority of both men and women report working 40 h per week or more, with the distribution particularly skewed for men. The sample includes all individuals from the 2006–2008 ATUS ages 25–64 who were employed, not enrolled in school, and did not have missing data This paper primarily examines the mechanisms through which time spent working affect an individual’s weight as measured by body mass index (BMI). In general, BMI might increase with more hours spent working since as leisure time declines, the opportunity cost of time rises. As an individual works more hours, she has less leisure time available, and it thus becomes more costly to undertake health-producing activities such as exercise, food preparation, and sleep, as well as to seek medical care. On the other hand, time spent working could be associated with a lower BMI if individuals use increased income to substitute away from time-intensive health investments to goods-intensive health investments. An increase in time spent working in non-strenuous jobs could affect BMI in particular if individuals who were previously active during their working hours are now sedentary at work and do not proportionately increase activity in their non-work time. Examining the relationship between working time and obesity, Fig. 2 shows the proportion overweight by weekly work hours for employed individuals. Here, it appears that working longer hours is associated with a higher likelihood of being overweight. Since it is important to control for other factors that might affect this relationship, more in-depth analysis of this question is valuable. The figure shows the proportion overweight by weekly work hours. Working longer hours appears to be associated with a higher likelihood of being overweight. The sample includes all individuals from the 2006–2008 ATUS ages 25–64 who were employed, not enrolled in school, and did not have missing data A number of papers have considered the effect of the business cycle on health. Many papers examine the relationship between employment and unemployment indicators and health outcomes and behaviors (Ruhm 2000, 2003, 2005, 2007; Bockerman et al. 2007; Charles and DeCicca 2008; Arkes 2009; Dave and Kelly 2012). In addition, several papers have examined the effect of the business cycle on health-related time use channels (Burda and Hamermesh 2010; Aguiar et al. 2013; Colman and Dave 2013a; Deb et al. 2011). While these papers are informative with regard to the effects of the business cycle on health behaviors and health outcomes, they do not directly measure the effects of working time, the topic of interest of this analysis. Several papers specifically examine the connection between time spent working and health outcomes. Courtemanche (2009) uses long differencing methods and the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979 (NLSY) to find that longer hours increase one’s own BMI and probability of being obese. Berniell (2012) uses the change in the legal maximum workweek hours in France enacted in 1998 to find that a reduction of working time is associated with a drop in the probability of smoking, in alcohol consumption, and in physical inactivity. Xu (2013) examines the effects of wages and working hours on health behaviors of men aged 25–55 with some college education or less and finds that increases in hours worked are associated with an increase in cigarette smoking, a reduction in physical activity, and fewer visits to physicians. The above papers have documented the positive relationship between time spent working and BMI and some health behaviors, but the question remains as to what channels drive this relationship. A number of papers have explored time use data to consider how individuals’ time use might play a role in their health outcomes. Biddle and Hamermesh (1990) use the 1975–1976 Time Use Study to find a negative relationship between time spent working and time spent sleeping. More recently, Hamermesh (2010) finds that more time spent eating (and grazing) is associated with a lower BMI and better self-reported health. Colman and Dave (2013b) find that time spent on physical activity (including work-related physical activity) reduces risk factors for heart disease, including BMI. Kolodinsky and Goldstein (2011) find that individual time uses related to food were insignificant in predicting the probability of being overweight, but that once an individual crosses the overweight threshold, these time uses are significant in predicting BMI. Zick et al. (2011) investigate the relationship between BMI and various uses of time including physical activity time, television/video viewing time, sleep time, primary eating time, secondary eating time, and food preparation time. In addition, several papers examine the mechanisms through which parents’ working time affects time spent with children as well as children’s health outcomes. Fertig et al. (2009) use the Child Development Supplement from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to investigate the channels through which maternal employment affects childhood obesity. Cawley and Liu (2012) use ordinary least squares models and the ATUS to investigate the mechanisms through which maternal employment might be associated with childhood obesity. Anderson (2012) uses Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey-Kindergarten Class of 1998–1999 (ECLS-K) data to investigate the relationships among maternal employment, family routines, and obesity. While all of these papers consider different aspects through which individuals’ time use can affect health outcomes, none specifically addresses the relationship between own working time, own time in health-related activities, and own BMI. This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, while other papers have examined the effect of the business cycle on health behaviors and outcomes, this paper specifically considers the difference in outcome for a worker’s marginal hour of work by examining workers’ time spent on the job. Further, building on the literature finding a relationship between working time and BMI, this paper investigates the potential eating, health investment, and physical activity channels driving this relationship to obtain a fuller picture of how work time affects lifestyle choices that affect weight and health. This analysis uses the 2006, 2007, and 2008 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) linked with Eating and Health module interviews and the Compendium of Physical Activities. While other datasets provide information on individuals’ market work time, the ATUS also provides insight into individuals’ non-market work activities. Linked with the Eating and Health module, it permits inference to be drawn about individuals’ time use in a variety of activities as well as measures relating to eating and health, including BMI. The linked ATUS and Eating and Health module data provide great insight into the relationship between time use and weight and health and can be very valuable in understanding the relationship between working time and BMI and health. This analysis aims to identify channels through which time spent working could affect BMI.Footnote 1 To address this question, I first reproduce the result found in other papers that increased working time is associated with a positive and significant effect on own BMI for both men and women using the ATUS. Next, I estimate a series of equations including controls for time spent in each of a variety of activities associated with eating, health investment, and physical activity to investigate the channels through which working time may impact BMI. This approach treats time spent in each activity as an omitted variable and tests whether its inclusion results in a significant difference in the effect of time spent working on own BMI. Because the relationships between one’s own time spent working, one’s own time in health-related activities, and one’s own BMI may be due not only to a direct causal link, but also to some unobservable characteristics which result in these correlations or to reverse causation, findings from this approach must be interpreted as highly suggestive and not necessarily causal. Results suggest plausible mechanisms for the association between time spent working and obesity. As a baseline, I find that for workers in non-strenuous jobs, 10 additional hours spent working are associated with an increase in BMI of 0.424 for women and 0.197 for men, representing an increase of 2.5 pounds and 1.4 pounds, respectively. A number of the tested channels appear to impact the effect of hours worked on BMI. For workers in non-strenuous jobs, the effect of time spent working on BMI becomes smaller after accounting for time spent sleeping for both men and women and time spent in exercise and food preparation for women only. However, the effect of time spent working on BMI becomes larger after accounting for screen time for both men and women and time spent in secondary eating and commuting for women only. Screen time is the single time use channel associated with the largest differences in the estimated effect of time spent working on BMI was screen time for both women and men employed in non-strenuous jobs. No effects were found for any channels for women working in strenuous jobs, and effects for men working in strenuous jobs were similar to those found for men working in non-strenuous jobs. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a theoretical framework for understanding the channels through which time spent working could affect time spent in health-related activities and BMI. The sections that follow present the data used in the analysis, outline the empirical specifications, and show results of the analysis. The last section concludes.",11

Children who do not receive adult supervision after school, also called “latchkey children”, are found to be the ones to most likely engage in substance use and other risky behaviors (Coley et al. 2008), have behavior problems (Vandell and Ramanan 1991), and experience depression and score lower academically (Richardson et al. 1993), as compared to those who arrive home with the mother or other adults present. Eighth-graders who participate in adult-supervised after-school activities are also found to use drugs significantly less often than those who are not involved in such activities (Jenkins 1996). Across siblings, those born later are found to have a higher propensity to engage in risky behaviors, the reason for which is attributed to differences in parental control (Bègue and Roché 2005) and supervision (Averett et al. 2011). Using a survey questionnaire, Bègue and Roché (2005) found that middle-borns are more likely to be involved in delinquent behaviors and are also less supervised than the first-borns, and concluded that differential parental control partly explains the role of ordinal position in delinquent behavior. While parents can exert a direct influence on their offspring by serving as role models (Bantle and Haisken-DeNew 2002) or by policing the offspring’s activities, increased parental supervision and decreased self-care are two sides of the same coin. Both provide a “guard” by limiting the opportunities and incentives to partake in these activities (Amato and Rivera 1999; Amato and Fowler 2002; Browning et al. 2005) and by decreasing the susceptibility to societal influences such as siblings (Altonji et al. 2013; Argys et al. 2006; Bard and Rodgers 2003; Fagan and Najman 2003) and peers (Clark and Lohéac 2007). While the literature points to a general negative impact of parental supervision on risky behaviors, the findings are based on proxy variables such as parental employment status or number of working hours, or on indicator measures of parental presence during different periods of the day (Aizer 2004), being able to go out at night without the parents, respect of curfew, or not telling the parents where one is going to be (Bègue and Roché 2005). These variables may be valid assuming that parents spend less time supervision with their offspring when employed as compared to when they are unemployed (James-Burdumy 2005). And although they are arguably exogenous, such measures provide incomplete or vague information about the quality composition or intensity of supervision which quantitative time supervision can measure more precisely. To illustrate, the relationship between parental employment and child outcomes remains ambiguous. While employment may affect child outcomes (Cawley and Liu 2012; Fertig et al. 2009) through decreased time availability (Johnson et al. 2013), employed mothers may make up for lost time from working by decreasing their own leisure time and effectively spend the same quality time as that by unemployed mothers (Bianchi 2000; Huston and Aronson 2005). Aside from a correlation among risky behaviors (Grossman et al. 2004), there is also evidence that engaging in risky behaviors is negatively associated with the future well-being, education, and labor market outcomes of individuals (Balsa et al. 2011; DeSimone 2010; Flouri and Buchanan 2002). For instance, early smokers are found to perform academically worse than their non-smoking counterparts (Ellickson et al. 2001). Alcohol consumption is found to affect brain development and learning mechanisms (Renna 2008), which may then worsen academic and cognitive achievements. Alcohol use and underage drinking have similar findings on educational attainment and years of completed schooling (Chatterji 2006; Cook and Moore 1993; Mullahy and Sindelar 1994), although magnitudes are smaller after taking into account unobserved heterogeneity (Balsa et al. 2011). Despite the relevant role of teenage risky behaviors in individual outcomes, there are relatively few studies examining adolescent behaviors as an outcome (Gruber 2001; Fertig et al. 2009), especially as compared to ones of cognitive, achievement, and education (Leibowitz 1974; Todd and Wolpin 2007). Among these, still a smaller number of studies have addressed the issue of unobserved heterogeneity by including family fixed effects (Aizer 2004; Anderson et al. 2003) as an identification strategy or by using an instrumental variables approach. Moreover, there is rampant use of contemporaneous measurements of risky behaviors and parental time (Fertig et al. 2009), which raises the issue of simultaneity: do teenagers engage in risky behaviors as a consequence of the time spent with parents, or do parents spend time with their teenage offspring based on the latter’s behaviors? The collection of time diaries, especially one taking the point of view of the child or teenager, provides a breakthrough in measuring parental time supervision directly and makes it possible to derive new insights into the role of parents in determining child outcomes. Utilizing this information, this research tests the relationship between parental supervision and adolescent risky behaviors of cigarette smoking, marijuana smoking, and alcohol consumption using a sample of adolescents 10–21 years old from the Child Development Supplement (CDS) and Transition to Adulthood (TA) of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Direct measurements of supervision are considered, calculated using the time each parent spent with the child and aggregated into weekly hours. Parental time from fathers and mothers are also looked at separately, disentangling the relative importance of each in determining teenage behaviors. This is related to the recent changes in household structure (Hofferth 2006), the decision-making process in the family, child care choices (Aizer 2004), as well as increased female labor force participation and maternal work schedules (Richardson et al. 1993). The common practice in the literature has been to aggregate parental influence as one entity. If separated, maternal role has been relatively more explored in line with cognitive and educational outcomes, while paternal role has been investigated with respect to behavioral and non-cognitive outcomes (Cobb-Clark and Tekin 2014). To my knowledge, none has compared the relative roles. With a panel dataset, this analysis uses lagged measurements of parental time to address the potential issue of simultaneity between contemporaneous behaviors and supervision, a solution also adopted in Zick et al. (2001). Lastly, the identification strategies rely on a household fixed effects approach that is made possible due to the observation of biological siblings in the dataset, and an individual fixed effects approach that is made possible due to repeated observations of the same individual. The paper is organized as follows. The data and sample are described in Sect. 2, followed by the estimation strategy in Sect. 3. The empirical results are presented in Sect. 4, with the overall result pointing to the importance of taking into account unobserved heterogeneity and highlighting the significance of fathers’ time supervision in mitigating teenage risky behaviors. Section 5 concludes.",10

Central to the design of such policies and evaluation of their welfare costs is the female labor supply elasticity which remains an active area of research in public finance and labor economics. Much of the previous literature on taxes and US female labor supply assumed myopic behavior and perfectly constrained capital markets and estimated primarily static models, which are not lifecycle-consistent if agents can transfer assets across periods (Blundell and Macurdy 1999; Blundell and Walker 1986).Footnote 2 On the other hand, papers that modeled lifecycle labor supply for US females, in general, assumed intertemporally separable preferences as well as budget constraints and estimated marginal utility of wealth (λ)-constant labor supply specifications. Such separability properties hold only if either there are no taxes or if taxes on asset income are linear, in which case, labor supply in one period is a function of wages and interest rates only in that period (Blomquist 1985). With current period wages affecting other period labor supply only through a wealth effect, marginal utility of wealth is a sufficient statistic for all information in other periods and λ-constant labor supply specifications are empirically feasible.Footnote 3
 Blomquist (1985) showed that if labor and asset income taxes are joint and progressive and, therefore, budget constraints intertemporally nonseparable, then current period wages affect labor supply in another period through more channels than just the standard wealth effect. For example, a wage increase this year can, not only lead to more hours and assets during the year but also, consequently, higher asset income and marginal tax rate next year, creating an intertemporal linkage between current and future after-tax wages. Although, marginal utility of wealth is no more a sufficient statistic and λ-constant labor supply specifications are not empirically applicable, intertemporal preferences as well as within-period elasticities can be recovered conveniently using a two stage-budgeting frameworkFootnote 4 (Blomquist 1985; Blundell and Macurdy 1999; Ziliak and Kniesner 1999). To the best of my knowledge, there are no applications of two-stage budgeting framework in estimating within-period lifecycle-consistent labor supply elasticities for US females.Footnote 5 This paper makes two contributions to the existing body of work on female labor supply. First, it uses the PSID-CNEF from 1979 to 2007 to estimate within-period lifecycle-consistent labor supply elasticities of US females, in the presence of nonlinear taxation, in a two-stage budgeting framework, in the spirit of papers such as Ziliak and Kniesner (1999) for US males and Blundell et al. (1993) for British females.Footnote 6 Second, the paper estimates US female labor supply models employing panel data estimation with censoring, selection and endogeneity and fills an important gap in the previous literature that used primarily cross-sectional rather than panel data.Footnote 7 Since estimating unobserved effect models of female labor supply with censoring and selection remains challenging, as simple fixed effects (FE) models do not work due to incidental parameters problems and first differencing to remove the FE is not feasible as the model is nonlinear (Neyman and Scott 1948), the paper combines a variety of econometric approaches from Kyriazidou (1997), Blundell and Powell (2004), Charlier et al. (2001), Papke and Wooldridge (2008), Wooldridge (2009) and Semykina and Wooldridge (2010).Footnote 8
 In many respects the paper is similar in spirit to three other papers which carefully examined the sensitivity of female labor supply estimates to a variety of different specifications: Mroz (1987), Jakubson (1988), and Zabel (1997). This paper differs from all these three papers, however. While Mroz (1987) restricted analysis to just the 1975 wave of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), Jakubson (1988), and Zabel (1997) used panel data from the PSID but estimated λ-constant random and FE Tobit models without taxes, ignoring the potential bias due to the incidental parameters problem as well as complications due to nonlinear taxation. There are three primary findings. First, female labor supply elasticities are highly sensitive to estimating unobserved effects specifications. FE models yield a participation wage elasticity of 0.43 compared with 0.56 from both simple pooled panel models without unobserved effects and Correlated Random Effects (CRE) specifications.Footnote 9 Intensive margin elasticities, however, are even more sensitive to accounting for unobserved effects; FE models and CRE specifications produce much smaller hours elasticities than pooled panel models without unobserved effects. Second, estimates of wage elasticity are somewhat sensitive to the choice of a more general lifecycle-consistent framework applicable under nonlinear taxes versus the standard static model, underscoring the need to account for lifecycle factors in female labor supply. In the CRE specification with instrumental variables, the estimated lifecycle-consistent wage elasticity on the extensive margin is 0.56, compared with 0.46 from the static model. On the intensive margin, estimated lifecycle-consistent wage elasticity is 0.31 from the CRE specification, while the static model yields a much smaller elasticity of 0.13. However, given the large standard errors, the estimates are statistically indistinguishable. Finally, the paper does not find evidence of significant difference in estimated elasticities across lifecycle-consistent models applicable to linear taxes that condition on net saving vis-à-vis models consistent with joint nonlinear labor and capital income taxes that condition on current period and lagged assets.Footnote 10 Overall, the results indicate that the choice of econometric specification and economic assumptions regarding lifecycle behavior can have nontrivial implications for the estimated impact of tax and transfer policies on female labor supply. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the econometric specification. Section 3 provides a brief description of the data and construction of the key variables: wage, income, assets and taxes. Section 4 discusses the results. There is a brief conclusion.",3

Baum,Shin-Yi Chou,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Part of President Obama’s health care legislation (the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) will require big chain restaurants’ menus to provide caloric information about their meals (The New York Times, March 23, 2010). California and New York City already restrict the amount of fat restaurants can serve. Several other city and state governments have proposed taxing soft drinks. These policies are largely a response to the growing prevalence of obesity. Over 33 % of Americans are currently obese, which is more than twice as many as were obese 30 years ago (Flegal et al. 2010). Whether these policies will be effective depends on the extent to which socio-environmental factors influence obesity, if at all. It is well accepted that weight gain is caused by caloric imbalance, where more calories are consumed than expended. Specifically, a pound of weight gain results from net intake of 3500 cal. Nevertheless, it is difficult empirically to distinguish the reasons why the prevalence of obesity has increased so dramatically over the last 30 years apart from cohort effects and year effects. Recently, researchers have begun examining the effects of various socio-environmental changes, which may have affected net calories consumed, on the prevalence of obesity. For example, Baum (2007) examines changes in the racial and ethnic composition and age distribution; Lakdawalla and Philipson (2007) examine employment and physical activity at work; Cutler et al. (2003), Chou et al. (2004), Rashad and Grossman (2004), and Rashad et al. (2006) examine the prevalence of restaurants and food prices; Chou et al. (2004) and Gruber and Frakes (2006) examine cigarette prices and taxes; Gibson (2003), Chen et al. (2005), Meyerhoefer and Pylypchuk (2008), and Baum (2011) examine food stamp receipt; and Ewing et al. (2003), Eid et al. (2008), and Zhao and Kaestner (2010) examine urban sprawl. We propose to build on the existing literature by simultaneously examining the effects of multiple socio-environmental factors on the prevalence of obesity and BMI. We consider in our analysis many of the socio-environmental factors that have been identified by other researchers as important influences on caloric imbalance. Specifically, we consider (1) employment, (2) physical activity at work, (3) the prevalence of restaurants, (4) food prices, (5) cigarette smoking, (6) cigarette prices and taxes, (7) food stamp receipt, and (8) urbanization (urban sprawl). We use 1979- and 1997-cohort National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data, which allow us to compare the prevalence of obesity between cohorts surveyed roughly 25 years apart (at a given age). A portion of the analysis simultaneously estimates the effects of the various socio-environmental factors on obesity using multivariate regression analysis. The analysis also uses the traditional Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition technique to approximate the contribution of each socio-environmental factor to the increase in obesity over the past 25 years (Blinder 1973; Oaxaca 1973). Many socio-environmental factors significantly affect weight, but none are able to explain a large portion of the obesity increase. Decreases in cigarette smoking consistently explains about 2–4 % of the increase in obesity and BMI. Food stamp receipt also consistently affects the measures of weight, but the small decrease in food stamp program participation during the period we examine actually dampened the increases in obesity and BMI. Collectively, the socio-environmental factors we examine never explain more than about 6.5 % of the increases.",2

About 69 % of American adults were overweight or obese as of 2010, a figure which has increased by more than 50 % in the last 30 years.Footnote 1 Marriage rates are 39 % lower than they were in 1950, with 17 % of this drop occurring since 2000. Marriages that do form are delayed; the proportion of women between 25 and 34 who have never been married is more than 150 % higher than it was in 1970. This paper explores one aspect of the relationship between marital status and obesity. The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and marital status is complex, and features bidirectional causality. A low BMI is a desirable characteristic in the marriage market, but at the same time being married can alter the incentives for investment in one’s health. Our paper focuses on the first point—the relationship between BMI and entry into marriage, specifically for women. Being obese is generally regarded to be a negative attribute in the marriage market, especially for women. For example, Averett et al. (2008) find that the negative association between BMI and marital entry is significant for both genders, but is much stronger for women than it is for men. Analyses of Internet dating websites find that a low body weight is a desirable characteristic for women (e.g. Hitsch et al. 2010).Footnote 2
 But even if we take for granted that a low BMI makes women more desirable in the marriage market, the translation between desirability and entry into marriages is not immediate. If we think of selection as a two-way process, the effect of desirability on marital entry is theoretically ambiguous. While it may be the case that obese women have more difficulty locating high-quality partners, they consequently have more incentive to commit to a relationship with matches that do arrive. That is, women with less desirable physical characteristics may actually be more likely to enter into marriages quickly because of bad expectations about future prospects. By contrast, women who perceive themselves to be the most desirable might delay getting married because they hope to locate a better match. Overall, the selection effect of BMI into marital entry is ambiguous. Our paper uses data from the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97) to investigate this relationship. In contrast to earlier work, we find mixed results on the effect of BMI on marital entry. Overall, marital probability does decline as BMI rises, but early marriages are different. We find evidence that women with a BMI in the most attractive range are less likely to enter into early marriages, as are women with a very high BMI. Similarly, extrapolating over the whole life cycle, increases in BMI are associated with a later age at first marriage. But, for women who marry early, increases in BMI are associated with a lower age at first marriage. Earlier work, by combining women in different age groups into a single sample to develop parameter estimates, has not detected this effect. By better understanding how our characteristics and our behavioral choices impact incentives and outcomes related to family structure, we can make some progress in understanding changes in family dynamics. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature on the relationship between BMI and marriage. Section 3 presents a theoretical model of the relationship between marital formation and characteristics like BMI that index desirability. Section 4 discusses the data and results. Section 5 concludes.",11

Berndsen,Hugrún J. Halldórsdóttir,Female,Female,Female,Female,"As western governments are responsible for a wide variety of income replacements, they are sensitive to the effects of their policies on health and the subsequent effect of health on the labor market. Risky lifestyle choices in Iceland, as in the industrialized world in general, have attracted the attention of policy makers. There is a large difference between what is currently acknowledged as healthy lifestyles and what most individuals practice. This difference seems difficult to reconcile, and is projected to be the source of leading health issues in the next decades (Chan 2010). Being unhealthy can have several economic consequences for the individual and society, both directly and indirectly. Direct costs involve for example hospitalization, medical examinations and drugs, but indirect costs are associated with decreased labor supply through lost productivity, such as absenteeism, decreased employment, hours worked or premature death (WHO 2007). Obesity, misuse of alcohol and daily smoking are explored in the current study with focus on how they relate to quantity of labor supplied. The go-to list of behavioral risk factors has generally included alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity and diet. As the survey questions on physical activity changed between waves and a single measure of healthy eating habits was not available, the body mass index (BMI) was used instead, although is it not a health behavior, but a condition resulting from health behaviors. These three health risks examined might not respond in the same way to aggregate or individual-level changes in labor supply since they are very different in nature and require different resources. Alcohol misuse and smoking might be considered goods-intensive while time-intensive inputs are more important for obesity. While this paper does not examine the effect of labor supply on those health risks, this may still affect the importance of retaining a job for the individuals involved as working influences both the income and time constraints an individual faces. The more relevant causal pathway in this paper is the one from risky health behaviors to labor supplied or demanded from subjects. Smoking, excessive drinking and obesity may weaken general health conditions, resulting in reduced productivity. However, there might also be discrimination against smokers, heavy drinkers or overweight and obese people that is not because of their health-related productivity. There are furthermore possible reasons why the labor-market effects of the risky behaviors examined here would differ across the business cycle. For example, if discrimination plays a role, the effects might be greater during hard times when employers can more selectively pick their employees, as opposed to times of full employment when it may in contrast be difficult for an employer to find workers. If the reason for the relationship depends on the health-related productivity of the workers, the changing work environment over the business cycle could also place different demands on the workers. Decreases in employment or hours worked have an impact on the individual and society, regardless of whether they result from health-related productivity decreases or discrimination. Although the individuals affected bear part of the labor-market cost themselves, in the form of lower wages and lower employment levels, the cost is also substantial for society, since governments are generally responsible for a wide variety of income replacements. The effect of obesity on the labor market has been studied to some extent in recent years. Generally the results have differed by gender. Obesity has been found to affect females negatively in the labor market but the effects for males have been limited (Atella et al. 2008; Ásgeirsdóttir 2011; Cawley 2004; Greve 2008; Lundborg et al. 2007). Because of its addictiveness, alcohol differs from other beverages, but research shows quantities consumed to be responsive to economic incentives. It is possible to decrease alcohol consumption with restricted access and higher prices (Cook and Moore 2002). However, alcohol regulations remain controversial and it is difficult to measure the costs and benefits resulting from such policies. Nevertheless, labor-market effects could potentially make up an important part of societal effects. It is commonly believed that alcohol misuse affects the labor market by reducing productivity, worker reliability, hours worked, the ability to obtain and retain a job, and by increasing absenteeism (Strategy Unit 2003). However, the results of previous studies are mixed, and a negative relationship between alcohol and labor-market outcomes has not always been found in previous studies (Ásgeirsdóttir and McGeary 2009; Dave and Kaestner 2002; Tómasson et al. 2004). Although the literature on the effects of tobacco use on the labor market is not large, existing studies have shown that cigarette smoking can have a negative effect on labor-market outcomes such as wages (Grafova and Stafford 2008; Levine et al. 1997). It is therefore clear that much work still needs to be done before the full and clear picture emerges. In 2008 the Icelandic banking system collapsed, resulting in an economic crisis, which affected people in multiple ways. Many individuals lost their jobs as the unemployment rate went from 2.3 % in 2007 to 7.2 % in 2009 (Statice 2013). The main purpose of this paper is to examine potential relationships between pre-crisis BMI, alcohol misuse or smoking and changes in the quantity of labor supplied following the banking collapse, using panel data collected in 2007 and 2009. Quantity of labor supplied is examined both at the extensive and intensive margins. That is, we examine if body weight, misuse of alcohol or smoking are related to the probability of job loss following the economic collapse as well as a decrease in hours worked between waves. This study consequently contributes to the literature on health, health behaviors and the labor market. However, it is not less importantly meant as a contribution to the field of business cycles and health. Results from individual level analyses and the aggregate-data business cycle analyses have been somewhat difficult to reconcile. Hence, examination of individual data during a time of great contrasts in ambient economic conditions is of interest. The result from the current study showed statistically significant relationships between pre-crisis health risks and decreases in labor supply following the banking collapse for women only.",8

While a number of studies have provided explanations for such imbalanced ratios,Footnote 1 their potential effects remain relatively unexplored. Becker’s marriage market model and related theories suggest that as women become scarcer in the marriage market relative to men, they receive larger transfer payments from their husbands. That is, women’s share of the “marital surplus” increases (Becker 1973; Choo and Siow 2006a, 2006b). Such allocation of household resources is also determined by a household bargaining process that results in what is termed the household “sharing rule” in the collective model of household bargaining. In this model, the sex ratio is a distribution factor that shifts the household sharing rule in favor of the scarcer sex (Browning et al. 1994; Chiappori et al. 2002). In this paper, I test whether the sex ratio at marriage is such a relevant distribution factor in determining intra-household resource allocation in China.Footnote 2 I find that high sex ratios improve the health of sons, supporting the hypothesis that women who face relatively favorable marriage market conditions have greater bargaining power once married.Footnote 3 This is further supported by the fact that sex ratio effects remain unchanged when controlling for spouse characteristics. High sex ratios also delay the age at which men marry, and reduce the amount of tobacco and alcohol a husband consumes. In comparing the effects of an imbalanced sex ratio of 120, relative to the usual average ratio of 107, this difference of 13 men per 100 women would improve boys’ short-term health by roughly 31 %, would raise the age at which men marry by nearly six months, and would reduce men’s daily tobacco consumption by 56 %. These findings suggest that at the time of marriage, spouses are able to commit future resource allocation, supporting prior research showing that a marriage market with assortative matching results in a unique sharing rule that lasts throughout the marriage and is, in part, a function of the sex ratio in the marriage market (Iyigun and Walsh 2007). Empirical evidence of such commitment was also found in South Korea (Lee 2007). Such commitment may be at least partly due to path dependence because of relatively high transition costs to altering initial arrangements (Arthur 1994). Though, such commitment may be limited and renegotiated, particularly when circumstances change. For example, social programs allocating money specifically to women also influence how resources are distributed within the household (Mazzocco 2007). The findings in this paper also complement prior research on famine-affected cohorts and their relatively low marriage rates at particular ages (Brandt et al. 2008; Almond et al. 2010). However, related studies assume a fixed age difference between spouses.Footnote 4 For example, the number of men aged 22–28 would be divided by the number of women aged 20–26, an estimation that ignores the degree to which a man aged 22 prefers to marry a woman aged 20 to one aged 26. In contrast, the sex ratio developed in this article weights cohort sizes by the proportion of people in the population who marry someone born in a different cohort. In this particular case, where fertility has fluctuated considerably, cohort sizes vary significantly over very brief intervals. Without such weights, relatively large cohorts are equally weighted to smaller ones, which would overestimate the number of available mates, should smaller cohorts be preferred. The sex ratio developed in this article reflects the average tendency of men to prefer women who are close in age to women who are several years younger than them. We can account for such preferences across different ages by using the observed population distribution in age differences between spouses to proxy for the net gains from marrying someone of a given age. For example, the proportion of men in a population marrying women who are 2 years younger than them approximates an average likelihood of a particular man marrying such a woman. This is because such average rates have been shown to reflect the average benefit for a man to such a marriage, in comparison to him marrying a woman of a different age, or remaining single (Choo and Siow 2006a, 2006b). Observed differences in ages for individual cohorts reflect a combination of preference parameters and the amount of net transfer payments made to the scarcer sex. In this case, the share of household resources given to a woman can be considered the “price” for marrying a particular woman. So I examine overall average age differences across spouses from cohorts not under study here, who face different prices. I also demonstrate that such population trends in average age differences between spouses are not influenced by particular cohorts that face especially stringent prices or marriage market conditions. Finally, it is important to note that we can never be assured that population sex ratios are completely exogenous to the individual. To the extent possible, I control for some potential bias due to endogeneity or selection issues resulting from the circumstances unique to one’s birth cohort. First, I do so by controlling for the size of one’s birth cohort, as many sex ratio effects are determined by one’s birth province and year. An additional control variable reflects the degree of competition from neighboring cohorts outside the marriage market such as competition for employment opportunities or education-related resources like teacher availability and class size. Another potential concern is that cohorts that differ in systematic abilities and life-forming early work experiences are averaged together in the ratio, which could potentially introduce biases related to these time-varying changes in unobservables. To address such potential biases, three additional controls are included in the regressions: the number of women in the youngest and oldest cohorts of the sex ratio, and the average completed level of education as of 2000 of all women who are included in the sex ratio. As these population-level variables may themselves be influenced by individual characteristics, I also estimate regressions excluding them. In addition to these robustness checks, I find that sex ratios do not influence possible placebo outcomes: one’s height or the likelihood of completing schooling beyond the primary level. Finally, I discuss limitations to these methods. In the context under study here, sex ratios resemble the degree of scarcity of women relative to men in other developing countries also experiencing sharp demographic changes that are somewhat similar to historical fertility fluctuations experienced in China.Footnote 5 In introducing a new way to measure sex ratios characterizing marriage markets, this paper improves our understanding of how shifts in the population affect marriage markets, and how imbalanced population sex ratios relate to individual household decisions. Overall, the findings suggest that if a man is born during a sustained period of low fertility or between periods of high and low fertility, he is faced with a great deal of competition in the market for a spouse. As a result, he must negotiate a smaller share of the marriage surplus. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains how marriage market conditions are estimated. Section 3 outlines the estimation strategy and describes the data used in the analysis. Section 4 discusses the empirical results, and Sect. 5 concludes.",24
14.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,09 October 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-013-9224-7,Does marriage affect men’s labor market outcomes? A European perspective,June 2016,Niklas Jakobsson,Andreas Kotsadam,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is a broad social science literature studying the effects of marriage and divorce for labor market outcomes of spouses (see Pollmann-Schult 2011; Raz-Yurovich 2011; Van Damme et al. 2009 for recent examples, and Ribar (2004) for an overview of the literature). That married men work more and harder, earn more, and are more stable workers than unmarried men is well documented (e.g., Akerlof 1998). But are these effects of marriage, or is it rather that a certain kind of men marry? The dominant theory as to why there is a difference between married and non-married men argues that marriage makes men more productive (the productivity hypothesis). Starting with Becker’s (1991) seminal work, economists have studied the economics of marriage. At the core of Becker’s theory lies the specialization hypothesis suggesting that spouses can specialize in different tasks and that increasing returns to scale of human capital increases productivity. Therefore, it is argued, marriage makes men more productive in the labor market. The selection hypothesis is the main competing theory. The selection argument implies that married men are more productive because they were more productive also before marriage, not because they became more productive after marriage. The idea is that a man’s attractiveness as a husband depends on his labor market status and on unobserved traits that are positively related to his future labor market status. Such traits may for example be looks, ability, or dedication, which may be related to outcomes in both the marriage market and the labor market (Ribar 2004).Footnote 1
 The relative merits of the productivity and selection arguments in explaining the effects of marriage are still to be established. Results from fixed effects studies often find a marriage premium in wages for men, although it is substantially reduced as compared to cross-sectional estimates (see Ahituv and Lerman (2007), Budig and England (2001), Cornwell and Rupert (1997), Gray (1997), Korenman and Neumark (1991) and Stratton 2002 for results regarding USA, Bardasi and Taylor (2008) for Great Britain, Choi et al. (2005) for Germany, and Richardson (2000) for Sweden). However, there are also studies that show no effects of marriage on wages in the US (Krashinsky 2004; Nakosteen and Zimmer 1987). Studies using samples of US twins to control for unobserved heterogeneity also reach different conclusions (Antonovics and Town 2004; Krashinsky 2004). In a recent study, Pollmann-Schult (2011) find that German men receive a wage premium when marrying (controlling for selection) but in contrast to the specialization hypothesis he does not find that these men reduce their housework or that the time of housework affect the wage. Hersch and Stratton (2000) find similar results in a US sample. The previous studies in the area have been conducted using different methodologies in different countries, and in different time periods and it is therefore not surprising that they have reached somewhat different conclusions regarding to what extent there is an effect of marriage on men’s wages. Moreover, previous research has mainly been concerned with wages; only a few have (covering USA and Germany) considered number of hours worked as well (Choi et al. 2005; Lundberg 2005; Ahituv and Lerman 2007), and these point to a positive effect of marriage on hours worked also when controlling for unobserved permanent individual heterogeneity. As argued by Ahituv and Lerman (2007), it is important to look at number of hours worked since this factor is more likely than wage rates to be under the influence of individual choice. Unlike previous papers we are able to assess the effect of marriage on both men’s wages and hours worked, in several European countries over a long period of time. A major aim of the present study is to discriminate between the productivity hypothesis and the selection hypothesis. It is generally acknowledged that outcomes of marriage specialization are affected by the opportunities outside of marriage (e.g., Baker and Jakobsen 2007), and these outside options may differ among countries and over time. The present paper moves beyond earlier studies by using data for 12 countries covering the years 1994–2007, which allows us to exploit variation across time and country groups. We may therefore highlight important heterogeneity in the effects of marriage on labor outcomes. We find that selection into marriage accounts for most of the differences between married and non-married men in Europe. We conclude that the positive difference between married and non-married men in hours worked is due only to selection. Regarding men’s wages, we find that there was an effect of marriage in the mid-1990s but that it has disappeared in more recent years.",8
14.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,09 March 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-014-9244-y,Parenthood wage penalties in a double income society,June 2016,Sara Cools,Marte Strøm,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Women’s labor force participation increased greatly in Norway during the last decades of the twentieth century, closely approaching that of men. Over the same period, as several European countries experienced falling fertility rates, the total fertility rate in Norway increased and stayed far above the European average. In a country where the combination of work and family is encouraged through public policies such as universal child care, paid parental leave and extensive job protection for parents, and where not only the two career household, but also the two carer household, is encouraged, the double fact of high female labor force participation and high fertility is the hallmark of these policies’ success. Unfortunately, and puzzling to some, the gender gap in hourly wage has not declined as successfully over the period. It seems rather that the convergence in men’s and women’s hourly wage stagnated some time during the 1980s, only to pick up slightly from 2000 onwards. As in most other countries, the gender wage gap is greater among parents than among non-parents—a phenomenon known as the family gap in wages. Quantifying the wage effects of parenthood is therefore of interest to policy makers wishing to address the overall gender wage gap. In this paper we study how children affect men’s and women’s hourly wages, using panel data on hourly wages in Norway from 1997 to 2007. Using fixed effects estimation and register data covering both the private and the public sector (in total 80 % of the working population), this is the first broad panel data study of parenthood wage effects in Norway. In addition to rich register data, the institutional setting provided by Norway as a typical Nordic welfare state makes it an interesting case for the exploration of causes behind the family wage gap. The international empirical evidence on a negative relationship between having children and women’s labor market outcomes, like wages and labor supply, is substantial (e.g. Korenman and Neumark (1992), Waldfogel (1997) and Budig and England (2001)). The evidence on the effects of fatherhood is both more scarce and less consistent (see for instance Millimet (2000), Lundberg and Rose (2002), Simonsen and Skipper (2008), Astone et al. (2010), Wilde et al. (2010)). Generally, the literature finds a smaller family gap in pay for mothers in the Scandinavian countries (Datta Gupta and Smith 2002; Harkness and Waldfogel 2003a). Differences in family policies are argued to be key in explaining differences in family gaps across countries (Waldfogel 1998). For example, Waldfogel (1998) show that in countries with paid parental leave, women return to work more quickly and at the same time maintain a good job match. The institutional context may therefore leave a smaller role for the motherhood wage penalty being caused by an adverse effect on firm-specific human capital. This paper aims to investigate further two main explanations for why we observe a negative wage effect on mothers’ wages.Footnote 1 Commonly, children are considered to have an effect on women’s productivity—by a comparative reduction either in their human capital or in their work effort—which again will be reflected in their wages. As proposed by Mincer and Polachek (1974), childbearing and child rearing may cause a comparative reduction in mothers’ labor market experience, both through periods out of the labor market and through periods of reduced working hours, which then adversely affects mothers’ accumulation of human capital. Several empirical studies have shown that when controlling for experience—measured as time in active employment, net of career breaks and/or adjusted for part time work—a large part of the wage penalty is explained (Waldfogel 1997; Budig and England 2001; Datta Gupta and Smith 2002; Anderson et al. 2002; Wilde et al. 2010). We explore a human capital explanation for the family wage gap by including actual job experience, the length of parental leave and part-time work as explanatory variables in our estimations of parenthood wage effects. As the Norwegian institutional setting provides, on the one hand, long periods of parental leave, while on the other, high job-protection during leave, we expect two conditions to be met: First, that the overall wage penalty is lower in Norway if the loss of job-specific human capital explains a large share of the wage-penalty in other settings. Second, that the inclusion of experience measures explains a smaller share of the wage penalty because they only pick up the deterioration of human capital in general. In the other part of the productivity explanation for mothers’ reduced hourly wage, Becker (1985) theory of a conflict between effort in home production and effort at work implies that among women working the same number of hours, mothers will put in less effort per hour. Several studies have found a negative relationship between housework load and wages (Coverman 1983; Shelton and Firestone 1989; McAllister 1990; Hersch and Stratton 1997). Career break effects may also wrongly be attributed to loss of human capital. Using Swedish data, Albrecht et al. (1999) find that the type of career break matters for its effect on wages, and that the effects vary by gender. As they find no effect of maternity leave and a negative effect of paternity leave, they interpret this as parental leave signalling worker effort.Footnote 2
 We explore the effort explanation in different ways. First, we expect workers to be more free to regulate their own effort in occupations requiring higher education, whereas workers in occupations requiring lower education will be relatively more forced to reducing working hours rather than effort in their work. We therefore expect parenthood to affect hourly wages more negatively in higher education groups (whereas it affects working hours more negatively in the lower education groups). Second, Anderson et al. (2003) suggest that the role of effort can be investigated by studying how the parenthood wage penalty evolves as the child grows older, since smaller children demand more effort at home than older children. The parenthood wage penalty should consequently be smaller when the child grows older.Footnote 3 Third, if effort is part of the explanation and there is a constant amount of effort to be shared between parents, we would expect men’s penalties to increase as women’s decline. Last, we should also expect to see larger wage penalties in the private sector, where individual wage setting is more common but job protection still applies, as long as individually bargained wages are more closely linked to effort. Other explanations from both the empirical and theoretical literature do not evoke an effect of children on women’s productivity: Mothers may earn lower wages than non-mothers due to employers’ discrimination or because they seek employment in “mother-friendly” jobs, for instance offering greater flexibility or requiring skills that deteriorate less rapidly during time spent out of the labor force—at the expense of lower wages (Budig and England 2001; Nielsen et al. 2004). We do not test hypotheses of discrimination in this paper, and cannot rule out that it plays a role. Public sector jobs are often viewed as more easily compatible with family life. We explore whether a change in sector of employment can explain some of the parenthood wage effects by including sector of employment as an explanatory variable in our regressions. Our results show that even in the context of a double income welfare state like Norway, there is a substantial wage penalty to motherhood. Ranging from 1.2 % during the first years for women with lower secondary education to 4.9 % for women with more than four years of higher education, motherhood wage penalties in Norway are lower than estimates found for the UK (Harkness and Waldfogel 2003b) and the US (Korenman and Neumark 1992; Budig and England 2001; Wilde et al. 2010), and comparable to estimates found for Germany (Harkness and Waldfogel 2003b) and Denmark (Nielsen et al. 2004), among others. Contrary to most other studies, we find a negative (though comparatively small) effect of having children of about .3 to .4 % on the hourly wages of men with middle length education. The wage penalty to motherhood is not explained when we include measures of experience, parental leave, working part time and sector of employment. The results indicate that Norwegian family policies protect mothers from adverse wage effects following a career break. We find evidence that changes in effort might be important for the explanation of a parenthood wage effect. As hypothesized, the wage effects to parenthood is larger for higher educational groups and for people working in the private sector, where we expected a change in effort to affect wages more.",23

Evidence from international survey research in Japan, the United States, China, and India",June 2016,Yoshihiko Kadoya,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Easing people’s concerns about growing old is one of the major challenges in social security research in the era of global aging. The causes of aging-related anxiety are often nebulous. This research cuts across different social contexts to investigate the reasons for anxiety about life after the age of 65 years. Population aging has become a major concern in many countries. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2006), the average ratio of people aged 65 and older to the population aged between 20 and 64 years (hereafter, the old-age dependency ratio) in OECD member nations is expected to increase from 22.9 % in 2000 to 46.3 % in 2040. This trend is expected to occur also in East Asia. The old-age dependency ratios in China, Thailand, and Indonesia are forecast to increase from about 10 % in 2000 to 40, 37, and 25 %, respectively, by 2040 (United Nations 2011). Furthermore, population aging will begin to affect even countries whose populations are growing, such as India. The old-age dependency ratio in India is expected to increase from about 10 % in 2000 to 17 % by 2040 (United Nations 2011). These trends may bring about, or exacerbate, serious social issues, including a shortage of labor and resources for necessary social services, such as long-term care that would eventually become necessary for substantially higher numbers of people. Anxiety produces a substantial burden on individual wellbeing. The constant state of anxiety could seriously affect quality of life by restricting daily activities and difficulty in sleeping (Hoffman et al. 2008). In a serious state, anxiety could also lead to depression, phobias, panic, and other psychological disorders. Furthermore, anxiety could lead to irrational thinking, like excessive health concerns, wrong beliefs, and social isolation. Usually, the middle-aged groups of populations make significant contribution to societies by their direct involvement in the workforce and via their experience. Anxiety could impede the ability of these groups of people to contribute to their societies. Anxiety has social implications alongside economic implications. It could affect family and social relationships, causing those affected to cease to act as active and responsible members of family and society. The direct cost of medical care from anxiety-related health problems and the indirect costs from the loss of productivity constitute the economic loss of this anxiety (Hoffman et al. 2008; Hu 2002). Overall, anxiety creates an economic burden and social imbalance in society. Therefore, it is natural for governments to be concerned about this problem. A critical aspect of this problem is that governments need to find efficient ways to ease people’s concerns about aging. To do so, they must first understand the causes of aging-related anxiety. Although social security systems help to lessen people’s anxieties, the resources available to develop such systems will become more and more limited as the old-age dependency ratio increases. Thus, social security systems need to focus their resources on the direct causes of people’s anxieties about growing old. The existing literature confirms the negative impact of income uncertainty on consumption. When future income is not certain, consumers tend to deviate from their consumption levels attained at permanent income levels. In line with this economic theory, it is possible that anxiety about old age, more specifically, the anxiety about future financial conditions, could have negative impacts on the economy through reduced consumption. Menegatti (2007) found evidence that income uncertainty negatively affects consumption decisions. To reduce such negative impacts on consumption, Menegatti (2007) emphasized the importance of precautionary savings. Analyzing household data in the United Kingdom, Dardanoni (1991) proved that future income uncertainty decreases consumption and increases people’s desires for precautionary savings, which negatively affects the national economy. Kazarosian (1997) and Carroll and Samwick (1998) endorsed this claim, using panel data on households in the United States. Social security, however, mitigates such negative effects by easing people’s concerns about their financial future. Engen and Gruber (2001) provided evidence that the development of an unemployment insurance system eases the degree of concern for the future and decreases the amount of precautionary savings. Starr-McCluer (1996) claimed that withholding health insurance increases people’s concerns about the future. All these findings point to the conclusion that it is important for governments to ease people’s anxieties about the future. It is noteworthy that middle-aged people are usually more concerned about old age than the old themselves are. A number of previous studies that have examined age differences in anxiety (e.g., Bland et al. 1998; Carta et al. 1991; Fichter et al. 1996; Jorm 2000; Weissman and Myers 1980) claim that people in their 40, 50, and early 60 s tend to be more anxious than those older than 65 years. Jorm (2000) explained that aging is associated with an intrinsic reduction of susceptibility to anxiety. Nonetheless, the anxieties of middle-aged people cannot be ignored, even though they may feel less anxious as they grow older. People in this age range are very important for the national economy, as they usually earn and spend more than other age groups. Moreover, they probably feel the most insecure owing to the current population trends that forecast an increase in the old-age dependency ratio. What makes people anxious about their old age is uncertain; multiple factors, including the status of people’s finances, families, and health, might be at work. A person’s financial status determines his/her ability to purchase the necessary long-term care when he/she becomes older and physically weak. Family status, and the ability or willingness of families to care for older family members, may influence aging-related uncertainty. Grossbard (2014) stated that altruism was not the only factor that affects in-family caregiving. Exchanges of work for money or inter-generational monetary transfers also play significant roles in family caregiving. As a result, people could be anxious about life after the age of 65 even though they live with family members. Health risk status almost surely influences people’s anxieties about old age, both in terms of fear of discomfort or death and in terms of increasing health care requirements. Furthermore, the measurement of all this uncertainty must be observable and exogenous in order to produce accurate data and to generate effective results (Browning and Lusardi 1996). Past literature has established the effects of social norms and cultural traits on the reporting of social anxiety. Most studies have used collectivism and individualism as a proxy for cultural traits to examine whether social anxiety differs significantly across countries with different cultural backgrounds. Hofstede (1984, 2001) studied how collectivism and individualism shape the behavior of people. Collectivist countries place high importance on group affiliation and harmony and less importance on individual gain. People from collectivist countries often are found to take care of their relatives and other group members in addition to their own family members. On the other hand, individualistic countries have weak social networks and place strong importance on individual achievements and success. Moreover, individualistic countries are found to be less tied with stringent social norms than collectivist countries (Argyle 1986). Thus, social norms and cultural traits, reflected in whether countries are either collectivist or individualistic, need to be examined to study people’s social concerns, like anxiety (Hofmann et al. 2010). East Asian countries, like Japan and China, are considered collectivist countries whereas western countries, like the United States, are considered individualistic countries (Hofstede 2001). Heinrichs et al. (2006) and Okazaki (1997) reported that collectivist countries have greater levels of social anxiety than individualistic countries. A related study by Norasakkunkit and Kalick (2009) studied the behavior of 127 Japanese and 126 American participants to establish the effect of cultural differences on social anxiety and well-being. The Japanese participants, who were influenced by collectivism, were found to be more prone to social anxiety than the American participants, who were influenced by individualism. However, this relationship held true only for anxiety and not for well-being. Thus, the findings of these studies suggest that anxiety about old age could be related to cultural norms and traits. Table 1 describes the differences in social contexts across Japan, the United States, China, and India. A very large portion of Japan’s entire population is aged, while Japan has an expensive pension scheme and a universal long-term care insurance system. By comparison, although a large portion of the United States’ entire population is also aged and covered by a comprehensive pension scheme, the long-term public care system is means-tested. The expectation is that China will shortly have a significant elderly population due to its long-standing one-child policy, yet its social security system is weak and underdeveloped. India’s social security system is also weak; however, the speed of change in its old-age dependency ratio is moderate because of its very large numbers of young people. In these circumstances, it is important to find the causes of anxiety about old age and to find the factors responsible for cross-country differences. To this end, this study conducts cross-country research to provide evidence on the causes of anxiety after the age of 65 years. To conduct the study, first, a questionnaire was designed to understand respondents’ degrees of anxiety regarding their lives after the age of 65, and to gather data on the possible determinants of such anxiety, such as the status of their finances, families, and health. The questionnaires were distributed to households in accordance with the protocols used to obtain census data. Second, the research spanned countries with different social contexts: Japan, the United States, China, and India. Since this is a cross-country analysis and regression models are used separately for each country, the results should provide evidence of the causes for old-age anxiety that are unaffected by the cultural differences of the countries. This study contributes to the existing literature in several ways. First, it provides new cross-country evidence for the causes of anxiety after the age of 65. Second, this study provides an opportunity to observe whether observed cultural differences in the sample countries affect the causes of older people’s anxiety. Third, the results of this study provide important implications for policymakers to improve their understanding about the lives of old people. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset and the data collection process in the sample countries. Section 3 presents the empirical models and results. Finally, Sects. 4, 5, and 6 present the policy implications, discussion, and conclusion, respectively.",10

Racial and ethnic differences in the relationship between pregnancy and life satisfaction in the United States,September 2016,Paul Hagstrom,Stephen Wu,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The economics literature provides no clear theories or predictions about the impact of pregnancy on life satisfaction. For some, becoming pregnant may bring personal value or respect from others. Edin and Kefalas (2005) suggest that having children may provide low-income youth with a sense of purpose and provide a turning point toward a better life. Deutsch (2001) argues that having children, particularly for married women, encourages the family to resolve differences. Alternatively, the “focusing illusion,” predicts that when people consider one particular aspect of their lives, they tend to overestimate its impact on their well-being. If this theory holds, women may overestimate the positive impact of having a child. Evidence of the focusing illusion has been found in the anticipation of marriage (Lucas et al. 2003), moving to a sunnier location (Schkade and Kahneman 1998), and increasing income (Kahneman et al. 2006). Powdthavee (2009, 2010) discusses the focusing illusion with respect to having children, while Clark et al. (2008) find that men and women report higher levels of life satisfaction the year before and the year after having a first child. Although pregnancy and life satisfaction would seem to be positively correlated for many women, for others the relationship may go in the opposite direction. For example, pregnancy and happiness may be negatively related if the pregnancy is unintended or if the timing of the pregnancy is problematic, for example while one is unemployed or in school. During pregnancy, a woman may also experience physical or emotional stress or anticipate financial difficulties in raising a child. The degree of such difficulties may depend on one’s relationship status or the depth of one’s emotional support network. Racial disparities in birth outcomes, stress, depression, and risky behaviors during pregnancy may be due to the pregnancy itself or may be explained by other socioeconomic factors such as income levels and education. In our empirical analysis, we specifically examine the degree to which race and ethnicity play a significant role in the relationship between pregnancy and well-being. For example, race and ethnicity are correlated with income. Those who are in lower income groups may be less able to afford the financial costs of an additional child, and the anticipation of this economic strain may result in diminished life satisfaction. Also, the average maternal age at births and at first births varies across racial and ethnic groups and younger mothers may be less equipped to care for their children. Furthermore, out-of-wedlock and unintended pregnancies are more common for minorities than for whites (Kost et al. 2012; Delhendorf et al. 2013). Limited social support from the father may decrease the probability that pregnancy increases life satisfaction. In a clinical study of black-white difference in the quality of life during early pregnancy, Liu et al. (2013) find that black mothers reported a lesser degree of social support by a spouse, boyfriend or significant other, a factor that significantly lowered measures of health related quality of life outcomes relative to white mothers. Similarly, O’Hara (2009) reports strained marital relationships, childcare-related stressors, insufficient social support, and lower socioeconomic status, all of which were reported during pregnancy, contribute to postpartum depression.",5

These findings in the American context raise the following question: what have been the effects of the Japanese government’s approval of OC? Unlike in other developed countries, physicians in Japan could not legally prescribe low-dose hormonal pills for family planning purposes until 1999.Footnote 1 In contrast to the rapid diffusion of OC in the United States that occurred once women were granted legal access to it, the diffusion of OC among Japanese women has been slow since the legalization of low-dose OC. Specifically, according to a report by the United Nations, only 1 % of married (or in-union) women aged 15–49 use OC in Japan, compared to 16.8 % in North America and 45.5 % in Western Europe (United Nations 2011). Additionally, in 2005 the percentage of pill users is 1.4 % among sexually active Japanese women aged 18–34 who have never been married (Kaneko et al. 2008). The remarks by Junichiro Koizumi quoted above represent the negative attitudes of Japanese politicians and mass media toward OC. Additionally, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare argued that the pill may encourage promiscuity and lower sexual morality by allowing women to have multiple sexual partners without the risk of pregnancy (Hollander 2006). While these views could certainly be related to low OC use, it is unclear how they affect Japanese women’s preferences and perceptions regarding contraceptive methods. Prior studies find that the most common reason given by Japanese women for not using OC is their concern about side effects (Matsumoto et al. 2011; Suga and Kitamura 2009). In particular, 50 % of Japanese women who have never used OC cite this concern, compared to only 25 and 17 % of their American and French counterparts, respectively (Matsumoto et al. 2011). Nevertheless, the relative importance of this particular concern in Japanese women’s contraceptive choice has not been examined. This study examines determinants of Japanese women’s choice of contraceptive method based on an online survey conducted in 2010, approximately 10 years after the legalization of low-dose OC. The Japanese context offers a unique setting in which a birth control technology became available after it had been widely adopted in other countries and evidence of its efficacy and safety had been collected. To my knowledge, no other studies estimate a regression model of contraceptive choice using Japanese data before or after OC approval.Footnote 2 I examine women’s demographic and socioeconomic characteristics as possible determinants of contraceptive choice; I also include their subjective beliefs regarding the pros and cons of each contraceptive method as explanatory variables, following Delavande (2008). My empirical analysis (1) uncovers the characteristics of OC adopters and (2) examines possible reasons for the slow diffusion of OC in Japan. With respect to (1), the impact of OC approval depends not only on the prevalence of OC use but also on the characteristics of new OC users. In particular, if women with a higher risk of unintended pregnancy use OC, the impact on abortions and/or unplanned childbirths could be greater. Similarly, if OC use is more prevalent among women who incur greater losses in career opportunities due to unintended childbirth, legal access to OC could have a greater impact on career choices and participation of women in the labor market. While this study does not test causal effects of OC approval on unintended birth or on women’s lifestyle, characteristics of OC users identified in this study provide important inferences on these issues. Regarding (2), I suggest how observed differences between users and non-users of OC among Japanese women might contribute to low OC use, although this approach does not allow me to examine potential explanatory factors that vary greatly across countries but that are largely uniform within Japan.Footnote 3

Vargas,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The bulk of research on the integration of immigrants to the US economy has primarily focused on the labor market assimilation process and how it is determined by country of origin and the number of years since migration. In this paper, I study how the time Mexican immigrants devote to market work, household production, personal care, and leisure activities change with duration of US residence. I perform this analysis from a household production framework that examines time allocation as a decision that incorporates information not only about the individual, but also the family context in which this decision takes place. In the immigrant assimilation literature, four main theoretical explanations have been proposed to explain the observed labor force participation patterns of immigrants that consider the role of the family (Baker and Benjamin 1997; Blau et al. 2003). First, there is a simple price model in which differences in the relative wages and assets of wives and husbands across immigrant and native families determine the initial immigrant native difference in the household division of labor. Within this framework, the observed labor-supply patterns of immigrant couples reflect responses to changes in each spouse wages relative to their marginal productivities in the household. A second explanation is the family investment model. In this framework, one member of the couple increases instantly his/her labor supply in a job that offers relatively high initial wages but little future growth to allow the spouse to invest in human capital and benefit from his or her higher earning position later on. This high labor force participation decreases in later years because the job he/she took upon arrival offers little opportunities for advancement. Correspondingly, the spouse works few hours upon arrival to allow time for human capital accumulation and gradually increases his/her position in the labor market. A third explanation is the individual investment theory, in which both spouses earn and work less than comparable natives upon arrival to devote time to invest in their own human capital. As their American experience accumulates, both husbands and wives gradually incorporate to the labor market eventually overtaking the labor supply of comparable natives. The fourth explanation is immigrant-native differences in preferences. In this scenario, differences in the labor supply of immigrant couples at the time of arrival arise from corresponding differences in social norms regarding the household division of labor between the countries of origin and destination. In this context, acculturation, described as the process by which individuals adopt the behaviors and attitudes of the dominant culture, is one of the mechanisms underlying the link between duration of residence and the time allocation patterns of immigrant couples. The empirical literature in this area has found that the pattern of assimilation depends on the composition of the immigrant group and conditions in the receiving country. Duleep and Sanders (1993) find evidence of family investment among Asian immigrant couples in the US. Their study suggests that the rapid assimilation observed among immigrant husbands is associated with a high labor force participation of immigrant wives in the early years upon arrival to the US. Later on, Baker and Benjamin (1997) test the prevalence of family investment among immigrants to Canada. They attribute early low employment levels among immigrant husbands and a steady increase with years in the country as evidence of initial investment in human capital. Their wives, on the other hand, exhibit high employment levels upon arrival and a later decline relative to comparable natives. In addition, Baker and Benjamin (1997) test and reject the explanation of immigrant-native differences in preferences by examining the variation in earnings and hours profiles across families that differ by the immigrant status of the husband or the wife. Subsequently, Blau et al. (2003) revisit the assimilation profiles of immigrants to the US as a collective labor market decision taken between spouses. They account for the spouse’s and own immigration history and find evidence that disputes the earlier results in support of the family investment theory for Canada and the US. In particular, they find that both immigrant husbands and wives, in the same degree, work less and earn less than comparable natives upon arrival to the US, but gradually overtake comparable natives as their years since migration increase. They interpret these findings as evidence in support of the individual investment theory. Both Baker and Benjamin (1997) and Blau et al. (2003) reject the simple price model because it would require implausible large labor supply elasticities to explain the immigrants’ assimilation profiles in hours and wages. More recently, Vargas (2013) uses the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to look at the time allocation trajectories of Hispanic immigrant couples from 21 Latin-American countries and finds that Hispanic immigrant husbands and wives gradually increase their paid work as they spend more time in the US, but this increase is significantly more pronounced among women. These findings suggest that both immigrant spouses in the US seem to invest primarily in their own human capital and are not consistent with the family investment model. A related study by Hamermesh and Trejo (2012) analyzes immigrants’ time use outside the household production framework. They derive a theory of the process of assimilation based on the notion that assimilating activities entail a daily fixed cost. Their theory predicts that immigrants will be less likely than natives to undertake assimilating activities, but conditional on undertaking them, immigrants will spend more time on them than natives. They identify education, shopping, and market work as assimilating activities and employ time use data from the US and Australia to test the implications of their model. They find that their theoretical predictions are strongly supported by the data and that the fixed costs for assimilating activities are higher for immigrants with poor language skills or who originate in less developed countries. Blau et al. (2003) also find behavioral differences associated with country of origin. For example, they find that for some cohorts of Central American immigrants, husbands and wives worked more or earned more on arrival than comparable natives, while in other cohorts, they earned or worked less. In fact, previous studies have found significant differences in socioeconomic status and migration patterns within the Hispanic population (e.g. Winkleby and Cubbin 2004). This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing, from a gender and marital status perspective, the effect of duration of residence in the US on the overall time allocations of Mexican immigrants, while identifying which of the four main theoretical explanations that consider the role of the family best fit their observed patterns of time use. In particular, I study how immigrants allocate the 24 h available in a day to market work, household production, personal care, leisure, and other activities not elsewhere classified; and examine how this time allocation changes with years since migration. I do this analysis using five different categories of US-natives as reference groups, to account for the diversity of the US population. To my knowledge, this comprehensive study of the overall allocations of time of immigrants and how they depend on their gender, marital status, and duration of US residence, is something that has not been done before in the literature and helps elucidate how well immigrants balance work, family, and personal time, an important element that affects their quality of life. Because changes in the countries of origin of immigrants over time might generate changes in unmeasured characteristics across immigration cohorts, studies that use the overall immigrant population, and do not control for cohort of arrival effects, might produce biased estimates of the effect of duration of residence on the time allocations of immigrants. This problem might be mitigated by concentrating on a single immigrant group. For this reason, I focus on Mexican immigrants, a large and growing segment of the US population. There are 11.7 million Mexican immigrants living in the US, making Mexico the source country of nearly a third of the US foreign-born population and two-thirds of all foreign-born Hispanic people (Motel and Patten 2013). In fact, understanding how such a large share of the population balances work, family, and personal time, and how this balance changes over the course of the immigrants stay in the US, has important repercussions not only on their physical and economic well-being, but also on that of their families and the areas they live. This type of analysis can also help improve policy-making in a wide variety of public assistance programs, aimed at this often marginalized segment of the US population. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The second section describes the data I use for this study and presents some unadjusted comparisons of the patterns of time use of immigrants and natives. The third section compares the time allocations of these groups while adjusting for differences in their socio-economic characteristics. The fourth section discusses the implication of my results, and the fifth section concludes.",10

Yaya,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Approximately 43 million immigrants or 14 % of the US population makes the US the single largest country of destination in the world.Footnote 1 Immigrants are an important source of population growth; the high-skilled ones add to the country’s overall productivity, and their incomes contribute to the private sector consumption and to the public sector tax receipts. These high-skilled immigrants are also less likely to be unemployed (Greenwood and McDowell 2011). However, the declining skill level of immigrants and the return of high-skilled immigrants to their source countries following the great recession of 2009 are seen as the major hurdles that policymakers face today. In addition to the presence of eleven million illegal immigrants, most blame the broken immigration system. In order to address these problems related to immigrants, the president has been promoting an immigration reform bill. This reform bill promises to strengthen border security, cracking down on firms that hire illegal immigrants, while creating a path to earned citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The bill also has provisions to encourage immigrants to integrate into their local communities. As this provision suggests, the policymakers are very interested in the adaptation process of immigrants. Many published studies have examined the integration process of immigrants. These studies examine income, education, language use, investment, and health insurance preferences as proxies of adaptation. Labor market outcomes such as employment, wages, and income are generally accepted as the economic assimilation proxies, while language use, marital status, and family structure are the proxies for social assimilation. Finally, the naturalization rates and voting behavior of immigrants are regarded as civic adaptation proxies.Footnote 2 For instance, Chiswick (1978) and Borjas (1985) both used earnings as proxies of economic adaptation to the host country in the discussion of their immigrant adaptation hypothesis (IAH), while Amuedo-Dorantes and De La Rica (2007) considered occupational upward mobility as proxies of economic adaptation.Footnote 3 Furthermore, Meng and Gregory (2005) analyzed the role of intermarriage between immigrants and natives on the assimilation of immigrants. Su et al. (2010) examined the cultural assimilation of Mexican Americans in terms of the division of labor at home and women’s participation in politics. Their results suggested that Mexican Americans do not assimilate into the US mainstream rapidly, and assimilation is most significantly observed within the third generation. Dubuc (2012), on the other hand, studied the adaptation of immigrant women in the United Kingdom. The author used the fertility of immigrants as a proxy of assimilation and showed the reduction of ethnic fertility differentials over several generations in the UK. Inequality, on the other hand, can be defined as the attainment differences between individuals in a population. Andrews and Leigh (2009) showed that individuals in societies with high inequality find it much harder to change their position in the social hierarchy. Most of the earlier studies in the literature that have examined income inequality differences among immigrants and natives are descriptive in nature and do not address the issue of adaptation. Moore and Pacey (2003) identified significant differences between the characteristics of immigrants and natives in Canada. Their findings suggested that most of the observed inequality was due to income dispersion within each group in Canada. Basavarajappa (2000) examined the older immigrants in Canada and found that immigrants as a group have roughly the same income distribution as their Canadian-born counterparts; however, income distribution within the immigrant subgroups differs considerably. Hoover and Yaya (2010) examined the gender differences within the income inequality of immigrants in the U.S. and showed that income inequality is much higher within female immigrants compared to males. It should be noted that these immigration studies did not provide substantial discussion on the adaptation process of immigrants. Furthermore, unlike the current study, most of these studies did not extend to specific immigrant groups from different regions or countries of birth; hence they did not address the heterogeneity of immigrants. Interestingly, for the most part, adaptation and assimilation were viewed as individualistic rather than community-based processes in the literature. However, Hatton and Leigh (2011) recently showed that immigrants integrate into the host country as communities, not as individuals; hence, within-group characteristics rather than individual characteristics play an important role in their level of adaptation. Following Hatton and Leigh’s assertion of community-based adaptation, this paper proposes to add another dimension to the host of adaptation proxies that reflects a specific community-based characteristic. The paper asserts that within-group inequality can be used as a proxy of how much an immigrant group adapted to the host country. In other words, the paper argues that immigrant groups that exhibit similar income and education distributions to those of the natives in the host country can be regarded as groups that are well adapted, while those who exhibit vastly different distributions should be considered as groups with limited adaptation. No other studies have extended the community-based adaptation theory to the inequality literature. The present study is one of the first to apply Hatton and Leigh’s community-based adaptation model. The paper presents evidence on three distinct areas that are closely related to the inequality and adaptation of immigrants. First, it provides a brief comparison of the income and educational inequality characteristics of immigrants to and natives of the United States. Next, it illustrates descriptive inequality statistics within immigrant subgroups based on their world regions and countries of origin. Finally, the paper examines the determinants of within-group inequality in immigrant subgroups based on the country of origin using cross-section regression analysis. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section two presents the data, and section three presents inequality characteristics of immigrants. Section four contains the model specifications, section five presents the empirical results on immigrant subgroups, and section six concludes.",1
14.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,12 April 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-015-9294-9,Intergenerational transmission of education among female immigrants,September 2016,Susan Niknami,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"An enormous body of research has investigated the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status (see reviews by Solon 1999; Black and Devereux 2011). The interest is motivated by the notion that poverty may be passed on from parents to their children, which violates norms of equal opportunities. In this context, Sweden is often cited as a pioneer country with its very low level of intergenerational correlation (e.g. Björklund and Jäntti 1997; Solon 2002). It has, however, recently been shown that the low transmission rate does not apply to the entire Swedish population. Hammarstedt and Palme (2012) find that immigrant men are facing a higher persistence than native men. This finding partly confirms the concerns raised in the policy debate, that second generation immigrants may inherit the disadvantages faced by their parents (e.g. Borjas 1994; D’Addio 2007). There is still, however, limited knowledge about the intergenerational transmission patterns among female immigrants. This paper uses comprehensive register data of more than 34,000 daughters with a foreign background to describe the patterns of intergenerational correlation in education among female immigrants in Sweden. While Sweden is often considered to be one of the countries where women enjoy the most equal access to education and the labor market, the country at the same time has one of the largest disparities in labor market outcomes between immigrants and natives, with immigrant women being the most socioeconomically deprived group (e.g. Bekhouch et al. 2013; OECD 2007a). Immigrant women on average have fewer years of schooling as well as lower earnings and labor force participation rates compared to the rest of the population (see e.g. Adsera and Chiswick 2007; Wadensjö 1997). If this disadvantage is transferred from mothers to daughters it may not only contribute to reinforcing pre-existing immigrant-to-native gaps in the labor market but also increase the gender gap in the society. Although an increasing number of studies has documented the intergenerational correlation in earnings and education among immigrants there are surprisingly few studies on immigrant women.Footnote 1 Borjas (1992) estimates the transmission of earnings from immigrant fathers to sons in the U.S. and find that it is slightly weaker than that of the overall population (cf. Björklund and Jäntti 1997). Card et al. (2000) analyze the earnings transmission from immigrant fathers to both sons and daughters in the U.S. and report weak associations. Aydemir et al. (2009) also examine the transmission from fathers to sons and daughters using Canadian data. They find similar patterns for immigrant and native sons, but a weaker association among immigrant daughters. Dustmann (2005) describes the earnings transmission from fathers to sons in Germany and shows that the link is stronger within the immigrant population. For Sweden, Österberg (2000) finds similar earnings estimates for immigrant and native men while Hammarstedt and Palme (2012) report a stronger relationship between immigrant fathers and sons. For mothers and daughters, Österberg (2000) finds a slightly larger earnings transmission rate among immigrants while Hammarstedt (2009) reports regression towards the native mean. The disproportionate focus on fathers and sons in the intergenerational earnings literature stem partly from the concern that a woman’s earnings may not be a reliable indicator of her socioeconomic status since women tend to participate only intermittently in the labor market. Measuring the intergenerational earnings transmission within the immigrant population is further challenging since the pre-migration earnings history is unknown. It is therefore difficult to compute lifetime earnings and the estimates will consequently be plagued by life-cycle bias (Haider and Solon 2006). In this sense, education has advantages over earnings as the measure is not subject to labor force participation decisions, available relatively early in life and stable over the life-cycle. Education is also highly interesting to study in its own right since it not only is a key determinant for access to and success in the labor market but also as it has been shown to be a good proxy for overall well-being (Lleras-Muney 2005; Oreopoulos and Salvanes 2011). Studies that examine the transmission of education tend to find a weak relationship between immigrant fathers and their sons (for Canada: Aydemir et al. 2013, for Germany: Dustmann 2005, for Sweden: Eriksson 2006, for the U.S.: Borjas 1992 and Card et al. 2000). Gang and Zimmerman (2000) instead analyze the patterns of transmission for immigrant children without separating the effects of sons and daughters and also find a lower intergenerational transmission compared to native Germans. There is only one study that explicitly analyzes the patterns of educational transmission from mothers to daughters within the immigrant population. Aydemir et al. (2013) report a much lower intergenerational transmission rate among female immigrants compared to female native Canadians.Footnote 2
 This paper adds to the existing literature by being one of few studies to analyze the intergenerational correlation patterns among female immigrants. While past studies relied heavily on data with few observations, high non-response rates and in some cases have been unable to directly link children to their parents (e.g. Card et al. 2000), this study uses individual register data on the entire population of foreign born mothers and their biological daughters. The comprehensive data increase the statistical precision and reduce the risk of measurement errors in daughters’ years of schooling. Problems associated with measurement errors in maternal education are nevertheless addressed separately in the paper. Although measurement error is one of the most fundamental methodological concerns in the intergenerational earnings literature the issue has not been recognized in the intergenerational education literature. The reason seems to be that most studies take for granted that immigrant education is measured without error. Yet, education is likely to be erroneously measured as most immigrants attained their highest education in their country of origin. Another contribution is that the present paper explores the role of nonlinearities. Comparing the degree of intergenerational transmission across different populations may say little about the true opportunities that the groups face, since any differences could simply be generated by the fact that the groups belong to different parts of the distribution. Knowledge of whether the link is nonlinear further provides important information about the true socioeconomic opportunities faced by individuals with a disadvantaged background. In particular, we want to know whether daughters of low educated mothers face a higher risk of becoming low educated themselves. The results suggest that the intergenerational transmission is lower among daughters of foreign born mothers compared to daughters with a native background. My results also reveal that the intergenerational relationship in education is nonlinear. Both for immigrants and natives, the transmission is weaker among daughters of poorly educated mothers. The large-sized data enables me to divide the data into 38 sub-groups to explore whether the pattern differ across geographical origins. I find large variations across different immigrant groups, which are partly explained by the first generation’s position in the educational distribution. Measurement errors in immigrants’ years of schooling do not appear to drive these patterns. The structure of the paper is as follows. In the next section, I give a brief background to immigration to Sweden. Section 3 describes the conceptual framework and Sect. 4 presents the data. The empirical results are presented in Sect. 5, followed by a discussion on different aspects and implications of the main results as well as concluding remarks in Sect. 6.",3
14.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,03 May 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-015-9296-7,Is caring for older parents detrimental to women’s mental health? The role of the European North–South gradient,December 2016,Elenka Brenna,Cinzia Di Novi,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Over the last few decades, the simultaneous decrease in mortality and fertility rates has induced a progressive ageing of the European population. Declining birth rates have reduced the consistency of the cohorts of young generations, while growing life expectancy has caused the age in which people die to rise. The percentage of people over sixty-five is higher in Europe than in any other continent and the ageing phenomenon is a problem that will make itself felt for the rest of the century. Forecasts for European demographics show that, by 2060, half the population of the EU-27 countries will be over fifty, while over-65-year-olds will increase from the current value of 17.4 to 30 % (Eurostat 2010). The ageing of the population and the greater longevity of individuals will lead to increasing numbers of older persons in need of long-term care. This need is partly met by formal care (e.g. medical doctors, nurses) either at home or in purpose-built structures (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes). Frequently, however, eldercare is provided by informal caregivers, typically women, who devote part of their time to assist their needy relative and who, in the collective view, are regarded as better suited to taking on home and family responsibilities (Davey and Patsios 1999; Mortensen et al. 2004; Di Novi et al. 2015; Carrieri et al. 2014; Kalwij et al. 2014). This is especially the case in the Southern European countries, commonly referred to as “strong family-ties countries” in contrast to the “weak family-ties countries” of Northern Europe. Mediterranean societies have traditionally been based on family unity and on an intra-generational pact of reciprocity, due both to cultural background and inadequacies in the institutional settings, two factors that are strictly related to each other (Reher 1998; Billari 2004; EOP 2010). The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of constant caring for older parents (biological parents, parents in law and step-parents) on the self-assessed mental health of women between the ages of 50 and 75, living in different European countries. In spite of the changing gender attitudes and the rapid entry of women into the labour force over the past decades, women continue to play a major role in running the household and giving care to family members, as the previous literature on the traditional roles of women in Europe suggests. Women are therefore more exposed than men to the stress generated by informal caregiving. Furthermore, as the literature shows (Silverstein et al. 2006; Bookwala 2009; El Habhoubi 2012), men react differently than women to stressful experiences, and provide informal care in forms that are different from women. For these reasons, this paper focuses on women and on the effects of informal caregiving on their mental health. The possible effect of the provision of informal care on daughters’ mental health status is measured by the EURO-D scale, a symptom-oriented instrument measuring depression. The empirical investigation is performed using a representative sample drawn from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) survey. Our paper contributes to previous literature by exploring the relationship between informal caregiving and mental health according to a North–South gradient. To this aim, we cluster the different countries into three macro regions, namely Northern, Central and Southern Europe. This subdivision reflects social and cultural factors that historically have influenced the role of the family as a provider of care, with Northern countries designed as “non-family centred societies” and Mediterranean countries characterised by strong family ties (Reher 1998). Since the family role, per se, is not enough to clearly identify different care regime clusters, we referred to two additional parameters: the amount of resources destined by each country to Long Term Care (LTC) and the different eldercare policies across European countries considered in the sample. In order to account for potential endogeneity due to self-selection in the relationship between the provision of informal care and the informal caregivers’ mental health, we matched each informal caregiver with a non-caregiver on each characteristic known to be associated with a caregiver’s condition and mental health (Caliendo and Kopeinig 2008). In our analysis, we performed this matching by using propensity score, as formalized by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983). The perceived mental health of matched individuals was then compared to estimate the average effect of being an informal caregiver. Our results, robust under different specifications of the propensity score model, reveal a clear North–South gradient: the provision of informal care has a negative and significant impact on daughters’ mental health in the Mediterranean countries where support to the elderly comes mainly from family members and welfare policies are not sufficient to cover ageing population needs. These findings may be interesting from a policy standpoint, inasmuch as the health effect and time burden of caregiving translate into larger wealth effects, which may include higher health expenses for the caregivers, early retirement or job interruption (Coe and Van Houtven 2009). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents a review of the literature on caregiving and mental health; Sect. 3 describes the data and the structure of the Northern, Continental and Southern sub-samples; Sect. 4 illustrates the empirical model, while the results are presented and debated in Sect. 5. Concluding remarks are reported in Sect. 6.",43
14.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,06 May 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9333-1,The “Costs” of informal care: an analysis of the impact of elderly care on caregivers’ subjective well-being in Japan,December 2016,Yoko Niimi,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The importance of informal elderly care has increasingly become recognized as population aging has rapidly progressed in recent decades. While informal elderly care is sometimes perceived as a cost-saving arrangement as it helps reduce the need for formal care, it is important to take into account the impact of caregiving on caregivers’ life when assessing the costs and benefits of informal elderly care. Ignoring such effects might lead to an underestimation of the cost of relying on family members to provide care to the elderly. There is indeed a growing literature that examines the impact of informal elderly care on caregivers’ employment, physical and mental health, and social and marital life.Footnote 1 While subjective well-being, such as life satisfaction and happiness, has often been suggested as an important indicator to assess people’s well-being in recent years (e.g., Layard 2005; Stiglitz et al. 2009), existing work on the effect of informal elderly care on caregivers’ subjective well-being remains relatively limited.Footnote 2 Moreover, the literature provides inconclusive results and suggests heterogeneous effects depending, for example, on the gender of the caregiver, the relationship between the caregiver and the care recipient, and whether the caregiver lives with the care recipient (e.g., Hansen et al. 2013; Van den Berg and Ferrer-i-Carbonell 2007). This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature and to contribute to broadening our understanding of the impact of informal elderly care on caregivers’ subjective well-being. The paper focuses its analysis on the experience of Japan mainly for two reasons. First, in the case of Japan, while there have been a number of empirical studies that look at the effect of informal elderly care on, among others, caregivers’ mental health and psychological well-being (e.g., Kumamoto et al. 2006; Oshio 2014, 2015; Sugihara et al. 2004) and labor force participation (e.g., Kan and Kajitani 2014; Sakai and Sato 2007; Shimizutani et al. 2008; Sugawara and Nakamura 2014), there has not been any previous work that analyzes the effect of providing elderly care on caregivers’ happiness, to the best of the author’s knowledge. It would be interesting to see whether or not previous findings obtained for other advanced economies hold in the case of Japan where filial obligation remains relatively strong and caring for elderly parents has therefore traditionally taken place within the family setting. Second, while Japan’s long-term care insurance (LTCI) system introduced in 2000 does not provide cash allowances for informal care, it covers the cost of services availed from the formal sector. As a result, a large demand for formal care services has been generated and new markets for various services, such as home care, day care, and short-stay care services, have emerged with the introduction of the LTCI system (Sugawara and Nakamura 2014). This differentiates Japan from most other developed countries where permanent institutional care tends to be the major formal care option and/or market volumes are relatively limited even if markets for home care services exist (Sugawara and Nakamura 2014). It would thus be interesting to examine whether the use of such formal care services can help mitigate or alleviate the adverse effect of informal elderly care on caregivers’ subjective well-being by looking at the case of Japan. This is a valid question given that the negative effect of providing care to the elderly on caregivers’ subjective well-being may increase the risk of the institutionalization of care recipients, which would have an important cost implication for the government. The key hypotheses that this paper will test using data on Japan are as follows: (1) providing care to the elderly negatively affects caregivers’ happiness; and (2) the extent to which informal elderly care affects caregivers’ happiness depends on, among others, the marital status of caregivers, the caregiver–care recipient relationship, and caregiving conditions. The latter includes living arrangements, the use of formal care services, and whether or not the caregiver has received any inter vivos transfers or financial support from his/her parents or parents-in-law. The results of such an analysis will provide a useful dimension that policymakers should take into account as part of the assessment of the cost of informal elderly care. The findings will also shed light on what measures would be effective in sustaining the provision of informal elderly care without incurring an excessive burden on caregivers. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of elderly care in Japan. Section 3 reviews the literature on the impact of informal elderly care on caregivers’ subjective well-being. Section 4 discusses the econometric methodology, the data, and the empirical variables used for the estimation. Estimation results are presented in Sect. 5. Section 6 summarizes the key findings and discusses some policy implications.",18

Katharina Spiess,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Increasing the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding has been identified as an important public health goal for a number of reasons (e.g., Rubin 2013): breastfeeding is assumed to reduce the risk of infections and obesity in children and to improve their cognitive and emotional development (Belfield and Kelly 2012; Anderson et al. 1999; Borra et al. 2012; Kramer et al. 2008; Del Bono and Rabe 2012; McCrory and Layte 2012; Fitzsimons and Vera-Hernandez 2013).Footnote 1 On average, breastfeeding is related to more time spent in emotional care for the child than other forms of feeding (Smith and Ellwood 2011). Breastfeeding is also associated with positive mental health effects and a reduced risk of breast cancer in mothers (e.g., Del Bono and Rabe 2012; Beral et al. 2002). Breast milk is the recommended source of nutrition for newborn children for at least the first 6 months of life (World Health Organization and UNICEF 2003). However, breastfeeding may make it more difficult for mothers to return to the labor market soon after childbirth (e.g., Kobayashi and Usui 2014; Roe et al. 1999; Berger et al. 2005; Ogbuanu et al. 2011). Maternity and parental leave provisions have been developed to mitigate this conflict. Some empirical studies show that the duration of maternity and parental leave is associated with improved child health and development (Ruhm 2000; Tanaka 2005; Waldfogel et al. 2002; Carneiro et al. 2011) while others report no significant association if parental leave extends beyond the first year of a child’s life (Rasmussen 2010; Liu and Skans Oskar 2010; Dustmann and Schönberg 2012). Although it is assumed that the positive effects of parental leave provisions identified within the first year are partly a result of breastfeeding, very little research to date has focused directly on the relationship between breastfeeding and parental leave mandates. This includes studies by Baker and Milligan (2008) and Huang and Yang (2015), who estimate a positive impact of parental leave entitlements and benefits on breastfeeding in Canada and California (USA). As in the above-mentioned two studies, this direct relationship is also addressed in the present paper: we examine whether a recent parental leave benefit reform had an impact on breastfeeding initiation and duration in Germany. In 2007, Germany passed a reform that created a new parental leave benefit (Elterngeld) and changed the amount of money provided to parents, the proportion of parents considered eligible, and the maximum benefit duration. We use the reform as an exogenous policy variation to obtain causal evidence on breastfeeding behavior, applying a difference-in-differences approach. The new parental leave reform did not bring changes in the first year of a child’s life for all new parents. We utilize these differences in the impact of the reform on new parents to identify a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group—mothers who benefited from the reform because they are eligible for a higher benefit after the reform than before—consists of mothers who were employed prior to pregnancy as well as mothers with an annual household income above the entitlement thresholds of the pre-reform parental leave benefit scheme. The control group—mothers for whom the reform did not bring much change in the first year—consists of mothers who were not in employment prior to pregnancy and an annual household income below the entitlement thresholds of the pre-reform parental leave benefit scheme. The parental leave reform of 2007 aimed at reducing possible income losses in the first year of a child’s life due to child-related maternal employment interruptions. This reform replaced the previous means-tested child-rearing benefit (Erziehungsgeld) by a parental leave benefit (Elterngeld) of 67 % of the pre-birth net income of the parent taking leave in the first year following childbirth (e.g., Spiess and Wrohlich 2008). It sought to increase both parents’ economic independence by reducing the maximum benefit period from two years to one and thus increasing the incentives for lower income mothers to return to the labor market earlier. The reform also aimed at encouraging fathers in particular to take part in childcare by introducing two additional “partner months.” With the expansion of the benefit in the first year, the reform aimed at creating a protected phase (Schonraum) during the first 12 months of a child’s life, as it has been shown that this period is particularly important for the interaction between parents and children and thus for child development in general (Deutscher Bundestag 2006; Bujard 2013). By lowering the pressure to return to the labor market in the first year after birth, the earnings-related benefit allows parents to maintain a relatively constant standard of living—especially those who would not have benefited under the old system, i.e., mothers (and fathers) with incomes above the established threshold. Empirical research has shown that this major goal of the reform has been achieved: more parents (mostly mothers) now stay at home longer during the first year of their child’s life (Spiess and Wrohlich 2008; Kluve and Tamm 2013; Wrohlich et al. 2012a). In the present paper, we address the question whether this new trend is related to an increase in breastfeeding probability and duration, which would indicate that there is a direct reform effect on breastfeeding. While rates of breastfeeding at birth have increased in the past few decades and are generally relatively high in Germany (about 80–90 %) compared to other countries, it has also been reported that breastfeeding rates in Germany decline sharply in the first few months after childbirth (Kersting and Dulon 2002; Lange et al. 2007; Dulon et al. 2001). Therefore, the question to be addressed is whether the reform in 2007 changed that trend. We provide the first empirical evidence of the effect of parental leave on breastfeeding for Germany, which is a country with a much more generous family policy regime than the US or Canada—the countries that have been the focus of previous studies analyzing the effects of parental leave reforms on breastfeeding (Baker and Milligan 2008; Huang and Yang 2015). As the German reform has not changed the entitlement to parental leave with respect to job protection, we can isolate the effect of a change in the size and duration of a parental leave benefit on breastfeeding from an effect of a longer leave period without benefits but with job security. This is another added value of the present study since this aspect has not been addressed in previous studies. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, previous findings on the conflict between maternal employment and breastfeeding are discussed. The German context is presented, including a more detailed description of the parental leave reform evaluated. Common findings on breastfeeding in Germany and potential impacts of the reform on breastfeeding are also discussed. The data and estimation strategy are presented, followed by a description of the main findings. Additionally, several sensitivity checks of our findings are presented. The paper concludes with an overall discussion of the findings.",17
14.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,17 February 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9326-0,The effects of teenage childbearing on long-term health in the US: a twin-fixed-effects approach,December 2016,Pınar Mine Güneş,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Teenage childbearing is a public policy concern, especially in countries with high teen birth rates, such as the United States.Footnote 1 Despite a decline in teen birth rates since 1990s (around 39 in 2009), the rates in the US are still high compared to other developed countries (Kearney and Levine 2012). Among the general public and policy makers, it is widely believed that teenage childbearing is a primary driver of poverty, leading to numerous adverse economic, educational, and health, consequences for mothers and their children.Footnote 2 However, with respect to empirical evidence, there exists several gaps in understanding the links between teenage childbearing and these adverse outcomes. Early studies document that teen mothers are more likely to have less education, lower earnings, and to be welfare dependent, and are less likely to participate in the labor force. However, more recent and rigorous research does not support that teen childbearing has a causal impact on economic and educational outcomes. (For a survey of the literature, see Kearney and Levine 2012.) Rather than early childbearing causing adverse outcomes, it appears that the socioeconomic background and contextual factors are responsible for early childbearing.Footnote 3 Despite the recent attention in the literature, there are few studies examining the effects of teenage childbearing on health and health behaviors of mothers. In particular, the question of whether there are effects on health has yet to be explored.Footnote 4
 The observed relationships between teenage childbearing and adverse health might be the result of underlying differences between teen and non-teen mothers (Kearney and Levine 2012). For instance, women with disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to be teen mothers and to experience adverse outcomes even without a child as a teen. In order to address the problem of endogeneity of teenage childbearing on various outcomes, previous studies have used within-family estimations using data on pairs of sisters (Geronimus and Korenman 1992; Holmlund 2005), instrumental variables (IV) using twin births and miscarriage as instruments (Klepinger et al. 1999; Bronars and Grogger 1993; Hotz et al. 2005), and propensity score matching (Chevalier and Viitanen 2003). There is a small literature on the causal effects on health behaviors of mothers. Webbink et al. (2008) employ the within-family approach, using a sample of Australian twins and their relatives, and find that teenage childbearing leads to adverse health behaviors. However, Fletcher (2012) shows that teenage childbearing has negligible effects on health behaviors of mothers in the US using both within-family (sibling differences) and IV approaches (miscarriage as the instrument). This paper estimates the effect of teenage childbearing (before the age of 20) on long-term health and health behaviors of mothers (aged 25–74 in the US in 1995/1996), using a nationally representative sample of twins as well as siblings from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) dataset.Footnote 5 I employ within-family estimations (fixed-effects (FE) approaches) using samples of siblings, and twin pairs in order to overcome the bias generated by unobserved family background and genetic traits that affect both the probability of becoming a teenage mother and health. More specifically, I compare the long-term health and health behaviors of teenage mothers to that of their (twin) sisters who had their first child after their teens. While within-family estimations eliminate the bias generated by unobserved family factors, this paper overcomes several of the concerns regarding family fixed effects by controlling for early life factors, such as birth weight and age at menarche, and restricting the sample to siblings that exhibit less observable heterogeneity. This paper makes several contributions to the existing literature. First, while a few studies explore the effect of teenage childbearing on health behaviors of mothers, this is the first paper to use within-family estimations to explore the effect of teenage childbearing on health outcomes, including self-reported health, number of chronic conditions, and mental health. Second, this paper adds to the literature investigating the effects of teenage childbearing on health behaviors of mothers. While previous studies generally find insignificant effects on health behaviors, this paper finds several significant impacts on behaviors not previously examined. More importantly, this paper demonstrates significant life-cycle effects. Specifically, accounting for life-cycle effects demonstrates that teenage childbearing has significant effects on both health outcomes and behaviors early in life, but very few significant effects later in life. This paper also provides evidence that teenage childbearing has a particularly acute effect among non-white (minority) mothers. Finally, this paper also uncovers the mechanisms through which teenage childbearing influences health behaviors and outcomes, with primary mechanisms including labor force participation, income, and matching outcomes (spouse’s education and labor force participation).",10
14.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,09 November 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-015-9315-8,Family time of couples with children: shortening gender differences in parenting?,December 2016,Joan Garcia Roman,Clara Cortina,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Family organization has changed dramatically in recent decades. The decline of the male breadwinner model and the predominance of a new model in which both parents are employed involve a new organization of tasks and a different allocation of time between both parents (Bianchi et al. 2006; Gershuny 2000). Although the division of time is not completely egalitarian, the differences in time allocation between men and women have decreased considerably (Sayer 2005; Ajenjo and Garcia-Roman 2014). Family time is also affected by the new organization of paid and unpaid duties. The increase of paid hours reduces the time spent with a partner and provides less availability to spend with children (Glorieux et al. 2011). Family time is considered an important value to an individual, and its availability is considered a good indicator of well-being and it is also a good input for children’s development (Hallberg and Klevmarken 2003; Pleck 2010). Time pressures derived from the new employment arrangements of the household have a negative effect on family time and as a consequence, on individual well-being (Kingston and Nock 1987; Presser 2003). Besides labor constraints, attitudes also matter for family time. It has been widely documented that couples whose members have more egalitarian values have a more symmetrical allocation of time (Meil 2005). Dual-earner couples, couples in which the mother reaches higher educational attainment and cohabiting couples are associated with more egalitarian behaviors (González and Jurado Guerrero 2009; Baxter 2005; Batalova and Cohen 2002; Ajenjo and Garcia-Roman 2011). Regarding family time, it generally seems that having characteristics associated with more egalitarian behaviors (dual earner, higher education, cohabitors) predicts a greater availability of time and, as a result, a higher participation rate of fathers with their children (including the share of time that fathers spend alone with their children) (Pleck 2010; Gracia 2014; Garcia-Roman 2013; Gimenez-Nadal et al. 2012). In this context of large changes in family organization, this research analyzes the time shared with the family (partner and children) among couples with young children in Spain. Spain is characterized by a later generalization of the dual-earner family model, and some norms and behaviors of the traditional model remain (Sevilla-Sanz et al. 2010). At the same time, prioritizing family and family balance is difficult because of the particularly long working schedules (Gutierrez-Domènech 2010). The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the differences in the roles of mothers and fathers in dual-earner and male-breadwinner couples. Dual earner couples are becoming more predominant and the preferred arrangement for couples (Garcia-Roman 2013; Dema 2005). However, it is crucial to explore to what extent changes observed in labour market, specially related with the generalization of female employment, are actually being reflected in the allocation of household and care activities. We base our research on data from time-use surveys, which are the most reliable source of information to study an individual’s allocation of time and to generate further understanding of economic decision-making processes (Robinson and Godbey 1997; Sevilla 2014). Through diaries of activities, information regarding all the activities conducted in 24 h is collected with other sociodemographic information and information that concerns the activities undertaken. “With whom?” the activity is done is a common question in time-use diaries. Several scholars have used this information to conduct studies on family time in some societies (Kingston and Nock 1987; Lesnard 2008; Gutierrez-Domènech 2010; Sevilla-Sanz et al. 2010; Bianchi et al. 2006). The structure of the paper is as follows. First, we review the previous empirical evidence on family time from a comparative perspective and discuss the limitations of the theory on housework division. Second, we present our research hypotheses. Third, we describe the data and the methods used. In the results section, we analyze the most common activities with the spouse and children and compare the differences between dual-earner and male-breadwinner couples. We also examine the main factors that explain the amount of family time for each type of couple and the differences between fathers and mothers in dual-earner couples. These results are discussed in the final section. Our findings show that mothers spend much more time with their children than fathers do, and even in more egalitarian couples, this difference persists. A father’s time with his children is affected more by the mother’s schedule, whereas a mother’s time with her children is less responsive to the employment of the father. In this sense, a mothers’ time with her children seems more “obliged,” whereas a fathers’ time may be considered a substitution for the mother’s time when she is working. The traditional allocation of time that gives the mother the role of the main caregiver is still strong in the family arrangement of couples in Spain. As other studies suggested with previous data, traditional values are still predominant in the Spanish society (Sevilla-Sanz et al. 2010). Changes are moving slowly and the scarcity of policies of balancing work and family makes them more difficult. Balancing the traditional role (main caregiver) and the new role (member of a dual-earner unit) may have a negative effect on mothers’ career that still maintain family responsibilities as a priority.",26

Sibling effects in household formation,December 2016,Ainhoa Aparicio-Fenoll,Veruska Oppedisano,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The proportion of young adults living with their parents is three times higher in Southern European countries than in Northern European ones.Footnote 1 Moreover, this proportion has increased sharply in Southern Europe during the last three decades.Footnote 2 Policy makers are concerned about young adults late household formation because it may critically affect family formation decisions, overall fertility rates, youth labour supply, labour mobility, and the sustainability of pay-as-you-go pension systems. As a consequence, several governments have implemented measures or advocated the need for incentives to promote household formation (for instance, the Portuguese “Porta 65” program in 2007, the Spanish “Renta Basica di Emancipacion” in 2008, and the French “Aide Mobili-Jeune” in 2013). Social interactions are particularly interesting for policy makers because they may alter the impact of policies. In the presence of peer effects in household formation, individuals’ decision to leave parental home in response to a policy could affect their peers’ household formation decision, even when the latter are not directly affected by the reform. Among social interactions, siblings’ ones are particularly interesting because, differently from other peer interactions, they happen within the household and they are more intense and lasting. In fact, siblings have often been found to be the most influential peers (Lindahl 2011; Nicoletti and Rabe 2013; Dahl et al. 2014). This paper analyzes sibling effects in the decision to form a new household, i.e., the impact of having a sibling who forms a new household in the same time period. Sibling effects in household formation can be positive or negative. They can be positive due to imitation or information transmission. Imitation among siblings may reflect an intrinsic desire to behave like others and is stronger for smaller age differences and from older to younger siblings (Barr and Hayne 2003). The decision of an individual to form a new household may also reflect information transmission about the costs and benefits of leaving parental home, so that the choices of any single person modify the information available to all her siblings (Duflo and Saez 2003). However, sibling effects may also operate in the opposite direction (Angrist and Lang 2004). First, if a sibling has left parental home, the quantity of public goods available for the remaining siblings increases, reducing their incentive to form a new household. Parents may also increase household resources to the remaining sibling in response to the higher risk of remaining alone: Manacorda and Moretti (2006) show that if children have a preference for living on their own, some parents are willing to trade off their own consumption to bribe their children into staying at home. Second, children of lone parents are observed leaving the nest at a lower rate (Mencarini et al. 2012). In this case, an individual’s decision to leave parental home may induce her siblings to stay home. Similarly, the presence of old or ill parents may delay young individuals’ household formation in response to their siblings’ decision to leave parental home if remaining children need to stay home to take care of the parent.Footnote 3 In our empirical analysis, we determine whether positive or negative sibling effects prevail in practice. Estimating causal effects arising from social interactions is challenging. As Manski (1993) pointed out, estimation of these effects needs to deal with problems of simultaneous causality, correlated unobservables, and endogenous group membership. Researchers have used different strategies to tackle these issues. Some authors attempt to control for as many observable characteristics as possible, or use instrumental variables.Footnote 4 Others identify peer effects by exploiting exogenous group assignment.Footnote 5 A third approach consists in studying peer effects in naturally occurring groups, and exploiting random variation in exposure to the treatment for a random subset of individuals.Footnote 6 This last strategy is called partial population approach (Moffitt 2001). The exogenous variation in the papers that adopt the partial population approach often comes from policies or legislation changes. Angelucci et al. (2010) and Lalive and Cattaneo (2009) exploit a randomized intervention in the context of the Progresa aid program, Dahl et al. (2014) analyze the introduction of the Norwegian paternity leave quota in 1993 and Hesselius et al. (2009) study the deferral of the monitoring of sickness absence for a group of randomly selected individuals in Sweden. We follow the partial population approach and examine the causal effect of a sibling’s household formation decision on the individual’s probability of leaving parental home. We use data from the Spanish Survey on Income and Living Conditions which follows individuals over time, even when forming a new household. Our identification strategy makes use of the panel structure of the data and the exogenous eligibility criteria for a Spanish rental subsidy that significantly affects household formation rates. The panel data nature of our sample allows us to difference out any individual or household time-invariant unobservable characteristic; the exogenous eligibility criteria for the rental subsidy allow us to deal with other omitted variables as well as reverse causality concerns. Our findings suggest that there are negative siblings’ effects on household formation: youngsters who leave their parental home delay their siblings’ decision to leave. When looking at the mechanisms, negative sibling effects can be explained by the remaining sibling staying longer in the parental home in the presence of an old or ill parent. The effect could be led by female individuals staying at home after their sister has left parental home. Estimated sibling effects turn positive for close-in-age siblings. Overall, siblings’ interactions reduce the impact of policies that foster household formation unless age differences between siblings are small. There is some evidence on the effects of peer behavior in living arrangements. Using Italian data, Di Stefano (2008) estimates a structural model in which young adults simultaneously choose labor supply, residential arrangement and marital status conditional on the social norm on the age at first marriage, endogenously determined as an equilibrium outcome. Although she does not analyze specifically sibling effects, her results indicate that young adults, and especially women, tend to conform to each other, which is a sign of the existence of peer effects. Adamopoulou and Kaya (2015), using peers’ characteristics as an instrument for the fraction of peers who have left parental home, find evidence of positive peer effects among North-American high school friends. Numerous studies have produced empirical evidence documenting the existence of relevant siblings’ interactions in many areas.Footnote 7 To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the role of sibling effects on the decision to leave parental home. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional setting and data. Section 3 presents the empirical methodology. Section 4 provides a discussion of the empirical results and Sect. 5 concludes.",8
14.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,04 January 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-014-9279-0,Divorce and the cost of housing: evidence from Iran,December 2016,Mohammad Reza Farzanegan,Hassan Fereidouni Gholipour,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Divorce crisis in Iran has now attracted even international attention. The New York Times (December 6, 2010) talks about “Iran’s Divorce Rate Stirs Fears of Society in Crisis” while the Seattle Times reports on “Skyrocketing divorce rate in Iran worries officials”. These media coverage reflects the ever-increasing family crisis in the Islamic and post-revolutionary society of Iran. During the last two decades, one of the major socio-demographic trends taking place in Iran has been a strong growth in divorce rate. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the crude divorce rate (per 1,000 population) in Iran has increased significantly since early 1990s. It shows steady growth from 0.50 in 1993 to almost 2 in 2010. In addition, the ratio of divorce to marriage, which was 6.9 % in 1980, has reached to 8.24 % in 2000 and 12.29 % in 2012 (Euromonitor International 2013). A recent statistics provided by the Iran’s National Organization for Civil Registration show that on average 16 divorce cases are registered every hour in Iran in 2013.Footnote 1
 Total number of divorces in Iran (per 1,000 population), 1970–2010. Source: National Organization for Civil Registration (http://www.sabteahval.ir/en/default-789.aspx) This socio-economic problem is happening in a decade that Iran is facing a decline in marriage rate, low fertility, and low population growth. According to Statistical Center of Iran, the annual average growth rate of population from 1996 to 2006 was 1.62 % while the rate declined to 1.29 % for the period of 2006–2011. High level of divorce among young couples who have been married for a short period and do not have children may worsen the problem of population growth. A recent statistic provided by Iran’s National Organization for Civil Registration indicates that in 2012, 35 % of divorces in Iran occurred among couples who were married for 3 years and less. It is noteworthy that about 60 % of women who were granted a divorce in 2011 and 2012 were under 30 years old, which are the best years for fertility. The housing boom in Iran has been blamed for various socio-economic problems such as low level of household formation and fertility rate as well as high incidences of land grabbing crimes (e.g., Gholipour 2012
Footnote 2). Over the last decade, home prices and rents have risen across the country.Footnote 3 Figure 2 illustrates the house rents per square meter in selected major cities in Iran. Trend in rents per square meter in selected major cities of Iran (IRR), 2000–2011.

 Recently, divorce has become another social issueFootnote 4 that is suspected of being influenced by rising housing costs. It is because a rapid increase in house prices and rents went hand-in-hand with continuous increases in divorce rate. This led some observers to suggest that the high level of divorces in Iran was spurred by the high and persistent increases in house prices and rentsFootnote 5 (Roshanfekr et al. 2012; Saeidi 2013). In fact, shortage of housing supply, housing costs as well as low depth of housing finance (2.8 % of GDP)Footnote 6 have been mentioned along with other unfavorable economic factors (high unemployment and inflation) as drivers of family dissolutions, particularly among young couples, in Iran. It remains, however, to test these stylized facts using objective data. Are increasing housing costs pushing divorce rate upward in Iran? Bivariate correlation shows a positive association between these two variables within our sample (see Fig. 3). However, in order to judge about causality from housing costs to divorce rate, we need to control for other time varying economic variables in addition to time constant, regional specific factors such as tradition, norms, conventions and attitudes toward divorce (see Hiller and Recoules 2013 for the role of culture in development of divorce). Also correlation may not be the causation. Effect can be also from divorce to housing prices and other macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment rate. Bivariate correlation between housing costs and divorce rates in a panel of Iranian provinces (2002–2010) We study the relationship between housing costs and divorce rate using data from provinces of Iran over the period of 2002–2010. Our main findings from fixed effects and dynamic generalized methods of moments (GMM) panel regressions show a positive and statistically significant effect of housing prices and rents on divorce rates, controlling for other time varying, province and year fixed effects. Furthermore, we provide new evidences on the divorce effects of “shocks” in housing costs at the national level from 1982 to 2010 by using the Vector autoregressive based impulse response and variance decomposition analyses. Response of divorce to increasing shocks in housing rental prices, controlling for other variables, is positive and statistically significant over 5 years following initial shock. The results of this study enhance our understanding about the economic determinants of marital breakdown in an Islamic developing country. The present study makes four contributions to the literature on divorce. First, although there have been some studies on the effect of house prices on divorce (or marital stability, partnership dissolution) in developed countries (Rainer and Smith 2010; Farnham et al. 2011; Harknett and Schneider 2012; Milosch 2014), to our knowledge, no empirical study has analyzed this link in a developing economy, especially in the Middle East Muslim dominated region. In contrast to developed countries, which have been experiencing a stable or decreasing growth in divorce rate, Iran (similar to many other developing economies) is experiencing an uprising trend (Euromonitor International 2013). Therefore, our result would provide some new evidences from a developing country where divorce is growing fast. The second contribution of this study is introducing the concept of Mehrieh
Footnote 7 to the literature on economic determinants of divorce, explaining how changes in prices of real estate and gold coins may affect the divorce decision in an Islamic society. Third, while previous studies in this area have used micro or individual-level data, very few empirical papers have used aggregate level data to study these variables. Finally, although there has been a series of survey (cross-sectional) and conceptual papers about divorce phenomenon in Iran, such as Aghajanian and Moghadas (1998), Ghotbi et al. (2004), Zargar and Neshat-Doost (2008), Ghiaci et al. (2010) and Aghajanian and Thompson (2013), no empirical study has been conducted to investigate the effect of economic determinants of divorce across provinces of Iran over recent years. In fact, the existing studies often focus on one city of Iran in a short period. Our panel data approach will address the main shortage of omitted variable bias due to unobservable effects in studying a multi-aspect phenomenon such as divorce. The paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 provides a brief background on cultural and religious attitudes of Iranian society toward divorce; in Sect. 3 we present theoretical framework for the relationship between housing costs and divorce and also reviews some of the relevant empirical studies; Sect. 4 explains the data and methodology; in Sect. 5 we present and discuss the empirical results; and Sect. 6 concludes this paper.",26

Morrissey,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Attending nonparental early care and education (ECE) settings, including child care centers, preschools, and home-based care, has become a normative experience in the lives of young children in the United States. In 2011, more than three-fifths (61 %) of children under five in the United States regularly attended some type of ECE arrangement, and among those in at least one care arrangement, they spent an average of 33 h a week in care (Laughlin 2013).Footnote 1 In 2014, 64 % of women with children under age 6 were employed; more than half of mothers with infants under 1 year were employed (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2015), and more than 6 in 10 households with children are dual-earner or employed single-parent households (i.e., all parents work) (Council of Economic Advisors 2014). Maternal employment rates (mothers with children 0–14 years) in the United States fall near the OECD average, with the Scandinavian countries, Canada, and much of Western Europe averaging higher rates (Sweden at the highest, above 80 %), and Australia, Mexico, and several Southern European countries averaging lower rates (i.e., Mexico at the lowest, below 50 %) (OECD 2015). Economic theory suggests that lower child care costs, through subsidized care or the provision of free or low-cost arrangements, decreases the costs of employment, and in turn, increases the use of ECE and the likelihood that parents are employed and lengthens their work hours (e.g., Blau and Currie 2006a, b; Connelly and Kimmel 2003; Tekin 2007). This paper reviews the research on the effects of ECE on parental labor force participation in the last 15 years (2001 and after), with a focus on the United States but also including research in other countries. Section 2 describes the ECE policy context and recent policy changes, and relevant background literature. Section 3 summarizes the current research on the impacts of ECE on mothers’ and fathers’ employment and work hours, first presenting research in the United States and then that conducted in other countries, and describes variations in impacts by child and family characteristics. Section 4 discusses the gaps in existing research and future directions, and provides concluding remarks.",78

A large number of national and international health agencies encourage pregnant women and new mothers to breastfeed. The World Health Organization, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Healthy People 2020 all promote exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a child’s life. Healthy People 2020 set a prevalence goal of 81.9 % for breastfeeding, and 60.6 % for breastfeeding at six months (USDHHS 2010).Footnote 1 Despite these strong recommendations, both quasi-experimental (Evenhouse and Reilly 2005; Rothstein 2013; Fletcher 2011) and experimental (Kramer et al. 2008; 2001) evidence suggests that many of the health and human capital benefits attributed to breastfeeding in observational studiesFootnote 2 can be explained, in part or in whole, by selection. However, no study has yet explored the adult earnings effects of breastfeeding. There are a number of reasons to expect a positive relationship between breastfeeding and adult earnings. Breastfeeding may improve cognitive development through the presence of high concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid in breast milk. Docosahexaenoic acid is an important long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid that has been linked to brain maturation (Horta et al. 2007; Wroble et al. 2002; Makrides et al. 1994). There is, in fact, some experimental evidence in support of positive IQ effects of breastfeeding, though the magnitude of the effect appears to be modest (Kramer et al. 2008). Relatedly, breastfeeding-induced cognitive benefits may increase academic achievement and educational attainment (Belfield and Kelly 2012; Rees and Sabia 2009; Evenhouse and Reilly 2005), which may also augment earnings. In addition, breastfeeding may confer health benefits on its recipients via immunologic protection in infancy, adolescence, and perhaps even adulthood (Hassiotou and Geddes 2015; Jackson and Nazar 2006), which may lead to important long-term economic benefits (Case et al. 2005). Finally, it is also possible that breastfeeding increases bonding between infants and parents, leading to productive parental investments that would not have otherwise been made. However, it may be that breastfeeding and adult earnings are positively related not because of a causal link, but rather due to unmeasured maternal or child heterogeneity. Mothers that breastfeed their children may make other unmeasured productive investments (not caused by breastfeeding), which could result in misattributing the effects of these other inputs in the production of child quality to breastfeeding (Fletcher 2011; Rothstein 2013). Mothers who breastfeed might also have the lowest opportunity costs of time (Baker and Milligan 2008; Kools et al. 2006; Fein and Roe 1998), which could conflate the effects of breastfeeding with those of maternal intelligence, schooling, employment, or other difficult-to-measure health investments.Footnote 3 Moreover, characteristics of the child—such as health or cognitive endowments—could lead mothers to make compensatory or reinforcing health investments in children (Fletcher 2011). Along the same lines, if prior estimates of the health and human capital effects of breastfeeding are overstated due to selection (Rothstein 2013; Fletcher 2011; Kramer et al. 2008; 2001), then several mechanisms through which breastfeeding could affect earnings may be much smaller, leaving fewer theoretical channels (such as breastfeeding-induced bonding) to explain such a link. Ultimately, determining the earnings effects of breastfeeding is an empirical question. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examine the relationship between breastfeeding and young adult earnings using a variety of identification strategies designed to control for the endogeneity of maternal breastfeeding decisions. Parsimonious ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions show that having been breastfed as a child is associated with a 10–12 % increase in the hourly earnings of young adults. However, after ensuring common support on observables via propensity score matching or relying on within-family variation in breastfeeding among biological siblings, the estimated effect of breastfeeding on wages is small in magnitude and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Together, our findings suggest little evidence that any early childhood benefits of having been breastfed extend to the labor market.",3

Wiemers,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Leaving home, completing schooling, entering the labor market, getting married, and having children are among the milestones in the transition to adulthood. This paper examines one of these milestones–the decision to leave home. The patterns of home leaving among high income countries are diverse but the trend toward later home leaving and longer transitions to adulthood is evident across Europe and North America (Aassave et al. 2001; Bell et al. 2007; Chiuri and Boca 2010; Giuliano 2007; Iacovou 2010)
. Delays in leaving the parental home are correlated with delays in other milestones including marriage and childbearing. Understanding why young adults leave home is thus important in our understanding of the overall transition to adulthood. This paper addresses one piece of the complex decision to leave home, asking how home leaving is influenced by local economic opportunities. I examine home leaving behavior of young adults during an economic expansion using the experience of the Celtic Tiger in Ireland. During the Celtic Tiger there were large increases in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the form of factories which opened at different times and in different locations. I use the geographic and time-series variation in foreign job growth to examine the effect of these factory openings on home leaving decisions. I argue that the unique institutional factors surrounding industrial development in Ireland suggest that the location of foreign firms is exogenous and show empirically that the location of these jobs is uncorrelated with preexisting labor market conditions and other local factors. Internal migration rates in Ireland are quite low and this combination of an exogenous shock to a local labor market with low migration allows me to shed light on whether young adults respond to increases in income and employment opportunities by moving out of the parental home. Because I examine a local labor market shock I cannot separate the effect of changes in children’s employment opportunities from those of their parents or from other changes in the local economy. Financial transfers from parents to children may increase as parents’ employment opportunities increase and may also increase the probability that young adults leave home (Altonji et al. 1992, 1997; Hayashi et al. 1996). Other factors associated with growing local economies may decrease the probability of leaving home. House price increases may make it more difficult for children to establish independent households (Matsudaira 2010) and the value of living with parents may increase if parents spend some of their increased resources on public goods items like housing quality (Manacorda and Moretti 2006). Parents may also be more able to finance college attendance during a boom period, keeping young adults at home until later ages. Ultimately, the relative importance of these factors is an empirical question. My results suggest that the net effect of local job growth is to increase the probability that young adults leave the family home. For well-educated young adults, a one standard deviation increase in job growth in foreign firms increases the probability of leaving home by 14 %. Because foreign job growth is largely skilled work for college graduates it makes sense that the effects are concentrated among those most likely to benefit from it, but I am unable to precisely identify the mechanism through which job growth in foreign firms increases home leaving—higher rates of home leaving may also be the result of parents getting jobs, spill over effects, or general equilibrium effects. In the current economic environment, my results suggest that new household formation will increase as the economy improves. However, if job creation for certain groups of workers, such as those with less education, is slow, these young adults will also be slow to establish new households.",3

This is especially the case for households sending their children to universities/colleges. Despite the general attention and relevance to public policy, however, the effect of high educational expenses on household behavior has rarely been examined in Japan. Whether or not a household has sufficient savings to cover higher educational spending is closely related to the prospect for equal opportunity in education, often debated as an important aspect of intergenerational transfer of inequality. Moreover, some important implications are extracted by evaluating tuition impact on such consumer behavior as household economy, educational decisions, and childbirth encouraging policies. Thus, we need to provide quantitative evidence on the welfare aspect of educational expense for households, especially as related to universities, the most costly educational institutions. In order to gauge welfare implication of the tuition burden for higher education, we examine consumption smoothing for households with children attending universities. College tuition payment causes large and clearly predictable changes in discretionary income in predetermined months. Therefore, by exploring the effect of tuition payment on household spending patterns, we can examine whether a household is able to maintain its existing standard of living. We share the view of Souleles (2000) which examined consumption smoothing in response to college tuition as an alternative test of the life-cycle/permanent income hypothesis (LC/PIH). According to the theory, a forward-looking household optimizing its consumption path dynamically responds in terms of its consumption to a predicted income change when it is anticipated under perfect credit market access. We view tuition payment as a large and clearly predictable change in discretionary income and examined whether a household succeeds in consumption smoothing over the month in which payment is made. The LC/PIH predicts that households do not alter consumption when the large tuition payment is made; however, if the hypothesis fails, household consumption would be affected by a change in discretionary income. A large number of empirical studies have found that predictable income changes caused substantial changes in spending and therefore the studies have rejected the LC/PIH.
Footnote 1 On the other hand, there are several works that find little relationship between the anticipated pattern of a household’s income and the pattern of its expenditure when the predictable income changes are large.
Footnote 2
 A bounded rationality argument is often used to reconcile the different results; in other words, a household adjusts its consumption path when the cost associated with the mental processing of these forecastable income changes is small relative to the utility gains from consumption smoothing (Hsieh 2003). Further, we need to consider several other factors that are responsible for influencing the validity of the empirical tests (Stephens 2008).Footnote 3 One factor is poorly measured consumption data which is detrimental when using consumption changes as the dependent variable (Shapiro 1984). Another factor is the information problem (Browning and Lusardi 1996). In the estimation of the consumption Euler equation, it is difficult for an econometrician to distinguish between anticipated and unanticipated changes when using observed data. If unanticipated changes are erroneously included in the measure of anticipated changes, and if the econometrician finds an effect of this measure of anticipated changes, one cannot necessarily reject the LC/PIH. To our knowledge, three papers have attempted to fill the gap in the information issue. All of them examined clearly predictable changes in discretionary income when income changes are accurately anticipated by households and clearly observed in the data. Souleles (2000) found that households appear to be engaged in consumption smoothing into the academic year despite the large expenditure of college tuition. Coulibaly and Li (2006) showed that households did not alter non-durable goods spending over the maturity date of a mortgage loan when their discretionary income increased; instead they increased financial saving and durable goods purchase. In contrast, Stephens (2008) showed that an increase in discretionary income after the final loan repayment leads to an increase in non-durable consumption.Footnote 4
 While all the papers mentioned in the previous paragraph used micro-level data from the US Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), this study is empowered by high-quality and high-frequency data called the Family Income and Expenditure Study (FIES). There are some comparative advantages to using FIES, with which we aim to add new evidence to the literature. The high quality of FIES data is due to its being based on a diary that is collected monthly and that contains a rich set of household demographics. Moreover, we need to emphasize the advantage of the decomposition of educational spending, which is essential to the contribution of this study. FIES has very detailed data on tuition payment and non-tuition educational spending, reflecting on out-of-pocket outlays. While the CEX has only the item of “total college expenditure” including all out-of-pocket outlays on college tuition together with room and board, FIES provides detailed data focused on college tuition only. This merit enables us to mitigate the endogeneity issue since some elements of educational expense are endogenous; households owing larger tuition payments are more likely to reduce non-tuition spending on education under a budget constraint. While there is room to choose the type of school before entrance, following enrollment, tuition payments are exogenously set for each household. Indeed, living expenses (including room and board) are smaller for private university students who owe a larger tuition payment (see Sect. 2). Thus, it is critical to distinguish between the (exogenous) tuition fee and more endogenously determined expenses related to studying. The unique advantage that the FIES contains rich information on tuition and non-tuition educational spending allows us to examine accurately the college tuition effect on household consumption. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section explains college tuition and the related university system in Japan. Section 3 describes the dataset. Section 4 presents the results of regression analyses to measure the size of the consumption response to decline in disposable income due to tuition payment. Section 5 performs alternative specifications and presents the results. Section 6 summarizes the findings and concludes.",

self-employed? The case of Sweden",March 2017,Pernilla Andersson Joona,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"It has been argued that women choose self-employment as a way of balancing work and family commitments, in particular if there are young children living in the household. The presence of children increases the amount of household work at the same time as the parents’ demand for flexible scheduling increases. Self-employment is assumed to increase flexibility regarding when and where the work is performed and self-employment also involves a higher degree of control and self-determination than what wage-earning employment does. Previous studies, mostly from Anglo-Saxon countries, find a positive correlation between the presence of young children in the household and self-employment probabilities among women (Boden 1996; Budig 2006; Hundley 2000; Lombard 2001; Wellington 2006). This has been interpreted as evidence of women choosing self-employment as a way to balance work and family. Boden (1999) using survey data from the United States report that in particular women with young children are more likely than men to state that they become self-employed to increase flexibility and for family-related reasons. This is also in line with the findings of Carr (1996). Related studies using time-use data find that self-employed women spend more time on household work than wage-earning women and less time on market work (Gurley-Calvez et al. 2009; Craig et al. 2012). There are no previous studies investigating this hypothesis for Sweden where the labor market is structured in a very different way than, for example, the United States. There are reasons to believe that Swedish women do not choose self-employment in order to balance work and family; there are other institutions in place aimed at facilitating the combination of work and family: large-scale publically subsidized child care, a generous parental leave system with built-in incentives for fathers to take more parental leaveFootnote 1, and the right for parents with children up to 8 years to work part time. In an international comparison, female self-employment rates in Sweden are low while female labor force participation is high, part-time work is high, and fertility levels are high.Footnote 2 Taken together, it seems plausible that Swedish women manage to combine work and family without choosing self-employment to a very high extent. Rønsen (2014) discusses the relationship between children and self-employment among Norwegian women in a similar way: the extra working time associated with being self-employed should outweigh the flexibility and self-autonomy associated with being self-employed in a welfare-state, such as Norway, with a good supply of state-sponsored child care. Rønsen (2014) does, however, find indications of a positive association between the presence of young children (up to 11 years of age) and female self-employment also in Norway. Using survey data with information on working hours, she also reports that self-employed women on average spend more time on market work than wage-earning women do. In a cross-country comparison, Noseleit (2014b) tests the hypothesis that the female self-employment share is lower in countries with better child care provision. The hypothesis is supported and in addition it is found that women who become self-employed in countries with better child care availability tends to have higher education and more often hire employees. In this paper Swedish register data for the total Swedish population covering the period 2004–2008 is used, and both pooled cross-sectional models and fixed-effect models are estimated to analyze the effect of young children in the household on self-employment probabilities. It is found that the presence of young children increases self-employment probabilities also among Swedish women. The effect is strongest for women with very young children, 0–3 years of age, and the effect is decreasing with the age of the children. A positive effect of having children on self-employment probabilities is also found for men but here the effect is strongest for the presence of slightly older children. Should this result be interpreted as that women in Sweden chose self-employment to balance work and family? Or is there an alternative explanation for why women with young children become self-employed?Footnote 3 To discuss this further we look at how much time self-employed women spend on market and household work compared to wage-earning women. If women choose self-employment as a way to balance work and family we would expect that they spend less time on market work and more time on household work compared to wage-earning women. Hundley (2000) argues that self-employment are not subject to some of the constraints of organizational employment; he assumes that there is a lower bound defined by the minimum contribution of the worker in organizational employment and an upper bound defined by the ability of organizations of rewarding very skilled employees. Due to the lack of primarily the lower bound in self-employment, it will be easier for the self-employed to adjust their time spent on market and household work if family responsibilities increase. Having the US labor market in mind, he further argues that self-employed women will work fewer market hours and more housework hours compared to their organizational employed counterparts, while the opposite will be true for self-employed men. Previous studies for Sweden and several different data sources with information about how workers divide their time between market and household work show that self-employed women in Sweden spend more, or as much, time on market work than wage-earning women and there are no significant differences in the amount of time spent on household work. This raises doubts about whether women in Sweden choses self-employment as a way to balance work and family. Instead, it seems plausible that women who choose self-employment while the children are young in fact are women with strong preferences for market work. In addition to analyzing time-use data, differences in number of days of parental leave between self-employed and wage earners are also analyzed. If women chose self-employment to balance work and family, we would expect that they take more parental leave compared to wage earners. Using administrative data, we find that the group of self-employed appears to be very heterogeneous; self-employed mothers are more likely to take no, or very short, parental leave when the children are very young but among those who take some parental leave, self-employed mothers take on average more days of parental leave than wage-earning mothers. This paper makes several contributions to the existing literature. First, results presented in previous research are mainly based on data from Anglo-Saxon countries while this study uses data for Sweden. The Swedish labor market is organized in a very different way than in Anglo-Saxon countries and it is of great interest to see if the results for Sweden are consistent with findings for other countries. One exception to previous research is Rønsen (2014) for Norway but this study is interesting for comparison. Second, in the present study register data for the period 2004–2008 covering the whole Swedish population is used. Most previous studies are based on rather small samples, and are often restricted to smaller groups, e.g., married white women, and cover earlier time periods. Third, the association between self-employment and the presence of young children in the household is further discussed by relating our findings to what is known about how self-employed and wage earners divide their time between market and household work and to differences in days of parental leave between self-employed and wage earners. Relating the results presented in this paper to previous results for other countries, we can see that the demand for self-employment increases if there is young children in the household, in spite of large differences in labor market institutions. It is, however, possible that the motives to choose self-employment among women with young children differ across countries. Differences between countries in time spent on market work compared to wage earners indicate that there are such differences. Also taking differences in the female self-employment share across countries into account, this could mean that self-employment is a more commonly adopted strategy among women in countries with less child care provision and a solution chosen by a more selected group of women in countries like Sweden. It is, however, also possible that cross-country differences in female self-employment mostly could be attributed to differences in self-employment among women without dependent children and that the demand for self-employment among mothers of young children is equal across countries in spite of differences in institutions. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 previous research is discussed in more detail, in Section 3 the data, variables, and the econometric approach are described, in Section 4 the results are presented, and in Section 5 the findings are related to differences in time spent on market work between self-employed and wage earners and differences in the use of parental leave. Finally, Section 6 summarizes and concludes the paper.",24

labor as an incentive device",June 2017,Selma Walther,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In developing countries, women continue to specialize in domestic labor in households. This specialization has traditionally been considered a burden for women, primarily because it reduces their earnings power, which may reduce their power within marriage. However, women may use this specialization to their advantage, particularly when divorce is not a credible threat. The question I address in this paper is the following: do women use domestic labor as leverage to influence their husbands’ actions in their favor, particularly when their outside options are low?Footnote 1 I structure a model of moral hazard in marriage based on the family institutions of Malawi, where exogenous kinship traditions imply that wives can divorce easily in some areas, but not others. Wives provide their husbands with incentives to invest effort in generating consumption. The model predicts that women with low outside options who cannot credibly threaten their husbands with divorce implement more stringent incentives through domestic labor than women who have high outside options and hence can credibly threaten with divorce. This prediction is confirmed in the data: where divorce is inaccessible, women make inefficient time allocation choices to generate incentives. Becker’s (1973, 1974) seminal contribution to our economic understanding of marriage rests on the idea that marriage takes place when there is a surplus to be gained for the two individuals, relative to staying single. Specialization within the household is an important driver of this surplus; this has traditionally involved women specializing in domestic production, and men specializing in market labor supply. However, this can lead to inefficiencies, if men cannot commit to compensating their wives for staying at home. For example, Cohen (1987) argues that marriage is a type of contract, with each spouse having expectations of a set of services that their partner will provide them with. At the same time, marriage is an incomplete contract; problems can arise when the inability to commit leads to inefficiently low investments, for example (Grossbard-Schechtman and Lemennicier 1999). A second problem arises because of the inherent lack of full information in marriage, as a result of which the effort spent generating marital goods, such as joint earnings, may be unobservable. This problem is exacerbated in developing countries, where women’s low autonomy results in less influence within marriage. Divorce may be an empowering strategy that helps to overcome this problem (Cohen 1971; Reniers 2003). The threat of divorce forces husbands to involve their wives in decisions and to provide for them. However, divorce can be inaccessible to women, particularly if it makes them economically insecure or socially ostracized. If divorce is not a credible threat, a fundamental moral hazard problem in marriage remains. I hypothesize that wives address this problem by using domestic labor as an incentive device. England and Folbre (2002) emphasize the role that marriage-specific resources, such as household work and affection, can play as sources of bargaining power if they can be credibly withheld. In cultures where men have official authority over women, women may hold “unassigned” power through the ability to withhold food and sexual services (Lamphere 1974, p. 99). Cohen’s (1971) study of the patrilineal Kanuri in Bornu, for example, demonstrated that control of the household sphere was the main way in which women derived control in other spheres of marital life. The key to the effectiveness of this mechanism is specialization, which implies that a woman’s labor cannot be easily replaced. In this paper, I model the behavior of spouses in rural Malawi. Existing intra-household models are inadequate for capturing the potential for within-household sources of bargaining power. Bargaining and collective intra-household models (Manser and Brown 1980; Chiappori 1988) postulate that a woman’s power within marriage is determined primarily by her outside option. Other models of the household have discussed within-marriage threat points (Lundberg and Pollak 1993) and the consequences of limited commitment on efficiency in marriage (Aura 2002; Lundberg and Pollak 2001; Rasul 2008). However, the use of incentives to generate desirable outcomes has not been addressed. I propose a model in which wives use a combination of domestic labor and divorce threat to incentivize husbands because of a moral hazard problem. Wives observe the amount of income a husband brings home, which is a noisy signal of how much effort he has made to contribute to the household. They respond positively to a high amount and negatively otherwise. In order to test the model, I take advantage of the fact that kinship in Malawi, which is exogenously determined at birth, has a strong influence on divorce accessibility. This is because it determines the pattern of land inheritance that a household follows. As a result, the effect of divorce accessibility on behavior can be neatly compared through kinship. In rural Malawi, there are two distinct kinship traditions. Most of Malawi is matrilineal: inheritance passes through the mother’s line and matrilocality is common, where a married couple resides in the wife’s natal village. The remainder of Malawi is patrilineal, where inheritance passes from father to son and patrilocality is common. Under matriliny, women’s outside options are high because they own household land and have the support of their kin.Footnote 2 As a result, divorce is a credible threat. In contrast, divorce is not a credible threat for patrilineal women who lose access to land on divorce. The model predicts that patrilineal women use domestic labor as a stronger incentive device than matrilineal women. The model is tested on wives’ time use in Malawi: the results confirm the prediction. The theoretical framework of this paper is related to the literature on asymmetric information, active incentives and domestic labor in marriage. Most of the current household economics literature focuses on Pareto efficient outcomes (Chiappori 1988; Lundberg and Pollak 1993), which are not supported by data on productive activities (Udry 1996). This motivates asymmetric information in marriage in this paper, which has already received some attention in the literature (Peters 1986; Friedberg and Stern 2014). Souza (2013) builds a moral hazard model of the family where the elderly provide the young with incentives to exert effort in the labor market, while Rasul (2008) demonstrates that bargaining over fertility can lead to inefficient outcomes due to the inability of spouses to commit to future actions. Active incentives are modelled by Landes (1978), who explores the role of alimony as an enforcement mechanism for optimal marital investment. Domestic labor as a source of power is addressed by Pollak (2005) through its effect on the outside option rather than its use as a leverage device. This paper models and tests the existence of domestic labor as an incentive device to overcome asymmetric information in marriage.Footnote 3
 The use of domestic labor in the model is similar to the concept of “wife-services” in Grossbard (1976, p. 703), whereby in a society with extremely traditional gender roles, women provide domestic goods, and hence supply domestic labor, while men demand women’s domestic labor, and compensate them for it. As in a standard labor supply model, the shadow wage is determined by the productivity of the wife, so that more able women will have a leftward shifted supply curve of domestic goods, because they demand a higher shadow wage than less able women. Interpreting the moral hazard model along the lines of Grossbard’s model implies that women in Malawi supply domestic labor and are compensated by men with cash goods, such as clothing. In addition, productivity differences may affect the total amount of domestic labor supplied. This paper offers important policy implications relating to female empowerment. Domestic specialization can be empowering for women, especially when their autonomy is otherwise low. However, using domestic labor as an incentive device prevents an efficient allocation of time. Accessible divorce is also empowering and may reduce the need for sources of power internal to marriage. Therefore, empowering women by making divorce more accessible can reduce inefficiencies in women’s time allocation. One way of empowering women in developing countries is to grant them land rights. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section presents some anthropological evidence on Malawi that is relevant to the paper. The theoretical model of marriage is presented in Section 3. Empirical tests are in Section 4 and Section 5 concludes.",7

Emancipation in the family context means to be free from and to be independent of parents. It implies independence in multiple aspects of life, economical, residential, decision-making and responsibility-assuming. Therefore, the age one emancipates depends on multiple factors, not only socio-economic ones but also emotional and psychological ones. To start with, we may consider the decision of emancipation in terms of costs and benefits of separating from parents. Of course, the costs and the benefits can be both economical and non-economical. Furthermore, we have to consider the costs/benefits from both children’s and parents’ side as the decision of emancipation often involves a process of negotiation between them. From children’s viewpoints, the main cost of emancipation is the loss of economies of scale in consumption usually financed by parents, while the main benefits are gains in personal freedom and intimacy. From parental viewpoints, the costs and the benefits may be more emotional than economical.Footnote 1 Presumably, rich parents can accommodate more easily their children longer time than the poor.Footnote 2 Given the parents’ economic capacity, in turn, children in smaller-size families would be tolerated longer than those in larger families. This may be relevant in Spain as the fertility rate declined considerably during the period the cohorts of our analysis were born.Footnote 3
 Macroeconomic conditions are also likely to play important roles in determining emancipation patterns. Tight housing market and weak job market conditions are likely to retard transitions to emancipation. The effect of individual economic conditions is likely to be larger than that of general economic conditions, and recessions may exert additional negative effects on emancipation due to the perception of future uncertainty (Lee and Painter 2013). Knowing the emancipation pattern and its evolution is important to acquire better understanding about a wide variety of demographic and socio-economic conditions of a society and to predict their prospects in the future, such as family formation, fertility, age structure, housing demand, consumption and labor supply.Footnote 4
 The main purpose of this paper is to record and analyze the patterns of emancipation in Spain during the current crisis relative to the preceding boom. Has the recession retarded Spanish youth’s emancipation? If so, how much? We compare the proportion of young people who are living away from parental home between the period of boom and that of bust. The period of boom is considered to be 2005–2008 and that of bust 2009–2013. The main contribution of our paper is the detection of a surprising counter-intuitive evolution of emancipation in Spain during the last economic cycle, the finding of a dominant behavioral effect and the attempt to explain this from diverse perspectives such as mobility, selection, reverse causation, time-lag and secular trend.",19
15.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,23 February 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9327-z,Living arrangements in Europe: whether and why paternal retirement matters,June 2017,Luca Stella,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the last several years, a substantial body of research has attempted to identify some of the potential determinants that may induce youths to continue living with their parents. Economists have primarily focused on parental economic resources (Edmonds et al. 2005; Manacorda and Moretti 2006; Battistin et al. 2009), labor market conditions for youth (Card and Lemieux 2000; Becker et al. 2010), prevailing characteristics in housing markets (Börsch-Supan 1986; Ermisch 1999; Alessie et al. 2004) and cultural factors (Giuliano 2007; Alesina and Giuliano 2011). While this investigation is particularly relevant for Italy and other Southern European countries, such as Spain and Greece, where young people tend to remain with their parents until their late 20s and early 30s, leaving home only when they get married, the ways in which children respond to these factors have attracted increasing attention in the public policy debate in most European countries. For example, policymakers may be interested in reducing the adverse impact of delayed cohabitation on an array of children’s outcomes, including individual motivations and ambitions, reservation wages, labor market entry and geographical mobility (Billari and Tabellini 2010). A further cause of concern involves the phenomenon of falling fertility rates associated with prolonged co-residence (Giuliano 2007). Combined with the effects of population aging, this phenomenon raises the elderly dependency ratio, thereby contributing to placing extra pressure on the long-term financial sustainability of pension systems. In the literature to date, many studies have shown that parental retirement significantly affects children’s living arrangements decisions, thus suggesting that household composition responds to changes in household income. For example, Edmonds et al. (2005), exploiting a special feature of the South African pension system as a source of exogenous variation in household income, show that in African households, when a woman becomes pension eligible, there is a rise in the numbers of young women of childbearing age and children younger than five but a fall in the number of prime working-age women, who leave the parental home in search of work. Using a similar identification strategy from the exogenous variability in the Italian pension reforms during the 1990s, Manacorda and Moretti (2006) and Battistin et al. (2009) also show that there are sizeable changes in household composition when a parent becomes pension eligible. However, while both studies find that parental retirement in Italy induces a significant decline in the number of adult children living with their parents, they offer two competing explanations for this pattern. On the one hand, Manacorda and Moretti (2006) argue that once parents retire, they are no longer able to make a financial transfer to their children and thus are unable to bribe them to stay at home because of the drop in their post-retirement income. On the other hand, Battistin et al. (2009) emphasize that liquidity considerations are unlikely to play a role because Italy is one of the few European countries where most Italian employees receive a generous lump-sum payment upon retirement. Therefore, they suggest that parents may use part of their severance payment to buy a house for their sons and daughters, who can then leave the parental home. Nonetheless, not only changes in family income but also social factors may alter children’s decisions to leave the parental home. For example, Angelini and Laferrère (2013) find that the nest-leaving age is influenced not only by the parental income but also by the housing quality. The authors point out that the housing quality effects are indeed important: children’s nest-leaving is delayed with a more comfortable, less crowded home or which offers more privacy. Overall, the lack of a cross-country analysis severely limits the ability to clarify whether the housing emancipation of young adults upon parents’ retirement can be attributed to cash problems faced by parents, as suggested by Manacorda and Moretti (2006), to the receipt of a sizeable retirement allowance, as noted by Battistin et al. (2009), or to social factors, including, for instance, housing characteristics at the time of children’s nest-leaving. Thus, there is a need for empirical work to test which of the channels dominates in practice. This paper contributes to the extant literature by using a European dataset to investigate whether and to what extent paternal retirement affects children’s nest-leaving, and then to test the relative weight of these alternative hypotheses and shed some light on the mechanism. To address problems of reverse causation and endogeneity of paternal retirement, I estimate a bivariate discrete-time hazard model with shared frailty (Abbring and Van den Berg 2003) for the impact of paternal retirement on the timing of children’s nest-leaving. Furthermore, to provide random variation in the timing of paternal retirement, I strengthen my identification strategy by employing changes in eligibility rules for early retirement benefits that were implemented across European countries during the period 1961–2007 as an exclusion restriction. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper that makes use of this exogenous source of variation to children’s living arrangements to assess whether and to what extent paternal retirement caused their children to leave the nest. Compared to the linear IV strategy, the hazard specification provides a more appropriate statistical framework for modeling time-to-event/survival outcomes and accounting for right-censoring, thereby allowing me to overcome certain limitations faced by previous IV studies. Finally, the bivariate hazard model offers greater flexibility in handling nonlinear baseline hazards and nonlinear effects of covariates and provides a novel approach to identifying treatment effects by modeling unobserved heterogeneity explicitly through bivariate specification. To conduct this analysis, I use data from the second wave (2006) of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). This European dataset has three important features. First, it collects data on the current economic, health and family conditions of over 30,000 individuals aged fifty and above in several European countries. Second, it provides retrospective information on the retirement age of the respondents and the nest-leaving ages of their children. This information is exploited to construct duration variables that indicate the time elapsed before each event occurs. Lastly, because it is designed to be cross-nationally comparable, this dataset enables me to properly conduct a multi-country analysis. Furthermore, I employ data regarding European early retirement legislation by relying on Angelini et al. (2009), Mazzonna and Peracchi (2012) and the country-specific studies discussed in Gruber and Wise (2004). It should be noted, however, that across the countries considered in the present investigation there are very different cultural histories, labor market institutions and social characteristics. Such differences may play a lasting role in explaining the substantial heterogeneity in the ages of children when they leave home across Europe (Aassve et al. 2002; Billari et al. 2001) and may not be entirely captured by including country fixed effects in the model estimated using the pooled sample from multiple countries. To mitigate this concern, I conduct the main analysis by European region. These regions correspond to the geographical aggregation into Northern European countries (Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands), Central European countries (Austria, Germany, Switzerland, France and Belgium) and Southern European countries (Italy, Spain and Greece). According to the previous literature (see, for example, Albertini et al. 2007; Albertini and Kohli 2013), this aggregation is particularly relevant because it reflects profound differences in welfare states and family regimes across the above-mentioned country groups. One implication of this division is that the conditional impact of early retirement eligibility rules on paternal retirement and children’s nest-leaving outcomes is allowed to vary between Northern, Central and Southern European countries. Overall, my results demonstrate that paternal retirement has a positive and significant effect on the timing of children’s nest-leaving only in Southern European countries. In this European region, the magnitude of the effect varies between 1.2 and 5 %, and there are no significant differences between sons and daughters. Focusing on Southern Europe, I find that the mechanism through which this pattern may occur remains an open issue because it cannot be attributed to families’ liquidity problems or a severance payment at the time of paternal retirement. One must probably focus on channels involving the provision of informal child care provided by grandparents or the home quality at the time of children’s nest-leaving. These findings are robust to a number of specification checks. On the policy side, the results of this paper suggest that in Southern Europe there are potentially unintended and undesirable consequences of pension reforms that raise the retirement age on decisions by young people to move out of their parents’ homes. Therefore, it is important that such pension reforms are accompanied by policy programs (e.g., interventions in the housing market) that encourage home-leaving of young adults. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a description of the data and provides background information on the eligibility ages for retirement in Europe. Section 3 describes the empirical specification and identification strategy. The main results of the paper are presented in Sects. 4, and 5 illustrates the robustness checks. I discuss the results in Sect. 6, and concluding remarks are provided in Sect. 7.",5

Some evidence from Italy,June 2017,Maria De Paola,Francesca Gioia,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In recent years a growing body of economic literature has tried to include a more complex psychological dimension of individual decisions, both in theoretical models and in empirical analyses. A wide range of psychological traits have been found to be strong predictors of lifetime outcomes and success in life. For many outcomes psychological traits seem to be just as predictive as cognitive skills (Almlund et al. 2011). Among psychological traits, the ones that have mainly attracted economists’ interest are those reflecting two important dimensions of the utility function, namely risk aversion and time preferences. Numerous empirical and experimental works confirm the relevance of inter-temporal and risk preferences for a very high number of domains such as education (Belzil and Leonardi 2007; Caner and Okten 2010; Castillo et al. 2011; Cadena and Keys 2011; De Paola and Gioia 2012, 2013), labour market outcomes (Della Vigna and Paserman 2005; Drago 2006; Ahn 2010; Dohmen et al. 2010a, b; Dohmen and Falk 2011; Pollmann et al. 2012), health (Sutter et al. 2013; Golsteyn et al. 2014) and immigration (Jaeger et al. 2010). However, the role of these variables on marriage, divorce and fertility is much less studied. Family breakdown has important implications for a number of societal outcomes, such as inequality and child wellbeing. Therefore, the understanding of its determinants is very important, though still limited. Existing literature has mainly focused on a number of socio-economic factors, such as age at marriage, education and unemployment (Lehrer 2008), while little attention has been paid to the role played by psychological traits and preferences (Lundberg 2012). As regards risk attitudes, Spivey (2010) analyses their role in shaping marriage decisions and shows that more risk averse individuals tend to get married sooner than their more risk loving counterparts and that this effect is larger in magnitude and more statistically significant for men, maybe because women appreciate having a risk averse mate. In addition, Schmidt (2008) finds that risk-tolerant women are more likely to delay marriage and that higher tolerance for risk is positively correlated to giving births at a young age. Light and Ahn (2010), on the other hand, focus on the relationship between risk preferences and divorce, finding that, conditional to the expected gains from marriage and divorce, the probability of divorce increases with relative risk tolerance. By using data from the German Socio-economic Panel Study, Lundberg (2012) does not find any significant effect of risk aversion on marriage (by age 35) for older cohorts, while a negative relationship emerges for younger female cohorts. On the other hand, risk aversion reduces the divorce hazard for women in both older and younger cohorts. In this paper, we contribute to this literature by focusing on the relationship between time preferences and marriage stability. Even though economic theory typically models divorce decisions as choices involving a trade-off between costs and benefits occurring in different periods of time, individual time preferences are usually ignored. Compton (2009) made the only attempt to consider the role of time preferences on divorce. She presents a game theoretical model which shows that following a negative shock whose temporary or permanent nature is uncertain for spouses at the time it occurs, patient individuals are more likely to remain in a marriage relationship, hoping that the shock is temporary. Despite the lack of academic work on the relationship between time preferences and marriage stability, common wisdom considers patience as a key ingredient for marital success. Marriage stability is often the result of the spouses’ willingness to make short term “sacrifices” for the long term viability of their marriage. Patience is likely to improve everyday interaction and communication within the couple which will have positive effects on the duration of the relationship. Time preferences can also affect the way in which individuals react to unanticipated shocks that negatively affect their relationships. In fact, patient individuals may be more inclined to sustain the immediate costs deriving from staying in a troubled marriage and wait for an improvement in the relationship. Time preferences can also affect marriage stability through the initial quality of the match. As suggested in the seminal work by Becker et al. (1977), dedicating greater effort to the search for a consort is an investment decision involving immediate costs and future gains in terms of better marriage opportunities. Therefore, impatient individuals are more likely to invest less and end up with a worse match. Furthermore, as in job search models (Della Vigna and Paserman 2005), impatience can also affect the quality of the match by driving the reservation policy chosen by each individual (Burdett and Cole 1999). The quality of the match will, in turn, affect the probability of divorce as unanticipated shocks are less destabilising if partners are well matched. Nevertheless, the direction of the relationship between impatience and divorce decisions is not so straightforward. It is also true that ending a marriage involves a number of immediate costs, such as the cost of the legal proceedings, of finding a new place to live, of building economic autonomy, of accepting having failed at being a wife/husband/parent and so on. These costs are sustained by people who decide to get divorced because they expect some future benefits from this decision. In this view, divorce might represent an investment decision which patient individuals might be more likely to undertake. Investigating the relationship between time preferences and marriage/divorce decisions empirically may clarify the direction of the effect. However, such analysis is often hampered by the lack of appropriate data. In this paper, we use data from Italy, a country that, notwithstanding its long tradition of a stable family system, is now experiencing a progressive rise in divorce. To be more precise, we use data from the 2004 and 2010 waves of the Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW). The use of these data has the advantage of providing a direct measure of time preferences. This measure is based on a hypothetical financial situation in which individuals have to decide how much money to give up in order to receive a certain amount of money today instead of in one year’s time. Although some papers have provided evidence that measures of time preferences are relatively stable overtime (Meier and Sprenger 2010; Krupka and Stephens 2013; Wölbert and Riedl 2013), to avoid reverse causality problems that may emerge when using measures of impatience computed at the same moment at which marital status is observed, we have restricted our sample to the panel component of individuals for whom we have observations both in 2004 and in 2010. We focus on individuals who were married in 2004 and look at their probability of getting divorced in the time interval 2004–2010. The measure of impatience and all our controls are computed by using answers to the 2004 survey. Our measure of time preferences is based on a hypothetical question asked within a broad survey collecting information on income, financial assets, properties, consumption and investment decisions. As underlined by Ventura (2003), this reduces concerns about its reliability because individuals who are asked such economic questions together with the hypothetical one, link the hypothetical situation to their real lives better. Moreover, the reliability of our indicator of patience is tested by checking its correlation with variables which have been proven to be strongly influenced by time preferences. We estimate a probit model for the probability of getting divorced. By controlling for an array of variables aimed at capturing the gains from marriage and divorce, we find that time preferences affect the decision to get a divorce and that impatient individuals are more likely to experience divorce. Indeed, an increase of 20 % in the discount rate over its mean increases the probability of divorcing by 0.2 % points, which implies an increase of about 7 % in the probability of divorce over its mean. These results are robust to different specifications of our model and to the inclusion of different controls. As time preferences might correlate with risk aversion, our results may be driven by the fact that more patient individuals are more risk averse (De Paola 2012) and, as shown by Light and Ahn (2010), more risk averse individuals are less likely to experience separation or divorce. Unfortunately, the 2004 wave of the SHIW does not provide any information on individuals’ risk attitudes. This information is, though, available in the 2010 wave of the survey, which asks individuals to choose the amount of money they would like to invest in a hypothetical risky lottery. Therefore, we use data from this wave to analyse the relationship between time preferences and marriage stability by controlling for risk attitudes. Taking the level of risk aversion as constant, time preferences continue to play a role and more impatient individuals are more likely to experience a marriage breakdown. Although in such an analysis the measures of time preferences and risk attitudes are computed at the same moment at which marital status is observed, results from previous estimates (which do not suffer from reverse causality problems) reassure us that the relationship between time and risk preferences and divorce is unlikely to derive exclusively from the effect that marital condition has on preferences. Our analysis contributes to the emerging literature on the effect of time and risk preferences on marriage stability by providing additional evidence on this issue and by improving on some aspects. Our results are in line with those emerging from Compton (2009) who, considering the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, finds that patient individuals are less likely to divorce especially in the earlier years of marriage. One advantage of our study is that we use a direct measure of time preferences, whilst Compton relies on indirect measures such as smoking, contraceptive use and the assessment of the interviewer on whether or not the interviewee was impatient or restless. In addition, we control for a direct measure of risk aversion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that jointly considers the influence of time and risk preferences on divorce. By controlling for risk aversion, we both check that our results are not driven by the fact that discount rates are correlated to risk aversion and analyse the effect that risk aversion produces on divorce probability. Our results confirm those found by Light and Ahn (2010) for the US, which showed that less risk averse individuals are more likely to experience separation or divorce. We also contribute to the rather limited quantity of literature investigating divorce determinants in Italy. We find that couples who have children and live in the southern part of the country are less inclined to divorce. On the other hand, individuals who earn higher incomes and those who live in large towns show a higher divorce probability. Women who were heads of households in 2004 are more likely to divorce than men in the same position, confirming that female economic independence is a crucial determinant in divorce decisions. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in the empirical analysis. Section 3 presents the probit estimates of the probability of experiencing separation or divorce. In Section 4, we check the robustness of our results by using a larger sample which also allows us to control for risk aversion. Section 5 concludes.",13
15.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,13 April 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-014-9246-9,Breastfeeding practices and parental employment in Japan,June 2017,Miki Kobayashi,Emiko Usui,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Abundant evidence has demonstrated the short- and long-term health benefits of breastfeeding for both children and mothers. For children, the benefits of breastfeeding include protection against childhood infectious diseases, decreased risk for both chronic diseases and sudden infant death syndrome (Howie et al. 1990; Beral et al. 2002; Ip et al. 2007; and WHO/UNICEF 2009), a positive association with higher intelligence scores (Borra et al. 2012; McCrory and Layte 2011), and reduced risk for being overweight or obese later on (McCrory and Layte 2012). The health benefits for breastfeeding mothers include reduced postpartum bleeding, contraceptive effect of delays in the resumption of the menstrual cycle, faster shrinking of the uterus, and decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. In a global public health recommendation, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared in 1990 that infants should be exclusively breastfed until 6 months of age, with breastfeeding continuing until the child is 2 years of age or more (WHO/UNICEF 1990). Based on this recommendation, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan has been promoting and supporting breastfeeding by, for example, creating the “Support Guide for Breastfeeding and Weaning” (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare 2007) for medical practitioners. Researchers in many countries have shown that there exists a conflict between breastfeeding and the mothers’ return to work after childbirth. Chatterji and Frick (2005), for example, find that for mothers in the US who return to work within 3 months after childbirth, the probability of initiating breastfeeding decreases by 16–18 % and the duration of breastfeeding is shortened by 4–5 weeks. Focusing on the increase in maternity-leave mandates in Canada, Baker and Milligan (2008) find that with every additional month not at work after childbirth, the duration of breastfeeding is prolonged by 2.6 weeks. Other studies that find an incompatibility between maternal employment and breastfeeding include Roe et al. (1999), Haider et al. (2003), and Mandal et al. (2010, 2012) for the US, Gatrell (2007) for the UK, and Cooklin et al. (2008) for Australia. In Japan, over the past 20 years, approximately 60 % of working women quit their jobs because of pregnancy or childbirth (Cabinet Office, Government of Japan 2012), and only 27.1 % of mothers work when their firstborn child is 1 year old (National Institute of Population and Social Security Research 2010). Although the reason why mothers leave the labor force is to care for children, which goes well beyond breastfeeding, combining work and breastfeeding may be especially challenging for mothers in Japan, because support for breastfeeding in the Japanese workplace has been quite limited. To date, however, very little research conducted in Japan has examined to what extent maternal employment is compatible with breastfeeding practices. To begin with, few studies have investigated associations between breastfeeding duration and mothers’ socioeconomic and educational status in Japan (Inoue et al. 2012). Furthermore, previous studies on breastfeeding in countries other than Japan have focused on the compatibility between breastfeeding and maternal employment, but have paid less attention to the effect of fathers’ work arrangements on breastfeeding practices. Since mothers may already be overburdened by infant care and domestic chores, fathers’ increased time at home may ease their wives’ burden and this makes breastfeeding more feasible. For this reason, in this paper we investigate to what extent this linkage exists in Japan. Until recently, it has not been possible to empirically investigate factors that influence breastfeeding practices in Japan because of data limitations. Three national surveys administered by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare collect data on breastfeeding: (1) the National Nutrition Survey on Infants and Preschool Children, (2) the National Growth Survey on Infants and Preschool Children, and (3) the Longitudinal Survey of Babies in Twenty-first Century (Babies born in 2001 and 2010). The first two surveys collect data decennially on infants’ feeding methods and foods since 1985 and 1960, respectively. However, the surveys do not collect information on family background characteristics; the first survey lacks data on parents’ education and employment status and the number of children in the household, and the second survey lacks data on parents’ education and fathers’ employment status. The third survey, which samples children born in January and July of 2001 and 2010, does collect information on family background characteristics; it also asks about mothers’ breastfeeding practices when their youngest child was 6 months of age. Since the median duration of breastfeeding is about 12 months for women in Japan (see Fig. 1), the length of completed breastfeeding spells is not available for many mothers in this survey. Furthermore, data on mothers’ breastfeeding practices are limited to their youngest child, and therefore the sample does not allow an estimation of mother fixed-effects models that could account for the correlation between maternal employment and unobserved maternal characteristics. Number of months of breastfeeding. Data source: LOSEF To overcome these problems, we use newly gathered data from the 2012 Japanese Longitudinal Survey on Employment and Fertility (LOSEF). The LOSEF collects information not only on parents’ socioeconomic status, but also on past fertility history, including data on breastfeeding and changes in parents’ employment before and after childbirth for each child. For breastfeeding practices, we have information on (1) breastfeeding initiation, and (2) breastfeeding duration, which is the number of months, if any, that the mother breastfed the child. Using this survey, we examine the factors that influence breastfeeding practices by estimating a logit model for breastfeeding initiation and an OLS model for breastfeeding duration. For both breastfeeding initiation and duration, we also estimate mother fixed-effects models. We find that breastfeeding tends to be initiated by mothers with a higher level of education, but among mothers who initiate breastfeeding, the duration of breastfeeding does not differ significantly by education. Breastfeeding initiation does not differ by birth order either, but its duration tends to be longer for the firstborn child. Breastfeeding initiation is higher and the duration is longer for mothers from younger generations, for mothers who give birth to a singleton, and for mothers who give birth at an older age. In Japan, breastfeeding initiation does not significantly differ between mothers who return to work within a year after childbirth and those who leave the job after childbirth, but the breastfeeding duration is shorter by 1.654 months for the former group. However, when fathers work under a flextime system after childbirth, mothers’ breastfeeding initiation increases and the duration increases by 4.418 months, indicating that when fathers provide assistance and support in early childrearing, it encourages mothers to initiate and continue breastfeeding. Therefore, allowing fathers to work under a flextime system promote the practice of breastfeeding in Japan.",8

Fungibility means that any type of income is a perfect substitute for another and it implies that the type of income does not affect its use. Put differently, there should not be any compositional effect of income on expenditure. However, recent research shows that labeling effects often yield violations of this basic principle. Intuitively, a label attached to a transfer or income affects a consumer’s perception in a way that distorts decisions towards the label. A well-known characterization of labeling effects is the mental accounting framework which suggests that individuals think of their resources as separate accounts (Thaler 1980, 1985, 1990, 1999). Each mental account implies a different propensity to consume the respective goods. Thus, changing the relative size of mental accounts while holding the income level constant changes consumption patterns. Other explanations for violations of fungibility can be found in theories of decision framing or narrow bracketing (Tversky and Kahneman 1981; Barberis et al. 2006; Rabin and Weizsäcker 2009). In this class of models consumers tackle small isolated decisions to solve more complex problems. Violations of fungibility can also result from reciprocity towards the bestowing party (Gouldner 1960). Welfare recipients, then, would try to act in the interest of the institution which paid out the benefit. Child benefits as a labeled transfer have stimulated researchers’ interest in the effect on families’ spending patterns.Footnote 1 The empirical literature has so far produced ambiguous results. Dutch child benefits increase expenditure on assignable children’s clothes disproportionately which is clear indication of a labeling effect (Kooreman 2000). To the contrary, in the United Kingdom no such effect is found. Instead, child benefits are spent disproportionately on adult goods like alcohol and tobacco, while the households’ clothes and food expenditure is found unaffected from child benefit increases (Edmonds 2002; Blow et al. 2012). The evidence, though, is incomprehensive. Family welfare is not only determined by short-term expenditure but also by long-term savings, which have been overlooked in the literature. In this paper, I exploit a child benefits reform to estimate the impact of a labeled transfer on child-assignable savings. Between 1978 and 1983 German child benefits were expanded for third children and to some extent for second children while they remained constant for first children. This allows me to use quasi-experimental research design in order to eliminate confounding variation that is common to all families. I identify the effect of a relative increase in labeled income from child benefits. If income was fungible, the income source should not affect household savings decisions. I use the German Income and Expenditure Survey (EVS) to analyze the effects on different savings measures. I distinguish between housing savings plans, securities, life insurances, and bank books. I argue that housing savings plans can be considered as child-specific savings and show suggestive evidence for the assumption. Furthermore, I analyze the effect on four child- and four adult-assignable consumption expenditures. Using difference-in-differences estimation, I find that the treatment group increases the probability to save in a housing savings plan by up to 6.6 percentage points and increases savings contributions by up to a third. The finding is consistent with a labeling effect of child benefits and hard to explain otherwise. I do not find an effect on other savings outcomes that are less connected to child welfare. Regarding consumption, I find mixed evidence. There is partly robust evidence for increases in child-assignable education and toy expenditure. I do not find evidence for effects on adult-assignable consumption. A possible explanation for the weaker evidence in the consumption domain is that families might satisfy the most basic needs out of their own incomes and allocate additional resources to more long-term investments. Eventually, the outlooks of a child’s life might be more dependent on these savings than on contemporaneous consumption. The results are robust to a number of different specifications and tests. I include comprehensive sets of control variables and find the savings results to be robust. Moreover, I apply estimations on accumulated savings, total savings and savings rates which all suggest that the baseline results are plausible. The savings results are also robust to a relative trend assumption I impose in an alternative specification of the difference-in-differences estimator. I test the plausibility of common trends in housing savings plans with two unaffected groups and find no evidence for violation of the assumption. For policy makers evidence on labeling effects is of particular interest as labeling cash transfers is virtually costless. The results suggest that labeling is effective to promote a desired behavior beyond consumption. Countries struggling with low private savings rates, thus, could relabel existing benefits before applying more costly measures. Furthermore, family policies in many countries involving cash transfers may shine in a new light as they are already labeled accordingly [e.g. Child Tax Credit (CTC) in the United States, Child Benefit (CB) and Children’s Tax Credit (CTC) in the United Kingdom, and Child Benefits (Kindergeld) in Germany]. These programs have in common the intention to mitigate financial constraints of families and to prevent child poverty which becomes ever more likely in the presence of labeling effects. The results also contribute to a broader literature that finds support for labeling effects and mental accounting in other domains. For example, randomly allocated and non-distortionary beverage vouchers make customers of a restaurant increase their expenditure on beverage consumption which cannot be explained by standard theory (Abeler and Marklein 2010). The perception of costs of goods can depend on the time between purchase and consumption; people perceive purchases intended to be consumed later as investments and detach the costs from consumption (Shafir and Thaler 2006). Non-fungibility of income might also explain why increases in housing benefits are to a large extent offset by increasing rents (Cage 1994; Susin 2002; Fack 2006). Bono de Desarrollo Humano cash transfers to women in Ecuador increase food expenditure (Schady and Rosero 2008), which may be due to a labeling effect or to changes in the intra-household allocation in favor of women. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, I describe the empirical approach and the data. In Sect. 3, I report baseline results and various robustness checks in Sect. 4. I conclude the analysis in Sect. 5.",4

Kirby,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the US, there are large and persistent racial/ethnic differences in access to medical care. While the sweeping changes brought by the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act (2010) (PPACA) may reduce these gaps, they will likely not eliminate them. Expansions in health insurance coverage brought by the PPACA will still leave millions of people uninsured (Nardin et al. 2013). Furthermore, findings from previous research suggest that disparities in access would not be eliminated even if universal coverage were achieved. A number of studies show that racial/ethnic differences in health care access persist even after controlling for health insurance status and its interaction with other important variables such as income and education (Hargraves et al. 2001; Pylypchuk and Hudson 2009; Zheng and Zimmer 2009). These findings suggest that there are barriers to health care access not directly related to cost that may be important in understanding racial and ethnic disparities. In this paper, we suggest that racial and ethnic differences in marriage could explain some of the differences in access to care. Marriage not only brings with it opportunities for employer sponsored health insurance (Zimmer 2007; Jovanovic et al. 2003), but a myriad of obligations and motivations for securing and maintaining adequate access to health care. At the same time, compared to whites, both blacks and Hispanics are less likely to be married (Table 1). Racial and ethnic differences in marital status may therefore be an important explanation for the persistence of racial and ethnic disparities in health care access and use. This study makes several contributions to the existing literature. First, we investigate the extent to which marriage is associated with improved access (hereafter referred to as the “returns to marriage”) and how the association differs by race and ethnicity. Second, we estimate the extent to which racial and ethnic differences in marital rates and returns to marriage explain differences in access to care using the Oaxaca (1973)–Blinder (1973) decomposition method. This enables us to show how much racial and ethnic differences in access would narrow if minority groups had the marital rates of whites and benefited from marriage to the same degree as whites. Finally, we propose that differences in the returns to marriage by race/ethnicity may reflect differences in the characteristics of spouses—in other words, who one marries, not just whether they marry, is important. In particular, ethnic/racial groups who marry spouses with high socio-economic statuses likely benefit more from marriage due to their ability to contribute resources to the family. Similarly, spouses with stronger preferences for and positive beliefs about medical care are likely to have stronger influences on their partners’ behaviors. We demonstrate that there are indeed large racial and ethnic differences in spousal characteristics such as educational attainment, income, and preferences for care, and estimate the extent to which these differences explain differences in access between married and unmarried people across the racial and ethnic groups.",3

Altindag,John Nunley,Alan Seals,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The nuclear family and the laws which govern its dissolution underwent dramatic change in the United States beginning in the 1960s. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, many states moved from a maternal preference regime to joint custody of children following a divorce (Brinig and Buckley 1998). In the U.S., most divorced parents now rear their children under some form of joint-parenting agreement (Allen et al. 2010). Altering the expected custodial allocation of children has been shown to affect marriage and divorce outcomes, child support receipt, investment in children’s education and labor force participation of married women (Allen et al. 2010; Allen and Brinig 2011; Brinig and Allen 2000; Brinig and Buckley 1998; Gonzalez-Val and Marcen 2012; Halla 2012; Nunley and Seals 2011). In this study, we investigate whether joint-custody reform influences time allocation within households by examining the reform’s impact on the amount of time that spouses with children devote to market and household work. The predicted impact of joint-custody reform on the time that married mothers and fathers devote to market and household work depends on the economic model of family behavior being used.Footnote 1 If custody reform affects the balance of power but not preferences or the joint-consumption set, unitary models predict no change in the intrahousehold allocation decisions made by households in response to custody reform (Becker 1991; Browning et al. 2006; Samuelson 1956). By contrast, divorce-threat bargaining models (Manser and Brown 1980; McElroy and Horney 1981) and collective models (Chiappori et al. 2002) predict that policy changes, such as custody reform, can result in different allocation decisions by altering the balance of power between spouses within marriage. Indeed, there is evidence that custody reforms may empower fathers, which could generate intrahousehold resource allocation decisions that reflect fathers’ preferences to a greater extent (Nunley and Seals 2011). In order to investigate the possible effect of joint-custody laws on spouses’ time allocations, we use the exogenous variation provided by custody reforms across states combined with individual-level panel data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSIDs).Footnote 2 The PSID includes consistent measures that capture the amount of time each parent allocates to market and household work over time. In addition, the period spanned by the PSID covers the period in which the majority of custody reforms took place, making these data ideal for investigating how the prospect of shared child custody affects within-marriage time allocation. Our study contributes to the existing literature on custody reform and household labor supply in a number of ways. First, our longitudinal data (PSID) provides a way to account for potential selection effects into and out of marriage based on custody reform, as individuals are observed before and after marriage. Second, our paper investigates the effect of child-custody reform on both labor force participation and hours worked in the market, unlike previous research that focused only on the extensive margin. In addition, our paper is the first to consider the responsiveness of time allocated to household work to the changes in child-custody laws. The examination of both market and household work provides a clearer picture of how custody reform affects time allocation within marriage. Our findings indicate that married mothers allocate more time to market work and married fathers allocate more time to household work in response to custody reform. The increase in market hours for mothers is substantially larger than the increase in time allocated to household work by fathers. Specifically, mothers work approximately 80 additional hours per year in the market, and fathers allocate about 40 more hours to household work annually. Custody reforms also reduce the labor-force-participation rates of married fathers by about 2 %. Fathers’ contributions to market and total work fall relative to that of mothers. Thus, custody reform results in the relative burden of market and household work falling disproportionately on mothers. These results are largely consistent with models that emphasize shifts in the balance of power between spouses (Browning and Chiappori 1998; Chiappori et al. 2002; Manser and Brown 1980; McElroy and Horney 1981). It is likely that custody reform alters the balance of power within marriage such that fathers are favored, which results in allocation decisions reflecting their preferences to a greater extent.",10
15.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,29 August 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-015-9307-8,The effects of the Chilean divorce law on women’s first birth decisions,September 2017,Jose V. Gallegos,Jan I. Ondrich,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In this paper we evaluate the effect of the introduction of divorce in Chile in 2004 on a woman’s decision regarding when to have a first child. The evolution of Chilean society and the historical trends of the regulation of marriage in Chile provide a rich context to study a topic where the economic literature has yet to form a consensus. In 1884 the regulation and registration of marriages passed from the Catholic Church to the State. However, the influence of the Church was not eliminated, especially with regard to the termination of marriages. Couples were not allowed to divorce until 2004, when new legislation introduced the concept of “divorce a vincula matrimonii” or complete divorce, under which either spouse can request a complete termination of the marriage. The new legislation also introduced monetary compensation for a spouse who gives up professional development or advancement for the good of the household. The Chilean divorce law (henceforth, DL) standardizes the process through which a marriage is terminated and thereby removes the uncertainty and potential negotiation costs the couple would incur if they decide to obtain the divorce. Becker (1974) suggests that the outcome of a divorce is related to specific investments made during the marriage, and lists children as one such type of investment. A married couple receives utility from children, but if the time cost of raising a child falls mainly on the woman, her career prospects are reduced. If this cost outweighs the benefit to the woman herself, having children reduces her net utility, and she would opt not to do so. If children are potentially Pareto-improving, the man might offer to transfer resources to the woman in order to compensate her for the costs she bears, so that having the child would become individually rational for both parties. While such a transfer may be fairly easy to implement for couples who anticipate being able to cooperate indefinitely, others may be unable to make such an arrangement unless they could count on an external enforcement mechanism. The system in place in Chile before the divorce law was introduced could not provide that enforcement, and many separated men were able to avoid making spousal support payments. Thus, the new divorce law in effect raises fertility because it rectifies a market failure by making some desirable implicit contracts feasible. The increase in fertility may actually have little to do with the ability to divorce itself, but instead is driven by the fact that the divorce law now enforces implicit contracts concerning alimony. It may also account for an increase in non-marital fertility, assuming that the courts now make a greater effort to enforce child support payments more generally, which suggests that the divorce reform is more closely associated with decreases in the mean age of first-time mothers than with decreases in the mean age of first-time brides. Moreover, the effect on the fertility may be greater for women with higher potential incomes, because they have more to lose if their career is derailed.Footnote 1
 The goal of this paper is to determine the degree to which the DL affects a woman’s decision regarding when to have her first child. Using the Social Security Survey (Encuesta de Previsión Social–EPS) Panel 2002–2009, we find that the DL has a positive effect on the hazard rate of having a first child for more educated women, controlling for the woman’s age and length of marriage, the negative trend observed on fertility rates in Chile since the mid-1960s, and other socioeconomic characteristics. We also find that a higher potential income level is associated with an increase in the hazard rate for first birth. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the context in which the Chilean DL was introduced, and our motivation to focus on first birth. The third section consists of a review of the literature which focuses on divorce laws and fertility decisions. In the fourth section we present the data, describe the empirical strategy and discuss the results of the estimation. Finally, in the fifth section we present our conclusions.",3

Effects of child gender on household expenditures,September 2017,Krzysztof Karbownik,Michal Myck,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Children’s gender has been demonstrated to influence family stability (Dahl and Moretti 2008), fertility (Ben-Porath and Welch 1976; Das 1987), abortion rates (Sen 1990; Jha et al. 2006), investment in nutrition and child care (Behrman 1988; Jayachandran and Kuziemko 2011; Barcellos et al. 2012), household expenditure (Lundberg and Rose 2004), educational and behavioural outcomes (Bertrand and Pan 2013, Autor et al. 2015), voting preferences (Oswald and Powdthavee 2010) and labour market activity (Lundberg and Rose 2002; Ichino et al. 2013).Footnote 1 These effects are sometimes explained by gender-biased preferences of parents who, for example, would rather have a boy than a girl. On a number of outcomes, however, they are also consistent with gender-neutral preferences. In these instances, they refer to differences in costs of bringing up boys and girls, differences in the returns from investment in the child’s human capital (especially prevalent in the developing world) and the importance of gender-specific roles in the upbringing process. In some cases, such as the effect on voting behaviour, the most natural explanation is a direct causal consequence of children’s gender on changes in parental preferences.Footnote 2
 Using a detailed dataset on expenditures of Polish households, we extend the existing pool of evidence on the effects of children’s gender to include its role in changing household consumption behaviour. Focusing on expenditure patterns may provide further clues in understanding the mechanisms behind the already-identified effects on parental outcomes. If there is differential treatment of boys and girls by their parents, then it should be reflected in the way households allocate their resources, which is of particular importance in the light of the growing evidence on the role of early interventions (Blau and Currie 2006; Cascio 2009; Almond and Currie 2011; Carneiro and Ginja 2014) and investment in children in the form of prenatal care, vaccinations or medical care (Aizer 2003; Figlio et al. 2009; Levine and Schanzenbach 2009). Thus, differential levels of expenditure related to the child’s human capital development or on items that may solidify gender stereotypes could have long-term consequences for children’s outcomes in the future. The Polish Household Budget Survey (PHBS), which we use in this paper, offers a unique chance to study detailed patterns of household expenditures differentiated by a child’s gender as well as other family characteristics. In contrast to most expenditure datasets, in the PHBS it is possible to classify a number of detailed expenditures by age and gender. This allows us to split spending between adults and children aged up to 12 and by gender among adults.Footnote 3
 Using data for the years 2003–2011, in the main analysis we compare 14,893 married couples with first-born girls and 16,164 married couples with first-born boys to study the differential patterns of household expenditure.Footnote 4 Subsequently we restrict the sample to families with two children of the same gender where we compare households with two girls versus two boys.Footnote 5 Since we observe some families in two consecutive years, in total we work with the main sample of 46,185 observations and the two girls versus two boys sample of 9515 observations. We first discuss three main potential confounding factors, namely marital stability, fertility and labour supply. We then examine the effect of child’s gender on total expenditure, adult clothing expenditure (Lundberg and Rose 2004) and child-related expenditure items, such as spending on clothing for children aged below 13 and expenditure on kindergarten. Additionally, we examine two categories of expenditure that include mainly child-related goods, namely ‘games, toys and hobbies’ and ‘educational books and materials’. We confirm that having a first-born girl decreases marital stability and fertility, but we do not find any relationship between child’s gender and parental labour supply. Our findings suggest that the gender of children can have a significant effect on household expenditure patterns. We find that having a first-born girl increases spending on clothing and shoes by 3.6 %, and this overall effect is found to reflect a 7.2 % increase in spending on women’s clothing, a 5.8 % decrease on men’s clothing and a 6.0 % increase on children’s clothing (in all cases in the text when we refer to clothing, the category also includes shoes expenditure). Moreover, households with a first-born girl spend less on games, toys and hobbies (by 13.4 %). We show that expenditure data can also be used to examine differential investment in human capital of sons and daughters. For example we find some suggestive yet not definitive evidence that spending on kindergarten in Poland is lower for girls. Overall the findings seem to point towards a gender-stereotypical pattern of child-related expenditure rather than deliberate differential investment in childhood human capital, with girls’ parents buying them more clothing and boys’ parents spending more on games. These findings naturally raise questions concerning long-term consequences of such behaviour for the development of boys and girls and their perception of social and gender roles. The findings on clothing expenditure are consistent with a number of potential hypotheses, and are in line with those already documented in the US for the total clothing expenditure (Lundberg and Rose 2004). First of all, the gender of the first child might have a direct effect on parents’ consumption preferences, which would be in line with the effect of having a girl on voting preferences (Oswald and Powdthavee 2010). Alternatively, mothers’ and daughters’ clothing might be complements, in which case spending more on one may lead to higher spending on the other, at the expense of fathers’ clothing. Our findings constitute first evidence suggestive of the fact that a child’s gender affects the patterns of both parental and child-related expenditure. On the one hand, this evidence may reflect the direct effect of a child’s gender on parental consumption preferences. On the other, it points towards a pattern of consumption suggestive of early assignment of stereotypical gender roles. Thus, girls get to look nice and boys get to play. Finally, we are also the first to study the relationship between children gender and household behaviour in a post-communist country.",3
15.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,17 May 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-015-9297-6,Teenagers’ risky health behaviors and time use during the great recession,September 2017,Sabrina Wulff Pabilonia,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Job losses during and after the Great Recession of 2008–2009 have had a tremendous impact on the health and incomes of a large number of Americans. Although numerous papers have examined the total effects of the Great Recession on adults and families, none has specifically focused on effects of the weakening economy during the Great Recession on the health behaviors and human capital investments made by teenagers aged 15–18, an especially vulnerable segment of the population. Teenagers may be affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions through numerous channels, including by direct changes to their own labor demand and future employment expectations, and by the financial and emotional stress resulting from the job losses experienced by their parents or the parents of their classmates (Ananat et al. 2011; Arkes and Klerman 2009; Bell and Blanchflower 2011). The direction of the total effects of an economic downturn on teenagers’ risky behaviors and time use is theoretically ambiguous (Arkes and Klerman 2009). A number of studies have found that during previous economic downturns, some teenagers engaged more than usual in risky health behaviors such as substance abuse and sexual activity (Arkes 2007, 2012; Arkes and Klerman 2009; Levine 2001). Arkes (2009) also found changes in teenage weight over the business cycle, with male teenagers losing weight and female teenagers gaining weight in weaker economic periods. However, these researchers lacked time diary data to examine some of the potential explanations, for example changes in parental supervision, for these changes in behavior over the business cycle. Even though parents may lose their jobs in a recession or have their hours cut, this does not necessarily mean that they will spend more time with their children, especially because their children are in school during the majority of the hours parents would typically be working. In fact, Morrill and Pabilonia (2015) found that mothers, who are still the primary childcare providers in the U.S., work more hours on weekends as the state-level unemployment rate increases, suggesting that parental supervision on weekends could fall. Aizer (2004) has documented that children aged 10–14 who are left unsupervised after school may engage more in risky behaviors such as skipping school, using alcohol or drugs, stealing something, or hurting someone. In addition, family members may choose to spend less time together if they are stressed or depressed due to financial difficulties. This paper contributes to the literature in the following ways: (1) documents the effects of changes in economic conditions on teenagers’ risky health behaviors during a time period that includes the Great Recession, (2) uses time diary data from the 2003–2011 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to examine several hypotheses about the potential mechanisms for these observed changes in behavior over the business cycle, including changes in the time teenagers spend being supervised by their parents, changes in time spent working, changes in sports participation, and changes in TV watching, and (3) describes other effects that the changing economic conditions over the 2003–2011 period have had on teenagers’ other major uses of time, especially effects related to investments in schooling-related human capital, which may affect the future earnings of this new cohort who are just beginning to enter the labor market. I use state-level unemployment rates to proxy for macroeconomic conditions in order to identify the total effects of the economy on teenagers’ activities. As in previous articles (e.g. Arkes 2007, 2012; Arkes and Klerman 2009; Ruhm 2000) that examined how changes in the economy affect behavior, the econometric model in this paper includes both state and year fixed effects, thus exploiting the variation in unemployment rates among states over time in order to identify the relationship between state-level unemployment rates and teenagers’ health behaviors and also between state-level unemployment rates and teenagers’ time use, while controlling for national trends and time invariant differences across states. It is important to control for national trends, for example, because teenager tobacco use has been falling (Arkes 2012) due to anti-smoking campaigns and changing state and national policies over time. In addition, Aguiar et al. (2013) found that leisure time has been increasing over time pre-Great Recession, and Smith (2012) showed that there has been a long downward trend in teenage employment that began in the 1990’s and accelerated in the early 2000’s. I do not examine the effects of a teen’s or parent’s employment status, because job loss may not be exogenous to intra-household time allocation and individuals may also respond to potential job loss by working harder or be assigned fewer hours due to reduced demand; my goal is to understand the total effects of macroeconomic conditions on teenagers’ activities rather than the partial effects. Results indicate that the effects vary by both gender and by race/ethnicity within gender groups. Black male teenagers engage less in sexual activity during poorer economic conditions, which is consistent with their spending more time with at least one of their parents. Consistent with a decrease in parental supervision, Hispanic male teenagers were more likely to have consumed alcohol or smoked marijuana in the past 30 days when the unemployment rate was higher. However, even though non-black, non-Hispanic (NBNH) male teenagers spent less time with their parents as the economy weakened, I do not find any significant changes in risky behaviors for this group. As the unemployment rate increased, Hispanic male teenagers were more likely to be obese, which is consistent with their also spending less time playing sports and working but more time watching TV. At the same time, female teenagers were not any more or less likely to spend time with their parents over the business cycle, but they did spend less time working during the recession and more time on educational activities, which could lead to future benefits. However, there are signs that teenage girls were stressed, because they slept less, smoked more regularly and, in the case of black female teenagers, were more likely to drink alcohol as the economy weakened.",11

Children’s imitation of parental reading,September 2017,Anna Laura Mancini,Chiara Monfardini,Silvia Pasqua,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Reading is a crucial activity in the process of human capital accumulation, as it is positively linked to educational outcomes and subsequent earnings (Connolly et al. 1992). Cunningham and Stanovich (2001) have shown that reading has accumulated effects over time, with profound implications for the development of a wide range of cognitive abilities, verbal skills, and declarative knowledge. Similarly, Stanovich (1986) emphasised the role of reading in increasing the efficiency of the cognitive process. In light of these benefits, educators and policy makers have been looking for ways to encourage young people to read. Research suggests that parents often transmit their preferences and habits to their children, and can thus act as role models in promoting reading (Mullan 2010). In this paper, we look at whether children imitate their parents’ reading activity. Imitation is an important channel for the intergenerational transmission of habits. It is widely assumed that parents directly influence the formation of children’s preferences by serving as role models. This suggests that active policies aimed at promoting good parenting behaviour could affect the reading habits of children. Clearly, the intergenerational transmission of attitudes towards reading occurs not only through imitative behaviours, but also through cultural and educational transmission from parents to children. While parents who wish to encourage their children to read can do so by reading to their children when they are very young (as in Kalb and van Ours 2014), teaching them the importance of reading, and providing them with books, Teale and Sulzby (1986) have found that adults’ reading habits also influence the reading habits of children. Studies on habit formation (Neal et al. 2006; Wood and Neal 2007) have shown that a large share of everyday actions are characterised by habitual repetition. Therefore, when parents read in the presence of their children, the children may develop the habit of reading through imitation. While reading is clearly not the only activity that builds human capital, the early acquisition of reading skills appears to facilitate the development of a lifetime habit of reading (Cunningham and Stanovich 1997), and therefore seems to have long-term and multiplying effects. Our analysis relies on the Italian Time Use Survey (2002–2003 and 2008–2009 pooled waves) conducted by ISTAT. While most Time Use Surveys collect data from only one member of each household, and rarely include children of primary school age, the Italian dataset provides detailed information on the time devoted to reading by both parents and their children, including when, with whom, and in the presence of whom the activity is performed. The availability of this information allows us to investigate whether children are more likely to allocate time to reading if they observed their parents engaged in this activity on the same day. We are able to examine the time children aged 6–15 devoted to reading on their own. As the dataset also includes information on a large number of siblings, we can identify the imitation effect using a family fixed-effects approach. We do so by exploiting the variation that occurs among siblings: different children, for exogenous reasons, may have been exposed differently to their parents’ reading activities on the survey day. This within-family variation allows us to isolate the causal effect of imitation from the effects of the household environment and education provided by the parents, which would have been experienced by all of the children in the household. Our identification strategy is validated by a number of robustness checks, which prove that the relationship and witnessing one or both of their parents reading is neither spurious nor mechanical. We find new and clear-cut evidence of the existence of an imitation effect, which confirms the truth of the adage that “a good example is the best sermon”. On the day of the survey, the probability that children spent time reading increased significantly after they saw their parents reading. We look separately at mothers and fathers, since past research has shown that individual parents can affect their children’s decisions and behaviour differently.Footnote 1 The probability that the child spent time reading increased from about 4 % to about 34 % when the mother was observed reading. The imitation effect for fathers was similar, raising the probability that a child spent time reading from about 5 % to about 36 %.
 Our research sheds new light on the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of preferences and attitudes that are essential for targeting human capital accumulation policies. Are parents able to influence their children’s preferences and choices through their behaviour? Can we assume that policies targeted at adults also have effects on members of the next generation, and are therefore more productive? Our findings suggest that role modelling by parents is one important channel through which parental time use may affect children’s behaviour and time allocation decisions, and thus future child outcomes. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the main literature. Section 3 describes the dataset used and the sample selection made for our empirical analysis. Section 4 presents the empirical strategy. The results and robustness checks are discussed in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes.",143

Wehby,Jason M. Hockenberry,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The prevalence of chronic conditions and health limitations among children has been rising in the past four decades (Perrin et al. 2007). The rate of adverse birth outcomes including preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW) has also been on the rise (Heron et al. 2010). Child disabilities or early life adverse health conditions can impact subsequent maternal fertility decisions in several ways as discussed below. Briefly, child disability or severe early life health problems such as very preterm birth (VPTB; gestational age <32 weeks) and very low birth weight (VLBW; birth weight <1500 g) may reduce fertility by constraining household resources to have another child and revealing information about potential heritable health risks. However, they may also increase parental demand for healthier children to compensate for parental loss in utility and/or to increase future household resources available to care for a disabled or less healthy sibling (such as when healthy siblings can care for less healthy ones). Despite the ongoing interest in the household behavioral responses to child health and disability, there has been limited investigation into the impacts of child disability and early life adverse health conditions on subsequent fertility among mothers in the US. We are aware of two previous studies that have examined the micro-level fertility behavior of a representative cohort of US women subsequent to giving birth to a child with disability (MacInnes 2008; Park et al. 2003). These studies estimate effects of child disability on subsequent fertility-related decisions by comparing mothers of disabled and non-disabled children. However, these comparisons may be biased by differences in unobserved preferences, maternal health factors and other family-level effects that vary between these two groups of mothers. In this paper we revisit the question of the impacts of having children with disabilities or with severe at-birth conditions including VLBW and VPTB on subsequent maternal fertility, acknowledging the potential heterogeneity in unobserved characteristics that relate to both child disability/health and fertility decisions. Our empirical model is differs from the previous literature in that we use mother fixed effects and only utilize within-mother variation in disability to estimate the fertility response. This allows us to capture the effect of disabled children on subsequent fertility net of any time invariant unobserved heterogeneity in preferences and health among mothers. For instance, maternal chronic health conditions may increase risk of child disability but also reduce propensity to have children. In addition to dealing with this issue of unobserved heterogeneity, we evaluate the effects of not only child disability but poor early infant health conditions measured by VLBW and VPTB. These are common, costly and burdensome conditions that signal potential future child health conditions and therefore deserve specific assessment for their potential effects on fertility behavior. Further, using at-birth health measures allows us to examine the issue of the timing of disability realization, which addresses a limitation in prior studies that only evaluate disability measures. Using the mother fixed effect model, we find no evidence that having a child with disability reduces subsequent fertility. If anything, the effects (while generally insignificant) are in the direction indicating an increase in fertility. In contrast, a classical model that uses both within and between mother variation indicates a decline in fertility in response to having a disabled child, as shown in other studies that used these models. We observe no impact of VPTB and VLBW on subsequent fertility using either model. To address the possibility that the AFDC which was in effect during our study period may modify maternal fertility decisions in eligible households, we re-estimate the models excluding women who may have qualified for AFDC and find generally similar results. Thus our findings may be generalized to the post AFDC period. Our results may still be influenced by time varying unobservables such as changes in maternal health and experiences. However, these are either on the causal pathway between the health of prior children and subsequent fertility or they likely result in a negative (opposite) bias in the estimated fertility response as discussed below. The within-mother fixed-effect estimates are primarily generalizable to the mothers contemplating having another child after having at least two children and may not necessarily apply to fertility responses to the health of the first child. We discuss below generalizability issues in detail.",4
15.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,11 March 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-015-9286-9,"Land ownership, the subsistence constraint, and the demographic transition",September 2017,Joel M. Guttman,Avi Tillman,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Ever since the pioneering work of Becker (1960), economists have been using economic theory to explain the dramatic “regime change” that occurred in nineteenth century Europe and which spread to the developing world in the twentieth century: a decline in fertility rates and a dramatic increase in per capita income, in contrast to the stagnant per capita income that characterized the preceding millenia of human history.Footnote 1 Three main mechanisms that have been studied are: (a) substitution of child “quality” for child “quantity,” (b) the role of urbanization in reducing the economic return to raising children, and (c) improvements in health, leading to lower child mortality and hence lower fertility. The present paper proposes a fourth explanation, complementing the three mechanisms cited above. Following Malthus, the model proposed here emphasizes the role of a minimum consumption level (denoted c
min): a level of consumption that is required for survival or which individuals view as absolutely “necessary,” even if this level is above the biological minimum for survival. While this theoretical element features prominently in the Unified Growth Theory developed by Galor and Weil (2000) and Galor and Moav (2002), it is not treated here as a constraint (like the income constraint) which affects behavior only if the constraint is binding. Instead, it is assumed that the marginal rate of substitution between own consumption and children as a source of utility goes to infinity as consumption approaches c
min. Thus the effect of c
min on fertility choice is continuous and exists (to some extent) even if income is considerably higher than c
min.Footnote 2
 
Jones (2001) presents a model that also predicts a demographic transition without assuming a quality–quantity tradeoff, and incorporates a subsistence constraint in a manner similar to ours. His model, however, differs from our model in several respects, particularly in his assumptions that there are no property rights to land, and that labor receives its average, not marginal product. Given Jones’ (2001) assumption that there are no property rights to land, he is forced to assume a greater-than-unity elasticity of substitution between parents’ consumption and children in the parents’ utility function, in order to obtain a time path of fertility that resembles the demographic transition. By making the more natural and realistic assumption that agents own land and thus receive non-wage income in addition to wage income, we explain the demographic transition without a need for Jones’ (2001) assumption on the elasticity of substitution between children and own consumption. In our model, the dividing line between the Malthusian and the Post-Malthusian regimes depends not on whether wage income is greater or less than c
min, but rather whether non-wage income is greater or less than c
min. The source of non-wage income is irrelevant to the model, but in nineteenth century Europe the main source of this income was the ownership of land. Thus the model leads us to take seriously the role of land, and particularly property rights to land, in the transition from the Malthusian to the Post-Malthusian regime. This emphasis on the role of land is quite new in neoclassical models of fertility and growth,Footnote 3 though it was a crucial element in the thinking of the classical economists like Smith and Malthus. More specifically, the model predicts that rising real wages (relative to land rents)—a feature of nineteenth century European economiesFootnote 4—will induce lower fertility only when non-wage income is above c
min.Footnote 5 This condition will tend to hold where ownership of land is relatively widespread in the population. Aside from the demographic transition itself, the model thus predicts a correlation between the timing of the demographic transitionFootnote 6 and the prevalence of land ownership.Footnote 7 Consider the contrast between the onset of the transition in England and Wales, on the one hand, and France on the other.Footnote 8 The demographic transition in France began about 60 years before the transition began in England.Footnote 9 Comparative data on land ownership are available only later, but in 1880, 60 % of all agricultural land in France was owned rather than leased by farmers, while in 1885 the corresponding figure for England and Wales was only 15 % (Swinnen 2002, Table 2). It should be emphasized that we do not claim that the demographic transition in France was a consequence of a change in the distribution of land ownership. While the Napoleonic Code that followed the French Revolution mandated that partible inheritance of land would replace primogeniture, the extent of the implementation of this aspect of the Code is debatable (Weir 1983). Our claim, instead, is that the relatively dispersed distribution of land ownership provided an economic setting favorable to the transition. The transition itself was a consequence of the increase in the real wage rate. In England, in contrast, this economic setting was absent, explaining the 60-year delay in the transition in England relative to France. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the fertility choice model. Section 3 embeds the fertility choice model in a simple general equilibrium model. It is shown that technological change, if it proceeds at a faster pace than population growth, induces first an increase, and then a decrease, in fertility over time. Section 4 discusses extending the general equilibrium model to a world of heterogenous agents, and the kind of evidence that can be used to test the model. Section 5 provides suggestive evidence from nineteenth century France that where land ownership was relatively dispersed, the effect of an increase in the rural wage rate on fertility was negative, whereas in départements where land ownership was relatively concentrated, the same effect was positive. Section 6 develops a model of endogenous growth based on the static model of Sects. 2 and 3, and presents a numerical example. Section 7 concludes.",
15.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,04 November 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-015-9314-9,Mother’s autonomy and child’s secondary schooling enrollment in Mexico,September 2017,Tanika Chakraborty,Prabal K. De,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"We address the question whether more decision-making power in the hands of a female member in the family has the same welfare effects as equivalent powers in the hands of a male member. In the context of both developed and developing countries, it has been found that the effects of a dollar earned by a female member of a family instead of a male member has led to an increase in food expenditure (Attanasio and Lechene 2014), an increase in health inputs like prenatal care (Maitra 2004), improved sex ratio (Qian 2008), and an increase in investment in girls (Antman 2015). Several countries have implemented policies that are geared towards greater transfer of income towards women such as micro-credit lending, and conditional cash payments. We try to extend the literature on two related issues. First, we provide a direct measure of female autonomy as opposed to measures that link autonomy to controlling more resources. Second, we show that the effects of higher autonomy of mothers may affect boys and girls in different ways.Footnote 1
 Economists have tried to measure a woman’s autonomy by her control over resources. In observational studies, they have either used transitory income or conditional cash transfer programs as proxies for female autonomy in reduced form estimations. Variables that have been used as exogenous determinants of female autonomy or bargaining position of a woman within the marriage include relative income (Hoddinott and Haddad 1995), non-labor income (Schultz 1990; Thomas 1990), current or inherited assets (Doss 2006; Quisumbing 1994), dowry instrumented by grain shocks (Brown 2009), and gender-specific outside income (Anderson and Eswaran 2009). Sometimes, it has been argued that exogenous changes like the passing of new laws or the emergence of new gender-specific economic opportunities increase autonomy through an increase in human capital accumulation(Oreffice 2007; Antman 2014). Finally, there are studies that use changes in divorce laws or other natural experiments such as migration, to proxy for female bargaining position (Lundberg et al. 1997; Chiappori et al. 2002; Antman 2015). Hidrobo and Fernald (2013) discusses a case where an increase in gender-specific income comes from direct cash transfers in Ecuador. There are two problems with this approach. First, how do we know that a dollar earned by a female member is spent by her own volition and not as directed by other male members, notably her husband? Looking merely at the household level spending and outcome may not give a true picture of female autonomy. Higher income may even worsen a woman’s place in the household. For example, Angelucci (2008) and Bobonis et al. (2007) find an increase in aggressive behavior and violent threats from husbands following the Opportunidades cash transfer program in Mexico. Hidrobo and Fernald (2013) also find mixed evidence on the effects of direct cash transfers in Ecuador. Though for educated women cash transfers lowered emotional domestic violence, the effects were opposite for women who had lower education, particularly with respect to her spouses’ level of education. Second, relative income, whether transitory or permanent, is only one of the many variables that may potentially affect power sharing within the household (Chiappori et al. 2002), as spouses negotiate decision-making on a large number of variables. These results show that we need a direct measure of female’s decision-making power within a household. This paper attempts to fill this gap. By creating a direct measure of female autonomy, we focus on the extent of woman’s autonomy within the household decision-making rather than the sources of individual income.Footnote 2
 We have tried to open the blackbox of female autonomy and look into the underlying dynamics between spouses. We create the female autonomy index using a unique survey design that collects information on each spouse’s perspective on domestic decision-making on a set of variables. Mexican Family Life Survey (henceforth, MxFLS) interviews each adult in the family such that the husband independently gives his opinion about who makes the decision- himself, his spouse or both (likewise for his wife) on a wide range of household activities. The setting is ideal to measure female autonomy “defined as the ability of women to make choices/decisions within the household relative to their husbands”(Anderson and Eswaran 2009). We have reduced the dimensionality of the decision matrix by creating an index of female autonomy using principal component analysis. This approach has several advantages. First, it is a continuous, time-variant measure that gives a range of autonomy. Second, it takes on the issue of decision-making directly, instead of inferring from indirect proxy measures such as access to transitory or transfer income. Third, with more and more surveys asking such questions, this measure can be replicable.Footnote 3
 We use our autonomy index to examine the effects of female autonomy on children’s welfare(See Eswaran 2002, for a theoretical discussion), particularly enrollment at the secondary school level. Greater autonomy of women in exercising their preferences may not always be beneficial for children. For instance, (Duflo 2003) finds that a pension program in South Africa leads to better health outcomes for girls when the pension recipient is a woman. However, Edmonds (2006) shows that the same program leads to better education outcomes for children in families where the pension recipient is a man. Putting dollars in the hands of women does not always lead to the desirable outcome. We too obtain mixed results on female autonomy. Interpretation of the effects of our autonomy index on children’s education is complicated because of omitted variables (such as personality of a woman) that may affect both outcome variables and autonomy. Our identification strategy consists of two parts. First, we exploit the longitudinal nature of the data by using lagged values for the independent variables to address simultaneity concerns. Second, to address unobserved heterogeneity, we match households with high and low levels of mother’s autonomy on a wide range of household characteristics using propensity score matching methods. We conduct a number of additional tests to verify the sensitivity of our results to various specifications. We find that the benefits of greater autonomy of mothers are restricted to younger boys. For instance, our estimates suggest that if the decision regarding a child’s education is taken by the mother instead of the father, decision-making on other variables remaining the same, the probability of enrollment increases by 1.3 % points for boys in the 10–14 age group.Footnote 4 However, we do not find any improvement in the education outcomes of girls, with greater autonomy of mothers. Our analysis also sheds light on the mechanism through which benefits from higher autonomy of mothers accrue differently to boys and girls. Boys seem to gain at the expense of girls within the mixed-sex-sibling families. We argue that the difference in outcomes between boys and girls is driven by the low labor force participation of women in Mexico so that parents only care about higher educational attainment of boys for better labor market prospects. These findings have important implications for the new trend in global development policy, where conditional cash or in-kind transfers are handed out directly to the female member of a family. This is particularly relevant in Mexico, where large sums of money are spent on programs like Prospera (formerly known as Progresa and Oportunidades), that are targeted towards women. Our results caution against these ambitious policies directed towards women. While we do find significant improvement in the education of boys when mothers have greater decision making power, our findings also suggest an apparent redistribution of resources from boys to girls in families with higher mother’s autonomy. The relevant policy question is whether a shift in the control over resources from men to women would improve the welfare outcome of children. We show that it may not necessarily be the case even when the women in the family themselves choose how to spend the money. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss the Mexican Family Life Survey dataset in the next section folowed by a discussion of our methodology to form a measure of female autonomy in Sect. 3. The following two sections specify our empirical strategy and discuss ou findings respectively. Section 6 is devoted to sensitivity analysis. In Sects. 7 and 8, we present results using matching estimators and examine the implications of disagreement among parents respectively. Section 9 tries to provide additional insights into the gender differences in our results. We conclude our paper by summarizing our findings and discussing their policy implications.",9
15.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,08 March 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9360-6,"Prostitution, hours, job amenities and education",December 2017,Scott Cunningham,Todd D. Kendall,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The economic literature on prostitution has examined factors determining the relatively high wages earned by workers in that sector.Footnote 1 In other occupations, one of the key determinants of high wages is typically education; however, prostitution is commonly seen as a uniquely “unskilled,” but high wage, occupation. In this paper, we employ unique data from a large survey of women in North America who either are providing, or have recently provided, service as escorts (nearly always including prostitution services) in order to examine the role of education in labor supply for this industry. A large share of our survey respondents, nearly 40 percent, reported having completed college. We have documented elsewhere the impact of the internet and other new technologies in creating a de facto partial legalization of what was traditionally an occupation in which only those with few other options entered.Footnote 2 Traditional streetwalking has been replaced to some degree by indoor sex work in which prostitutes use internet advertising and other technology-facilitated market mechanisms to identify safer clients, arrange assignations, and avoid arrest.Footnote 3
 Our survey shows that, consistent with the traditional view of prostitution as a low-skill industry, calculated hourly wages for college-educated prostitutes are not on average higher than those of prostitutes with less education (except in certain niche segments of the market). Also, likely due to their better legitimate labor market and monogamous coupling opportunities, college-educated women are less likely to work as prostitutes in any given week. However, conditional on working as a prostitute (i.e., seeing clients) in a given week, college-educated women see more clients, a larger share of which are return clients (or “regulars”), and provide longer average sessions to clients. We show that this finding is consistent with a theory that college-educated prostitutes are able to effectively reduce the marginal disutility of prostitute labor supply by attracting men who are less likely to be violent or otherwise unpleasant as clients, and by combining sexual services with companionship and conversation, where education may increase productivity. In addition, human capital associated with college completion may be productive in the sense of reducing the probability of arrest. Consistent with these theories, we find that college-educated prostitutes in our sample report having more attractive clients, being more likely to kiss their clients on the lips, and having a lower perceived risk of arrest. Our survey includes responses from almost 700 female escorts in the US and Canada, and encompasses information on over 2000 individual client transactions for these women. We use sample weights to address unobserved sampling bias to the extent possible and also attempt to control for selection. While realizing the inherent limitations when attempting to study people engaging in behavior that is nearly always illegal, we believe our survey to be the largest available on sex workers in modern economies, and one of the few surveys to extensively examine the labor market practices of prostitutes. Our research contributes to the literature by presenting new information on earnings and labor market practices among prostitutes in a developed country among sex workers who operate using modern information technology. In an extensive literature survey, Weitzer (2005) finds that street-based prostitution may constitute as little as 20% of the U.S. market for prostitution, although it has attracted upwards of 80% of academic research. In examining earnings among indoor prostitutes, we build on a more recent literature that has begun to examine earnings in this important segment of the industry (Moffatt and Peters 2004; Logan and Shah 2013; Cunningham and Kendall 2011a). In finding systematic variation in labor supply by education status, we highlight heterogeneity as a key aspect of prostitution labor supply in North America. Also, in distinction with previous literature on prostitution, we examine non-pecuniary “job amenities” and not only wages. Our paper also contributes to a better understanding of the general relationship between human capital and criminal labor supply (Raphael 2001; Lochner 2004; Krueger 2008). Our results are consistent with criminal labor market segmentation by education, as Lochner (2004) found with respect to white-collar crimes, and consistent with the inverse relationship between general crime rates and educational levels (e.g., Gould et al. (2002)). Section 2 presents our labor supply model, while Section 3 describes the survey instrument and Section 4 presents empirical results. Section 5 concludes.",9

Investigating the dependent coverage mandate effect on dependent tax exemptions,December 2017,Dan M. Shane,David M. Zimmer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Policies from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) law that passed the US Congress in 2010 are increasingly yielding useful insights into behavioral changes tied to health insurance and health system reforms. An early plank of the ACA was the mandate requiring private health insurance plans to allow dependents up to age 26 to remain on parental health insurance plans. Clear evidence has emerged that this change increased health insurance coverage for the affected group of young adults. Antwi et al. (2013) find that dependent insurance coverage increased by 7 percentage points in the year following full implementation of the law and subsequent studies (Sommers et al. 2013; Kotagel et al. 2014; Shane and Ayyagari 2014) using different data sets have borne out those results. Antwi et al. (2013) further show that the policy change resulted in both a decrease in the uninsured and decreases in young adults holding their own employer-based policies and non-group policies. Two recent contributions investigated the effects of previous US state-level dependent coverage mandates. Dillender (2014) finds evidence that the additional option of parental insurance increases wages among the affected young adults while Depew (2015) finds that labor supply decreased along the intensive margin. In a paper showing positive spillover effects due to the ACA mandate, Shane and Ayyagari (2015) find that rates of dental insurance increased along with rates of health insurance for the affected group of young adults, despite the fact that the ACA policy change did not apply to stand-alone dental policies. The notion of broader and perhaps unintended effects due to the ACA motivates further work into how the dependent coverage is affecting individual and family decision making outside the realm of health insurance. Adding dependents to family insurance plans is not costless. For example, if employers set employee premium contributions according to the number of covered lives, then parents who add young adults to their plans might face higher premiums. Work by Depew and Bailey (2015) confirms that premiums increased for health insurance plans that cover children compared to single plans. Even if employers do not increase employee premium contributions, benefit programs might become less generous, perhaps by increasing enrollee cost-sharing, as employers seek to recoup the costs of covering additional family members. This paper posits that some families pay for potential increased costs, in part, by claiming those newly-insured young adults as dependents for tax purposes. The financial advantage of claiming a dependent comes from being able to deduct from taxable income an additional “personal exemption,” which amounted to $3700 for the 2011 tax year, thus reducing total taxes owed. There is an inherent tension in terms of tax exemptions between parents and adult children earning their own income and filing their own tax return. If a parent claims a young adult daughter with a dependent exemption when filing taxes, the daughter would not be able to claim a personal exemption when filing her own tax return. We consider the possibility that when parents allow adult children access to their employer health insurance plans via the new dependent coverage mandate rules, the likelihood of the parent, rather than the child, claiming the available tax exemption increases. The ACA policy language allowing young adults up to age 26 to qualify for parental health insurance plans does not require a young adult to be a dependent for tax purposes though there may also be confusion in this regard. Therefore, we consider the incentives facing young adults and families as many young adults are taking advantage of parental insurance policies. Parents who allow children to enroll or re-enroll as part of their establishment health insurance plan may face higher premiums from switching to a family plan or from increased cost-sharing as companies seek to recoup the costs of covering additional family members. Claiming the young adult as a dependent for tax filing purposes would be one mechanism through which the dependent could compensate the parent for the insurance benefits. As average taxable income is significantly higher for parents compared to young adult children, any significant change in dependent exemptions is likely to result in income gains at the household or family level. The Census BureauFootnote 1 estimates average income for young adults (15–24) at $39,000 in 2011 while parental cohorts in the 45–54 or 55–64 age ranges have average incomes of $86,000 and $79,000, respectively. In 2011 the dependent (or personal) exemption was $3700. A young adult would likely have a marginal income tax rate of 15%, meaning the exemption would save $555 in taxes. For a parent facing a marginal income tax rate of 25% due to their higher income, the exemption would save $925. For a household, the potential financial net gain in this simple scenario is $370 if the parent claims the exemption rather than the child. However, the adult child faces a higher individual tax bill in this scenario and may explain why, prior to the dependent coverage provision, the parent doesn’t always claim the available tax exemption. Significant increases in dependent tax exemptions will also result in a net transfer of the tax burden away from families with young adults ages 19–25. Working from the assumption that individuals ultimately pay health care costs, shifts in family tax decisions may result in taxpayers covering a significant fraction of health care costs for these young adults. We use nationally representative household data to estimate the effect of the dependent coverage mandate on the likelihood that a young adult is claimed on a parental tax return. We further provide the first evaluation of the overall welfare effects stemming from the dependent coverage provision. We find a significant increase in dependent tax exemptions among 19–25 year olds following the mandate and offer evidence on the likely causal mechanism for this effect.",3

15.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,24 March 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9367-z,"Drinking behavior during the Icelandic economic boom, crisis, and recovery",December 2017,Tinna Laufey Asgeirsdottir,Asgerður Th. Bjornsdottir,Thorhildur Ólafsdóttir,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Do individuals change their alcohol-drinking behavior as a response to a macroeconomic crisis? If so, are such behavioral changes likely to be long lasting or do they revert to their previous levels when the economy recovers? In this paper, we use individual longitudinal data covering a boom, a sudden economic crisis and the subsequent recovery to explore four different measures of drinking behavior. We contribute to the literature by studying in detail whether a previously documented reduction in alcohol consumption during a recession in Iceland was only a short-term effect or whether the effect was prolonged over the additional 3 years included in this study. Furthermore, we explore the possible role of income and work hours on the pathway between business cycles and drinking behavior. Studies from several countries have shown that when unemployment rates go up mortality rates decline. In those studies data were used from, e.g., the U.S. (Granados et al. 2014; Ruhm 2000, 2003, 2005a, 2005b), Spain (José 2005), and 23 European Union countries (Toffolutti and Suhrcke 2014), although, within the OECD countries, cyclicality of mortality appears less tangible in countries with greater social insurance systems (Gerdtham and Ruhm 2006).Footnote 1 This seemingly pro-cyclical relationship between unemployment and mortality rates calls for studies on the mechanisms through which the macro-economy could affect people’s health. One proposed mechanism is individual behavioral changes. Of particular interest among the health behaviors studied for this purpose is alcohol drinking. The four major causes of increased mortality in upswings are heart diseases, liver diseases, driving fatalities and homicides. Heavy alcohol drinking affects all of these causes and is thus an important research topic. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that any alcohol consumption affects some of these causes as well. Changes in the macroeconomic environment can affect alcohol consumption through various pathways and somewhat conflicting hypotheses have been put forward on whether drinking increases or decreases during recessions. Alcohol consumption could decrease during recessions through income effects as individuals have less income to purchase alcohol. Furthermore, there are likely fewer social opportunities to drink, i.e., events at workplaces are fewer when business goes down. Another hypothesis is that individuals decrease their drinking because they are afraid of losing their job when employment goes down. However, individuals may increase their alcohol consumption in recession due to increased stress or other emotional pathways. It is furthermore not clear whether the abovementioned directions of a drinking response to a recession is turned around during a recovery or whether the proposed effects of a recession on drinking affect the long-term trend in drinking over a sustained period of time. In light of the conflicting hypotheses on the direction of a possible drinking response to business cycles it is of interest to understand if and why macroeconomic conditions affect drinking behavior. As an example, for policy purposes it is important to understand whether it is more likely that business cycles affect alcohol consumption through individual time and budget constraints or through other pathways, e.g., mental stress. Xu (2013) used combined data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the National Health Interview Survey from the United States to investigate the effects of wages and work hours on health behaviors of low-educated people. Results showed that unhealthy behaviors increased in economic upturns, such as alcohol use and cigarette smoking, while physical activity and visits to physicians went down. Changes in employment appeared to drive the changes in health behaviors rather than changes in income, indicating that as individuals spend less time on leisure and more time working, less time is available for time-consuming health-promoting behavior. Thus, referring to Grossman’s (1972) human-capital model of the demand for health it can be argued that with transitory increase in earnings, individuals may be motivated to draw on their health stock in the short run and take advantage of the fleeting opportunity and likewise in crisis when employment goes down individuals have more time to spend on health-promoting behavior. A reduction in work hours during a recession can therefore contribute to less drinking if refraining from drinking is complementary to other time-consuming health behaviors. Aggregate findings on alcohol consumption and business cycles are mixed. de Goeij et al. (2015) in their systematic review conclude that economic crises can affect alcohol consumption through two ways; a reduction in alcohol consumption due to tighter budget constraints and a rise in harmful drinking due to increased psychological distress. Catalano et al. (2011) found in their systematic review that alcohol consumption was both counter-cyclically and pro-cyclically related to unemployment rate and there were also findings of no relationship. Bor et al. (2013) found that during The Great Recession there was an increase in rates of abstinence from alcohol for adults (in the U.S.), but they also document a rise in total alcohol drinking driven by an increase in moderate and heavy drinking. Latif (2014) found that unemployment rate is positively related to alcohol consumption as well as probabilities of binge drinking. Ruhm and Black (2002) reported a pro-cyclical pattern in heavy drinking. The literature indicates that drinking responses to business cycles vary by gender. In their systematic review Modrek et al. (2013) show that though overall alcohol use tends to decrease in crisis there is a subgroup of men at risk for increased heavy drinking. This is in accordance with results from Dávalos et al. (2012) who found that four types of problematic alcohol consumption (binge drinking, number of binge drinking days, driving after having too much to drink and an indicator for alcohol abuse) increased as the economy declined and that an increase in problematic alcohol consumption is more pronounced for men than women. Richman et al. (2012) report that a relationship between economy-related stressorsFootnote 2 and problematic drinking pattern (drinking to intoxication, binge drinking, and problem-related drinking) were positive and statistically significant for men but not for women. Even though many recent papers report that men are more vulnerable to heavy drinking in economic downturns than women, Mulia et al. (2014) report that a severe economic loss is positively associated with alcohol dependence and drunkenness among women (who experienced job loss, lost retirement savings and reduced work hours). Those women consumed 41–70% more alcohol than women unaffected by the crisis. Most of these studies use cross sectional data (Bor et al. 2013; Mulia et al. 2014; Richman et al. 2012; Xu 2013) but Dávalos et al. (2012) used panel data in their study. Another paper that used individual longitudinal data collected with interviews in late 2009 to early 2010 and again in 2011, shows that those who lost their jobs between interviews did not take up harmful or hazardous alcohol use. However, respondents’ perceived decline in economic resources was linked to taking up harmful and hazardous drinking. Thus, the drinking response was sensitive to which measure of hardship experienced was included in the analysis (Kalousova and Burgard 2014). Researchers have taken advantage of the sudden Icelandic economic collapse to explore the effects of the collapse on drinking behaviors, using comprehensive individual panel data. The Icelandic economic collapse was sudden and distinct even to the point where it is often pinned on a specific date, 6 October 2008, when the prime minister of Iceland addressed the nation in a speech which ended with unusually dramatic words in the Icelandic political context: “God bless Iceland” (Haarde 2008). Within a week the three main banks in Iceland collapsed, leading to the largest banking-system collapse in history relative to GDP (Johnsen 2014). What followed was a decline in employment and gross domestic product in Iceland. GDP growth in Iceland declined from 9.5 in 2007 to −4.7 in 2009 compared to a 6% average annual growth from 2004 (Statistics Iceland 2016a). The number of indebted individuals went up by 48% between 2007 and 2009 (Statistics Iceland 2013) and the unemployment rate rose to 7.2% of the workforce 2009 from 2.3% the year 2007. Keeping in mind that Iceland experienced an unemployment rate of 2.7% on average during the 10 years prior to the collapse (Statistics Iceland 2016b), this is a considerable change. In the year 2012 the unemployment rate had declined to 6% and GDP growth was 1.2% and rising. The consumer price index (CPI) increased by 27% between 2007 and 2009 and by 12.4% between 2009 and 2012 (Statistics Iceland 2016c). All of this affected individuals through reductions in real individual income and work hours that we use in this study as possible mediators between macroeconomic conditions and alcohol use. Ásgeirsdóttir et al. (2014) examined the short-term effects of the Icelandic economic collapse on a wide range of behaviors, one of which was binge-drinking participation. That study has two limitations with regard to alcohol consumption worth noting that have partly, but not fully, been elaborated on in later work. Firstly, due to the range of behaviors considered, Ásgeirsdóttir et al. do not examine each behavior in depth. Secondly, they only examine the short term effects of the collapse (2007 vs. 2009). This second limitation prompted a follow up study, Asgeirsdottir et al. (2016), including the recovery period (year 2012). The main conclusion was that despite some short-term effects found in Ásgeirsdóttir et al., all health behaviors reverted back to their pre-crisis levels or trends, with the exception of their only measure of alcohol consumption (binge-drinking participation), which continued to decline but at a slower rate. These findings draw attention to the specifics of drinking and call for further examination of various types of alcohol use, as only one crude alcohol measure was used in their study; a dummy for binge drinking. Therefore we expand on their study, examining alcohol consumption in greater detail covering the period from the crisis to the recovery period. The current study can similarly be seen as an expansion of Ólafsdóttir and Ásgeirsdóttir (2015), which did a more in depth comparison of alcohol consumption in Iceland between 2007 and 2009. However, the alcohol-specific results found during the recovery period call for a similar in depth analysis of the 2012 data that has not been carried out. Specifically Ólafsdóttir and Ásgeirsdóttir (2015) examined how the Icelandic economic collapse affected alcohol-consumption frequency, frequency of binge drinking, binge-drinking participation and alcohol dependence. They used data from health and lifestyle survey “Heilsa og líðan” (Health and Wellbeing) collected by the Directorate of Health in Iceland, the same data as used in the other aforementioned Icelandic studies. In light of the previous research, it is intriguing to expand Ólafsdóttir and Ásgeirsdóttir’s research and expand the existing analysis on alcohol consumption. Economic fluctuations and health have in a majority of cases been examined using aggregate data and thus without the possibility to directly testing individual-level mechanisms. Here, we study how changes in the macroeconomic environment from collapse to recovery affect four variables of drinking behavior using micro data with repeated measures for each individual, and information on individual-level labor-market changes that can be examined as mechanisms. In particular, it is of interest is to see how drinking behavior evolved after the recession. That is, we study medium-term effects of the crisis on drinking behaviors to see if the short-term effects are enduring or not. The purpose of this paper is thus also in a more general sense to add to the rather mixed literature on how economic downturns and recovery affect alcohol drinking behavior, using an established natural experiment in Iceland and comprehensive data with information on the same individuals during boom, bust and recovery periods, as well as possible individual-level mediators.",1
15.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,29 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9378-9,Health capital investment and time spent on health-related activities,December 2017,Juan Du,Takeshi Yagihashi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In his seminal work, Grossman (1972) wrote, “Gross investments in health capital are produced by household production functions whose direct inputs include the own time of the consumer and market goods, such as medical care, diet, exercise, recreation, and housing.” This statement emphasizes the indispensable role that time input plays in improving health. Health-related time use has become more important than ever due to several developments that took place during the past half-century. First, average time spent on health-related activities has been steadily rising. According to Aguiar and Hurst (2007), health-related activities (both health-enhancing and health-deteriorating) explain about two-thirds of the increase in total leisure time between 1965–2003.Footnote 1 Second, rising health care costs have put fiscal burdens on governments worldwide, prompting them to seek resource-saving alternatives such as promoting exercise and healthy lifestyles among the public (e.g., the “Let’s Move” initiative led by Michelle Obama).Footnote 2 Third, more knowledge has been accumulated on the potential impact of business cycles on health-related time use. For example, Aguiar et al. (2013) find that as much as 30% of the foregone market time was allocated towards sleep and TV viewing during the 2008 recession, whereas Du and Yagihashi (2015) find that the utilization of routine medical care increased during the same period.Footnote 3
 Despite the important role of time in the Grossman model and the growth of leisure time in the past half-century, few empirical studies have examined the use of time as an input for health capital. Our study fills this void by examining how individuals allocate time for different types of health-related activities in response to economic variables. We start out by separating time use into four conceptual categories: time spent on health-enhancing (HE) activities, time spent on health-deteriorating (HD) activities, market work, and others. For HE activities, we further decompose it into activities with more of an investment nature (exercise, medical, and personal care) and activities involving more consumption or pleasure (socializing and relaxation). We then employ time diary data in the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to map individuals’ time use into these categories based on the existing literature. Since our primary focus is to determine how time spent on HE and HD activities respond to the wage rate (i.e., the opportunity cost of time), we restrict our sample to employed individuals. The price of health-related goods and services is also incorporated in our analysis because we assume individuals produce utility-yielding “commodities” by choosing the optimal mix of market goods/services and nonmarket time (Becker 1965). Empirically, we estimate each type of time use using ordinary least squares, while taking into account the endogeneity of wages by using a Heckman sample selection procedure. Using compensated wage elasticity we show that individuals devote more time to investment-nature HE activities but less time to sleep and HD activities when their wages are higher. The effect of wages on consumption-nature HE time is inconclusive: It is negative during weekdays and positive during weekends, rendering the net effect for the week to be statistically insignificant. Our results indicate that a 10% increase in the wage rate is predicted to increase HE time by 18.5 min and decrease HD time by 46.3 min over the course of a week. We further demonstrate that the aggregate HE time that combines investment- and consumption-nature activities has a positive and significant wage elasticity of 0.1, which contrasts with the wage elasticity of nonmarket time (total time−work time) of −0.08. Our main results generally hold when we stratify by gender, marital status, and education level. This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, we add to the relatively scant literature on health-related time use by examining a broader array of health-related activities and allowing substitution to occur within health-related leisure time. Previous studies largely focus on specific types of time use and do not consider substitution within nonmarket time. For example, Mullahy and Roberts (2010) examine how time spent on physical activities differs by education. Podor and Halliday (2012) examine how sports and exercise time relate to health status. A few studies focus on other activities such as medical care at home and at doctors’ offices (Gronau and Hamermesh 2006), personal self-care (Ettner et al. 2009), sleep (Biddle and Hamermesh 1990), and meal preparation (Dunn 2015; Kohara and Kamiya 2016; Senia et al. 2017). Our study encompasses the above studies by examining a broader set of health-related activities and further explores the heterogeneous nature of these activities. Second, our result provides a rationale for future studies to distinguish time input for health production from other nonmarket time. In the health production literature, a common empirical strategy is to treat all nonmarket time as an approximation of the unobserved time input for health.Footnote 4 However, it would not be appropriate to lump all nonmarket time together if activities with different health effects respond differently to economic conditions. Our finding further challenges the assumption of the traditional labor / leisure model that assumes that all leisure time responds negatively to an increase in the wage rate. Our results show that this assumption does not apply to investment-nature HE time. This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we introduce the model framework and derive the demand for health-related time use. Section III explains the data and estimation methodology. We present the main results in section IV and additional analysis in section V. Section VI presents the study’s conclusions.",9

People compare themselves to others in a wide variety of aspects of life, with important repercussions on happiness.Footnote 1 For individuals who care very much about status but who have limited access to the legitimate means for attaining the goal of economic success such as an elite education, a pressure arises that necessitates coping behavior. We argue that gambling is a means of coping with the discrepancy between the desired status and the bleak prospects of achieving it via traditional channels.Footnote 2 Despite the extremely low probability of winning and the low pay-out ratio,Footnote 3 gambling offers an unparalleled possibility to leapfrog in the status hierarchy. This paper tests whether households with positional concerns are more likely to gamble and to have higher gambling expenditures. After deriving this prediction in a simple model for households with strictly convex status utility, we analyze a comprehensive data set that is representative for Germany and comprises household characteristics, a detailed breakdown of household expenditures, and information about household income. A proxy for households’ positional concerns is key to our study but is difficult to obtain in the field. In this paper, we use households’ expenditures for conspicuous consumption as a proxy for status concerns. Conspicuous consumption (Veblen 1899) refers to consumption that aims to reveal one’s economic status to others, where the relative visibility of many consumption choices (when compared to, for instance, financial wealth) makes the reliance on consumption for this purpose rational (see, e.g., Corneo and Jeanne 1998; Heffetz 2011, 2012). Both the fact that relative concerns are important and that goods differ with regard to their positionality (i.e. that certain goods have a higher relevance for relative standing in society) have been confirmed in several empirical studies (e.g., Alpizar et al. 2005; Carlsson et al. 2007; Hillesheim and Mechtel 2013; Solnick and Hemenway 1998, 2005).
 Cars are usually considered as a prime example of a positional good.Footnote 4
 Our empirical analysis uses logit estimations to understand whether or not a household participates in gambling and ordinary least squares estimations for the level of gambling expenditures. In robustness checks, we refer to findings for tobit and double hurdle models. Using expenditures for conspicuous consumption as a proxy for the strength of households’ positional concerns, we find that a strong status orientation indeed makes participation in gambling and higher gambling expenditures more likely. This supports the hypothesis that status-oriented individuals seek opportunities to “correct” their low status and find one in gambling. In contrast, traditional saving, which may be an alternative way of improving one’s absolute (although not necessarily relative) standing in the future, is less important for households with strong status concerns. When exploring the relationship of positional concerns and gambling, we seek to control for socio-economic and demographic household characteristics and thereby also consider the region, urbanization, education, and gender of the household. This yields a host of findings secondary to our result on the effect of the importance attached to relative position. We thereby contribute to the evolving literature on gender differences (see, e.g., Andreoni and Vesterlund 2001; Croson and Gneezy 2009)
 and comparisons between East and West German households (e.g., Alesina and Fuchs-Schündeln 2007; Brosig et al. 2011; Friehe and Mechtel 2014; Heineck and Süssmuth 2013; Ockenfels and Weimann 1999; Rainer and Siedler 2009; Torgler 2003). Our regression results suggest that women are much less interested in gambling.Footnote 5 Furthermore, we find that households in East Germany are less likely to gamble and have significantly lower expenditures for gambling. Finally, regarding the relationship of education and gambling, we obtain the finding that better educated subjects seem to engage less in gambling, a result that is well-aligned with the empirical literature on gambling (see, e.g., Beckert and Lutter 2009, 2013; Grote and Matheson 2012). The paper at hand contributes in several ways to existing knowledge. First, we provide evidence consistent with the prediction that positional concerns are associated with more extensive gambling. This finding is important, given that no definite answer has yet been found to explain why people play lotteries [see Ariyabuddhiphongs (2011) for a recent survey]. Even though we do not consider the motivation described in this paper to be all-encompassing, it certainly is a valuable addition to the existing theories. Second, we contribute to the literature about the repercussions of individuals having positional concerns. Given that gambling has a negative expected payoff, taking part in it lowers in expectation the economic status of those trying to leapfrog in the social hierarchy. Moreover, people with strong status concerns seem to substitute gambling for traditional wealth formation. This adds to the adverse consequences already established in the literature. For example, Moav and Neeman (2010, 2012) show that conspicuous consumption may influence the likelihood of poverty traps, and Frank (2000, 2008) argues that conspicuous consumption may use up resources otherwise spent for healthcare, among other things. The prior empirical literature on lottery play has largely been concerned with the question about its potential regressivity (see, e.g., Beckert and Lutter 2009; Clotfelter and Cook 1987; Crowley et al. 2012; Farrell and Walker 1999; Perez and Humphreys 2011; Worthington 2001; Worthington et al. 2007). In contrast, Kearney (2005) explores whether households substitute lottery expenditures for other gambling expenditures when a state lottery becomes available, and whether households respond to changes of the lottery’s expected value. In line with previous findings, our results suggest that expenditures on gambling are strictly concave in the level of income. Our paper is most closely related to Haisley et al. (2008) who conducted two experiments dealing with subjective relative income and lottery ticket purchases. Subjects were asked to complete surveys, then handed five dollar bills for doing so, and afterwards were offered lottery tickets in exchange for the five dollars received. In Experiment 1, respondents had to check the applicable income bracket for their yearly income while completing the survey. The brackets were manipulated in a way so as to make some subjects perceive that they were earning very little income. These subjects subsequently purchased a higher number of tickets on average. The second experiment tested whether or not the suggestion that middle-class and rich people often have better access to aspects related to success would motivate low-income people to opt more often for the supposedly class-free lottery. The results are again in support of the hypothesis. Our study is complementary to Haisley et al. (2008). First, our analysis builds on actual consumption patterns of a very high number of households that are representative for Germany and, moreover, surveyed at several points in time (whereas Haisley et al. use lottery ticket purchases of >200 subjects after an experimental task as data). Second, we focus on conspicuous consumption as proxy for actual status orientation (whereas Haisley et al. focus on experimental variations of one’s perceived relative income position). Despite these differences, the underlying behavioral model is closely related. Our results suggest that many individuals feel pressure given that the desired status will in all likelihood remain out of reach, and that these subjects consider gambling as a legitimate channel that promises “correction” and is similarly accessible to low-status households. The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present a simple theoretical model to derive our central hypothesis regarding the influence of a greater status orientation on the involvement in lottery. We describe the data used for our analysis in Sect. 3, while Sect. 4 contains our empirical analysis. The last section concludes.",7

Using microdata from the Nikkei Radar (1987–99), which covers households in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Iwaisako (2009) demonstrated that housing wealth accounts for approximately 90 percent of the total wealth of homeowners in their 20 s, and about 80 percent for those in their 30 s or 40 s.Footnote 1 Of course, housing wealth fluctuates markedly because of variations in house prices as in Fig. 1, which depicts the Japan Real Estate Institute (JREI) Home Price Index based on price changes for repeat sales of secondhand condominiums in the Tokyo metropolitan area from 2004 to 2015. Repeat-sales price index for the Tokyo metropolitan area  
Source: Japan Real Estate Institute A voluminous literature has investigated how house price fluctuations affect household decisions. In a pioneering study, Case et al. (2005) argued that the housing wealth effect on consumption has become increasingly important, as institutional innovations have made it simpler to extract cash from housing equity.Footnote 2 They hypothesized, and duly supported with empirical results, that exogenous changes in house prices are associated with changes in the available housing equity, thereby varying consumption. More recently, Lovenheim and Mumford (2013) and Dettling and Kearney (2014) have applied the housing wealth effect to the childbearing choices of households. Using the same logic, they hypothesized that changes in house value imply wealth changes for current homeowners, and that these could consequently affect childbearing decisions. Their empirical results, which used data covering a period of housing boom in the US, suggested that children are normal goods and that an increase in house prices tended to encourage childbearing among homeowners. Household fertility decisions are an important issue in Japan because the total fertility rate fell to its lowest historical level of just 1.26 in 2005. Since then, the total fertility rate has risen slightly, but in 2015 it was still only 1.45. A recent news article has sounded the alarm that the total fertility rate is headed for a long-term decline as second-generation baby boomers, those born between 1971 and 1974, pass their peak childbearing years.Footnote 3 Examining the purported link between changes in housing wealth and household fertility decisions could then inform this issue. Indeed, Mizutani (2015) found that a decrease in home values had a negative impact on childbirth for existing homeowners with mortgages during the housing bust period in Japan. In this paper, we shed light on an asymmetry in the response to unanticipated housing wealth gains and losses.Footnote 4 If we consider a standard model in which housing wealth influences homeowners’ decisions only through the budget constraint channel, thereby including the effects of both unrealized capital gains/losses and equity extraction, it predicts that housing gains and losses of equal magnitude would have similar effects. However, there is a longstanding psychological and behavioral economics literature showing that people care more about housing losses than equivalent gains, implying an asymmetric effect of housing wealth on the household decision. Genesove and Mayer (2001) first applied reference-dependent preferences, as proposed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and later Tversky and Kahneman (1991), to the housing market. Motivated by this analysis, Case et al. (2013), by focusing on the household consumption decision, hypothesized that the painful regrets associated with decreases in house values exert stronger psychological consequences than does the pleasant elation associated with increases in house values, such that homeowners behave asymmetrically as to the gains and losses in housing wealth. The empirical results suggested that an increase in housing wealth has a positive effect on household consumption, while a decline in housing wealth has a negative and somewhat larger effect on consumption, both being consistent with the reference-dependent preferences from prospect theory. We thus examine the impact through a different channel by applying a model of reference-dependent preferences. This model, in which housing wealth enters homeowners’ utility directly, assumes that households care more about wealth losses than equivalent gains. In our model, the utility from childbirth is weighted by the utility from the change in house prices, where the reference level is based on the house price in the previous year. The theoretical model suggests that the fertility response to housing wealth changes is indeed larger for losses than gains. We test this theoretical prediction using longitudinal data on Japanese households. The Japanese housing market provides a unique setting for examining the psychological consequences of housing wealth change. In Japan, it is quite difficult to convert housing wealth into cash because there is only a tiny resale market in Japan for used houses, and the financial sector does not generally provide equity loans against property of uncertain value (Mitchell and Piggott 2004). In this regard, any fertility responses would presumably be smaller if housing wealth influenced homeowners’ decisions only through the budget constraint channel. Our dataset covers the period from 2004 to 2015. As shown in Fig. 1, this period appears to be ideal for examining the supposed asymmetric housing wealth effect because the housing market has experienced both price increases and decreases. These variations in housing wealth are captured by the relative change in self-reported house values, where the house values reported in the previous year serve as the reference level. We measure childbearing choices using a binary variable and estimate a logit model to better understand the relationship between changes in housing wealth and family formation behavior. Through this process, we can examine whether price increases and decreases for specific properties have differential effects on individual-level fertility decisions. We find that the fertility responses of homeowners are substantially larger for housing losses than gains. In fact, our estimates indicate that a one million yen reduction in house values decreases the probability of childbirth by approximately 4.6 percent, whereas a one million yen increase in house values leads to an increase in the probability of childbirth by less than 0.1 percent. This suggests that encouraging childbirth through boosting housing markets will entail a different magnitude of impact, depending on housing price gains and losses.",2

Crossley,Yuqian Lu,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In an influential paper, Deaton and Paxson (1998) raise an important puzzle in understanding returns to scale in household consumption. They note that, holding per capita resources constant, returns to scale (in at least some goods) imply that larger households are better off, and so should consume more of private goods such as food. However, they document in a range of data sets that larger households have lower per capita food expenditures (holding per capita resources constant). Gan and Vernon (2003) suggest that returns to scale in food consumption—particularly in food preparation—may resolve this puzzle. However, Deaton and Paxson (1998, 2003) emphasize that the presence of returns to scale in food preparation strengthens rather than resolves their puzzle.Footnote 1
 The latter assertion is true of models in which “food” is a single commodity, or at least homogeneous with respect to preparation time. In contrast, if food is a composite of goods that differ in their preparation times, returns to scale in food preparation are a potential explanation of the Deaton–Paxson Puzzle. The first contribution of this article is to develop a slightly richer model that retains the Barten-type demographic effects of Deaton and Paxson’s analysis but adds explicit home production (of food) and two types of food (which differ in their preparation times). Thus it serves to illustrate the case in which returns to scale in food preparation might explain the Deaton– Paxson Puzzle, and contrasts with the case in which food is homogeneous with respect to time costs. Deaton and Paxson recognize this possibility in their original paper, but do not consider it a likely explanation (Deaton and Paxson 1998, p. 922). The second contribution of this article is to compare some of the predictions of a model with foods that are heterogeneous in preparation times to Canadian data from detailed food expenditure diaries and detailed time use diaries. We find the data are consistent with key predictions of our model. Compared to singles, couples spend a smaller share of their food budget on prepared food, and, strikingly, couples spend more time per capita on food preparation than singles. With respect to the Deaton–Paxson puzzle, we find that a version of the puzzle remains. However, we argue that the type of test for returns to scale that Deaton and Paxson propose may be difficult to implement (at least for developed countries) because of substitutions within broad food categories. In the next section we set out the background to our analysis by reviewing the puzzle posed by Deaton and Paxson (1998), and the implications of adding home production to their model while maintaining the assumption that food is a homogeneous good. In Section 3, we contrast this analysis with a model with two types of food that differ in their preparation times. Section 4 presents our empirical evidence. Section 5 discusses alternative explanations for the patterns we see in the data, and implications of our findings.",4
16.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,06 September 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9388-7,"Economies of scale, bulk discounts, and liquidity constraints: comparing unit value and transaction level evidence in a poor country",March 2018,John Gibson,Bonggeun Kim,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"An enduring puzzle about household behavior, particularly in poor countries, concerns the relationship between household size and the demand for food. The puzzle is that the budget share for food falls (especially for the poor) as household size rises at constant per capita consumption (Deaton and Paxson 1998). Larger households should have higher food demand, from an effective income increase from the sharing of public goods. Hence, food budget shares should rise with household size, especially for poor people whose income elasticity of food demand is highest. In this paper we study a mechanism—bulk buying discounts—that Abdulai (2003) claims can explain the Deaton and Paxson puzzle. The idea is that these discounts let larger households spend less on food even as they consume more. In terms of evidence, Abdulai finds lower food unit values (expenditures over quantities) for bigger households and claims that this shows that they use bulk discounts to lower their food costs, resulting in a lower food budget share. Our focus on this mechanism is not because it is more plausible than the other mechanisms proposed as solutions for the puzzle.Footnote 1 In fact, we find that bulk discounts are far too small to generate much difference between large and small households in the price paid for food. Moreover, unit values are an unreliable basis for estimating the bulk discount schedule, as we show below. We study bulk discounts because they may matter to household behaviour related to several literatures, including the Deaton and Paxson puzzle. One of these literatures is about whether the poor pay more for food. For example, Rao (2000) claims that the poor in rural India are liquidity constrained and so have to buy small quantities on each purchase occasion and end up paying more for food than do the rich; adjusting for this effect, the Gini coefficient for real income is 12–23 percent higher than for nominal income. Similarly, in Colombia the unit values for rice, beans and carrots are up to 27 percent higher when households purchase the smaller units typically used by the poor (Attanasio and Frayne 2006). Bulk discounts also may matter to price index calculation, even for studies that are not necessarily concerned with differences in the cost of living for the poor compared to other households (Griffith et al. 2009). A problem with evidence on bulk discounts from poor countries is the use of unit values, which represent combined effects of several consumer choices, so it is hard to identify a single effect, like bulk discounting. For example, it has long been known that poorer households have lower unit values because they buy lower quality items (Prais and Houthakker 1955; Deaton 1988), so unit values will reflect combined effects of quality choice and any inability to capture bulk discounts. It is less widely recognized that buying in bulk alters the relative price of quality, in the same way that adding a fixed transport cost alters the price of quality (Alchian and Allen 1967). Since the costs that a seller incurs for small quantity sales, such as repackaging costs, should be the same per unit weight for high quality and low quality items, the relative price of high quality items will be cheaper in small packages than in larger ones.Footnote 2 Perhaps because of the complex set of consumer choices that influence unit values, when they are used as a proxy for prices they tend to provide a different answer than when surveys of prices in stores and markets are used, as has been found in studies of ‘do the poor pay more’ (Kaufman et al. 1997; Gibson and Kim 2013). Another problem is that unit values aggregate over purchase occasions during the reference period of a survey, obscuring how much was bought in each transaction, but it is at transaction level that bulk discounts occur. Another problem for methods using unit values is that attempts to identify the price schedule by instrumenting for demand face the problem that some of the commonly used instruments, like family size and composition, also affect the opportunity cost of shopping more frequently to search for lower prices (McKenzie and Schargrodsky 2011). A largely neglected source of data on bulk discounts is the record of individual transactions in expenditure diaries. These diaries are used in surveys in many poor countries and typically ask respondents to record expenditure and quantity for each transaction but also the brand (if available), unit size and the number of units purchased on each occasion. Transaction-level data allow quality to be held constant by restricting attention to the same brand and specification, and are the right level of aggregation for estimating bulk discount schedules, which depend on the amount purchased on each occasion rather than the total amount purchased over some period. In contrast, unit values from recall surveys treat a single ten kilogram purchase that may attract a bulk discount as identical to buying one kilogram per day for 10 days, which should not give any bulk discount. Our empirical results use individual transactions from a diary-keeping survey in urban Papua New Guinea to estimate the bulk discount schedule for four foods that make up one-third of the total food budget (rice, chicken, canned meat and canned fish). The regressions for each food only use data for the dominant brand(s) so no quality variation confounds the results.Footnote 3 All four foods have precisely measured but small elasticities of unit price with respect to quantity purchased. It is also true that the poor, on average, buy smaller quantities in each transaction. Thus, the overall effect is that they face slightly higher prices; doubling household income would reduce the unit price paid for these four foods by one percent. The bulk discount schedule is also fairly flat with respect to household size; it would take a doubling of household size to get a 1.2 percent fall in average food prices paid. This very modest effect of household size suggests that bulk discounts cannot provide an explanation for the Deaton and Paxson puzzle. These transaction-level estimates are contrasted with estimates obtained by applying approaches used elsewhere with unit values. The unit value methods give inaccurate estimates of the bulk discount schedule, either for estimating whether the poor pay more for food or for estimating how household size affects pecuniary economies of scale. Moreover, we show that poor people often buy more than one of a small-sized unit in the same transaction, which suggests that they had enough cash on hand to buy a single larger unit at a cheaper price per unit weight if they had so desired. Hence, liquidity constraints may not be the only explanation for why the poor buy smaller sized units. We suggest a behavioral explanation based on self-control issues in settings where reciprocal obligations require households to feed all who come to their table. Our approach is unusual, in using transaction-level data from diaries, but a few other studies use similar data. Beatty (2010) uses transactions from the British Expenditure and Food Survey diaries and finds bulk discounts for some foods. These foods are more important in the budgets of the poor, so the poor pay less than average for food, contrary to the literature that the ‘poor pay more’. In the results below, a similar instrumental variables specification to Beatty (2010) gives imprecise estimates, perhaps due to demographic variables used as instruments not satisfying exclusion restrictions since they also affect the ability of households to search for lower prices. Another closely related paper is Dillon et al. (2016), who use transactions from diaries in Tanzania and calculate that one-quarter of households could reduce expenditures by over ten percent without reducing quantity purchased, by exploiting the bulk discount schedule these authors estimate. However, there is reason to doubt the estimated schedule because only one of the 22 categories of goods they study is restricted to a specific brand, while most are unbranded local foods and so give no easy way to control for quality of what is bought, unlike here. Moreover, many of the items are reported in non-metric units such as bunches and heaps, with metric quantity estimated ex post from locally established conversion factors while we have exact measures of quantity because we work with packaged foods. Despite these differences, the Tanzania study also suggests that liquidity constraints are not a major cause of the pattern of purchasing behavior, with explanations rooted in self-control problems and social taxation advanced as more fruitful avenues for understanding why households may neglect to exploit apparent bulk discounts. Of course, the key feature of these papers, and our own, is not the use of diaries per se but rather that transaction level information is gathered. A related type of data comes from consumer panels who use scanners for all barcoded purchases. Griffith et al. (2009) use such data for the United Kingdom and examine the savings from purchasing items on sale, bulk buying, buying store brands, and choosing outlets. On average, households could save an equivalent of about six percent of annual food spending from sales, and from using store brands, and about 16 percent from buying the largest package sizes, when each effect is considered in isolation. Poorer households save more from bulk buying, which is consistent with what Beatty (2010) finds using diaries. It is not clear how these findings apply to poor countries since the consumers who save the most by bulk buying tend to shop by car and shop infrequently (once a month), which is less feasible in a poor country. The persistence of traditional marketing channels in poor countries may limit what foods can be studied with scanners, since many will tend not to be barcoded.Footnote 4 However, other technologies may be feasible, such as using smart phones to take pictures of items that are part of a transaction and then uploading these (geo-tagged) pictures along with price information to a survey agency.",10

These issues include corruption, deterioration of the environment, and rising economic inequality. Inequality may be especially of concern as China has become the Asian country with the highest level of income inequality (Asian Development Bank 2007). Moreover, China’s income-based Gini coefficient increased from 0.33 in 1980 to 0.46 in 2000 (Chang 2002), and then to 0.49 in 2007 (Xie and Zhou 2014). Although it has stopped increasing in recent years, the Gini coefficient in China is still among the highest around the world. There is intense scholarly and policy debate about whether economic growth when accompanied by rising economic inequality leads to improvements in subjective well-being (SWB) of their residents. How China’s economic growth and the accompanying rising inequalities affect subjective well-being is an empirical question that needs further investigation. The relationship between income inequality and subjective well-being is mixed both from a theoretical perspective and across empirical studies. Due to diminishing marginal utility of income, Lerner (1944) argues that increases in inequality will in general decrease welfare of society, implying a negative relationship between increases in income inequality and subjective well-being. In contrast, Hirschman and Rothschild (1973) describe the “tunnel effect” of an initial increase in inequality, i.e., individuals may perceive increased economic inequality as signaling better economic opportunities for themselves. Empirical studies on the association of income inequality with subjective well-being find mixed effects. Senik (2004) uses the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey data from 1994 to 2000 to explore the relation between life satisfaction and income distribution, and finds evidence supporting the “tunnel effect” conjecture. Grosfeld and Senek (2010) show that in the economic transition period of Poland, income inequality at first contributes positively to people’s happiness from 1992 to 1996, but the relation reverses in the period after 1997. Luttmer (2005) using American data finds that higher income of neighbors is negatively correlated to one’s happiness, after controlling for one’s own income. Angus Deaton and his coauthors enriched the literature on subjective well-being from several perspectives. Deaton (2008) uses Gallup World Poll data on national samples of adults from 132 countries to explore life satisfaction’s relationships with national income, age, and life-expectancy. He finds that per capita national income strongly positively affects life satisfaction and that the relationship is almost linear in the log formulation. Kahneman and Deaton (2010) further distinguished subjective well-being into two aspects: emotional well-being or happiness, and life evaluation or life satisfaction. They find that income and education are more important determinants of life evaluation, but health, care giving, loneliness and smoking are more closely related to daily emotions. High income increases life satisfaction but not happiness, and low income is associated both with low life evaluation and low emotional well-being. In addition to studying subjective well-being for the population in normal times, Deaton (2012) examined the 2008 Financial Crisis impacts on the emotional and evaluative lives of the population. He finds that both emotional well-being and life evaluation declined sharply during the fall of 2008 and spring of 2009, but largely recovered by the end of 2010. Deaton and Stone (2013) further show that relative income may not be a critical factor for subjective well-being. There are also studies on the relationship between inequality and SWB in developing countries, including China. Among them, Appleton and Song (2008) use the China Household Income Project (CHIP) 2002 data to report that in urban China life satisfaction is positively correlated with individual attributes such as self-reported good health status, being married, and female. But in terms of income inequality, they find that relative income does not significantly affect life satisfaction. Knight et al. (2009) use the 2002 sample of CHIP data to study life satisfaction in rural China. They report a positive effect of inequality on happiness, but a negative effect of others’ income within the village. Chen and Zhang (2009) review the literature on inequality and income distribution in rural China, and on its determinants and relationship with households. They also identify new research areas with existing panel datasets, and a new panel dataset to shape future research. Knight and Gunatilaka (2010b) study subjective well-being functions for urban and rural China. They report that although urban households are richer than rural households, rural households have higher subjective well-being than their richer urban counterparts. Oshio et al. (2011) examined the relative income effects on happiness by using data from China, Japan and Korea. Consistent with previous literature, their paper also finds a significantly positive association of individual’s relative income and perceived happiness. In contrast to Japan and Korea, Chinese residents’ happiness has stronger associations with relative income calculated by individual income than by family income. Easterlin et al. (2012) use data from six surveys to document the relationship of life satisfaction and income inequality between 1990 and 2010 in China. They find a U-shape age relation in life satisfaction similar to those observed in developed countries. They also report that rapid economic growth in this period benefited higher-income and better-educated groups with higher life satisfaction, but led to declining life satisfaction in the lower-income group. In recent years, more studies have paid attention on the mechanisms behind the impacts of inequality on SWB. Knight and Gunatilaka (2010a) provide one reason why China’s rural-urban migrant households report lower happiness than rural households. They find that certain features of migrant conditions and high aspirations in relation to achievement produce unhappiness. Frijters et al. (2012) explored the relationship between optimistic income expectations on life satisfaction using 2002 household survey data. They show that expectations have strong associations with life satisfaction especially for urban areas, but countryside residents and rural-to-urban migrants have higher levels of optimism about the future. Jiang et al. (2012) distinguish between different effects of between-group and general inequality on happiness. Their paper indicates that people feel unhappy with between-group inequality, but that general inequality is positively related to happiness after controlling for identity-related inequality and other characteristics. Asadullah et al. (2015) find that women, urban residents and people with higher income are happier in China. Rich people care more about relative income, whereas poorer residents pay more attention to absolute income. Our paper adds to the existing literature in the following ways. First, we measure inequalities in economic resources using both income and expenditure data and focus on expenditure inequality, as consumption expenditure is a more comprehensive and accurate measure of economic resources in developing countries (Strauss and Thomas 2008). We study the relationships of consumption expenditure levels and of consumption expenditure inequality with life satisfaction and compare the findings with those obtained from using income measures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to compare the impacts of inequality on life satisfaction measured by both expenditure and income using micro dataset from China. Second, this paper provides a comprehensive view of how inequalities are associated with life satisfaction in both urban and rural China using the national representative China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) data. While Easterlin et al. (2012) provide evidence that poorer individuals dislike inequality more, whether being poor in rural areas is worse than being poor in urban China is not directly addressed. Indeed, Knight et al. (2009) observed that rural-dwellers in China appear to be relatively happy despite their poverty and low socioeconomic status. In this paper we will take advantage of the size of the CFPS data and sample to study within and between measurements of inequality on well-being of rural and urban residents. Third, we further separate urban residents into those with and without urban Hukou, and study their life satisfaction. Knight and Gunatilaka (2010a) explore why China’s rural-urban migrant households report lower happiness than rural households and find that high aspirations in relation to achievement produce unhappiness, but they don’t focus on the heterogeneous impacts of inequality on subgroup’s life satisfaction within urban residents. In this paper we define people who live in urban areas but have rural Hukou as migrants. Hukou (household registration system) is still one of the most important factors associated with each individual’s rights and welfare in China. Migrants without urban Hukou do not have equal rights in employment, pension system, medical care, children’s education permission, and so on. As a result, migrants might have different feelings about inequality, or different valuation of their subjective life satisfaction. Finally, this paper also explores the mechanism behind the basic relationship between inequality and life satisfaction. The literature has pointed out that individual’s subjective welfare is determined not only by the actual level of material life, but also by his/her aspiration (Veenhoven 1995; Inglehart 1990; Knight and Gunatilaka 2010a). However, the current literature doesn’t test aspiration as a potential channel of inequality’s effect on life satisfaction. CFPS data enable us to employ a measure of aspiration and to investigate its role in associating inequality with life satisfaction. The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the CFPS data and the variables to be used in our analysis. It also defines and shows the relationship between life satisfaction and our two measures of economic status—per capita income and per capita consumption expenditures. Section 3 describes the estimation models and defines the other explanatory variables to be used in our regression analysis. Section 4 presents the main results of the empirical models. Finally, section 5 highlights our main conclusions.",15
16.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,24 November 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9353-x,Polygamy and child mortality: Historical and modern evidence from Nigeria’s Igbo,March 2018,Vellore Arthi,James Fenske,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Long of interest to anthropologists and sociologists, the institution of polygamy has also come under study by economists seeking to explain poor development outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. In some of these studies, the practice of polygamy has been theorized to hinder economic growth by undermining human capital and wealth accumulation (De La Croix and Mariani 2015; Tertilt 2005); meanwhile others show that the weakening of altruism in polygamous households leads to more efficient production (Akresh et al. 2012, 2016; Kazianga and Wahhaj 2016). These studies suggest that distinct features of polygamous households—or features strongly correlated with polygamy—play an important role in macroeconomic success through their effects on individual wellbeing. The association between polygamy and poor welfare outcomes is of particular importance given how widespread polygamy is in Sub-Saharan Africa: roughly 25 % of married women in Sub-Saharan Africa are in polygamous marriages, and about the same fraction of children under 14 have been born to polygamous mothers.Footnote 1 Accordingly, it is likely that many of the region’s children may be exposed to adverse conditions associated with membership in polygamous households. How does this in turn affect their chances of survival? In this paper, we analyze the correlation between polygamyFootnote 2 and child mortality in both a historical dataset and a modern one. Our historic data were originally collected in 1911 by the anthropologist Northcote Thomas, in three Igbo villages in southeastern Nigeria. We have recovered these from the archive and digitized them. Using the household rosters that Thomas compiled, we correlate the fraction of the household head’s children who have died with his number of wives, and assess the sensitivity of this correlation to controlling for a variety of location and extended family fixed effects, for past fertility, and for the composition of the household. Adding historical data to the literature on polygamy and child health allows us to make two contributions that are not available to many studies that employ modern data. First, we are able to assess the correlation between polygamy and child mortality in a setting where many of the variables that confound the links between child mortality and polygamy in the present, such as Christian religious beliefs or attitudes toward modern medicine, are far less pronounced. In so doing, and in the spirit of Deaton (2009) and Deaton and Cartwright (2016), our approach takes account of how the institutional and historical context may matter to the relationship under study. Second, the historical data classify the households into sub-village quarters and into families, allowing us to assess the strength of the correlation comparing households within these broader networks. Additionally, to our knowledge, ours is the first study to quantitatively test for the relationship between polygamy and child mortality in historical data. In order to validate our historical findings on the Igbo, and to examine changes in the association between polygamy and child mortality over time in this setting, we perform a similar exercise using the Igbo sub-sample of the most recent Demographic and Health Survey data from Nigeria. We correlate the mortality of individual children with whether their mothers are polygamous, and assess the sensitivity of this correlation to a wide set of controls. In particular, we use methods set forth by Altonji et al. (2005) and Oster (2016) to provide inference on what the sensitivity of our estimates to observable controls can tell us about the potential role for selection on unobservables to explain the raw correlations that we measure.Footnote 3
 In both our historical sample and our modern sample, we find positive correlations between polygamy and child mortality, confirming the stylized fact uncovered in earlier studies (e.g., Omariba and Boyle 2007; Strassmann 1997). In the historic data, however, this result is not statistically significant.Footnote 4 Adding vectors of controls and fixed effects does substantially lower the magnitude of the correlation in the sample, suggesting an important role for selection on both observables and unobservables in explaining the general pattern. The existing literature has focused on several mechanisms by which polygamy may be associated with poor child health outcomes, including resource dilution, crowding, intra-household allocation, behavioral practices, and selection. Indeed, this literature has reached mixed conclusions as to why and how polygamy correlates with child survival. In order to test the channels by which this association manifests in our data, we consider each of these explanations in turn. Specifically, we include additional controls that either capture the observable drivers of both polygamy and child mortality, or that capture mediating variables that arise as a result of polygamy and that might help explain its correlation with child mortality. Thus, and given the mixed evidence in the literature, a contribution of this paper is first, to confirm the direction of the net association between polygamy and child mortality in the Igbo context, and next, to use this setting to systematically validate the commonly hypothesized mechanisms underlying this relationship. We also focus in much greater depth than in previous studies on how selection into group membership may help explain the adverse association between polygamy and child mortality. Indeed, our study makes selectivity into polygamy the chief focus of the analysis, with findings that suggest that in our context, polygamy as an institutional arrangement may be important only insofar as it proxies a set of regional, household, and individual characteristics that undermine child survival. To examine the role of resource dilution and physical crowding, we control for several measures of household size and competition between children. We find that the inclusion of these measures increases our estimates of the correlation of polygamy with child mortality. Altonji et al. (2005) tests suggest that these channels would be unlikely to explain away the polygamy-child mortality correlation if we could include all similar unobservables. Oster (2016) tests, by contrast, urge caution: we are able to induce changes in our estimated coefficients that are large relative to the additional variation in mortality explained by these controls. We also assess the importance of intra-household allocation in explaining the polygamy-child mortality relationship, first by using gender-specific correlations of polygamy with child mortality, and second, by testing for child mortality differences by wife rank. Here, we find some evidence of a more severe mortality “penalty” for the daughters than for the sons of polygamists in the historical data, evidence which is absent in the modern data. Similarly, in the modern data, where we can observe wife rank, we find no differences in mortality risk for the children of junior vs. senior wives. To examine differences in the behavioral practices of polygamists which may contribute to child mortality, we measure whether the children of modern polygamists are less likely to receive a broad suite of early-life investments, including vaccinations and medical care in the prenatal period. While these correlations suggest that the children of polygamists receive fewer health investments, a number of these results become statistically insignificant and much smaller in magnitude after controlling for location fixed effects and predetermined controls such as wealth and maternal education. Thus, these results point to selection into polygamy as an important mechanism underlying the polygamy-child mortality relationship. Finally, we test for the role of differential selection into polygamous unions, and show that several observable characteristics of polygamist parents differ from those of monogamists. No single characteristic so substantially weakens the correlation of polygamy with child mortality that we can identify it as the most important margin of selection. Nevertheless, and in accordance with our findings on behavioral practices, our results on polygamist selectivity are consistent with the importance of unobserved features of the locations where polygamists reside, women’s education and opportunities, and general socioeconomic status. There exists a large literature testing how family form and composition affects resource allocation decisions within the household. Factors such as the household’s size, age profile, marital type, and kinship type; the gender of decision-makers; and the social status of household members; can affect household outcomes including the types of expenditures made, the distribution of investments amongst members, and the efficiency of household production (Black et al. 2005; Browning 1992; Browning et al. 2014; Duflo and Udry 2004; Grossbard 2014; Kazianga and Wahhaj 2016; Pilla and Dantas 2016; Tertilt 2005). Recent work has focused on how characteristics and intra-household dynamics peculiar to polygamous households may affect consumption and resource allocation. A key feature of this literature is an examination of the dynamics between wives. For instance, although polygamous households may be intuitively expected to be inefficient, due largely to competition between wives, the evidence is mixed: some studies reject the collective rationality of polygamous households (Dauphin et al. 2015), while others affirm it (Dauphin et al. 2010); yet others find their efficiency to be context-dependent (Dauphin 2013). Agarwal (1997) and Akresh et al. (2012, 2016) emphasize the role of co-wife cooperation in polygamous households, where the lack of altruism in co-wife relationships leads to greater productive efficiency between co-wives than between spouses. For contrast, Rossi (2015), Arthi and Fenske (2016), and Kazianga and Klonner (2006) point to co-wife rivalry as a driver of fertility competition amongst polygamist wives, of strategic time mis-allocation in child care, and of health disparities by wife rank, respectively. Meanwhile, Han and Foltz (2015) find that the degree of co-wife competition or cooperation depends on the ethnic context of polygyny. Thus, the balance of power between spouses and amongst wives in polygamous households—and so too, the distribution of resources to children—may depend both on the distinct cultural features of polygamous households, and on selectivity into polygamy by widely-cited determinants of bargaining power such as education, wealth, and outside options. Investigation of the effects of household composition, through intra-household bargaining, on children’s outcomes is a key theme in the work of Angus Deaton. Although some of this research focuses on the effects of household size on per capita food availability (Deaton and Paxson 1998), or offers recommendations to improve the quality of data used to test for age and gender differences in poverty and resource allocation (Case and Deaton 2003), the bulk of this strand of research concerns gender discrimination in intra-household allocation to children. Specifically, Deaton and his co-authors test for such discrimination by using the demographic separability of certain consumption categories to determine the degree to which parents sacrifice their own consumption to accommodate the addition to the household of a son vs. a daughter (Deaton and Muellbauer 1986; Deaton et al. 1989). Using this method, they find suggestive but surprisingly limited evidence of gender discrimination in poor and rural households in Asia and Africa (Deaton 1989; Subramanian and Deaton 1991). Indeed, in response to his own body of research, and a number of similar studies it spawned, Deaton remarks that “it is a puzzle” that expenditure data consistently fails to show gender effects, even where discrimination is known qualitatively to exist, and where outcomes show clear evidence of gender-based differences in welfare (Deaton 1997, p. 240). While the household-level budgetary data typically available may tend to obscure the effects of household composition on resource allocation (Kingdon 2005), it is clear that Deaton’s intuition regarding the effects of household form on child well-being remains relevant to studies, such as this and others on the welfare effects of polygamy, which use health outcomes as a revealed measure of parental investment.Footnote 5
 Our work adds to this literature by examining how the practice of polygamy—through household organization, features, and behaviors unique to this form of marriage—correlates with child survival. In particular, we show that while there are gender differences in survival in polygamist households, which suggest that these households have either different gender preferences in their offspring or different balances of spousal bargaining power than their monogamist counterparts, there is no evidence of a wife-seniority gradient in child mortality among polygamists. Our finding that polygamy is associated with higher rates of child mortality also suggests that the potential child health benefits of cooperation amongst co-wives may be negligible. The impact of household form on the distribution of resources to children is of special concern in poor and rural settings, in which the scope to invest in children’s nutrition, health care, and education may be limited. Both theory and evidence on childhood poverty and poverty alleviation suggest that children in disadvantaged households suffer worse health and well-being in the short term as well as in later life (Almond et al. 2011; Heckman 2007; Wood 2003). The same may also be the case amongst young children living in poor regions more generally (Chetty et al. 2015; Smith-Greenway and Trinitapoli 2014). Similarly, adverse shocks to household income (e.g., Banerjee et al. 2010; Fishback and Thomasson 2014) and nutritional availability (e.g., Barker and Osmond 1986; Ó Gráda 2011) have been shown to do meaningful damage to children’s human capital (see Almond and Currie 2011 for an in-depth survey). Given the prevalence of polygamy in poor and rural regions (Smith-Greenway and Trinitapoli 2014), the selection of poorer and less well educated women into polygamous unions (Amankwaa 1996), and the vulnerability of children in polygamous households to reductions in their access to resources (Brahmbhatt et al. 2002; De La Croix and Mariani 2015), the association between early-life conditions and child health is of particular relevance to our study. Here, too, Deaton’s work offers insights into the relationship between poverty, early-life conditions, and health. This body of research investigates a number of big-picture issues such as socioeconomic gradients in multi-dimensional health and subjective well-being (Case and Deaton 2005; Deaton 2008b, 2012; Kahneman and Deaton 2010), the impact of income inequality on health (Deaton 2003, 2008a; Deaton and Lubotsky 2003), and the differences within and across countries in the association between improvements in income and those in health (Cutler et al. 2006). However, it also addresses smaller-scale questions such as the degree to which income constrains nutritional provision (Subramanian and Deaton 1996) and the effects of the early-life disease environment on survival and growth (Bozzoli et al. 2009; Deaton 2007). These latter studies are especially relevant in our context, and emphasize that income likely matters most to nutrition, health, and mortality risk at the lower end of the income distribution. For instance, Deaton (2007) and Bozzoli et al. (2009) find that the adverse effects of the early-life disease environment on adult height in poor settings are so strong that mortality selection (the culling of the health distribution’s lower tail), dominates the scarring effects (the damage to individual health status) associated with poverty and early-life morbidity. Their results are especially relevant to our study, since they not only suggest a strong impact of poverty on child health, but also provide a setting in which selection (in their case, into survivorship; in ours, into polygamous households) plays an important role in driving the observed health outcomes. Indeed, our work emphasizes the role of rural poverty in the relationship between Igbo polygamy and child mortality. Firstly, we find that polygamy—which is more prevalent in poor, rural, and socially conservative regions—is associated with poor child survival, suggesting a role for selection into polygamy on the basis of both observable and unobservable characteristics of the places in which this marriage form most often occurs. Secondly, we show that child mortality is higher in polygamist households through the relatively poorer education of polygamist mothers, a characteristic itself associated with poverty and resulting in lower levels of investment in infant health. Thus, we show that the selection of poorer and less well educated women into polygamy is also an important factor underlying the polygamy-child mortality correlation. Together, our results contribute to the literature on polygamy and child mortality by suggesting that selection may play an important part in explaining the correlation between the two, particularly on the unobservable characteristics of individuals, households, and the communities from which polygamists are drawn. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, we discuss the literature on Igbo polygamy and child mortality, and enumerate the channels identified in the literature for the general correlation between polygamy and child mortality. Section 3 describes our sources of historical and modern data. In section 4, we outline both our approaches to analyzing the modern and historical data, as well as the techniques we use to assess the mechanisms driving the polygamy-child mortality relationship and the sensitivity of our results to observed and unobserved variables. These results and sensitivity analyses are presented in sections 5 and 6. Section 7 concludes.",32

His 1985 paper with Browning and Irish was among the first to jointly analyze labor supply and consumption in a framework entailing both dynamics and uncertainty; as such, it had a deep influence over subsequent research on the topic—an influence that I am personally eager to acknowledge. At the core of any empirical model of labor supply—and, as a matter of fact, of any empirical analysis of household behavior—is the need to reconcile the precision of theoretical predictions based on specific functional forms with the apparent fuzziness of data. Theory typically predicts a deterministic relationship between the economic context (characterized by wages, non labor income, family composition, etc.) and households’ behavioral responses. In practice, however, individuals or household facing similar economic conditions may react in widely different ways. Usually, these discrepancies are attributed to two possible sources: errors and unobserved heterogeneity. In the first category, one could include not only measurement issues (on which Angus has worked extensively), but also such behavioral aspects as limited rationality, imperfect maximization or pure mistakes; in the second, it is usual to gather a host of factors (such as idiosyncratic tastes or private costs) that, despite their importance in determining behavior, are not observed by the econometrician. In both cases, an econometrician’s standard response is to introduce some stochastic shocks that capture these effects. Importantly, these shocks are not supposed to represent any explicit randomness; they are simply a reduced form for (mostly deterministic) effects that we cannot directly apprehend. In this paper, I suggest another possible interpretation for these random terms. Namely, I submit that, in some (and possibly many) circumstances, optimal behavior entails explicit randomization. This phenomenon has been largely overlooked so far, at least in empirical microeconomics. I will argue that this omission is a by-product of a standard (and I think unwarranted) methodological bias, whereby multiperson units (households in particular) are represented as a single decision maker (the so-called unitary approach). If one is willing to accept that a couple (say) consists of two individuals, whose utilities need not be exactly identical (and who therefore need not, ex ante, exactly agree on every possible decision), then whenever the economic context involves indivisibilities—or more generally any type of non convexities—randomization may be part of the optimal decision process. In other words, I will argue that, in some (and possibly many) situations, heterogeneous behaviors do not simply reflect our inability to accurately measure outcomes or observe relevant individual characteristics. Instead, when observationally identical individuals behave differently, it may well be the case that these differences are optimal responses to the economic context they are facing. A direct implication of this argument is to point out (still) another weakness of the unitary model. A standard criticism of unitary approaches, whereby a group is represented by a single, well-behaved utility that is maximized under feasibility constraints, is that it disregards power relationships. In general, changes in the economic environment (prices, wages, incomes or any other relevant ‘distribution factor’) may affect the respective bargaining positions of the group members. As a result, while the maximization assumption is in general acceptable, the maximand varies with the environment, a feature that is not permitted by the unitary approach. A natural translation, at the core of the collective model, is that the household maximizes some function of individual utilities, and that this function directly depends on prices, incomes, and possibly other relevant variables. In other words, one may want to allow for prices and incomes to directly impact the shape of household preferences, in order to capture possible changes in the intrahousehold distribution of power resulting from variations in the economic environment. From this perspective, there would be a situation in which the unitary approach would be justified—namely, whenever household utility can be represented by a function of individual utilities that is price- and income-independent. The argument developed below, however, suggests that even the latter claim is actually incorrect. In the presence of non convexities, the unitary approach, even with a price and income-independent household welfare index, may generate outcomes that are suboptimal in the Pareto sense—the reason being that it does not allow for randomization, even when randomized decisions are actually optimal. The standard, unitary approach, therefore, does not only disregard power relationships; even leaving these aside, it typically fails to capture the richness of multi-person decision processes and their potential consequence on behavior.",

Miller,Kevin A. Park,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"On June 26, 2015 the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges (135 S.Ct. 2071, 576 U.S., 191 L. Ed. 2d 953 (2015)) that all same-sex couples have the right to marry in the United States. That decision capped a decade of piecemeal yet remarkable change in state same-sex marriage laws. Beginning with Massachusetts in 2004, each state pursued a different path towards marriage equality. Some voluntarily implemented same-sex marriage laws through legislation or voter initiatives. Others were forced to repeal bans on same-sex marriage by state and federal courts. The extension of the right-to-marry provided many benefits to gay and lesbian households that had previously been available only to heterosexual couples. Many of these benefits affect household formation and tenure choice. For example, marriage reduces the cost of homeownership by clarifying transfer of property in death, simplifying tax preparation, and introducing a formal contract that specifies the distribution of assets upon dissolution of the relationship. By lowering the cost of owning a home, the availability of marriage and its associated benefits could increase the demand for mortgage credit. To test this hypothesis and identify the causal effect of marriage on the demand for mortgage credit we exploit the sporadic implementation of state same-sex marriage laws prior to the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, often through court order in which the outcome and timing of ruling was unknown. Variation in timing is commonly used in the literature to estimate the causal impact of policy on economic outcomes (Autor et al. 2006; Adams and Cotti 2008). More specifically, recent work has used plausibly exogenous implementation to separately identify the causal effect of same-sex marriage on risky behavior (Dee 2008) and household dynamics like marriage, divorce, and extramarital births (Langbein and Yost 2009; Dillender 2014; Trandafir 2015). We estimate states that implemented same-sex marriage experienced a roughly 6–16% increase in same-sex mortgage applications. The results are robust to a variety of tests examining the timing and method of enactment and alternative policies such as housing anti-discrimination laws, civil unions, and the repeal of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). We also find strong evidence supporting the parallel trends assumption integral to our differences-in-differences research design. Although many studies document the positive association between marriage and homeownership, the studies are unable to disentangle the interdependency of observed and unobserved personal characteristics. For example, those entering into a marriage contract could demonstrate a preference for stability in partnership that may be correlated with a preference for stability in tenure. Our study contributes to broader literature on the economics of marriage by establishing the direct relationship between marriage and homeownership through the examination of a natural experiment that extended the right to marry to a select population at different points in time. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to examine the causal effect of state-level variation in marriage laws on the demand for mortgage credit. The findings further our understanding of the economics of the household at a crucial point in time in the evolution of marriage and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights.",11
16.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,09 May 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9335-z,Food insecurity and housing instability in vulnerable families,June 2018,Christian King,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Food insecurity, the lack of access to enough food to maintain an active and healthy life, affects many households and families in the United States. In 2014, almost one out of six Americans—or about 50 million—is food insecure (Coleman-Jensen et al. 2015). Food insecurity leads to many negative consequences for families. For example, a literature review on the impact of food insecurity on health documents many negative short and long-term outcomes for children, adults, and also seniors (Gundersen and Ziliak 2015). Reviewing the literature on the determinants of food insecurity, Gundersen and Ziliak (2014) list the following factors that increase the risk of child food insecurity: poor maternal mental health, single parenthood, drug use and abuse, unstable family structure with a non-resident father, being an immigrant, paternal incarceration, and non-center based child care. In addition, economic hardship and low-income are also strongly correlated with household food insecurity (Coleman-Jensen et al. 2015). Most studies on the negative consequences of food insecurity have focused on health outcomes. Few studies have examined its impacts on another type of hardship: housing instability. Housing instability, which includes missing rent or mortgage payments, doubling-up or overcrowding, moving more than once per year, having been evicted, or being homeless, is highly prevalent among low-income households, households experiencing economic hardship, and those who receive public assistance (Acs and Loprest 2004; Burgard et al. 2012; Phinney et al. 2007; Van Order and Zorn 2002; Wood and Rangarajan 2005). Housing instability has an association with several negative long-term outcomes in adults including poor physical and mental health (Burgard et al. 2012; Park et al. 2011; Ross and Squires 2011; Suglia et al. 2011). For children, housing instability can lead to poorer physical and mental health (Masten et al. 1997; Rafferty et al. 2004; Wood et al. 1990). Stable housing is an important factor contributing to the well-being of individuals and families, which facilitates access to health care services, employment, and education (Bratt 2002; Kushel et al. 2006). The negative consequences of housing instability on child health could be long-lasting and contribute to health disparities as children in poorer health lag behind their peers in physical development, educational attainment, and labor market outcomes (Oreopoulos et al. 2008). Determining the direction of the causality between food insecurity and housing instability is not a trivial task. Studies on the relationship between food insecurity and housing instability are lacking, despite the fact that they are correlated (Kushel et al. 2006; Ma et al. 2008). A report commissioned by Feeding America, a network of food banks, shows that over half (57 %) of the 46.5 million unique clients that Feeding America serves reported having to make the difficult choice between paying for housing or food (Weinfield et al. 2014), an increase from 46 % in its 2010 report (Mabli et al. 2010). A handful of studies have examined the association between homelessness—a specific instance of housing instability—and food insecurity. Gundersen et al. (2003) used a sample of 299 families in Massachusetts to find no association between homelessness and food insecurity. Using a sample of households in Los Angeles County, Furness et al. (2004) found that a history of homelessness is associated with food insecurity. Lee and Greif (2008) used data from the National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients (NSHAPC) and found that homeless individuals were at higher risk of experiencing food insecurity. Some limitations of these studies are their cross-sectional design and the possibility that the findings could be due to selection. Food insecurity has many negative consequences, hinting to three notable potential mediating factors that could explain (part or most of) the relationship between food insecurity and housing instability: (1) maternal depression, (2) experiencing material hardship, and (3) having lower levels of social support. Food insecurity is associated with maternal depression and poor mental health (Hadley and Patil 2006; Heflin et al. 2005; Huddleston-Casas et al. 2009; Whitaker et al. 2006). First, food insecurity could increase the risk of maternal depression through the accumulation of stress from experiencing food insufficiency (Heflin et al. 2005; Whitaker et al. 2006
), or through multiple nutritional deficiencies such as in vitamin B12 and folate (Alpert and Fava 1997; Reynolds 2002; Tiermeier et al. 2002). In addition, maternal depression increases the risk of experiencing housing instability (Corman et al. 2016; Curtis et al. 2014). As a result, maternal depression could mediate the relationship between food insecurity and housing instability. Second, food insecure households tend to have lower levels of social support and informal networks (Tarasuk 2001; Walker et al. 2007), which could be a result of ineffective coping strategies (Mills and Hanson 2013). Mental illness and depression reduces the instrumental and social support available to household heads (Harknett and Hartnett 2011). Households lacking social support are substantially more likely to experience housing instability and homelessness (Eyrich et al. 2003; Fertig and Reingold 2008; Lee et al. 2010). Social support could therefore mediate the relationship between food insecurity and housing instability. Third, food insecure households are more likely to experience various forms of material hardship (e.g. did not pay utility bills on time and got disconnected) (Corcoran et al. 1999; Heflin 2006). Households experiencing material hardships are at higher risk of housing instability and homelessness (Bassuk et al. 1997; Fertig and Reingold 2008; Lee et al. 2010). For example, a household often late on paying utility bills may be more likely to be behind on subsequent rent payments, which may lead to eviction. As a result, food insecurity could have an association with housing instability through the depletion or unavailability of resources. The diagram in Fig. 1 summarizes these potential mediators. Because this study cannot establish causality (which will be discussed further as limitations), the arrows represent associations rather than directional links. In addition, the diagram is a simplified picture. There may be additional associations between the variables shown (especially between the mediators). However, establishing all possible paths is beyond the scope of this study and not essential for its purpose, which is to test whether these factors play a mediating role. Diagram showing mediating factors in the relationship between food insecurity and housing instability This study uses longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), a sample of predominantly unmarried mothers, to examine whether food insecurity has an association with housing instability. Using difference-in-difference (DiD) models, I find that food insecurity has a statistically significant association with experiencing housing instability. To address potential selection and unobserved heterogeneity due to the possibility that food insecure households are not comparable to food secure households, I estimate two additional sets of models. Propensity score matching models show that the association between food insecurity and housing instability remains statistically significant. In addition, restricting the sample to only households that did not experience prior housing instability also yielded similar results. Examining three sets of mediators, I find that material hardship and social support explain about half of this association. This indicates that food insecurity increases the risk of housing instability through a combination of material hardship and a lack of instrumental support. A stronger social safety net through public assistance programs, which are effective in reducing food insecurity (Borjas 2004; Gundersen and Ziliak 2014; Meyers et al. 2005; Ziliak 2015), would reduce material hardship and strengthen social networks and support, resulting in a lower risk of housing instability.",31

Diette,Arthur H. Goldsmith,William Darity Jr.,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In recent years, social scientists have been evaluating hypotheses aimed at explaining the determinants of happiness using data drawn from surveys providing self-reports of happiness and subjective well-being.Footnote 1 Researchers over the past two decades also have reported that a substantial share of Americans have been subjected to maltreatment as children. For instance, an astonishing 22 percent of Americans report having suffered from childhood sexual abuse; 21 percent indicate they were the victims of physical abuse as a youth, and 14 percent had witnessed maternal violence in the home as children (Edwards et al. 2003; Kilpatrick and Saunders 1997). Moreover, there is large body of research (Benjet et al. 2010; Kessler et al. 1997; Kendler et al. 2000; Shalem et al. 2012; and Diette et al. 2014) linking maltreatment as a youth with poor mental health later in life. However, scholars have yet to explore carefully the connection between traumatic victimization earlier in life and level of happiness as an adult.Footnote 2
 Exposure to traumatic events can have both direct and indirect effects—by altering factors such as mental health and personal behavioral—on subsequent subjective well-being. There is a substantial body of research demonstrating an association between violence victimization during childhood and both emotional distress and problematic behavior as a youth (Hughes 1988; Garbarino and Abramowitz 1992; Sternberg et al. 1993; Berman et al. 1996; Berton and Stabb 1996; Cooley-Quille et al. 2001; Gabarino et al. 1992).Footnote 3 However, due to endogeniety, it is difficult to establish if these outcomes of violence victimization are the pathways leading to lower happiness later in life without appropriate instruments.Footnote 4 Thus, this paper contributes to the literature by documenting if an association exists between trauma and subsequent happiness. We unite the separate literatures on adult happiness and maltreatment as a youth to determine whether traumatic victimization early in life that occurs inside and outside of the household negatively affects a person’s life to the extent that it is linked to lower levels of happiness as an adult. Using data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a large nationally representative survey, we estimate the connection between experiencing four alternative forms of traumatic victimization—violence in the home as a youth, sexual assault, violence in the community, and stalking—on current happiness as an adult. Our findings reveal that being the victim of these traumatic experiences is associated with lower levels of happiness as an adult, after accounting for a wide range of factors expected to affect subjective well-being, and the magnitude of these effects is similar to that of major sources of disappointment as an adult including unemployment and low social standing. In addition, the probability of being happy as adult declines for females and males as the total number of different types of traumas a person is the victim of rises. Some economists view subjective well-being, or happiness, as a proxy for “utility” (Thaler 1992; Frey and Stutzer 2002), while others consider self-perception of happiness as an indicator of revealed preference for various forms of consumption or experiences (Kahneman and Krueger 2006). Empirical work providing a deeper understanding of the determinants of individual happiness is helpful to policymakers in designing and implementing initiatives that advance societal well-being (Frey and Stutzer 2002). For instance, although happiness measures are highly correlated with conventional, material-oriented measures of well-being such as consumption, income, and wealth (Gruber and Mullainathan 2005; Kahneman and Krueger 2006; Stevenson and Wolfers 2009), research reveals that happiness self-assessments are strongly associated with non-financial factors including relationships (Myers and Diener 1996; Frey and Stutzer 2002).Footnote 5 Moreover, studies reveal relatively small and short-lived effects of changes in most life circumstances on reported life satisfaction, a phenomenon referred to as the “hedonic treadmill” (Kahneman and Krueger 2006). However, the existing research has found a consistently large and sustained significance of personal socioeconomic developments including self-perceived social standing and unemployment on self-reported life satisfaction. Thus, numerous economists (Kahneman and Krueger 2006; Graham 2008) and psychologists (Diener and Seligman 2008; and Ostir et al. 2000) suggest that policy-makers not only emphasize increasing consumption opportunities, but also take these social insights into account when designing new programs.",4

Intrahousehold bargaining and the distribution of utility within marriage,June 2018,Dirk Bethmann,Robert Rudolf,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Until recently, measuring utility directly was thought of to be impossible by neoclassical economists. Thus, scholars contented themselves with studying the symptoms of utility, rather than utility itself, using revealed preferences such as consumption choices and time allocation. After two decades of steady growth in the happiness economics literature, however, the picture has changed. Advancements in data quality, in the measurement of subjective well-being (SWB), as well as in statistical techniques compatible with SWB data has allowed economists to look at “experienced” utility in a more direct manner. The rise of happiness economics in part means returning to the roots of utility (Kahneman et al. 1997). In fact, Jeremy Bentham coined the terms utility and utilitarianism to describe what he called the “Highest Happiness Principle.” Two centuries after Bentham, economists use measures of self-reported happiness and satisfaction in a growing variety of econometric applications such as studies of unemployment, income and wealth, health, marriage, etc. (Easterlin 1974; Clark and Oswald 1994; Luttmer 2005; Gardner and Oswald 2007; Clark et al. 2008; Deaton 2008; Dolan et al. 2008; van Praag and Ferrer-i-Carbonell 2008; Stiglitz et al. 2009; Layard 2010). The literature on intrahousehold allocation of resources has strongly relied on the revealed preference approach to make predictions about the allocation of utility within families. Many empirical economic analyses have found that allocation of resources by households varies with individual resources of family members, starting with Grossbard’s (1976) study showing that in a polygamous society the number of wives in a household is a function of such individual resources. Theories of households’ allocation of time and money assuming divergent interests by family members, and thus implying that pooling all incomes is problematic, include Becker (1973; his first theory of marriage), Manser and Brown (1980), McElroy and Horney (1981), and Grossbard-Shechtman (1984). It has generally been found that incomes within households are not pooled, but rather that expenditures depend on the relative education, incomes, and assets of individual family members (Thomas 1990; Hoddinott and Haddad 1995; Lundberg et al. 1997; Duflo 2003; Brown 2009; Li and Wu 2011; Doss 2013). Men are usually found to spend a higher share of their income on goods for their personal consumption, while women are more likely to purchase goods for children and for general household usage. Higher female bargaining power has further been found to be associated with increased time spent in household chores by husbands and increased leisure time of wives (Bittman et al. 2003; Brown 2009). It has also been shown that where women are likely to have a higher value on the marriage market (due to e.g., higher sex ratios among marriage market participants), they are less likely to supply their labor in the work force and thus have more leisure (Grossbard-Shechtman and Granger 1998). Stevenson and Wolfers (2006) have shown that an exogenous increase in female bargaining power decreased domestic violence in the USA. This article is the first to combine the economic analysis of happiness with that of intra-marriage allocation by testing how direct measures of individual utility of husbands and wives vary with their individual resources. We chose the case of Korea for our empirical analysis for two reasons: First, being a highly developed country, data sets provided are both of high quality and substantial time series length. We are able to use six annual waves of a rich longitudinal data set [Korean Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS)] from 2003 to 2008. Second, although highly developed in terms of its economy, Korean households continue to follow traditional gender roles more than is common in the West. In international rankings of gender equality, Korea lacks far behind other developed countries. While the country in 2014 was ranked 15th in the Human Development Index, it ranked only 117th in the Global Gender Gap index. The fact that Korean gender roles remain much more traditional today is often ascribed to the widespread Neo-Confucian culture on the one hand and rapid economic development on the other hand. Confucian thought promotes patriarchic social and family structures, and is prevalent across all age groups, yet most strongly within the older generation (Yang 2003; Jang et al. 2009). Korean labor markets show high levels of gender discrimination in hiring, pay, and promotion (Yoo 2003; Hausmann et al. 2014). While younger generations adhere less to Confucian ideas compared to their parents, the Korean example shows that cultural change can sometimes not keep pace with economic catch-up. For reasons of statistical inference of the gendered distribution of utility within households, it is certainly an advantage to have a case study with sufficient variation in terms of gender outcomes. In addition, on-going cultural changes in Korea will also allow us to shed some light on generation effects. In a very recent study, Ham and Song (2014) also use the KLIPS data set for the estimation of a bargaining model. Using information on transfer payments of young Korean couples to spousal parents, their regression results indicate a slightly higher bargaining power for wives. When using experienced utility, we find no difference in relative spousal benefits from marriage within young couples. Within older couples, however, we find that men benefit significantly more from marriage than their spouses. This is even true after the marital union is dissolved: divorced men experience a greater utility loss than their female counterparts. The estimated gender difference seems to reflect the distinctive roles women and men—both unwed and married—have in the Korean society, and how these roles are changing over time. We argue that it is in line with Akerlof and Kranton’s (2000) theory of identity. Grossbard’s “work-in-household” theory (cf. Grossbard-Shechtman 1984) can also explain our finding. Discrimination of women in the labor market is likely to cause low levels of compensation for female services in the household which in turn causes the gender difference in experienced utility.",5

The impact of expected spouse earnings",June 2018,Katherine Michelmore,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The earned income tax credit (EITC) has become the largest cash transfer program in the United States, distributing over $60 billion dollars in benefits in recent years (Tax Policy Center 2011). In 2014, the maximum federal benefit for a household with three children was $6,143, which represents up to 45 % of household earnings among recipients. Cohabitation rates have also increased sharply over the last decade and have become less and less associated with marriage, particularly among the low-income population (Bumpass and Lu 2000; Kennedy and Bumpass 2011; Lichter et al. 2006). The expansion of the EITC over this time period may have played a role in the rise of cohabitation. Since the EITC is based on family earnings, it may discourage marriage for many dual-earner households, while encouraging traditional, single-breadwinner families.Footnote 1 While policy efforts have been made in recent years to eliminate the marriage penalty from the EITC by increasing the earnings thresholds for married couples, the current policy retains elements that create distortive incentives for marriage. There has been a considerable amount of research analyzing how welfare benefits affect marriage decisions (Bitler et al. 2004; Grogger and Bronars 2001; Moffitt 1998), and how the tax structure more broadly incentivizes or discourages marriage (e.g., Alm et al. 1999; Alm and Whittington 2003). Many of these studies find either no effect or only modest impacts of welfare benefits and tax penalties on marriage. Others have studied the impact of the EITC on marriage and divorce (Dickert-Conlin and Houser 2002; Eissa and Hoynes 2000; Ellwood 2000; Fisher 2013; Herbst 2011), generally finding modest, negative effects on marriage. In this analysis, I investigate how the EITC has impacted marriage and cohabitation among low-income single mothers, making the following contributions to the literature. First, this analysis adds to the literature on the EITC and family structure by quantifying the expected gains and losses in EITC benefits upon marriage for a sample of single mothers. Much of the EITC literature on this topic evaluates a marriage penalty for a sample of individuals already cohabiting or married, excluding single, non-cohabiting individuals. This paper is the first in the EITC literature to estimate a potential loss or gain in EITC benefits for individuals not currently cohabiting or married, providing the first descriptive picture of the distribution of expected gains or losses in EITC benefits associated with marriage for low-income single mothers. The federal policy changes to the EITC benefit structure over this time period provide variation for illustrating how the marriage penalty has changed over time. Second, much of the previous work examining the impact of the EITC on marriage decisions either does not take into account the heterogeneity in the penalties or subsidies associated with the EITC, or measures these penalties after coresidential decisions have already been made, raising concerns of endogeneity of labor market decisions to marriage and cohabitation decisions. This analysis expands on prior work by simulating a marriage market to generate exogenous variation in spouse earnings in order to estimate potential gains or losses in EITC benefits associated with marriage. This method is advantageous in that earnings are evaluated prior to marriage and cohabitation decisions, reducing concerns of endogeneity of earnings with respect to coresidential decisions. Third, with the exception of Dickert-Conlin and Houser (2002), which was based on data prior to the expansions of the EITC for married couples, many of the recent analyses of the marriage disincentives associated with the EITC estimate the impact of the EITC on the stock of existing marriages (Eissa and Hoynes 2000; Fisher 2013; Herbst 2011). Measuring the stock of marriages rather than transitions into marriage could bias estimates of the impact of the EITC on marriage decisions if households simultaneously make marriage decisions and adjust their earnings to minimize household tax burden. Using panel data, I estimate the impact of the EITC on transitions into marriage and cohabitation. This allows for a clean identification of how tax incentives affect family formation decisions because policy changes and household earnings are measured prior to the marriage decision. Finally, this analysis builds on prior work by incorporating several different exogenous sources of variation in determining whether a single mother can expect to gain or lose EITC benefits upon marriage. The first source of variation comes from the random spouse match, which generates random variation in the earnings of potential spouses that is exogenous to single mother’s own earnings. Second, I incorporate exogenous variation generated by several federal policy changes to the EITC over the last decade that have affected the size and the likelihood of experiencing a marriage penalty. Finally, there have also been several states that have introduced their own EITCs over this time period, which also vary in generosity both across and within states over time. This variation will also lead to exogenous variation in the size of the expected loss in EITC benefits, and will amplify the effects of federal policy changes. Through these different sources of variation, this paper provides updated estimates on how policy-induced changes to the EITC affect marriage and cohabitation rates of low-income, single mothers. To conduct this analysis, I first simulate a marriage market to predict the earnings of potential spouses using data on single men and women from the 2001, 2004, and 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Based on the matches made in this simulated marriage market, I calculate the expected household EITC within and outside of marriage for this hypothetical couple using federal and state tax laws. I then illustrate how federal and state policy changes to the EITC schedule for married couples have affected the marriage penalty in recent years. I use multinomial logistic regressions to analyze the effect of an expected loss or gain in EITC benefits upon marriage, on decisions for single mothers to cohabit or marry during the SIPP survey. I then conduct several alternate specifications of the expected loss function as well as alternate specifications of potential spouse earnings to further identify the population most likely to respond to expected losses in EITC benefits upon marriage. Results from the simulated marriage market suggest that the average EITC-eligible single mother can expect to lose approximately $1300 in EITC benefits upon marriage, about 40 % of pre-marriage EITC benefits. The likelihood of losing benefits upon marriage, as well as the size of the marriage penalty have decreased in recent years due to the federal expansions to the EITC benefit schedule for married couples. In my sample, the marriage penalty declined from an average loss of $1600 in 2001 to $745 in 2009 (2014$). Single mothers who expect to lose benefits upon marriage are 2.5 percentage points less likely to marry their partners, and 2.5 percentage points more likely to cohabit with their partners compared to women who do not face a marriage penalty associated with the EITC. Results are concentrated among the least educated single mothers, as well as underrepresented minorities. These results suggest that the EITC affects the marriage and cohabitation decisions of low-income single mothers, contributing to the divergence in marriage and cohabitation patterns between low-income and higher-income women in the United States.",26

Gunter,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"As of 2013, 27 percent of children aged 0–18 did not live in the same household as their father (US Census 2013). Children who grow up in households without fathers are at increased risk for poverty and material hardship (DeNavas-Walt and Proctor 2014; Lerman 2002), have worse educational outcomes (Ginther and Pollak 2004; Painter and Levine 2000), and are more likely to engage in delinquent behaviors (Comanor and Phillips 2002). The child support system plays an important role in mitigating poverty in single-mother families: $32 billion was collected in child support in 2013 and child support constitutes 45 percent of total income for poor families that receive it (Office of Child Support Enforcement 2014). In addition to increasing custodial mothers’ financial resources, child support enforcement can also affect other aspects of child wellbeing by altering noncustodial parents’ contact with their children. Peters et al. (2004) find that policies that increase child support payments cause the frequency of noncustodial fathers’ contact with their children to increase, and Nepomnyaschy (2007) also finds that higher amounts of child support paid increase father–child contact. This paper considers the possibility that the mechanism by which fathers pay child support, regardless of payment amount, affects the father–child relationship. Wage withholding became the default method for child support payment due to passage of federal and state wage withholding laws during the 1980s and 1990s and 70 percent of child support payments routed through state child support enforcement agencies are now collected through wage withholding (OCSE 2014). The child support literature has advanced several models of child support enforcement under which wage withholding could affect father–child contact. First, withholding increases custodial mothers’ bargaining power by enforcing child support orders automatically. Del Boca (2003) and Del Boca and Ribero (2001, 2003) illustrate this with a bargaining model in which fathers trade visitation time for child support. Withholding makes payment mandatory and consequently increases mothers’ bargaining power. This effectively increases mothers’ income at the expense of fathers’ income. Fathers consequently “purchase” less contact even when the equilibrium amount of support paid is the same. Second, the shift from discretionary to automatic enforcement resulting from withholding laws may reduce feelings of unfairness and reduce conflict between parents, which could increase father–child contact (McLanahan et al. 1994; Seltzer et al. 1998). In addition, recent work in behavioral public finance has shown that the salience, or visibility, of payments can influence behavior even when the monetary value of a payment is held constant. Individuals respond to fully salient prices or payments by incorporating all information when making economic decisions. When payments are less salient, or less visible, individuals have access to full information but do not use it when making economic choices. Finkelstein (2009) finds that the short-run price elasticity of driving declines after the introduction of less salient electronic toll collection, and Chetty et al. (2009) report that when stores alter tax salience by posting true (tax-inclusive) prices, consumer purchases decreased relative to purchases for goods posted with tax-exclusive prices. Stango and Zinman (2014) find that consumers were less likely to incur bank overdrafts after completing a survey that increased the salience of overdraft fees. In the context of child support, the government’s decision to enact wage withholding arguably makes child support payments less salient for nonresident fathers by changing the process from one that requires action to an automatic default. Reducing the salience of child support payments may also reduce the salience of the underlying reason for those payments: the father’s obligation to support the child. If so, a shift from direct child support payment methods to wage withholding may impact father–child contact even for fathers who would pay the full mandated amount of support in the absence of enforcement. This paper examines whether child support wage withholding has a causal effect on father–child contact. First, I review the predictions of models of contact from the child support literature, including the bargaining models of Del Boca (2003) and Del Boca and Ribero (2001, 2003) and the schematic model of child wellbeing by McLanahan et al. (1994). Second, I contribute to the literature on salience of payments by formally modeling the effects on father–child contact of reduced salience of child support paid via withholding. I then use data from the 1994–2006 Current Population Survey Child Support Supplements to test for an effect of withholding on father–child contact. In order to estimate a causal relationship, I instrument for wage withholding using the introduction of state wage withholding laws. I find that withholding lowers the frequency of contact between fathers and their children. Last, I explore the relationship between additional payment process characteristics including payment frequency and payment route in order to partially distinguish between the possible theoretical explanations for the effect. The negative effect of withholding on contact is consistent both with withholding increasing mothers’ bargaining power and lowering the salience of child support obligations. I find that parents whose support schedules require them to pay on a more frequent basis, all else equal, spend more time with their children, which is consistent with increased salience of child support obligations leading to increased contact. I observe large effects of withholding on contact for fathers whose payments are transmitted to the mother directly or via direct deposit to the mother’s account, but I do not observe an effect of withholding on contact for fathers whose payments are routed through courts or government agencies. This is consistent with bargaining effects because payments routed via government agencies are monitored by a third party regardless of payment method, which may reduce the scope for bargaining. These results suggest that both bargaining and salience effects may contribute to the negative effect of withholding on father–child contact, and should be considered when designing policies to support contact.",2
16.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,26 May 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9336-y,Parental child care during and outside of typical work hours,June 2018,Alice Schoonbroodt,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"While James Heckman and co-authors have shown that early childhood education is of primary importance to adult outcomes (see, e.g., Cunha and Heckman 2007, AER), recent research findings suggest that parental time, and father’s time in particular, is a crucial ingredient in child quality production (see, e.g., Boca et al. 2014, ReStud). Moreover, the overall income gradient of child care appears to be positive. As such, it has been argued that child care should be modeled separately from other household chores and leisure, both of which have negative income gradients (see, e.g., Guryan et al. 2008, JEL). Understanding household time allocation is important for family policy. Affected areas include, but are not limited to, parental leave policies, child care tax deductibility and education subsidies. Patterns of household time allocation can also inform labor policies at the macroeconomic level (see e.g., Aguiar and Hurst Forthcoming, Handbook of Macroeconomics, Vol. 2). This paper contributes to the above literature by first highlighting that parental time spent with children is not spread uniformly throughout the week and time of day. In particular, I distinguish between time spent during and outside of typical work hours (TWH), where TWH are defined as 8am to 6pm, Monday through Friday.Footnote 1 With this distinction, child care actually decreases with income during TWH—especially for mothers. Outside of TWH, child care tends to increase with income—especially for fathers. Using these facts, I proceed to analyze a simple model to see what kinds of properties of the utility and child quality production functions can rationalize the observed patterns. I show that differing opportunity costs between mothers and fathers can indeed explain parental time spent with children during TWH. The same applies across income groups. The patterns found outside of TWH require that particular preference and/or child quality production parameters differ systematically by income. In the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Development Study (PSID-CDS) 1997 time diaries, a subsample of PSID households with children under the age of twelve were asked to keep time diaries for one weekday and one weekend day. Following Folbre et al. (2005), Folbre (2008), Boca et al. (2014) and Abbott (2015), I compute active and passive child care from the PSID-CDS 1997 time diaries using a similar strategy with a few adjustments. The most important adjustment is introducing a distinction between child care during and outside of TWH. As this paper shows, this distinction is crucial in determining the opportunity cost of spending time with children. In particular, I demonstrate that both mothers and fathers spend more time with children outside of TWH, than they do during TWH. These times are distinguished by the form of opportunity cost. Outside of TWH, the opportunity cost is leisure or housework; during TWH, it is first and foremost foregone earnings. Moreover, I find that—presumably for similar reasons—some groups of the population catch up to other groups outside of TWH. For example, while fathers spend half as much time in child care than mothers do overall, they spend one-third as much time during TWH. Fathers, therefore, catch up to mothers outside of TWH, albeit in relative rather than absolute terms (i.e., mothers still spend more time with children than do fathers). By income quintile, I show that when restricting attention to TWH, child care actually decreases with income, especially for mothers. It tends to increase with income for fathers outside of TWH. These findings refine those of Guryan et al. (2008) and suggest that child care actually does behave like leisure or other household chores at certain times of the week and day. In sum, then, high income parents catch up to low income parents outside of TWH: mothers in relative terms and fathers in absolute terms. Taken together, paternal relative to maternal time outside of TWH monotonically increases with income, while it is almost flat during TWH. The above facts are generally more pronounced for active care. I therefore concentrate on this measure in analyzing theoretical implications.Footnote 2
 From a Beckerian point of view, these facts can inform us about the properties of the utility and child quality production functions needed to rationalize these choices. Consider a model where households derive utility from consumption, leisure and child quality. Child quality is produced using expenditures and parental time during and outside of TWH. To start, I assume that the only source of heterogeneity lies in labor market productivity and, hence, wages. I first assume logarithmic utility combined with a Cobb-Douglas production function for child quality. This specification is close to a static version of the model used in Boca et al. (2014), extended to differentiate between child care during and outside of TWH. Here, I show that level differences for mothers and fathers can easily be rationalized. Yet, this specification cannot replicate the observed patters of parental child care during and outside of TWH by income quintile, unless various preferences and technology parameters differ systematically by income. In order for child care during TWH to decrease with income without adding systematic heterogeneity by quintile, utility needs to be such that the substitution effect of a higher wage dominates the income effect. This does not apply outside of TWH. Indeed, this model predicts that maternal and paternal child care outside of TWH must move in the same direction with income (even with a nested CES quality production function as in, Abbott 2015). Hence, this specification still requires preference and/or technology parameters to systematically vary with income.Footnote 3
 In sum, the specifications frequently used in the literature are at odds with those needed to rationalize the static time allocation decision during and outside of TWH by household income as analyzed in this paper. That being said, further exploration of child care patterns during and outside of TWH is needed to inform us about the dimensions in which this widely used framework should be extended. Ultimately, future research needs to develop a unified theory that simultaneously explains the static and the dynamic dimensions of time allocation and child quality production across income groups. Implications for various family policies hinge on this understanding. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the child care measures and data results, reporting maternal and paternal child care hours per child per week during and outside of TWH. It also contains information on active and passive care by household income quintile. Section 4 discusses implications for theory and Sect. 5 concludes.",17

According to the most recent PISA data (OECD 2016a) several advanced countries such as US, UK, and Italy are lagging behind and do not show any sign of improvement in terms of scholastic performance. This has been increasingly being attributed to delayed and inadequate investment—both public and private—in human capital (e.g. Carneiro and Heckman 2003). In most countries, attending pre-primary education is positively associated with better performance at age 15 (OECD 2016b). Cost-benefit analysis of human capital investments targeted towards different age groups indicates that investing in the earliest years yields the best outcomes. Later investments carry higher costs for remediating gaps in scholastic achievement and reducing detrimental behaviour. Not only are investments made during the preschool period less costly, they are also more effective. This is because the individual abilities of young children are more malleable, and early investments have a cumulative effect over time, unlike those made later in life (Carneiro and Heckman 2003; Cunha and Heckman 2007). Early childcare plays an important role in the production of cognitive skills. What determines cognitive ability and behavioural development early in life is of crucial policy importance. While early psychological theories stressed the need for maternal care, more recent studies from the fields of psychology, sociology, and economics show that other childcare arrangements do not necessarily produce negative outcomes. Whereas a substantial body of research has analysed the impact of parental and formal childcare, the influence of other family members such as grandparents has received little attention. However, data available from several countries indicate that grandparents do play an important role in childcare and show that quite a large proportion of grandparents provide some kind of care for grandchildren, even on a regular basis (Hank and Buber 2009; Aassve et al. 2012). For the UK, Gray (2005) estimates that about 30% of families with children under 5 receive some childcare support from grandparents. The objective of this paper is to explore the impact of grandparental and formal childcare on child cognitive outcomes, controlling for other forms of childcare. These are the two most important alternatives to parental care and represent two very different childcare choices. We utilize the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) for the UK, which provides very detailed information about children, parents, grandparents, childcare choices, as well as several child outcomes. We find that the effect of grandparental care is always in the same direction of parental care, and that children looked after by their grandparents are better at naming objects but worse at non-verbal reasoning and at developing basic concepts compared to children looked after in formal childcare centres. The magnitude of the effects is similar to what has been found in other papers. However, the results are highly heterogeneous according to the socio-economic status of the family: the positive association of grandparents’ care with naming abilities is stronger for households with higher incomes, while the negative association with other abilities is stronger for households with lower incomes. In addition, there is a negative association of grandparents’ care with problem-solving ability only among children from lower income families.",18
16.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,31 October 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9352-y,The labor supply of military wives in the US,June 2018,Breann Whitby,Janice Compton,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The labor market outcomes of military wives is an important issue for many groups within society, including both military personnel and administration, and policy makers. The military lifestyle is demanding for both military personnel and their families. Frequent migrations and deployments, as well as the threat to both physical and mental health that military service involves all represent challenges that military families face (Karney and Crown 2007; Hoge et al. 2006).Footnote 1 Given these challenges, as well as the high value we place on the military in society, the well being of military families, and for the purposes of our analysis, military spouses, should be of high importance. With migration that is both frequent and location-determined, the military lifestyle has unique and significant implications for the labor market outcomes of military spouses. The labor force participation (LFP) of military spouses holds further interest for labor economists. Comparing the relationship between migration and labor supply of military spouses and non-military population allows us to isolate the correlations between migration and labor supply when location is not a choice variable. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we use data from the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey (ACS) to document and analyze the deteriorating labor force trends for military wives between 1990 and 2010. We focus on the labor force participation and employment of military wives (civilian women married to husbands in the military) rather than military spouses in general, since the sample size of military husbands is small.Footnote 2 Differences in the labor force participation of military and non-military wives may be due to personal characteristics and aggregate economic forces, frequent migration to exogenously chosen locations, and/or other aspects of military wife status. Focussing on the latest data available, we address each of these contributing factors, and determine how they interact with labor force participation. Our results show a general deterioration in the labor force outcomes of military wives, relative to non-military wives. Between 1990 and 2010, the relative wages of military wives to non-military wives fell from 67 to 58 %. Moreover, despite a slight increase in the labor force participation rate of prime aged women in the U.S. over this time period, the labor force participation rate of military wives fell steadily from 63 to 57 %. The lower labor force attachment of military spouses is consistent with results from other, previous studies. For example, while analyzing survey data to compare the demographic characteristics and labour market outcomes and activity of non-military and military wives, Payne et al. (1992) find labor force participation rates of 70.1 and 49 % for non-military wives and military wives, respectively, and also found that hours of work are much lower for military wives than for non-military wives. Payne et al. (1992) also find that military wives have more education, are younger, and are more likely to have children than non-military wives. Cooke and Speirs (2005) find that, for military wives, migration led to a 9 % decrease in the labor force participation of military wives, largely due to decreased employment, and a decline in hours worked. Hosek and MacDermid Wadsworth (2013) find that both civilian husbands and wives of military personnel are more likely to be unemployed than similar married individuals whose spouse is not in the military. Schwartz et al. (1991), find that labor force participation rates are higher for military spouses that are black, have higher levels of education, and who have children between the ages of 12 and 17 years old compared to military spouses that do not have these characteristics. Schwartz et al. (1991) also find that the closer the military family is to population centres, the higher the labour force participation of military spouses. Hosek et al. (2002) find that when they compared movers and non-movers among military families and non-military families, earnings and weeks worked were lower among families who moved and the difference is larger among military families. Specifically, they found that migration was associated with an average decrease in annual earnings of $3905 for military wives and a slightly lesser decrease of $3690 in annual earnings among non-military wives. Little and Hisnanick (2007) find that military wives earn 52 % less than non-military wives. Our analysis updates the previous research with recent data. Our empirical results indicate a strong negative correlation between military wife status and LFP, even after controlling for demographics, migration, and location variables. The results are large: military wives are about half as likely to be in the labor force compared to non-military wives. Since the migration controls are capturing recent migration, the coefficient on military wife captures the correlation between LFP and both the accumulated past migrations and the anticipation of future migrations. Further, we show that that the relationship between military wife status and LFP is greater for those with higher education. With the knowledge that migration may be frequent, military wives may be more likely to choose a career and accept jobs that are transferable across labor markets. Careers that require higher levels of education are often less mobile. For example, frequently changing employers would be less costly to a woman working in retail sales than for a woman working as a lawyer. Our second objective of the paper is to highlight differences in the correlation between migration and labor force participation for military and non-military wives. Overall, we expect that the coefficients on migration that is less frequent, and for which the destination is chosen by the household, will be smaller than the coefficients on migration that is frequent and to exogenously determined locations. Military wives are not only tied spouses, as defined by Mincer (1978 p. 753) as “those [in the family] whose gains from migration are (in absolute value) dominated by gains (or loses) of the spouse”, but tied spouses with exogenous location.Footnote 3 Military wives are affected not only by the most recent migration, but also by the accumulated effect of previous and anticipated frequent migrations. For this reason, military spouses are likely to encounter further difficulties in seeking and maintaining employment. These difficulties arise due to both issues of both labor demand and supply. On the demand side, Rosenfeld (1978) suggests that since frequent migration may result in temporary employment for military spouses, employers may be reluctant to hire a military spouse as they are unlikely to fully realize the benefits of hiring these individuals. On the supply side, military spouses may experience lower incentive for both acquiring skills and searching for an appropriate job due to the frequent migration that they often experience (Payne et al. 1992). The correlation between migration and the labor supply military wives is likely, therefore, to provide an upper bound on the general effect of migration on tied spouses. Harrell et al. (2004) combine information from the 1990 Census data with a qualitative study of military spouses residing on military bases. Again, the lower labor force participation among military spouses is found, with key drivers being metropolitan status, migration and presence of children. Finally, in a comprehensive study of military spouses, Lim and Schulker (2010) analyse survey data from 2006 and show similar patterns of low labor force participation. Our analysis updates and expands the previous research by incorporating recent data, comparing the results with data from previous decades, and focussing on the connections between migration and labor force status. Contrary to expectations, our results show that recent migration is not strongly related to LFP of military wives. However, to the extent that the coefficient on military wife status is picking up the relationship between LFP and frequent and anticipated migration, this correlation is larger. Moreover, we show that while the negative correlation between presence of children and labor force participation is stronger for migrating military wives compared to migrating non-military wives, the interaction between education and labor force participation is similar for both types of wives. The paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 we discuss the issue of selection and endogeneity. In section 3 we provide information on the data and descriptive statistics spanning 1990–2010. In section 4 we present the results from logit regressions that estimate the relationship between labor force participation and demographic variables, migration, and military wife status. We show that there is a strong negative relationship between military wife status and labour force participation that remains after controls are included in the regression. In section 5 we focus on the relationship between migration and LFP for both military and non-military wives. Section 6 concludes.",

An empirical analysis using propensity score,June 2018,Amadeo Fuenmayor,Rafael Granell,Mauro Mediavilla,Male,Male,Male,Male,"There is a wide research analyzing the effect of taxes on agents’ behavior,Footnote 1 and indeed an important part of this literature examines how fiscal reforms have impacted upon married women’s participation in the labor force. Within the USA, Leuthold (1979) studies the effect on labor supply for two-earner families taxed jointly. Eissa (1995), Eissa and Hoynes (2005), Eissa et al. (2008) and Hotchkiss et al. (2012) analyze the consequences of different US fiscal reforms. Fan (1988) describes the effect of changing tax rates on labor force participation of women in Taiwan. Tsounta (2006) relates the supply of women in the workforce with the Canadian fiscal system. Yamada (2011) examines married women’s labor responses when facing changes in tax rates, as a result of Japanese tax reform during the 1990s. Bosch and van der Klaauw (2012) study the effect of Dutch tax reform on female labor force participation and on working hours. Callan et al. (2009) analyze the labor supply effects of changes in the structure of taxation in Ireland. Hannapi and Müllbacher (2013) analyze the consequences of the Austrian policy reform in 2009, and introduce some proposal to improve it. Very recently, Kabátek et al. (2014) examined how both partners changed their labor supply and housework due to a switch in French income tax towards separate taxation. There is a growing literature using tax reforms as quasi-experiments, focusing on the labor supply responses of married women to income tax reforms. Gustafsson (1992) is a precedent, analyzing the change in labor force participation of Swedish women (individually taxed) if they had worked in Germany (and were taxed jointly), and vice versa. Nevertheless, the seminal work was undoubtedly, the study of Eissa (1995) in the USA. In this work, Eissa analyzes the effects of the 1986 Tax Reform Act on the supply of labor of married women. To show the causal effect, changes in labor supply of women married with high-income husbands are compared to changes in labor supply of women married to low-income husbands. The main result of this work is that tax reform significantly increased the labor supply of women married to high-income husbands, which was the group most affected by the tax reform. This causal effect allows the author to evaluate for a particular segment of the population the incentives in the decision to offer hours of work. Moreover, Crossley and Jeon (2007) analyze the effects of the 1988 federal income tax reform in Canada. This reform reduced the ‘jointness’ of the tax system. Using the difference-in-differences approach, they produced evidence that this reform involved a significant increase in labor force participation of women married to high-income husbands (those actually affected by the reform), with respect to women married to lower income husbands. Furthermore, Lalumia (2008) analyzes the US tax reform of 1948, which introduced compulsory joint taxation. As this reform only affected a number of states, she then carried out a natural experiment comparing affected and unaffected states. For highly educated tax payers the tax change (from separate to joint tax filing) implied a decline of 2 percentage points in the employment rate for married women. So, her results were very much along the same lines as Eissa and Crossley and Jeon. Finally, Selin (2014) studies the 1971 Swedish tax reform, which abolished joint taxation. His results show that employment grew more among women married to high-income earners, supporting previous studies. Unlike Eissa, Crossley and Jeon, and Lalumia, all of whom use repeated cross section data, Selin exploits a rich longitudinal register data. As far as we know, there is no such work done for Spain. The most relevant Spanish literature estimates the elasticity of taxable income with respect to net-of-tax rates, following a well-known work by Feldstein (1995). These papers measure how taxable income changes in response to changes in marginal tax rates. But they do not explicitly analyze changes in labor behavior. Badenes (2001) studies the consequences of 1988 income tax reform. She compares the 1988 situation with the years after the reform (1989–1992). She does so separately for primary and secondary earners, and for different income brackets. She obtains a wide range of elasticities (1.5–2.5). Díaz Mendoza (2004) and Sanmartín Sola (2007) present similar studies of the elasticity of taxable income as a result of changes in marginal tax rates. They do not distinguish between primary and secondary earner, and produce very different elasticities: 0.35 in Diaz’s case, and 0.1 in Sanmartin’s paper. Onrubia Fernández and Sanz Sanz (2009) also calculate the elasticity of taxable income with respect to net-of-tax rates, looking for the effects of inflation on income tax in 1993 and 1994. They obtain different elasticities for primary and secondary earners, and also for different income brackets. The purpose of our work is different from the Spanish research papers. We use the 1988 Spanish income tax reform as a quasi-natural experiment, analyzing its effect on the labor force participation of secondary earners. To do so, we have worked with longitudinal register data. Our main contribution is to explicitly establish a procedure for selecting the treatment group and the comparison group in order to find out the possible differential labor behavior between these groups. For this purpose, we use the difference-in-differences approach. Our results support the main conclusions stated by previous literature: the groups more heavily affected by the tax reform will react more strongly in their labor force participation. In the Spanish case, secondary earners experiencing a strong reduction in tax rates increased their participation rates (9.4 percentage points) more intensely than people less affected by the tax cut (7.8 percentage points). As a result, we can attribute a 1.6-percentage-point-increase in participation rates to the 1988 income tax reform. The 1988 Spanish income tax reform changed the compulsory joint filing to a system where married couples could choose between joint and separate taxation. To make this election feasible, a number of changes were introduced. Generally speaking, tax rates were strongly reduced for married couples, but the reform produced a difficult pattern of these changes. Contrary to tax reforms in other countries, tax rates underwent a greater reduction for secondary earners in low-income families. As a result of these differences in tax reductions, we obtain different labor behaviors. Labor participation grows more for secondary earners in low-income families. Our paper is organized as follows. The following section outlines the 1988 Spanish income tax reform, and its complex effects on family taxation. In Sections 3 and 4, we describe the data and the methodology applied. In Section 5, we define the treatment and the comparison group. In Section 6, we present the main results. Finally, in Section 7, we present the conclusion.",

Miller,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over the past few decades a literature has developed on the determinants and labor market consequences of the destination language proficiency of immigrants in developed economies. Very little is known, however, of the labor market consequences, if any, of the language skills of the native born who are bilingual, that is, individuals who are proficient in the language of their country of birth, where they currently live, and yet have some degree of proficiency in another language.Footnote 1
 This study focuses on these “native-born bilinguals”. Although the topic is of broader interest, the application in this study is to the adult male population born in and living in the United States. In particular, the interest is on the extent to which limited English proficiency and proficiency in another language affects their earnings. The section ‘The model and the data’ develops a methodology to explore these issues and discusses the data used in the empirical estimates, namely the American Community Survey for 2005–2009. ‘Descriptive statistics’ starts with descriptive statistics on the native-born Americans who speak a language other than English at home and on their English-language proficiency. ‘Multivariate analysis’ presents the results of the multivariate analysis (ordinary least squares and quantile regressions) of the effects on earnings of speaking another language and English-language proficiency among adult male native-born Americans.

Central to this process is ensuring equal opportunities to participate in the labor market work and earn a fair wage. Despite some progress, in most countries men still outnumber women in the labor market. In addition, advancements in gender equality spread unevenly around the world and therefore gender disparities in labor force participation (LFP) vary greatly. Sweden ranks as one of the world’s most gender-equal countries (Hausmann et al. various years) and is at the same time a recipient of immigrants from countries with more traditional views of gender roles and gender equality. In Sweden the LFP rate of women in 2016 is about eight percentage points below that of men, while in countries such as Afghanistan and Syria the difference is around 60 percentage points (International Labor Organization). Furthermore, the participation rate of immigrant women in Sweden is about 10 to 15 percentage points below that of native women, and only about half of the low-educated immigrant women participate in labor market work (Statistics Sweden 2016). This brings to the fore the question of whether the LFP of immigrant women in Sweden continues to be shaped by more traditional gender roles and a less equal division of labor in their source countries, or if their LFP comes to resemble that of native Swedish women with the passage of time since migration. There is a large literature on labor market assimilation of immigrants in the host country (e.g., Borjas 1995 for the United States; Edin et al. 2000 and Hammarstedt 2003 for Sweden).Footnote 1 This literature shows that new immigrants tend to be at a labor market disadvantage, but this disadvantage decreases with time in the host country. To date, researchers have not fully explored the gender disparities and the impact of source country factors in the assimilation process. In this paper, I investigate the extent to which a traditional culture—one with a more traditional view of gender roles—in the source country is important for immigrant women’s labor market assimilation to that of comparable native women in Sweden. The economic literature defines culture as the totality of differences in beliefs and preferences across groups with different cultural backgrounds (Fernández 2007). I follow previous literature and measure source country cultural beliefs regarding the appropriate role of women by the source country female relative LFP (FLFP). The FLFP is the female LFP rate divided by the male LFP rate (e.g., Antecol 2000; Blau et al. 2011; Blau 2015; Blau and Kahn 2015). This measure captures the source country’s culture on gender roles, and affects immigrant women’s LFP in the host country through the preferences and/or learned beliefs regarding women’s labor supply behavior and the household division of labor in her source country (see e.g., Fernández 2007, 2008, 2011). I will answer the following research questions. Are immigrant women from countries with high FLFP rates engaged in labor market work to a higher degree than immigrant women from countries with low FLFP rates? Is the difference between immigrant women from high- and low-participation countries constant, increasing, or decreasing as length of residence in Sweden increases? Does immigrant women’s participation in the labor force reach that of native women with passage of time since migration? Blau et al. (2011) argue that if differences in labor market participation between immigrant women from countries with high and low FLFP persist with time in the host country, this indicates that culture has an important effect on gender roles. Should all immigrant women, independently of FLFP, assimilate to the participation rates of comparable natives, this indicates that the host country’s culture, institutions, and economic environment might be more important than those of the source country’s culture. In other words, immigrant women’s labor market assimilation could be driven both by adjustments to a new institutional environment and/or by changes in their culture on gender roles to be more in line with that of natives. Separating these mechanisms is outside the scope of this paper. For the United States, research has shown that immigrant women from countries with low FLFP rates work less than do immigrant women from countries with high FLFP, but that both groups assimilate towards the work hours of comparable native women (Blau et al. 2011; Blau 2015; Blau and Kahn 2015). If and how these results translate to other countries is still unknown. Compared to the United States, Sweden offers more and farther-reaching gender-specific institutions, such as parental leave and child-care facilities, and a larger percentage of women participates in labor market work (e.g., Anxo et al. 2011; Blau and Kahn 1996; Rønsen and Sundström 2002; Ruhm 1998). Hence, I investigate whether source country culture on gender roles is transmitted and explains immigrant women’s labor market participation in a society that emphasizes gender equality and women’s participation in labor market work more than the United States. To study the association between FLFP and immigrant women’s labor market participation, I use Swedish longitudinal register data covering the full Swedish population from 1990 to 2007, together with source country data collected around the time of migration. Apart from extending the literature to the Swedish case, the longitudinal data allows us to make additional contributions. In the previous literature on culture and immigrant’s outcomes, the main challenge has been to separate the effect of source country culture from that of other source country variables (e.g., women’s education and skills) and selection in migration. I use a model with individual-fixed effects, implying that the bias of the assimilation estimates from time-constant individual and source country factors and return and onwards migration is reduced. In previous literature it has been hard to rule out that the rate of assimilation is connected not only to culture, but also to the likelihood of return migration. Moreover, I will follow previous literature and examine the behavior of immigrant men, which can serve as a falsification test (Blau 2015). If the source country FLFP has the same impact on immigrant men and women’s participation rates, this indicates that the source country’s FLFP captures other omitted source country variables. Our results show that immigrant women arriving in Sweden in the 1980s and 1990s have lower LFP rates than comparable native women at arrival, and that this disparity reduces with time spent in Sweden. Furthermore, immigrant women from countries with high FLFP rates have between 3 and 17 percentage points higher participation rates than do women from countries with low FLFP. These results point in the direction that the source country culture on gender roles is important for immigrant women’s labor market behavior in their new host country. However, the results seem to be driven partly by differences in individual characteristics and return migration between immigrants from low- and high-participation countries. Still, among immigrant women arriving to Sweden in the 1990s, those from high-participation countries work more than women that migrated from low-participation countries. However, neither women from high-participation countries nor those from low-participation countries assimilate to the participation level of native women. Furthermore, source country female relative participation is not strongly correlated with immigrant men’s labor market participation in Sweden. This supports the idea that the source country LFP captures source country culture on gender roles rather than other omitted factors, such as work behavior, that affect men and women similarly. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. “Literature review” section offers an overview of the literature. “Data and descriptive statistics” section presents the data and descriptive statistics. “Empirical specification” section presents the empirical model and “Results” section explains the results. Finally, “Conclusions” section concludes.",12

Sabia,Joseph P. Price,Reginald Covington,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Widespread concern about the negative social, economic and health impacts of teenage childbearing has generated a number of research efforts to improve our understanding of the nature and extent of these consequences.Footnote 1 While policymakers often note that teenage childbearing is negatively related to educational attainment and earnings and positively related to poverty and welfare dependence, much less is known about the relationship between teenage childbearing and civic engagement, an important form of social capital development. Civic engagement activities such as charitable giving, volunteerism, and political involvement may produce important positive externalities. Charitable contributions in the U.S. reached an estimated $358 billion in 2014 (Giving USA 2015) with the largest share of donations made to religious (32%), educational (15.0%), or human service (12%) organizations (Giving USA 2015).Footnote 2
,
Footnote 3 In addition, 69.8 million adults in the United States volunteered with an organization, contributing a total of 8 billion hours of time (National Center for Charitable Statistics 2015), valued at over $180 billion (Corporation for National and Community Service 2015). Finally, while the share of U.S. adults who vote is low relative to other OECD countries (Pew Research 2016), political participation has been linked to greater social cohesion and civility (United Nations 2012), each important to a well-functioning democracy (Somin 2010).Footnote 4
 There are several pathways by which teen childbearing could affect civic engagement. Because childcare is a time-intensive activity, hours available for some forms of engagement such as volunteerism and investments in may be reduced (Arpino and Bordone 2017). Moreover, if education increases a sense of social responsibility (Wiepking 2009) or political awareness (Nie et al. 1996), and teenage childbearing reduces educational attainment (see, for example, Hoffman et al. 1993; Bennett et al. 1995; Levine and Painter 2003; Klepinger et al. 1995, 1999; Hoffman 1998; Fletcher and Wolfe 2009; Covington et al. 2011), then teenage childbearing may diminish civic engagement. Finally, if teenage childbearing reduces earnings, then it may reduce forms of civic engagement that are normal goods, such as charitable giving (Do and Paley 2012; Auten et al. 2002) and political engagement (Levin-Waldman 2012).Footnote 5
 On the other hand, early parenthood may transform the lives of some young individuals, leading them to adopt more mature adult civic-minded roles than their non-teen parent counterparts (Herbst and Ifcher 2016).Footnote 6 In addition, participation in some forms of civic engagement such as religious, community, and school-based organizations can be considered inputs in child production. Thus, involvement in such activities for individuals in their 20 s may be greater for those who were teen parents compared to those who are not parents. Finally, the financial hardships of early childbearing may affect teen mothers’ taste for redistribution, leading to greater political engagement.Footnote 7
 In addition to the causal pathways through which teenage childbearing could affect civic engagement, difficult-to-measure characteristics at the individual- and family-levels could also drive a non-causal association. For example, teenage mothers may discount the future more than non-mothers or have parents who make fewer investments in their children (Hotz et al. 2005). Only two studies of which we are aware examine the relationship between teenage childbearing and voting. Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey, Pacheco and Plutzer (2007, 2008) find that, after controlling for a parsimonious set of background variables, early childbearing is negatively related to voting participation. These authors conclude that diminished educational attainment may be an important mechanism at work. However, these authors do not examine the effects of teen parenthood on charitable giving and volunteerism nor do they employ fixed effects or instrumental variables models designed to disentangle the causal impact of early parenthood from associations that may be explained by selection on unobservables.Footnote 8
 Using data drawn from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97) and a variety of econometric strategies designed to disentangle the causal effect of teenage childbearing from unmeasured heterogeneity, we examine the relationship between teen parenthood and the probability of participating in four forms of civic engagement: giving to charitable causes, volunteerism, acquiring knowledge of political affairs, and voting. Ordinary least squares estimates (OLS) and propensity score matching (PSM) estimates show consistent evidence that teenage childbearing is associated with a reduction in the probability of charitable giving, volunteerism, political awareness, and voting among young women. After controlling for unobserved family background characteristics common to siblings via family fixed effects, the estimated relationship between teen childbearing and adult civic engagement is generally smaller in absolute magnitude, but the precision of estimates do not allow us to rule out substantially sized adverse civic engagement consequences. When we exploit a natural experiment in pregnancy outcomes by using teen miscarriages to instrument for teen births (Hotz et al. 2005), we continue to find evidence of adverse adult civic engagement consequences of teen motherhood, with the largest effects on volunteerism. We find that teenage childbearing is associated with an 11.7 to12.6 percentage-point reduction in the probability of adult volunteerism. Diminished educational attainment and time available for civic engagement appear to be the primary mechanisms through which teen motherhood diminishes civic engagement. Finally, an exploration of the consequences of teen fatherhood on social capital development of fathers suggests that adverse civic engagement effects may extend to males, but the effect is much smaller in magnitude.",

Ali,Shiferaw Gurmu,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Standard economic theory suggests that enhancing women’s employment opportunities is the most important mechanism through which female education reduces fertility (Becker 1960, 1993; Becker and Lewis 1973; Willis 1973). In particular, highly educated women are more likely to have high-paying jobs, which increases the opportunity cost of childbearing and, therefore, decreases fertility. This mechanism, however, does not appear to hold in the case of Arab countries, where the majority of women do not participate in the labor market despite the remarkable increase in female education over time. In fact, during the 1980s and the 1990s, fertility rate in Arab countries declined by more than two births per woman. Concurrently, female education in these countries has increased by more than threefold (Eltigani 2005). The increase in female education, however, hardly affected women’s labor-force participation. Eltigani (2005) documents that labor force participation of women in the Arab countries is among the lowest in the world, and that the rate of their participation during the 1980s and 1990s changed very little, or may have even declined. This pattern also seems to exist in other non-Arab countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region such as Turkey (World Bank 2009).Footnote 1 A recent report by the World Bank (2013) has found that female labor force participation in the entire MENA region is only 25%—about half of the world average-despite the substantial increase in female education in this region. The low rates of women’s labor force participation in the Arab countries, and in the MENA region in general, raises some doubts on whether the large reduction in fertility rates that these countries witnessed over the last few decades was actually driven by improving female education. Put differently, both female education and fertility might be driven by other factors such as community background and women inherent ability. For example, many communities within the Arab countries, especially in rural areas, place a small value on female education and, at the same time, encourage big family sizes.Footnote 2 In this cultural context, a negative correlation between female education and fertility can be observed even if female education per se does not have a causal impact on fertility. Furthermore, even if the reduction in fertility rates was caused by the increase in female education, understanding the mechanisms through which female education reduces fertility, in spite of the low rates of women’s labor force participation, has important implications for both economic theory and government policies targeted at reducing fertility rates. Although a substantial effort has been devoted by governments and international organizations to increase female education and promote women’s empowerment in the Arab world (United Nations 2005), little is known about the mechanisms through which women’s education reduces fertility given the unique culture and traditions of these countries. Understanding these intermediate mechanisms may provide great insights into the extent to which labor market opportunities play a role in household fertility decisions in the Arab countries. This paper attempts to address these issues. In this paper, we use a natural experiment from Egypt to study the causal impact of female education on fertility and explore the mechanisms underlying this relationship. The majority of studies that examined the relationship between female education and fertility in developing countries did not adequately account for the endogeneity of female education, and hence, their results can be better regarded as correlations rather than casual relationships (Al-Qudsi 1998; Bhargava 2007; Cochrane et al. 1990; Handa 2000; Khawaja and Randall 2006; Lam and Duryea 1999; Martίn and Juάrez 1995). A recent and growing number of studies in developing countries have used sources of exogenous variations in female education to account for the endogeneity of education (Baird et al. 2010; Breierova and Duflo 2004; Chicoine 2012; Dinçer et al. 2014; Duflo et al. 2015; Güneş 2016; Osili and Long 2008; Ozier 2015; Tequame and Tirivayi 2015). These studies, however, did not focus on the Arab region, and only a few of them analyzed the mechanisms through which female education reduces fertility. One exception is Lavy and Zablotsky (2015), who examined the causal impact of female education on fertility among Arab citizens of Israel. Lavy and Zablotsky used the exposure to the end of the military rule, which restricted the mobility of Arabs in Israel, as the source of exogenous variation in education. The authors found that each year of female education reduces the number of children born per woman by 0.6 children. Although this study provides important insights into the effect of female education on fertility in the Arab region, there are two main concerns with its findings. First, the Arab citizens of Israel may not be representative of the majority of population in Arab countries given the unique position of Arabs in Israel and the historical context within which their communities have developed, which might put some constraints on their choice sets and influence their incentives to have children. Second, as acknowledged by the authors, it is possible that reducing mobility restrictions imposed on Arabs in Israel might have improved outcomes other than women’s education that directly affected fertility. In particular, not only did the removal of travel restriction create access to schooling, but it also enabled access to better employment opportunities, health knowledge, and modern lifestyles. These factors are expected to have direct impacts on fertility in absence of female education. Our paper uses the change in the length of primary schooling in Egypt in 1988–89 to examine the causal impact of female education on fertility in Arab countries and explore the mechanisms through which education affects fertility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use this natural experiment to create an exogenous variation in education in Egypt. Beginning in 1988, the Egyptian government cut the length of primary education from 6 to 5 years, moving from a 12-year system of pre-university education to an 11-year system (law No.233 of 1988).Footnote 3 The 5-year primary system was universal throughout the country, affecting all individuals born on or after October 1, 1977. Therefore, October 1, 1977, represents a cutoff such that individuals born before that date had to attend one more year of schooling than individuals born on or after that date. Assuming that women born immediately after and just before October 1, 1977, are similar in baseline characteristics, the differences in their completed years of schooling in adulthood are exogenous. In fact, even if some parents can plan when their children are born, they are less likely to have full control over the exact date of birth. Moreover, the reduction in the length of primary schooling occurred in 1988, and it applied immediately to children who were 11 years old at that time. Thus, it is unlikely that parents would have anticipated that such policy change would have happened 11 years in the future and changed their behaviors accordingly. Therefore, the policy change can be regarded as good as a random local experiment around the cutoff date, allowing us to compare fertility of women born right before and just after October 1, 1977, and relate the difference in their fertility outcomes to the difference in their education. Our identification strategy is in line with several recent studies in developed countries that use educational policy changes to create exogenous variations in education and explore its impact on fertility (Amin and Behrman 2014; Black et al. 2008; Currie and Moretti 2003; Cygan-Rehm and Maeder 2013; Grönqvist and Hall 2013; Lindeboom et al. 2009; McCrary and Royer 2011; Monstad et al. 2008). We examine the effect of female education on three fertility outcomes: the number of children ever born per woman, ideal number of children, and age of women at first birth. We use a nonparametric regression discontinuity (RD) design to compare education and fertility of women around the cutoff date. We implement the RD regression using a fuzzy RD design to account for the possibility that women’s educational attainment in adulthood is not solely explained by the length of primary schooling. In fact, a large portion of women in our study continued their education beyond the primary education level in addition to a considerable portion of women who did not enter school or dropped out of school before completing their primary education.Footnote 4 Therefore, other factors, beyond the length of primary schooling, also determine women’s educational attainment in adulthood. The fuzzy RD design is more appropriate in this case as it allows for other factors, beyond the length of primary schooling, to influence female educational attainment in adulthood.Footnote 5 We estimate kernel-based local linear regression models for education and fertility. We also carry out a complementary analysis using local exponential mean regression models for count responses. The data for this study come from the recent seven waves of the Egyptian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) (1992, 1995, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2008, and 2014). The total sample size for the seven waves is 97,314 ever-married women of reproductive age. The EDHS survey is a nationally representative sample that provides rich information on fertility history and socioeconomic and demographics factors. Most importantly, for the purpose of our analysis, this survey provides information about the year and month of birth of each woman so that one can identify which woman attended which primary school system. Our analysis shows that women who were affected by the 6-year primary system had completed in adulthood, on average, 1 more year of schooling compared to women who were subject to the 5-year primary system. Using this variation in education, we find that each year of female education reduces the number of children ever born per woman by 0.079 children. That is, a woman with a high school diploma has about one less child than a woman with no formal education. We also analyzed the mechanisms through which female education reduces fertility. The analysis shows that the reduction in the number of children seems to result from postponing maternal age rather than changing women’s attitudes and preferences. In particular, each year of female education postpones maternal age by 2.63 to 3.45 months, with no significant impact on women’s ideal number of children. We also provide evidence that the delay of maternal age results from delaying marriage rather than increasing women’s labor force participation or affecting their usages of contraceptive methods. Our results are quite robust to several robustness checks and restrictions on the sample. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the existing literature on education and fertility and briefly discusses the change in the length of primary schooling in Egypt. Section 3 describes the EDHS data. Section 4 discusses the regression discontinuity design we use in this paper. In section 5, we present the results of this paper dividing them into baseline results ignoring the endogeneity and the main results of the RD analysis. Section 6 provides robustness checks. Section 7 examines the mechanisms through which female education affects fertility. Finally, section 8 provides the conclusion.",25

16.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,25 January 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9359-4,Is consumption efficiency within households falsifiable?,September 2018,Anyck Dauphin,Bernard Fortin,Guy Lacroix,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The analysis of consumption decisions in multi-person households dates back to the pioneering work of (Becker 1973, 1974, 1981), which introduced the insight that individuals consume, not households. He was the first to show how marriage markets influence individual consumption within a marriage. He also proposed the Rotten Kid theorem, where an altruistic dictator made all the decisions on behalf of the household members, to explain how multi-person households could end-up behaving in a unitary way. These seminal papers lead to a burgeoning literature on individual consumption in marriage. For example, Grossbard (1976); Grossbard-Shechtman (1984) considered each member of the household as separate decision-makers whose interactions did not necessarily lead to an equilibrium allocation. Others assumed spouses allocated resources through a cooperative or non-cooperative bargaining game (e.g., Manser and Brown (1980); Lundberg and Pollak (1993). More recently, the collective household model, which assumes that decision-makers achieve efficient outcomes, has become one of the main paradigms through which much of the research on consumption by multi-person households is conducted. One reason that explains its widespread use is that the model yields testable restrictions even though it rests upon a very small set of assumptions (Browning and Chiappori 1998; Chiappori and Ekeland 2006). One particular set of falsifiable restrictions proposed in the literature to test efficiency focuses on the effects of so-called distribution factors.Footnote 1 There are three different ways distribution factors can be used to test the efficiency hypothesis. First, the proportionality condition states that the ratio of the marginal effect of two distribution factors must be equal across demand equations (Bourguignon et al. 1993; Browning et al. 1994; Bourguignon et al. 2009). Second, the z-conditional demand condition requires the effects of the remaining distribution factors to vanish once the demand equations are conditioned on the demand for some other good and upon substituting out one of the distribution factors (Bourguignon et al. 2009). Finally, the rank condition posits that the impact of the distribution factors must be at most of size one (Chiappori and Ekeland 2006). The collective model is hardly ever rejected when using tests based on distribution factors, assuming given price levels. Some have thus been led to question the restrictive nature of the constraints imposed by the efficiency hypothesis. Others have raised concern over the statistical validity or power of the tests they imply. For instance, the proportionality condition implies a nonlinear restriction across equations which is generally tested by means of a Wald test (Bourguignon et al. 1993; Quisumbing and Maluccio 2003; Bobonis 2009). Yet, Wald tests are not invariant to algebraically equivalent nonlinear parameterization of the null hypothesis (Dagenais and Dufour 1991). Tests based on z-conditional demands are potentially more powerful because they boil down to testing single equation exclusion restrictions. Nevertheless, z-conditional demand equations include endogenous right-hand side variables and are typically estimated using an instrumental variables approach. The omitted distribution factors are natural instruments, but can prove to be weak. Finally, it is well-known that rank condition tests may suffer from poor statistical power in small samples (Camba-Mendeza and Kapetanios 2009). Irrespective of the above issues, under-rejection of the efficiency hypothesis may arise for a more practical matter. In their seminal theoretical contribution, Bourguignon et al. (2009) (henceforth BBC2009) assume that at least one distribution factor (locally) affects each demand equation.Footnote 2 This assumption is however hardly ever satisfied empirically. To the best of our knowledge, among all the papers using either the proportionality or the z-conditional demands restriction to test the collective model, only two (Chiappori et al. 2002; Attanasio and Lechene 2014) satisfy the BBC2009 assumption. Thus, the vast majority neglects it. Yet, the standard testing approach used in the literature to investigate the efficiency hypothesis based on these restrictions requires the latter assumption to hold. Such inconsistency between the statistical procedures and their underlying assumptions, we argue, is a plausible candidate to explain under-rejection of the collective model. However, the assumption of BBC2009 is perhaps too restrictive since distribution factors, by definition, need only affect two (or more) demand functions.Footnote 3 This is the starting point of our paper. We propose a falsifiable restriction of the efficiency hypothesis, which extends BBC2009’s approach insofar as it does not require a distribution factor to (locally) affect each demand equation. The basic intuition is that, even under collective rationality, it is possible that the demands for a subset of goods (e.g., heating, electricity, lodging) may not be affected by the relative bargaining power of the household members, at least locally. In the case of two-member households, expenditures on these goods will then be independent from all distribution factors. On the other hand, the demands for those goods that are influenced by the spouses’ bargaining power must depend on all distribution factors. This provides an alternative all or nothing testable restriction. We derive a set of testable conditions that takes this restriction into account and fully characterize collective rationality, absent price variations. In our approach, the proportionality condition, as well as the z-conditional demand condition, apply only to goods that depend on all the distribution factors. As with z-conditional demands, the new falsifiable restriction boils down to testing an exclusion restriction in each single equation. Because it rests upon unconditional demand functions, endogeneity of right-hand side variables is not an issue for testing this constraint. Furthermore, contrary to the proportionality or the z-conditional demands restrictions, it does not require any of the distribution factors to be continuous. This is a great advantage since the most convincing distribution factors are random policy treatments. Finally, we show how our approach can be extended to households comprising potentially more than two decision makers. To illustrate both our test procedure and how under-rejection of efficiency may arise, we use a field survey conducted by one of the co-authors of this paper to collect information on the decision process in very poor households from rural Burkina Faso. The social and customary environments in which these households evolve are likely to impede enforcement of efficient marriage contracts as these are deeply rooted in traditions that dictate expected behavior from both spouses. We investigate the efficiency of outcomes both in monogamous and bigamous households.Footnote 4
 The empirical analysis is based upon the widely used and flexible QUAIDS demand system. For both monogamous and bigamous households our data clearly reject the efficiency assumption using our test procedure. We also compute a test of Chiappori and Ekeland (2006)’s rank condition. This latter is asymptotically equivalent to our (simpler) test procedure. Concern with sample size leads us to bootstrap the rank condition test using a recent procedure proposed by Portier and Delyon (2014). Results from this test are consistent with our own test as it rejects efficiency for both monogamous and bigamous households. We next test the proportionality condition despite the fact that the assumption of BBC2009 is not satisfied in our data, as is customarily done in the literature. Our results show that collective rationality is then (falsely) not rejected for monogamous households. We also show that the z-conditional demands approach cannot be implemented to test the efficiency of our Bukinabé households by lack of strong instruments, a problem we suspect is more common than what is usually reported. Since the all or nothing restriction boils down to testing an exclusion restriction in each unconditional demand function, it is straightforward to review the empirical literature supporting collective rationality based on distribution factors.Footnote 5 Of the ten papers we reviewed, only four are consistent with collective rationality based on our test. Much of the evidence in favour of collective rationality is therefore open to criticism. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents our generalization of BBC2009’s collective model to households comprising respectively two and potentially more decision-makers. We discuss our new procedure to test the model in each of these cases. We also illustrate how the standard approach to test BBC2009’s model may yield misleading inference. Section 3 describes the socio-economic specificities of monogamous and polygamous households in Burkina Faso and discusses the choice of distribution factors. We also present the design of our survey and the main samples characteristics. Section 4 presents our estimation results and provides various tests of our generalized model for both monogamous and polygamous households. Section 5 concludes. Our theoretical approach is based on the collective model in the absence of price variation as in BBC2009. We generalize their approach in two directions. First, we relax one of their crucial assumptions, namely that at least one distribution factor (locally) influences all the demand functions. Second, given that part of our empirical analysis focuses on bigamous households, we allow households to comprise more than two adult members.Footnote 6
 Consider a household with I + 1 members. Each member i draws his/her well-being from the consumption of N market commodities, which we represent by the vector x. Each commodity may be consumed privately or publicly by household members. All prices are normalized to 1 so that the household budget corresponds to ι′x = m, where ι is a unit vector of dimension N and m is the level of exogenous household expenditures.Footnote 7
 Each member i has his own preferences U
i(x) over (private and public) goods consumed in the household. No restrictions are imposed on the nature of the preferences. They can be egotistic or altruistic and may involve externalities or other types of preference interactions.Footnote 8 We assume that U
i(x) is strongly concave, twice differentiable in x and increasing in each of its arguments. Under rationality, the outcomes of the household decision process are assumed to be Pareto-efficient. This means that the household chooses a vector x such that no other feasible vector could make all members at least as well off and at least one member strictly better off. The collective model also allows the possibility for exogenous variables, called distribution factors, to influence the household’s decisions. These variables are denoted by the vector z of dimension K. The influence of these factors can be understood within a bargaining framework where each member has an outside option. The poorer his/her outside options, the more he/she will be willing to compromise and thus the lower will be his/her bargaining power. As a result, the less the consumption decisions will correspond to his/her preferences. Outside options can vary across individuals and cultures. For example, members could behave non-cooperatively in case of minor disagreements (Lundberg and Pollak 1993; Chen and Woolley 2001) and eventually separate in case of major disagreements (Manser and Brown 1980; McElroy 1990). In the latter case, the state of the marriage market as proxied by the sex ratio (Chiappori et al. 2002), the nature of divorce laws (Gray 1998; Chiappori et al. 2002) and the relative contribution of the spouse to the household income (Browning and Chiappori 1998; Dauphin et al. 2011) have been considered as distribution factors in the literature. In the context of developing countries, Haddad and Kanbur (1992) stress the possibility for women to return to their native families in case of disagreement, and discrimination against women in the market place as potential distribution factors. The setting of collective rationality is equivalent to stating that there exists a vector μ(m, z) of I non-negative Pareto weights such that x is the solution to the following program: Thus the household pseudo-utility function to be maximized is a weighted sum of the individual utility functions. The Pareto weight associated with the preferences of member i (for i ≠ I + 1) can be interpreted as the importance attached to these, relative to those of the (I + 1)th member, in the household decision process. If the Pareto weight of a given member is equal to zero, the household does not take into account that member’s preferences in the decision process, other than via the possible caring preferences of the other members. The I Pareto weights can therefore be viewed as the distribution of decision power within the household and the number of decision-makers as the number of strictly positive Pareto weights plus one. The Pareto weights might be functions of distribution factors and of household expenditures, in which case they are assumed to be twice continuously differentiable in (m, z). It should be noted that some weights may be (locally) constant while others may respond to distribution factors. Furthermore, the non-constant weights may not all (locally) respond to the same distribution factors. When all the weights are constants, the household is said to behave rationally in a unitary way because the objective function can be interpreted as representing a unique utility function. When some of the weights are non-constants, the household is said to behave rationally in a collective way because the objective function cannot be interpreted as representing a unique set of preferences. The demand system obtained from solving the above program for x can be written as: \({\bf{x}} = {\hat {\bf x}}\left( {m,{\boldsymbol{\mu }}\left( {m,{\bf{z}}} \right)} \right)\), with \(\iota \prime {\hat {\rm x}}\left( {m,{\boldsymbol{\mu }}\left( {m,{\bf{z}}} \right)} \right) = m\) from the adding-up restriction. This shows that the distribution factors influence household consumption choices only through the non-constant Pareto weights. This follows from the fact that the distribution factors do not affect the Paretian frontier of the household consumption possibilities, but only the household’s location on it. Clearly, since the Pareto weights are unobservable so is the structural demand system. Yet, it is still possible to test whether the reduced form of the latter, x(m, z), satisfies: 
Proposition 2 of BBC2009 assumes that at least one distribution factor (locally) affects each demand function. Yet, distribution factors need not locally influence more than two of the latter to yield falsifiable restrictions. We thus start by relaxing this assumption and derive the appropriate test procedure. Next, we generalize the test to the case where a household comprises more than two potential decision-makers. Consider a partition \({\bf{x}} \equiv \left[ {{{\bf x \prime}}_J ,{\bf{x}}_{ - J \prime} } \right]\prime\) of the demand system and a partition \({\bf{z}} \equiv \left[ {{{\bf z \prime}}_J ,{\bf{z}}_{ - J \prime} } \right]\prime\) of the set of distribution factors, with x

J
 and z

J
 having the same dimension J. Given such a partition, (1) can be written as:Footnote 9
 If the sub-system of reduced-form demand functions in (2) has continuous first partial derivatives and is such that \({D_{{{\bf{z}}_J}}}{{\bf{x}}_J}\left( {{{\bf{z}}_J},{{\bf{z}}_{ - J}}} \right)\) is non-singular at a point P = (z

j
,z
−j
), then we can use the Implicit Function Theorem to invert x

j
 and z

j
 in some open neighborhood of P to get the following local inverse function: which has continuous first partial derivatives. Upon substituting the latter into (2) and (3) we get: The (local) sub-system of demands x

−J
 in (5) is written as a function of the sub-system of (local) demands x

J
 and of the distribution factors z

−J
.These are the so-called z-conditional demands proposed by BBC2009. The sub-system x

−J
 is said to be z

J
-conditional, since it is conditional on the inversion of z

J
. We further assume that μ(z) and \({\hat {\bf x}}\left( {{\boldsymbol{\mu }}\left( {\bf{z}} \right)} \right)\) are differentiable at the point P. The first generalization is as follows: 
A system of N ≥ 2 demand functions of a household with I + 1 = 2 members is locally compatible with rationality if, and only if, distribution factors, z, either do not influence the demand system (unitary rationality):
 
or influence it in the following way when K ≥ 2 (collective rationality):Footnote 10
 
Moreover, the demands for which
\({D_{\bf{z}}}{x_n}\left( {\bf{z}} \right) \ne \, \ne {\bf{0}},\)
denoted
\(x_m^*\left( {\bf{z}} \right)\)
also satisfy:
 
and, equivalently,
 
where 2 ≤ M ≤ N.
 The proof is available in a web Appendix.Footnote 11 The proposition states that the demand system of a two-person household is compatible with rationality if and only if it either complies with unitary rationality, (7a), or with collective rationality, (7b), (7c), and, equivalently to the latter, (7d). According to Restriction (7a), a demand system is compatible with unitary rationality if and only if none of its demand functions is influenced by distribution factors. Our new all or nothing Restriction (7b) stresses that a demand system that responds to at least two distribution factors is compatible with collective rationality if each of its demands either does not respond to any of the distribution factors or responds to all of the distribution factors. Equation (7c) further restricts the manner in which the distribution factors impact the demand functions that respond to all of the distribution factors (denoted \(x_m^{\rm{*}}\)): the ratio of the marginal effects of any two distribution factors must be equal across the latter. Finally, Restriction (7d) is equivalent to (7c). It states that the demand functions \(x_m^{\rm{*}}\) are compatible with collective rationality only if they no longer respond to the distribution factors once they are conditioned on any of them, i.e., are transformed into their z

1
-conditional form. Many empirical applications investigate the efficiency hypothesis using (7c). In most cases, the tests ignore Restriction (7b). Yet, the two go hand-in-hand. We will argue later on that focusing on (7c) while ignoring (7b) partly explains why the efficiency assumption is hardly ever rejected. The intuition behind Proposition 1 is the following. In a rational household composed of two members there is only one Pareto weight. The distribution factors, if they exist, can only exert their effect on consumption choices through this weight. If unitary rationality holds, then the Pareto weight is constant. Each of its demand, x

n
, must therefore satisfy (7a). On the other hand, if collective rationality holds and distribution factors do exist, then the single Pareto weight must respond to all of them. If a given demand function, x

n
, say, does not locally respond to the Pareto weight, it will respond to none of the distribution factors (D

z

x

n
(z) = 0). Conversely, if x

n
 does respond to the Pareto weight, it will be sensitive to all the distribution factors (D

z

x

n
(z)≠≠0. Each demand x

n
 stemming from a collectively rational household must therefore satisfy the all or nothing Restriction (7b). Furthermore, since distribution factors exert their effects through a single weight, the demand functions that respond to it, \(x_m^{\rm{*}}\), must be such that the ratio of the marginal effect of any two distribution factors is equal to the ratio of the marginal effect of the two distribution factors on the weight, and this ratio must be different from zero. Therefore, the ratio of the marginal effect of any two distribution factors is equal across \(x_m^{\rm{*}}\) demands as stated by (7c). Finally, conditioning a given demand function, \(x_m^{\rm{*}}\), by another, \(x_1^{\rm{*}}\) say, is equivalent to maintaining \(x_1^{\rm{*}}\) constant. In order to maintain \(x_1^{\rm{*}}\) constant, z

1
 must compensate for the variations in z
−1 in such a way that the variations in the weight cancel out. Restriction (7d) must thus hold for this z

1
-conditional demand. An important corollary to the all or nothing restriction is that a system in which some demands respond to a subset of distribution factors while other demands respond to another subset of distribution factors is not compatible with collective rationality when I + 1 = 2. The all or nothing restriction is absent from Proposition 2 of BBC2009 because it is assumed at the outset that one of the distribution factors (locally) affects all the demand functions. Since there is a single Pareto weight, this amounts to assuming that all the demand functions respond to the weight and therefore that they all respond to all the distribution factors affecting the weight. This is equivalent to assuming that all the demand functions satisfy (7b), and more precisely its second part, that is D

z

x

n
(z)≠≠0. Hence, in the BBC2009 framework our Proposition 1 boils down to Restriction (7c) and, equivalently to the latter, (7d). Contrary to the proportionality and the z-conditional demands restrictions, the all or nothing condition does not in fact require any of the distribution factors to be continuous. This is a great advantage since the most convincing distribution factors are random policy treatments. The all or nothing and the z-conditional demands restrictions boils down to testing an exclusion restriction in each single equation. This type of restriction is likely to be more powerful than the proportionality restriction since we can use single-equation estimation methods and since single-exclusion tests are more robust than tests of equality of parameters across equations. Furthermore, because the all or nothing restriction rests upon unconditional demand functions, endogeneity of right-hand side variables is not an issue for testing this constraint. It thus appears that restriction (7b) is likely to be more powerful to reject collective rationality than restrictions (7c) and (7d). Proposition 1 is valid for households in which it can legitimately be assumed that there are at most two decision-makers. Many household configurations (extended families, adult children, polygamous households, etc.), though, may potentially have more than two decision-makers.Footnote 12 It is relatively straightforward to extend Proposition 1 to multiple potential decision maker households.

and, equivalently,
 
where 2 ≤ M ≤ N−J. The proof is provided in a Web Appendix.Footnote 14 This proposition states that the demand system of an I + 1-person household is compatible with rationality if and only if it either complies with unitary rationality (8a) or with collective rationality (8b), (8c), and, equivalently to the latter, (8d). Restriction (8a) is identical to Restriction (7a). Restrictions (8b) and (8c) are equivalent to (7b) and (7c) but they involve z-conditional rather than unconditional demand functions. Restriction (8b) states that the demand system of an I + 1-person household influenced by at least I + 1 distribution factors is compatible with collective rationality if there is a non negative J ≤ I − 1 for which each demand contained in x

−J
, once conditioned on x

J
, either does not respond to any of the remaining distribution factors (z

−J
) or responds to a subset of them, denoted \({\bf{z}}_L^{\rm{*}}\).Footnote 15 This subset must be the same for all the z

J
-conditional demand functions. In other words, those z

J
-conditional demands that still respond to distribution factors must respond to the same subset of them. The latter may include all the remaining distribution factors or a subset of them. Hence, having some z

J
-conditional demand functions responding to some distribution factors and other z

J
-conditional demand functions responding to other distribution factors is incompatible with collective rationality. Restriction (8c) further states that the z

J
-conditional demand functions \(\left( {\bar x:m^{\rm{*}}\left( {{{\bf{x}}_J},{{\bf{z}}_{ - J}}} \right)} \right)\) responding to distribution factors \({\bf{z}}_L^{\rm{*}}\) are compatible with collective rationality only if the ratios of the marginal effect of any two distribution factors included in \({\bf{z}}_L^{\rm{*}}\) are equal across them. Finally, and equivalently to Restriction (8c), Restriction (8d) stresses that the \(\bar x:m^{\rm{*}}\left( {{{\bf{x}}_J},{{\bf{z}}_{ - J}}} \right)\) demand functions are compatible with collective rationality only if they no longer respond to the distribution factors once they are conditioned on one more demand influenced by \({\bf{z}}_L^{\rm{*}}\) (say \(x_1^{\rm{*}}\)). Chiappori and Ekeland (2006) (henceforth CE2006) provide another generalization of Proposition 2 of BBC2009, which we present here in a slightly modified manner. 
(Chiappori and Ekeland 2006
) A system of N ⩾ I + 1 demand functions of a household with I + 1 decision-makers is compatible with 
rationality
 if, and only if, distribution factors, z
,
 either do not influence the demand system (
unitary rationality
):
 
or satisfies the following condition whenever K ⩾ I + 1 (
collective rationality
):
 See CE2006 for the proof. Restriction (9a) is identical to our restrictions (7a) and (8a). Restriction (9b) states that if there exists K ⩾ I + 1 distribution factors, then the rank of the matrix D
z
x(z) must be greater than zero, but no greater than I. Intuitively, there can be no more than I Pareto weights under collective rationality. Since the distribution factors only impact the demand system through the latter, if there are fewer weights than there are distribution factors, their effects on the demand functions must necessarily be linearly dependent. Propositions 2 and 3 are equivalent. If a demand system satisfies (8b), (8c) and (8d), it will also satisfy (9b) and vice versa. However, if (8b) is satisfied, but restrictions (8c) and (8d) do not apply because L < 2, then (9b) may not be satisfied. This is because (8b) is only necessary. However, under collective rationality, and as long as K + 1 ≥ I, it will always be possible to partition \({\bf{x}} \equiv \left[ {{\bf x \prime}_J ,{\bf x}_{ - J \prime}} \right]\prime\) and \({\bf{z}} \equiv \left[ {{\bf z \prime}_J ,{\bf{z}}_{ - J \prime} } \right]\prime\) in such a way that L ≥ 2.Footnote 16
 The two propositions provide falsifiable restrictions for an overall test of rationality. In the case of Proposition 2, the first step is to test whether all the demands satisfy Restriction (8a), i.e., to test whether households behave rationality in a unitary way. If this hypothesis is rejected, the next step is to test collective rationality. The general formulation of the null hypothesis corresponding to collective rationality is H
0:J ≤ I − 1 vs. H
1:J > I − 1. Since H
0 is a composite hypothesis, a sequential approach can be followed. One should thus start by testing whether all the demand functions satisfy Restriction (8b) when J = 0. If this hypothesis is rejected, the Restriction (8b) has to be tested for J = 1 and so on until it is not rejected for J ≤ I − 1. If the Restriction (8b) is not rejected for J ≤ I − 1, the Restriction (8c) or (8b) should be tested for those demand functions that are influenced by distribution factors. If the latter hypothesis is not rejected, then testing stops and collective rationality is not rejected. Conversely, if Restriction (8c) or (8d) is rejected, then Restriction (8b) should be tested again for a higher J. If the restrictions (8b) and (8c) or (8d) are successively rejected for all J ≤ I − 1, then collective rationality as well as overall rationality must be rejected. The same sequential approach must be used with Proposition 3. The first step is to test whether the rank of D

z

x(z) is equal to zero. If not so, then the next step is to test whether it is equal to 1 and so on until I is reached. If the rank is not found to be equal or inferior to I, then overall rationality is rejected. If the rank is found to be of any value greater than 1 but inferior or equal to I, then testing stops and collective rationality is not rejected. Household collective rationality is the object of much research in the empirical literature. In what follows, we present a brief and informal meta-analysis that illustrates how our propositions may partly explain why the standard testing approach is likely to under-reject the collective model based upon distribution factors. Most papers focus on households composed of two adults, which is the concern of our Proposition 1. Demand systems are estimated using data from developed as well as developing countries and are based on a variety of functional forms (AIDS, QUAIDS, etc.). Likewise, a rich set of distribution factors are used to proxy spouses’ relative bargaining power (e.g., relative income, age and assets at marriage). As shown earlier, for collective rationality of two-person households to be satisfied, the all or nothing Restriction (7b) needs to hold and Restriction (7c) and, equivalently (7d), only applies to the subset of demand functions that are responding to all the distribution factors. Yet, it is customary in the literature to neglect Restriction (7b) and to test collective rationality by means of Restriction (7c), or Restriction (7d), over the full set of demands, thus including those that do not respond to distribution factors as well as those who respond to a subset of them. This, we argue, partly explains why collective rationality is likely to be under-rejected. In short, the failure to reject the collective model may be an artifact of the testing procedure. For illustration, we report in Table 1 a series of papers referred to in Chapter 5 of Browning et al. (2014) and in Naidoo (2015) whose empirical results are interpreted as generally supportive of the collective model. We see first in column 5 that among the ten papers using the proportionality condition or the z-conditional demands to test the collective model, only two of them (that is, Chiappori et al. 2002 and Attanasio and Lechene 2014) satisfy the BBC2009 assumption. Recall that this condition assumes that at least one distribution factor affects each demand equation. Second, among the ten papers, four of them (that is, Quisumbing and Maluccio 2003, Bayudan 2006, Bobonis 2009, Attanasio and Lechene 2014—columns 6 and 7) conclude that the collective model is not rejected though it is rejected, based on our all or nothing test. Note also that, according to our test, the unitary model is not rejected in Thomas et al. (1999) and Vermeulen (2005) as none of the distribution factors are statistically significant. This leaves only four papers which are consistent with collective rationality according to our test (Bourguignon et al. 1993; Thomas and Chen 1994; Browning and Chiappori 1998; Chiappori et al. 2002).Footnote 17
 For example, let us focus on the paper by Quisumbing and Maluccio (2003). It uses data from various developing countries to estimate household demand systems. Assets of spouses at marriage and spouses’ schooling are treated as distribution factors. Results for Bangladesh show that the demand for food significantly responds only to the husband’s assets, that the demand for education responds only to the wife’s assets and the husband’s schooling and that the demand for child clothing responds only to the husband’s schooling. This is not compatible with collective rationality as it violates the all or nothing restriction. Indeed, in a demand equation where one distribution factor is statistically significant, all other distribution factors should also be significant. Results for Ethiopia show that food responds to the two assets distribution factors, but alcohol and tobacco only to the wife’s assets. This is not compatible with collective rationality either. In both cases, Restriction (7c) is tested with a joint test over all demands and is not rejected, and hence nor is collective rationality. The latter study is representative of how most papers test collective rationality. In what follows, we use data from rural Burkina Faso to investigate rationality within monogamous and bigamous households. All or nothing Restriction (7b) (monogamous) or (8b) (bigamous) is first tested. If satisfied, we next move on to test (7c) or (8c) as the case may be. We also test collective rationality using the asymptotically equivalent test of CE2006 rank condition. We next use the same approach as in the above papers and test Restriction (7c) irrespective of whether the all or nothing Restriction (7b) holds.",10

Ayhan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Ever since Mincer (1962) the ‘added worker effect’ (AWE) has been extensively discussed in the family economics literature to explain the labor supply response of married women to their husbands’ unemployment by entering the labor force (extensive margin) or increasing their working hours (intensive margin). This paper empirically assesses the extensive margin of AWE during the global economic crisis of 2008, a period that witnessed an external labor demand shock. This paper uses data from Turkey, where the participation rate of women in the labor force is remarkably low, standing at 23.6% in 2007. Many studies from Turkey highlight the significant role of cultural factors in explaining the low rate of female labor force participation, especially among married women. The increasing responsibilities of women related to household chores upon marriage are considered a key factor constraining them from market work (Aran et al. 2010; Dayioglu and Kirdar 2010; Gunduz-Hosgor and Smits 2008). Only about one out of four married women participate in the labor force, whereas the participation rate is around 10 percentage points higher for their single counterparts (Table 1). On the other hand, men who were not working before marriage enter the labor force to fulfill their roles as bread winners. This argument is supported by the higher rate of labor force participation among married men relative to their single counterparts. As shown in Table 1, the labor force participation rate of married women increased by more than 3% points between 2007 and 2009, compared with about a 1% point increase among single women and an almost constant trend among (married) men. What could have changed during the 2008 crisis in favor of women’s participation behavior? Could it be the case that the shock to the husbands’ income removed the constraint on women’s labor supply? Or, as highlighted by Starr (2014), could it reflect the deterioration of traditional social roles due to the income shock, shifting responsibilities towards wives as bread winners? Motivated by these questions, the current study seeks to analyze the extent to which the increase in women’s labor supply during the 2008 crisis can be explained by their husbands’ job losses. For the empirical analysis, it is necessary to consider the potential endogeneity problems primarily arising from the joint determination of spousal labor supply, assortative mating and complementarity between the leisure of spouses. In order to deal with these endogeneity issues, this paper, inspired by Starr (2014), exploits the ‘mancession’ characteristics of the 2008 crisis in the analysis of AWE.Footnote 1 In particular, the crisis hit hardest the typically male-dominated sectors (such as manufacturing, construction, trade and transportation) in terms of output losses. The variation in the output of these sectors is used as an instrument for the husband’s unemploymentFootnote 2 after removing the variation in the output of other sectors (with relatively higher female labor force), individual characteristics and a time trend. It can be observed that the demand-side factors, which are likely to have a direct impact on female labor force participation, are captured effectively by controlling the output of other sectors. Fixed effects are also included in the regression analysis to capture (time-constant) unobserved heterogeneity which might be correlated with the husband’s unemployment propensity. Employing panel data from the ‘Survey of Income and Living Conditions’, I conduct an analysis based on quarterly measures of labor supply. The analysis enables me to capture the transitory increase in the participation of the female workforce during the husband’s short period of unemployment. It also accounts for potential delays in the labor supply response of women to their husbands’ job loss. This type of analysis, using data from Turkey, has not commonly been performed in previous literature employing annual measures of labor supply. Relatively few studies address endogeneity problems while assessing AWEFootnote 3, and existing empirical evidence is quite mixed. Bredtmann et al. (2014) suggests that the varied evidence in the literature can be explained by the different types of welfare regimes that exist in Europe. In particular, generous unemployment benefit systems and social assistance schemes might set disincentives for women to enter the labor market following the unemployment of their husbands. The empirical evidence also reveals that the magnitude of AWE is most prominent in countries that support the traditional gendered division of labor within households, implying low female labor force participation. While highlighting this aspect of the literature, the current study provides causal evidence of AWE taking place in Turkey during the 2008 recession. Regarding the results from the first stage of the Instrumental Variable (IV) method, a strongly negative correlation is found between the variables of output in the male-dominated sectors and husbands’ unemployment. This finding rules out concerns over the consequences of a weak instrument. The IV with fixed effects estimation results suggest that the probability of female labor force participation increases by 15–28% in response to the husband’s job loss. This supporting evidence of AWE becomes noticeable after one quarter of the husband’s unemployment and only remains prominent for the two subsequent quarters. Compared to the previous literature, the relatively large magnitude of the results might be attributed to the emerging character of credit markets in Turkey, which introduces a more binding liquidity constraint on households. There is no outside option other than increasing the labor supply of the family to compensate for the income loss. AWE would also be expected to work in similar contexts where married women face similar constraints on their labor force participation and liquidity constraints are largely binding. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the theoretical reasons behind the probability or improbability of AWE. Section 3 introduces the data and section 4 presents the identification strategy. Section 5 discusses the estimation results, before section 6 concludes the discussion.",7
16.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,20 April 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9370-4,The EITC and the labor supply of adult dependents: direct effects and family income effects,September 2018,Margaret Katherine McKeehan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In 2014, over 13 million non-child individuals were claimed as dependents in the United States, with this type of claim appearing on approximately 1 in every 15 returns.Footnote 1 These claims, if made legally, represent very low-income individuals (earning less than $3950 in 2014) receiving the majority of their financial support from the primary filers who claimed them. Since these individuals have very low income levels, small changes in tax liability can generate sizable welfare effects. Despite these considerations, little is known about how taxes affect the labor supply of non-child dependents. Acknowledging this, I use the 1993 expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to study how taxation affects their labor force participation decisions. Two features of the 1993 EITC expansion potentially affected adult dependents. First, for dependents attached to low-income households, family credits could have increased by as much as $1017, changing family income and the value of dependent labor force participation. Second, starting in 1994, individuals without children could claim up to $306 in wage subsidies under the credit. This credit for childless individuals generally follows the form of the credit for filers with children. The value starts at $0 for individuals without wage income and increases proportionately with wages until reaching its maximum value. Then, for higher-wage individuals, the credit begins to be phased out. For example, in 1994, no childless individuals earning $9000 or more could claim the EITC. Noting these two relevant changes, I look for evidence that the expansion affected labor force participation for three separate categories of dependents: adult children living with their parents (who are too old to be “child dependents”), older individuals living with their children, and non-nuclear relatives. I find that the 1993 reform increased the labor force participation for non-nuclear, adult dependents by about 5 percentage points. In contrast, for adult children, I find that the absence of a net response to the EITC expansion is likely due to a previously undocumented effect: increases in family credits decreased their labor force participation.Footnote 2
 To identify these effects, I use difference-in-differences estimation and data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the Current Population Survey (CPS), which observes more than 28,000 potential adult dependents between 1991 and 1996. Using this methodology to study the effects of the EITC has considerable precedent. Eissa and Leibma (1996) use the 1987 expansion of the EITC to identify an increase in labor force participation among single women with children, while Eissa and Hoynes (2004) demonstrate that the 1993 EITC expansions led to a decrease in labor force participation by married women. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines the 1993 EITC expansion and its predicted impacts. Section 3 discusses the sample selection methodology applied to the Current Population Survey and resulting sample characteristics. Section 4 studies labor force participation responses using difference-in-differences methodology. Section 5 concludes.",5

The American Psychological Association (2016) describes anxiety as an emotion characterized by feelings of tension and worried thoughts. This study defines anxiety about life in old age as persistent and excessive worry about everyday things in old age that include financial, health, shelter, and overall livelihood issues. Although health, shelter, and livelihood have no direct relevance to financial literacy, people can avail themselves of better healthcare, shelter, and livelihood in old age through the enhanced financial capacity gained by financial literacy, which could reduce anxiety about life in old age. Hofmann et al. (2010) also defined anxiety as feelings of tension and troubled thoughts, which can substantially hamper the wellbeing of people and negatively affect quality of life. According to recent statistics, 74% of Americans feel anxious about old age (Oakley and Kenneally 2015), with subjective wellbeing as well as uncertainty about life in retirement affected by social, economic, and cultural issues (Pinquart and Sörensen 2000). Previous studies have identified that age, gender, asset holdings, education, homeownership, household income, the cultural dimensions of the country of residence, and marital status are related to anxiety about life (Heinrichs et al. 2006; Kadoya 2016; Norasakkunkit and Kalick 2009; Okazaki 1997). Although Bland et al. (1998), Carta et al. (1991), Fichter et al. (1996), Jorm (2000), and Weissman and Myers (1980) found that people in their forties, fifties, and early sixties tend to be more anxious than those older than 65, Jorm (2000) claims that aging is associated with an intrinsic reduction in susceptibility to anxiety. In particular, Kadoya (2016) provides evidence that education, gender, and marital status typically affect anxiety about life after retirement. In addition to people’s socio-economic condition, doing regular exercise (Mochcovitch et al. 2016; De Moor et al. 2006) and benefits from social security programs (Kadoya and Khan 2017) are also found to reduce anxiety about life in old age. Despite such findings, however, these factors are unable to fully explain anxiety about life after retirement. Based on this gap in the literature, we examine which other variables could influence anxiety levels in old age after controlling for social and economic factors. In most countries, an employee’s pension scheme is not sufficient to sustain livelihood in old age (Sekita 2011). Households increasingly need to think about retirement savings and costs for healthcare and long-term care (Banks 2010; Sekita 2011). In addition to pension benefits and government-sponsored healthcare and social security programs, people need to accumulate wealth during their working life so that they can enjoy its benefits in old age. Thus, a sound living standard in old age partially depends on how people plan and make decisions about current consumption, savings, and investments during their working lives. Since financial markets are intertwined with these decisions, people need to understand them. In recent decades, although financial markets have become more accessible and offer different sophisticated financial products that people can use to maximize their benefits in old age, the complexity of the financial products and riskiness of the markets can have disastrous consequences for people’s financial conditions. Lusardi and Mitchell (2011a, 2014) have rightly observed that the need for financial knowledge for households to make decisions in a global and risky marketplace is being felt more than previously. Financial literacy helps people to decide on value maximizing savings and investment decisions. In the absence of financial knowledge, savings and investment decision could be guided by rules of thumb, which often do not ensure maximum benefits for the household (Bernheim 1998; Calvet et al. 2009; Stango and Zinman 2009). Bernheim and Garrett (2003) asserted that financial education received in the workplace improves households’ saving decisions. Several studies provide evidence that financial literacy improves household behavior on savings, investment, retirement planning, wealth accumulation, and stock market participation (Alessie et al. 2011; Lusardi and Mitchell 2011a; 2011b; Sekita 2013; Van Rooij et al. 2011, 2012). Despite these benefits, financial literacy is low globally and also varies by demographic characteristics (Al-Tamimi and Kalli 2009; Lusardi and Mitchell 2011a). Lusardi et al. (2014), Lusardi and Mitchell (2011b), Lusardi et al. (2010), Lusardi and Mitchell (2008), and Lusardi and Mitchell (2007) showed that financial literacy is below average among women, young, lower income individuals, minorities, people without a college degree, and non-whites. Although previous studies have examined the effects of financial literacy on the economic and investment behavior of people, it is not yet well understood whether financial literacy reduces the level of anxiety. Based on the foregoing, this study analyzes whether financial literacy affects the level of anxiety in people’s lives in old age. To do this, we control for several factors that have been found to influence anxiety and hypothesize that financially literate people are more able to earn more income and accumulate more assets leading them to have a less anxious life after retirement. Higher financial literacy allows people to make better saving and investment decisions, leading them to accumulate more wealth. Increased financial resources as well as the ability to make decisions under risk and uncertainty make people less anxious about life when they are older. Previous studies also provide evidence that people rarely save sufficiently for retirement, have difficulty investing, and accumulate excessive debt, which all create further burdens in old age (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007; Moore 2003; Sekita 2013). Therefore, this study makes important contributions to the field of financial literacy and the study of anxiety in old age. Kadoya and Khan (2017) provided evidence that financially literate people are able to reduce anxiety about life in their old age by accumulating more assets and earning more income. Since there are differences in culture, family orientation, and subjective wellbeing in the US and Japan (Kikutani et al. 2016; Kitayama et al. 2000), we cannot apply Japanese experience in the US so naively. Previous studies also found that countries’ cultural orientations and social norms are reflected in the anxiety level (Hofmann et al. 2010; Heinrichs et al. 2006; Okazaki 1997). As a result, this study examines whether financial literacy reduces anxiety about life in old age in the US, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first study of this issue in the United States. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and methodology, Sections 3 and 4 present and discuss the empirical findings, and Section 5 concludes.",31
16.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,12 April 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9369-x,"Decomposing culture: an analysis of gender, language, and labor supply in the household",December 2018,Victor Gay,Daniel L. Hicks,Amir Shoham,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The labor force participation rate of married women has increased spectacularly during the second half of the 20th century, both in the U.S. and around the world (Goldin 2014). Nevertheless, wide differences across countries remain, with the gender gap closing faster in some countries than others, and a number of developing nations, such as India, lagging behind (Field et al. 2016). Among the factors used to explain these differences, the role of cultural norms has been shown to play a crucial role (Fernández 2007; Fernández and Fogli 2009; Alesina et al. 2013; Farré and Vella 2013; Fernández 2013). In particular, scholars have begun employing the epidemiological approach to distinguish the impact of cultural factors from that of other institutional forces (Fernández and Fogli 2009; Fernández 2011).Footnote 1
 When analyzing married couples, both individual and spousal culture are thought to play an important role in explaining labor market decisions. Early collective models of labor supply emphasize the importance of taking into account the distribution of bargaining power within the household (Chiappori et al. 2002, Blundell et al. 2007). Recently however, these models have been extended to investigate whether their main predictions depend not only on bargaining power, but also on the surrounding cultural context (Oreffice 2014) as well as on social and institutional constraints related to traditional gender roles (Field et al. 2016). These norms may influence women to allocate more labor to household production relative to the formal market at either the intensive or extensive margin. This paper studies the impact of gender roles on the labor force participation of married female immigrants in the U.S. within a collective labor supply framework. We explore culturally acquired gender roles as those embodied by the presence of grammatical gender in language spoken. Recent work has documented correlations between linguistic structure and individual behavior (Lupyan and Dale 2010; Chen 2013; Ladd et al. 2015) with the presence and intensity of gender in grammatical structures correlating with gender gaps in compensation and promotions, division of household labor, educational attainment, and political empowerment (Givati and Troiano 2012; Santacreu-Vasut et al. 2013, 2014; Hicks et al. 2015; Mavisakalyan 2015; van der Velde et al. 2015; Davis and Reynolds 2016). The mechanisms underlying these associations are largely unresolved. Perhaps the most compelling question, whether language may causally influence behavior, remains a subject of debate.Footnote 2 Linguistic correlations could reflect historically acquired cultural norms of behavior that became codified in language or language itself could represent an institutional force, influencing and perpetuating a set of behaviors. From a methodological point of view, because language is observed at the individual level, it is possible to isolate its effect from the influence of aggregate correlated historical, cultural, and biological forces. This is an exercise we undertake in this analysis following the epidemiological approach. Furthermore, because language acts a cultural marker for gender roles, we show that this barometer of norms allows us to examine labor market predictions of the collective household model in the presence or absence of these cultural influences. This yields new insights regarding their relative influence. To do this, we examine labor market outcomes for nearly half a million married female immigrants to the U.S. aged 25 to 49 in the American Community Surveys (ACS) between 2005 and 2015. In our analysis, we focus on married, foreign born individuals, who speak a language other than English in the home. With the assistance of linguists and drawing on information contained in the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures database (WALS), we assign to these speakers consistent measures of the presence and intensity of gender in the grammatical structure of their language. There are several novel empirical advances to the approach taken in this paper. First, this analysis relies on a detailed set of microeconomic data which provides a rich set of covariates and substantial variation to control for many potential confounding factors. These include many of the individual, spousal, and household level variables analyzed in the past, as well as measures which may influence the decision to migrate in the country of origin and measures of the location to which the immigrant has moved. A second advantage is reliance on the epidemiological approach in this setting which helps ameliorate a fundamental problem of identification. By using a restrictive fixed effects strategy, including country fixed effects, we are able to capture a wide array of unobservable cultural forces and obtain identification using variation in language spoken from individuals of the same country of origin or ancestry. The takeaways from this exercise are several. First, we show that married female immigrants speaking a language with sex-based distinctions in its grammar are less likely to participate in the labor market. This is true even after controlling for observable characteristics such as traditional household measures, husband characteristics, and bargaining power measures, as well as when controlling for a vast set of unobservable cultural forces through country of origin fixed effects.Footnote 3 When we empirically decompose the relationship between gender in language and gendered behavior in this manner, it suggests that roughly two thirds of this relationship can be explained by correlated cultural factors, with about one third potentially explained by language having a causal impact. Second, using language as a measure of culturally acquired gender roles allows us to speak to and test the role of bargaining power within the household relative to the impact of cultural norms. We demonstrate that both are important, and that their impacts are distinct from one another. Third, focusing on language spoken allows to also study the behavior of female immigrants in both linguistically homogeneous and heterogeneous couples. We exploit linguistic heterogeneity within the household to show that the presence of gender in language has an association with a wife’s behavior both when husbands and wives speak a gendered language, and when they speak languages with different structures. Our findings suggest that while there is an independent effect on a wife’s behavior when she alone has a gender marked language, gender marking in the husbands language enhances this effect. Fourth, using language as a measure of gender roles but recognizing it as a network technology allows us to examine the role that ethnic enclaves play in influencing female labor force participation. In theory, enclaves may improve labor market outcomes by providing information about formal jobs and reducing social stigma on employment. At the same time, enclaves are likely to reinforce immigrant language usage and thus may enhance the impact of gender in language or provide isolation from U.S. norms. We present evidence implying that the latter effect is present, which suggests that the impact of language is stronger when it is shared with the surrounding community.Footnote 4
 Finally, and as part of our robustness checks, we also show that some forms of gender roles are not present for unmarried women suggesting that they may be dormant among unmarried women where the pressure to not work, to raise children, and to provide household goods may be weaker. These findings speak to several literatures. Mavisakalyan and Weber (2016) review of the nascent field of linguistic relativity and economics and point out that the mechanisms behind the associations between language and economic behavior remain largely unresolved. Despite the current study’s ability to account for both time-invariant and time-variant country of origin factors in a more rigorous manner than previous analyses, the correlation between language and behavior remains significant and negative. This means that while we can demonstrate that most of this association can be explained by language as a cultural market for correlated gender norms, we cannot formally disprove that the behavioral channel may explain some of the remaining correlation (Roberts and Winters 2013; Hicks et al. 2015; Roberts et al. 2015).Footnote 5
 Our research also directly contributes to literature that investigates whether the impact of intra-household bargaining power on the labor supply depends on culture. In particular, our results imply that the standard prediction that the spouse with higher bargaining power will substitute labor for leisure due to an income effect as in Oreffice (2014) applies only to native born couples in the U.S., and to immigrant couples with gender roles similar to the U.S. Interestingly, our results confirm that in couples coming from countries classified as exhibiting strong traditional gender roles, the influence of bargaining power on household collective labor supply may be culturally dependent and that some of these standard predictions may not hold for these groups. While Oreffice (2014) focuses on the intensive labor supply among couples where both spouses are working, we focus mainly on the extensive margin and how bargaining power influences female labor force participation. Field et al. (2016) study the extensive margin of the labor supply among married female in India and model the impact of bargaining power distribution within the household with social constraints related to traditional gender norms. Our findings complement these studies by empirically showing that the married female immigrants with stronger bargaining power are more likely to work, not less, and that the impact of bargaining power is reinforced when traditional gender roles are embodied in the language spoken. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents summary statistics for both the ACS and linguistic data and details the empirical strategy. Section 3 presents the empirical results—decomposing the impact of language from other cultural influences, using gender in language as a cultural marker to study labor supply within the household and presenting a wide range of robustness checks. Section 4 concludes.",26

In developed countries, upstream transfers are mainly in the form of caregiving (time) from adult children to their elderly parents (Arrondel and Masson 2006). Conversely, downstream financial and in-kind transfers usually take place at an earlier stage of the life cycle, when young individuals invest in their human capital and when they acquire a new house to leave the nest and establish a new family. These past transfers are particularly important, as they affect the process of wealth formation, both influencing the young individuals’ decisions and determining the degree of their future wealth and income mobility. The relation between these transfers, and the different motives that lead individuals to make them, has been the subject to lively debate in the literature, starting with Bernheim et al. (1985). In this paper we contribute to the literature on inter vivos transfers by providing novel empirical evidence of the relation between upstream and downstream intergenerational transfers that occur many years apart. In particular, we study whether adult children who, in the past, received economic assistance from their parents are more likely to currently provide informal care to them. This helps to shed new light on how the members of an extended family network enforce implicit agreements of mutual assistance that extend over time. Downstream and upstream intergenerational transfers usually take place in different stages of the life cycle, often more than a decade apart. If there is nothing to prevent the younger generation from shirking its responsibility, the two generations may end up in a prisoner dilemma in which neither assists the other side. Furthermore, as long as the two transfers are tightly related, public policies that affect one of them, such as taxation and old-age security, may also impinge on the other. Most of the empirical literature has focused on contemporary exchange, which can hardly offer any insights about intertemporal choices. By contrast, using Italian data containing a wealth of retrospective information, we present robust evidence that couples who received economic assistance with housing from their parents at the time of their marriage are more likely to provide their parents with informal care later in life. We also discuss further results suggesting that our main finding is more consistent with exchange models and the theories based on self-interest, rather than with frameworks based on pure altruism, although we are not able to fully pin-point a specific theory. Recent papers that focus on the relation between contemporary downstream transfers and upstream caregiving (see McGarry and Schoeni 1997; Altonji et al. 2000, for previous results), Norton and Van Houtven (2006) and Norton and Huang (2013) demonstrate that caregivers are more likely to receive money from their parents, although there are no differences in terms of the amounts. Conversely, according to Jimenez-Martin and Prieto (2015), informal caregivers receive less economic assistance from their parents. Only a few empirical studies provide evidence about the relation between past transfers from parents and in-kind services provided by the adult children later on in life. McGarry and Schoeni (1997) find that the provision of informal care to parents is negatively correlated with financial transfers received from them in the previous 10 years, although they also find that parents giving more money expect to receive more (time) help in the future. Arrondel and Masson (2006), discussing the results of Wolff (1998) and Arrondel and Masson (2001), claim that in France neither past gifts nor care given to grandchildren by parents seem to explain current time transfers to them. Furthermore, according to their results, helpers have not been subject to higher educational investments in the past, nor do they expect higher bequests in the future. The authors also refer to Cox and Stark (1998), however, who provide some empirical evidence that helpers are more educated, so may be paying back the past investment from their parents. Arrondel and Masson (2006) conclude that help provided to elderly parents is more likely to be explained by altruism or by a system of indirect reciprocities between generations, whereby young adults either follow what their parents did in the past for their own parents, or hope that they will be imitated by their own children. More recently, López-Anuarbe (2013), using US data, finds that monetary gifts from parents are positively correlated with the past receipt of time assistance from their offspring, but not with the current one. Conversely, she finds no correlation between current caregiving to elderly parents and past monetary gifts received from them. Other studies, in particular Tomassini et al. (2003) and Coda Moscarola et al. (2010), point out that those children receiving help with housing from their parents are more likely to live near to them. Although geographical distance is a good proxy for time transfers, neither paper directly estimates the relation between them and housing transfers. To conclude, Brugiavini et al. (2013) recently demonstrated reciprocity between the provision of grandchild care and elderly care. We contribute to this limited empirical literature using three cross-sections (1998, 2003 and 2009) of the Italian Multipurpose Survey on Families to analyse the relation between transfers at different points in time. The survey contains retrospective information on help with housing received from the parents at the time of marriage, as well as information about the family network and the current exchange of services, in particular informal care provided by adult children to their elderly parents. The 1998 wave of the Multipurpose Survey has already been used by Tomassini et al. (2003) to study the relation between past help with housing and current geographical distance.Footnote 1 Their results, based on a multinomial logit, show that adult children tend to live closer to the set of parents (wives’ or husbands’) that provided help with housing at the time of their marriage, and closer to both if they both helped. By contrast, we directly study the link with the current provision of informal care to parents. In doing so, we investigate how the system of mutual assistance lasts over time, and we show that only a fraction of our main results can be explained by increased geographical proximity. Other mechanisms, related to a mix of self-interest motives, seem to be relevant in this context. Furthermore, although our main results involve the couple as a whole, the focus on informal care also allows us to understand which partner is mostly involved in this intergenerational exchange. We focus on help with housing at the time of marriage for several reasons. First, housing costs represent a large proportion of family income and European households generally perceive them as a heavy burden (Pittini 2012). Second, quite a significant proportion of adult couples received this form of help at the time of their marriage, consistent with earlier evidence about the fundamental role of the family in supporting entry into home ownership (Mencarini and Tanturri 2006; Helderman and Mulder 2007; Modena and Rondinelli 2011). Third, this help takes place at the point at which a new household is formed and, therefore, makes the distinction between the two generations clear. Fourth, this past transfer is precisely identified in the Multipurpose Survey, whereas other forms of past economic assistance are collected only with reference to specific moments of economic hardship. Nevertheless, we also discuss these in our empirical analysis. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses the conceptual framework. Data are presented in Section 3 and the main results in Section 4. Section 5 discusses whether our findings are in line with different theoretical models. We conclude the discussion of our findings in Section 6.",7

This relationship is perhaps most obvious in developing countries where families face liquidity constraints and income uncertainty. It is well documented that parents often focus resources on male children over female children in the household (Behrman et al. 1986). The observed male bias could be purely taste based, but there is evidence that households have economic motives for favoring sons over daughters (Rosenzweig and Schultz 1982). According to the parental repayment hypothesis, a parent’s investment in their young child’s human capital increases a child’s future productivity and income and may encourage the child to repay the parent later in life (Lillard and Willis 1997). If market conditions favor men in the labor force, parents may invest more heavily in male children over female children (Davies and Zhang 1995). A related hypothesis is the old age security hypothesis, which emphasizes the role of savings constraints as a motive for intergenerational transfers. In regions where public and private provision of old age support is limited, transfers from children to parents are one of the primary means of old age support (Wong and Higgins 2007). In Mexico, over 75% of the elderly population does not receive any pension benefits (Noel-Miller and Tfaily 2009), so intergenerational transfers form an important source of income for the population over 65. In particular, over a third of income comes from kin, usually male children (Wong and Espinoza 2002). Parents may wish to invest in their children as a form of old age security. These theories of intergenerational transfers do not consider personal risk preferences, which may play an important role in the decision-making process. In response to current income uncertainty, households may form risk sharing networks.Footnote 1 If income uncertainty in later stages of their life cycle is the primary concern, parents who are highly risk averse may have a stronger precautionary savings motive relative to parents who are less risk averse, and in turn may focus more resources on the child more likely to provide support. In this paper I examine the relationship between parental risk aversion and child investments using panel survey data from the Mexican Family Life Survey (MXFLS). The MXFLS is a unique dataset that includes a module on risk preferences and anthropometric data, as well as detailed information on household expenditures. I use outcomes of parental investments such as weight and height for age, which are measured with less noise than parental inputs. Child height and weight may also serve as an early indicator of future labor market productivity (Black et al. 2007; Victora et al. 2008; Vogl 2012). While I cannot observe health inputs, as an alternate specification I also examine parental expenditures related to children’s schooling. Risk preferences are elicited by having respondents choose between hypothetical gambles. One might expect that households who are more risk averse would be better at smoothing the consumption of all their children, but I find evidence that mothers who are risk averse have heavier boys relative to households where the mother is less risk averse. It is not entirely a healthy increase in weight; boys are less likely to be underweight, but are also more likely to be overweight. While the BMI results suggest that male favoritism is being expressed through unhealthy channels, I find that risk averse mothers spend more on their son’s schooling related expenditures. I also employ a household fixed effects specification to examine whether parental risk preferences affect the intrahousehold allocation of resources, and find that brothers are heavier and receive more schooling inputs relative to their sisters. I do not find a strong relationship between a father’s risk preferences and child outcomes of either sex. A potential concern with using experimental measures of risk preferences is that decisions regarding hypothetical outcomes may not be representative of a person’s true risk preferences. While this claim is difficult to test, there are many studies that validate experimental measures of risk aversion by examining outcomes where there is a clear theoretical relationship between risk preferences and the outcome in both developed and developing country contexts. Binswanger (1981) conducts an experiment with real payoffs to measure risk aversion among rural farmers in India. He finds that the experimental measure of risk aversion is correlated with the riskiness of the farmer’s agricultural decisions such as fertilizer use, sowing time, and irrigation investment. Surveys in developed countries that elicit risk preferences, such as the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), have been used to examine the relationship between risk tolerance, asset allocation, and savings. The method of eliciting risk preferences is similar to the MXFLs, where individuals are asked to choose between pairs of hypothetical gambles. Barsky et al. 1997 find that differences in the experimental measure of risk tolerance can explain differences in asset allocations across households. This study adds to the expanding literature on the role of risk preferences with respect to non-financial decision-making. Schmidt (2008) examines the relationship between risk preferences and the timing of marriage and childbirth using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Tsaneva (2013) uses the Mexican Family Life Survey to find evidence that risk averse mothers are more likely to treat the water their children consume. However, she does not examine whether risk preferences lead to differential treatment of male and female children in the same household. Hamoudi and Thomas (2006) examine the effect of a mother and father’s risk preferences on intergenerational transfers using data from the MXFLS Preferences Pilot Study, where individuals are presented with gambles with small actual payoffs. Hamoudi and Thomas (2006) find some evidence that mothers who were risk loving have children who weigh less whereas fathers who were risk loving had taller children, but do not examine direct measures of parental inputs or the intrahousehold resource allocation process. To the best of my knowledge, I am the first to show evidence of a gender gap in child investments within risk averse households and to present a model of precautionary savings that is consistent with the empirical results. This paper also contributes to the literature that examines household decision-making with respect to children. The empirical research has mainly focused on identifying differences between a mother and father’s preferences (Duflo 2000; Reggio 2011; Lundberg et al. 1997; Thomas 1994). These studies indicate that women have a greater preference for child investments than men, but there is limited research that explores preference heterogeneity within gender. A notable exception is Blundell et al. (2005), who examine the theoretical underpinnings of the concept of mother’s “caring more” within a collective model. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a theoretical framework for child investments. Section 3 outlines the data I use in estimation, and includes details of how my risk aversion measure is constructed. Section 4 describes my empirical specification and results are reported in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.",4
16.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,30 October 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9395-8,Marriage and the economic status of women with children,December 2018,Briggs Depew,Joseph Price,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the strongest predictors of poverty for children in the US is whether or not their parents are married (Lichter et al. 2003). Child poverty rates among married-couple families are four times lower than for single mother households and twice as low as that of cohabiting couples (Thomas and Sawhill 2005). This strong relationship between marriage and poverty is part of a broader class of correlations between marriage and various positive outcomes (Waite 1995). However, critics of this literature argue that selection into marriage alone drives these relationships and that there is no true causal effect of marriage. The purpose of this paper is to explore the causal relationship that marriage may play on a mother’s economic status. In order to control for the endogenous selection into marriage, we direct our attention to the subgroup of mothers that are marginally pushed in and out of marriage according to the gender of their first child. Specifically, we use the gender of a woman’s first child as an instrument for marriage. We find that if a mother’s first child is a boy, the mother is 0.33 percentage points more likely to be married at any point in time over the course of that child’s first 12 years of life. Several recent papers have employed this instrument to examine the impact of divorce on the economic outcomes of women with children (Bedard and Deschênes 2005; Ananat and Michaels 2008), analyzing the subgroup of mothers marginally pushed in and out of divorce based on the gender of their first child. Although our approach is quite similar, we examine the question of how being married impacts economic outcomes for mothers rather than just examining the impact of divorce. Additionally, our sample includes all mothers and not just those women who were married prior to the birth of their first child. Our inclusion of never married women is important since this is the subset of mothers that experiences the highest poverty rates. Our study presents three important sets of results. First, we find that marriage plays an important role in determining the economic well-being of mothers. In particular, we find that marriage increases family income, decreases welfare receipt, and decreases the likelihood that a woman’s children are below the poverty line. Second, using an IV quantile regression framework similar to that used by Ananat and Michaels (2008), we find that the effect of marriage on family income is most pronounced among women at the lower end of the income distribution. As we examine increasingly higher levels of income, we see that the effect of marriage grows smaller to the point that it essentially disappears for women in the upper quintile of the income distribution. Third, we compare married and cohabiting mothers and find that cohabitation alone does not provide the same economic benefits as marriage. Limiting our sample to include only women who have a spouse or partner, we find that marriage decreases the likelihood of receiving welfare assistance, living below the poverty line, and receiving food stamps. One channel through which this effect may operate may lie in the stabilizing role that marriage plays relative to cohabitation. The internal validity of our research design requires that the gender of a mother’s first child does not directly affect the economic well-being of that mother, except through the effect of a mother’s marital status. While this assumption is not testable, it may be problematic if, for example, mothers adjust their labor supply, accumulation of human capital, or fertility decisions based on their first child’s gender. Additional analysis that controls for these potentially endogenous channels produces estimates that are strikingly similar to our main set of results. Taken together, our complete body of results suggests that marriage plays an important role in the economic well-being of mothers.",8

Data from the 2010 census suggests America has over 3 million single fathers.Footnote 1 Although there are about 3 times as many single mothers, very little is known about the circumstances or effects of single fatherhood.Footnote 2 In this paper I estimate the effect of single fatherhood on men’s labor market outcomes using samples from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Even controlling for individual differences, single fatherhood is associated with significant changes for men entering into single fatherhood through marital separation. These “separated fathers” experience a sizable decrease in income and wages and an increase in hours of housework that exceeds what is experienced by other separated men. These changes persist after men remarry, but diminish after their children mature and leave the household. Moreover, single fathers’ dramatic labor market changes are present even with widower-fathers who have not likely planned for or chosen the role of single parent. This provides the first evidence that single fatherhood is a significant obstacle to men’s labor market success, raising concerns for the wellbeing of affected men and their children. Several concurrent phenomena contribute to the rapid increase in single parent households. First, the increasing age of first marriage has led to an increase in children born to unwed parents. In addition, the increase in single parent households may be attributed to changes in state divorce laws. Gruber (2004) suggests that states’ adoption of laws permitting unilateral and no-fault divorces in the 1960s and 1970s made it easier for couples to separate, with or without children. Although some (e.g. Wolfers (2006)) believe that there is insufficient empirical evidence to conclude divorce laws were to blame, national divorce rates spiked rapidly in the early 70 s only recently returning to their pre-1970 level. This lead to a wave of separated families in the mid to late 1970s, with mostly mothers being awarded custody due to customs and precedents in individual states. In addition to an increase in single parenting in general, there has also been an increase in single fatherhood. Cancian et al. (2014) document a dramatic decrease in mother-sole custody decisions from 80% to 42% of cases between 1986 and 2008, with a corresponding increase in shared custody. This suggests that fathers are now much more likely remain involved as a parent to some extent after marital separation. In the sample below, a large number of fathers sampled by the PSID appear to retain custody of their children after marital separation. Fully understanding the effects of single fatherhood on men’s labor market outcomes is important for several reasons. First, single fatherhood is responsible for dramatic reduction in the labor hours and wages of a group of men already typified by below average income and education. The decrease in these men’s earning potential, therefore, puts them at significant economic risk. Moreover, a large body of research has established the importance of family income on child outcomes (e.g. Heckman and Carneiro 2003); if sole parenting puts a considerable strain on men’s earnings, this could imply decreased educational and career opportunities for their children. For this reason, understanding the outcomes of single fathers is important to inform policy which supports these men and their children. Second, the circumstances of single fathers provide unique insight into the economic consequences of fatherhood in general. Many papers detail the effect of parenting on labor outcomes for men and women, but few natural experiments provide a truly unanticipated shock to parent status. A man informed that he will be father to natural twins,Footnote 3 for instance, may have to plan to act as a father for two children instead of one. Although timing and number may be a surprise, he has likely planned to be a father for many years. Widower fathers are unlikely to have chosen or planned for their role as single fathers enough years in advance to influence their educational attainment, industry, occupation, etc. Although it may be unsurprising that single fatherhood significantly disadvantages men on the labor market, this stands in stark contrast to existing results regarding the effects of parenting on men’s labor outcomes. First, previous work suggest that men earn more and work more as fathers,Footnote 4 presumably because men specialize in market work to support their children and partner, who assumes the majority of household duties. This pattern of household specialization may be true in many cases, but this paper provides evidence that the effect of children on men’s labor outcomes depends on who is doing the housework. Second, previous studies suggest that housework has a negative effect on female hours and wages but does not significantly influence the labor outcomes of men.Footnote 5 Single fatherhood causes a sudden and sizable increase in men’s housework hours which is concurrent with dramatic declines in wages and work hours. Widower fathers, therefore, provide evidence that sufficiently large unexpected increases in housework hours indeed negatively influence the labor outcomes of men.",2

Unemployment rose to an average that exceeded 25 percent in some provinces and, for some groups, such as younger workers, that figure hovered around 50 percent. Employment loss, along with the bursting of the housing bubble and the significant drop in value experienced in financial markets, have the potential to severely impact the wealth and wealth accumulation patterns of Spanish households. In this paper, we examine how the recession affected the wealth and wealth accumulation of Spanish households, paying close attention to emerging wealth disparities. Which assets were primarily impacted by the downturn? Was it real estate assets, financial assets, or business assets? Was it just their value that dropped? Or did ownership of those assets decrease significantly as well? Because the extent to which household wealth is affected by the business cycle is highly dependent on its portfolio composition, we start by documenting the dissimilar portfolio composition of households depending on their relative standing in the wealth distribution. Subsequently, we discuss the role of the economic downturn played on Spanish households’ wealth accumulation patterns after 2008 via changes in the ownership of certain assets (asset portfolio composition) and/or changes in the net value of households’ portfolios, paying close attention at some of the channels through which the latter might be taking place—namely: changes in household composition, income, access to credit or asset prices. The analysis concludes with a discussion of differential wealth accumulation trends by quintiles and rising wealth inequality. Understanding how the crisis impacted the wealth accumulation of various types of households is crucial, not only for addressing the long-lasting effects of the past recession through the design of policies helping those most hard hit by the downturn, but also in forecasting the fiscal impacts and long-term consequences of future crises, such as increased government spending on unemployment and retirement benefits. In the case of Spain, these two types of government transfers can become potentially large owing to the significant increase in unemployment and an aging population, respectively. Finally, awareness of the impact that the downturn has had on the distribution of wealth across Spanish households is also important given global concerns of escalating wealth inequality and its adverse effects on ensuring economic opportunity, social cohesion and overall well-being.",7

While some policy makers have argued for mass deportation, others have argued for large scale legalization. A number of papers estimate the effects of legalization on labor market outcomes. Most of these papers (Borjas 1999; Kossoudji and Cobb‐Clark 2002; Kaushal 2006; Amuedo-Dorantes et al. 2007; Pan 2012) find that legalization leads to a small wage gain for previously illegal immigrants. A related (but smaller) literature explores relationships between legal status and other outcomes such as: consumption, remittances, health, and criminal activities. Fasani (2015) provides a recent and comprehensive review of this literature. Another related literature addresses the issue of human capital investment by immigrants (Borjas 1999; Duleep and Regets 1999 among others). However, these papers make no distinction between legal, and illegal, immigrants. Despite its importance in determining economic outcomes, little is known about how illegal immigrants decide to invest in their own human capital—or how legalization affects these decisions. A recent paper by Méndez et al. 2016 is an exception. They use the Legalized Population Survey (LPS) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) data to show that previously illegal immigrants substantially increase investment in job training after receiving legal status. This paper explores how the subjective beliefs of illegal immigrants about deportation or legalization affect their decisions about investment in education. This topic is very relevant in the current environment as a new U.S. administration proposes to ramp up enforcement actions against illegal immigrants. What might be the effect of an increase in perceived deportation threat on educational investment among illegal immigrants? To analyze this we develop a two-period model of educational investment along the lines of Borjas (1999). However, in our model, current legal status, and expectations about future legal status affect educational investment decisions. In period one, immigrants decide whether to invest in education. In the model illegal immigrants face three possibilities in period two: they may remain in the host country illegally, they may become legalized, or they may be deported to their source countries. Since the return on their investment depends on period two outcome, the expectations about period two affect educational investment decisions. The theoretical model predicts that educational investment among illegal immigrants is a decreasing function of deportation probability. The theoretical model does not have a definitive prediction about which group (illegal or legal immigrants), will invest more in education. Theoretical model suggests that it depends on subjective beliefs and relative returns to education. In other words, which group (illegal or legal immigrants) will invest more in education is an empirical question. We analyze the educational investment decisions made by immigrants using data from the two waves of New Immigrant Survey (NIS) that are currently available. The NIS data have been previously used to estimate wage gains from legalization (Lofstrom et al. 2010 and Mukhopadhyay 2016). The NIS data contains the educational investment decisions of illegal immigrants when they were staying in the U.S. illegally, and after they received Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) status. In the empirical implementation, we distinguish between the immigrants who entered the U.S. without documents (entry without inspection, or EWI) and those who overstayed their visa (over-stayer, or OS) following Jasso et al. (2008). We describe the details in the data section. The NIS data also contains educational investment decisions of legal immigrants when they were staying in the U.S. on a legal temporary visa (such as F1), and after receiving their LPR status. Since these individuals were always staying in the U.S., legally they are labeled as always legal (AL) immigrants (Lofstrom et al. 2010). To measure enforcement actions we use data from the Statistical Yearbooks of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (1982–2002) and other sources (we discuss them in details in the data section). We begin our empirical analysis by testing our model prediction that educational investment among EWI immigrants is a decreasing function of deportation probability. A number of recent papers show that increased enforcement actions leads poorer labor market outcomes among illegal immigrants (Amuedo-Dorantes and Bansak 2012; Bohn and Lofstrom 2013). We use a strategy similar to the one employed by Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2016). They show that increase in enforcement actions increases the probability that U.S. citizen children with illegal immigrant parents live in poverty. In another recent paper Dustmann et al. (2016) show that deportation probability may affect the consumption level of illegal immigrants. Our focus, on the other hand, is on how enforcement affects educational investment decisions. Our results show that one standard deviation (1.31 percentage points) increase in the deportation probability reduces the probability of investing in an academic degree by 3.02 percentage points. This is significant at 5% level of significance. Falsification tests show that deportation probability does not affect the educational investment among AL immigrants. Next we explore whether EWI (OS) immigrants invest less in education compared to AL immigrants. Our theoretical model suggests that this may or may not be true. OLS results show that EWI and OS immigrants invest less in education compared to AL immigrants. However, OLS results may be suspect because of unobservable differences among groups. Since NIS includes data on educational investment both before and after LPR for all groups, we can compare the educational investment decisions of the treatment groups (EWI or OS immigrants) to the control group (AL immigrants), both before and after the LPR status using a difference in difference estimation method. We implement pooled OLS, first difference (FD), and propensity score matching (PSM) difference in difference (DD) estimation. The DD regression results show that the EWI (OS) immigrants are 16.9 (6.98) percentage points less likely to invest in education in the pre-LPR period. Empirical results also show that legalization increases the probability of investment in education by 15.5 (8.47) percentage points for EWI (OS) immigrants. FD-DD and PSM-DD estimates produce similar results for EWI immigrants, but the results on OS immigrants are not conclusive. The rest of the paper is structured in the following way. Section 2 presents the theoretical model, Section 3 presents the data, Section 4 presents the empirical results and Section 5 concludes.",1
17.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,20 January 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9400-2,Testing the acculturation of the 1.5 generation in the United States: Is there a “critical” age of migration?,March 2019,Marina Gindelsky,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Greater numbers of immigrants have arrived in the U.S. as children in recent decades. The share of immigrants arriving as children (ages 1–18) has increased from 15% of all immigrants in the U.S. labor force in 1970 to 31% in 2010, making the adult outcomes of immigrant children an increasingly important topic for study. While many studies have examined the economic and educational outcomes of immigrants, their children, and grandchildren, there has been little focus on immigrants who arrived as children, i.e., the “1.5 generation” (1.5g). This study uses the Current Population Survey (CPS, 1994–2016) and a Mincerian regression (Mincer 1974) of earnings on human capital, labor force participation, and demographics to analyze the acculturation of the 1.5 generation in the United States and investigate the question: is there a critical age of migration, before which the 1.5g earns more than successive generations? Though many works examine economic outcomes of first generation immigrants, the 1.5 generation is different in specific ways that make a priori expectations of their labor market outcomes theoretically ambiguous and thus, of particular empirical interest. These immigrants are “tied movers”Footnote 1and are sufficiently distinct such that it is inappropriate to include them in analyses of native-born children (Oropesa and Landale 1997). On the one hand, they have the advantages of at least some acculturation and education in the host country (Friedberg 1992) like the second generation or the native-born. Indeed, if the first-generation immigrant parents are positively self-selected, their children may benefit from this selection.Footnote 2This selection may be on observable (e.g., education, occupation etc.) or unobservable traits (e.g., higher ability) such that as the first-generation accrues destination-specific human capital, their earnings rise steeply and they eventually catch-up with the native-born (Chiswick 1978, 1979). These parents may then transmit some ability to their children. Since transmission decreases with each subsequent generation as prior research has shown, on average the 1.5g is expected to have higher ability than generations that follow (3+g). On the other hand, the 1.5 g will have less destination-specific human capital (acculturation) than subsequent generations given a shorter duration in their destination country. Members arriving as teens or pre-teens may face more acculturation challenges than those arriving at younger ages. Thus, the level of acculturation is likely to decline with age at migration. When analyzing the earnings profile for immigrants to Canada, Schaafsma and Sweetman (2001) find that ease of acculturation is inversely related to age at migration and teen migrants earn less than those who came younger or older. Scandinavian longitudinal studies have also found causal effects of age at migration on socioeconomic outcomes (Aslund et al. 2009; Bohlmark 2009; Hermansen 2014). Therefore, earnings of the 1.5 g overall may be higher or lower than those of successive generations. Although the process of acculturation includes many difficult to identify facets, one observable aspect is language proficiency. Bleakley and Chin (2004) find a “critical period” of language acquisition. Children who arrive after age 9 from non-English speaking countries have lower levels of English proficiency. I find that the effect of acculturation extends beyond language proficiency. Similarly, studies examining impacts of age at arrival on educational attainment have found that while those who arrive at early ages acquire more education than the native-born, teen migrants acquire less than the natives (Chiswick and DebBurman 2004). Corak (2011) finds that those who arrive after age 9 are more likely to drop out of high school in Canada. As demonstrated by the aforementioned studies, acculturation has an important and economically significant impact on educational attainment. Empirically, I will be focusing on its impact on earnings for a given level of education, using CPS data, which will allow me to shed light on the intergenerational transmission of human capital specifically pertaining to the 1.5 generation and generations that follow. I test the hypothesis that there is a critical age of migration after which the earnings of the 1.5g are lower than the earnings of the 2g (second generation, defined as having at least one foreign-born parent) and 3+g (third and higher order generations). As age at migration (hereafter, “AAM”) increases and the level of acculturation declines, the earnings advantage of the 1.5g relative to subsequent generations is hypothesized to become an earnings disadvantage in the labor market. Results suggest there is an early AAM threshold after which the 1.5 generation has lower earnings than successive generations (9 for the 3+g and 5 for the 2 g). Immigrants arriving before these ages have higher earnings, while those arriving afterwards have lower earnings. This paper extends existing research on immigrant assimilation by specifically studying within-group differences by ethnicity and gender, showing them to be drivers of previously found full-sample results.Footnote 3This is an important step in documenting initial cross-sectional evidence on the socioeconomic drivers of acculturation as the variation in the results by gender and ethnicity is consistent with hypothesized differences in cultural dimensions which contribute to earnings differentials. The earnings advantage for 1.5g Hispanics over native-born Hispanics becomes a disadvantage at a much earlier AAM than for non-Hispanics. Factors which may influence this result include the lower level of selection of Hispanic migrants and higher likelihood of residence in an enclave than among successive generations which limits acculturation opportunities, as compared with migrants living in less concentrated areas. For females, the higher AAM threshold relative to males may reflect a greater ease of acculturation, both through higher English proficiency and cultural assimilation. It seems increased language ability among women facilitates acculturation, but more study is needed to isolate the mechanisms, particularly for Hispanics. Furthermore, a key contribution of this study is the demonstration that the vital role of early migration extends beyond increased language proficiency, shown to have a critical threshold (Bleakley and Chin 2008). As is evident from the results for English-speaking migrants, there is a significant acculturation component in addition to the effect of language proficiency. Identification of this critical threshold has important implications both for researchers studying the path of immigrant assimilation and for policymakers analyzing determinants of success rates for an increasing number of child migrants. Given the complexities of analyzing effects of human capital accumulation at early ages on adult earnings, this vital topic has been understudied. As opposition to immigration and proposed policy reform often hinges on a perceived failure of assimilation (Abramitzky and Boustan 2016), it is important to understand the precise relationship between age at migration and acculturation. Results demonstrate the impact of the acculturation process on future earnings and particularly which ages may most benefit from programs designed to facilitate assimilation. This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 outlines a conceptual framework for studying the effects of the acculturation of the 1.5 generation on earnings. Section 3 presents the data and model and Section 4 discusses the results of the regression analysis. Section 5 discusses alternative specifications and additional considerations. Section 6 concludes.",5

17.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,29 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9380-2,Changes in parental leave and young children’s non-cognitive skills,March 2019,Katrin Huber,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Cunha and Heckman (2007) point out that investments into early childhood skill formation are extremely important for a child’s future development because toddlers’ and youngsters’ skills underlie a self-reinforcing mechanism and are complementary to later skill formation. Psychological research (e.g. Erikson 1980) also has been coming to the conclusion that a child’s first year of life shapes future behavior and development. As parental leave regulations may influence the time and resources parents devote to their child they contribute to forming early child development in the light of these findings. Quasi-experimental evidence on parental leave and children’s long-run outcomes (e.g. Dustmann and Schönberg 2011; Carneiro et al. 2015; Liu and Skans 2010; Danzer and Lavy 2017) suggests that it is beneficial for the child if parental leave regulations incentivize mothers to stay at home in the early phase after birth but induce them to return to the labor market thereafter. Studies evaluating short-run effects on child development, however, remain scarce. Even though some of the short-run effects might persist and turn into long-run effects, it is extremely important that policy-makers know about the nature and the extent of these early childhood effects: according to Cunha and Heckman (2007), policy interventions to enhance child development are more effective the earlier they step in. Politicians can only choose appropriate designs for such early interventions if they know exactly how family policies affect children already in their first years of life. The only two papers (Baker and Milligan 2010, 2015) that focus on the effects of parental leave on different dimensions of child development for children aged younger than five provide evidence from Canada.Footnote 1 In 2000, benefit duration augmented from 6 to 12 months in Canada and significantly increased the amount of first-year maternal care. The authors do not find any notable average effects on 0–3-year-olds and a very modest negative effect on cognitive skills of 4–5-year-olds. I provide complementary evidence from Europe and exploit a unique setting to investigate a reduction in the duration of paid parental leave while all existing studies focus on extensions in benefit duration. To this end, this study exploits the parental leave reform in Germany in 2007 as a natural experiment and determines the causal effect of parental leave on the development of toddlers and young children. The reform, on the one hand, reduced benefit duration for already eligible families but, on the other hand, changed eligibility criteria and thus largely increased the group of eligible parents. Moreover, benefit amounts are no longer fixed and means-tested but relate to parents’ pre-birth earnings. Consequently, this reform created both winners—mainly among wealthier families—and losers—predominantly among lower-income households. The German Socio-Economic-Panel (SOEP) provides me with a battery of proxies for children’s development and non-cognitive skills. To determine the expected gain or loss in benefits due to the reform I match this data with wide-ranging and accurate information on households and on parents’ characteristics. The empirical strategy uses a classical Difference-in-Differences design and exploits that the changes in parental leave regulations did not affect children born before January 1st 2007, but all children born thereafter. On the one hand, the findings suggest that a reduction of benefits results in significant adverse effects on newborns’ socio-emotional development. On the other hand, this difference between winners and losers vanishes at the age of 2–3 years for most dimensions of child development. There is only suggestive evidence that an increase in benefits makes 2–3-year-olds better off in terms of skills, especially language skills, if compared to children from loser-families. To rule out a violation of the common trend assumption and selection effects, I run several robustness checks to validate these findings. First, I exclude December and January births to test whether selection of women with due dates very close to the cutoff drives my results. Second, I reduce the time frame around the date of implementation to avoid long-run selection through planned births. I, third, change the control cohorts, fourth, introduce a placebo-outcome and fifth, estimate a Placebo-Diff-in-Diff in the pre-treatment year. To avoid measurement error when I determine winners and losers I, sixth, exclude parents who are just on the edge of being a winner or a loser. The results are robust to these manipulations. Nevertheless, this paper has beyond dispute some limitations: First, due to the low number of observations in my dataset the statistical power is low and some estimates are therefore jumpy between specifications. Consequently, I cannot put too much emphasis on the size of the effects. Second, the Placebo-Diff-in-Diff estimates turn significant for three of nine well-being indexes of the 2–3-years-olds which excludes these indexes from interpretation. Third, the outcome variables are reported by parents and are thus at least to a certain extent subjectively measured. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 summarizes the potential channels through which parental leave can affect children’s development. Section 3 briefly describes the institutional setting. Section 4 introduces the identification strategy, Section 5 describes the data. Section 6 shows the main results and provides robustness checks. Section 7 discusses the results and Section 8 concludes.",3
17.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,08 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9376-y,Parenting skills and early childhood development: production function estimates from longitudinal data,March 2019,Jade Marcus Jenkins,Sudhanshu Handa,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Cognitive achievement in early childhood is strongly associated with a range of welfare outcomes in later life. In the U.S., test scores as early as 2 years of age are associated with later educational attainment as well as adult wages (Feinstein 2003; Case and Paxson 2006). Moreover, a related literature establishes that the gap in cognitive achievement between children of low and high socioeconomic status appears very early in life (Grissmer and Eiseman 2008; Bradley and Corwyn 2002; Reardon 2011; Carneiro et al. 2005; Heckman 2011), prior to school-entry, as early as age one.Footnote 1 Ample explanation for the strong relationship between early development and later life outcomes comes from neurobiology, developmental psychology, and physiology research. At birth, the brain is dependent upon interactions, experiences, and environmental stimulation for healthy development (Als et al. 2004; Dawson et al. 2000; Greenough et al. 1987; Lupien et al. 2000), and is extremely responsive to experiences during the first two years of life (Levitt 2008; Singer 1995; Fox et al. 2010; Knudsen 2004). Thus, experience-based development that occurs very early sets pathways for future learning that affect skills and well-being for life. To address this very early gap in cognitive achievement, human capital interventions during early childhood are essential. Numerous scholars have illustrated the long-term individual, societal, and economic benefits of investing resources in early childhood development programs (Reynolds et al. 2010; Belfield et al. 2006; Bartik 2011; Campbell et al. 2012; Duncan and Magnuson 2013; Heckman and Mosso 2014). Most notably, Heckman and colleagues provide empirical evidence on the returns from early childhood interventions (Cunha and Heckman 2007; Heckman 2006; Cunha et al. 2010). They demonstrate that investments during early life affect a child’s skills and abilities at later stages, and that the skills produced at earlier stages raise the productivity and potential of later investment. This body of research undergirds the recent investment growth in early childhood policy; federal spending in the U.S. and UK reached $19.6 and £5.6 billion respectively in 2011 (Isaacs et al. 2012; Stewart 2013). This includes age-4 prekindergarten programs, which have been shown to improve children’s school readiness and academic success (Duncan and Magnuson 2013; Gormley et al. 2008; Wong et al. 2008). However, very young children spend a majority of their time in the home during the first 5 years of life. As such, other policy interventions work with parents to improve the home environment by teaching parenting skills or connecting parents with community resources (Brooks-Gunn and Markham 2005; Gomby et al. 1999; Love et al. 2005). For example, home visitation is a core component of Early Head Start, a federally funded program in the U.S. targeting mothers during pregnancy through children’s 2nd year of life. Surprising then, is the dearth of evidence on the exact familial inputs that are important for a child’s early cognitive development. Motivated by the importance of early life experiences on later outcomes, this article estimates the production function for early childhood development using rich longitudinal data and a unique input—the quality of the parent–child interaction. The nature and quality of this interaction is a more direct measure of the production technology that is typically proxied by education or income. And unlike fixed characteristics such as intelligence and education, parental sensitivity and engagement with their child is a manipulable behavior that is amenable to policy intervention. Most of the published work in economics estimates the education production function (EPF) on data from school-aged children and focuses on school inputs such as class size, peer effects, and teacher characteristics (Rivkin et al. 2005; Hanushek et al. 2003; Angrist and Lavy 1999). These inputs explain very little variation in test scores; by school-age, children are already locked into their development trajectory. For younger children, the child development production function (CDPF) literature investigates the effects of family inputs and home environment on child outcomes, and may also include child care (Todd and Wolpin 2003). Todd and Wolpin’s (2007) CDPF study established that parent education and labor market skill measures account for nearly half of racial test score gaps, consistent with studies linking parent socioeconomic status to child well-being (Bradley and Corwyn 2002; Currie 2009). Central to the innovation of our study is the fact that parent’s education can affect children’s development through several avenues: purchased goods, time spent, or the efficiency or ‘technology’ of their time spent with children. For example, more educated parents and those who are higher earners spend more time interacting with their children (Guryan et al. 2008), as do parents who put their child in preschool (Baker and Milligan 2013; Gelber and Isen 2013). Bjorkland and Salvanes review the economic literature in this area and estimate that only 20% of the variation in children’s years of schooling comes from parent’s education (2011). Decades of research from psychology and cognitive science provide a promising insight; this literature shows that specific qualities of a parent’s interaction with their child, particularly parenting skills such as engagement and sensitivity, have a direct impact on children’s development (Brooks-Gunn et al. 2002; Blair et al. 2008; Hackman et al. 2010), and can buffer the effects of poverty on development (Gershoff et al. 2007; Burchinal et al. 1997). This article provides detailed estimates of the production function for early childhood development, extending the existing research on EPFs in many directions. First, ours is the first study to present estimates of the early childhood development production function which includes detailed information on familial inputs of time, goods, and parenting for current and prior periods between birth and age 5 using rich data from a large and representative sample of U.S. children. Inclusion of historic inputs is important because child development is cumulative and the timing of inputs is critical where some periods of early life are more sensitive than others. This builds upon the work of Todd and Wolpin (2007) who estimate the EPF for children of school age (6–13 years). We also add to the work of Heckman and colleagues in their study of early skill formation. Their studies often use data collected in 1979 where the first measurement of children is ages 6 and 7 that provide valuable information on the skill formation process, but cannot capture the nuances of parental investment in very early childhood as we do here, and with data that more closely reflects the current population (i.e., children born in 2001). Second, we augment the standard economic inputs of ‘time’ and ‘goods’ with an observer-rated measure of the parent–child interaction derived from the child development literature, which, as we show below, provides new and unique information in the CDPF. Moreover, this input is ‘manipulable’ and can be addressed through policy intervention. Third, because we have four waves of data, we can provide estimates of alternative, commonly used specifications of the EPF such as the popular ‘value-added model’ and examine whether the lagged dependent variable is a sufficient statistic for the history of inputs during early childhood. We identify four key take-home messages. First, the application of inputs such as parenting and reading books as early as 9 months of age predict reading cognition at age 5. Second, the parent–child interaction is an important input in the development process and one that is particularly amenable to policy. Third, the lagged dependent variable used in value-added modeling does well in capturing the history of home inputs and endowments. The fourth and most important message is that due to the cumulative nature of child development, the most efficient time to intervene is at very young ages, as young as 9 months. Not only do inputs at this period have lasting associations with future cognition, but the likelihood of locking into a development trajectory is greater at 5 years relative to even 12 months earlier. This may suggest that policies like prekindergarten may be too late to provide the most effective human capital interventions in development.",3
17.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,24 August 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9385-x,Single-mother families and the gender gap in children’s time investment and non-cognitive skills,March 2019,Letizia Mencarini,Silvia Pasqua,Agnese Romiti,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Over the last 40 years, the separation and divorce rates in OECD countries have greatly increased. The divorce rate among OECD countries almost doubled between 1970 and 2012. In 1970, there were 1.1 divorces per 1000 marriages, and in 2012, the rate was 1.9 (OECD 2014). Consequently, an increasing number of children live with a single parent, mainly with a single mother. Several studies have shown that this living arrangement has negative consequences for parental investment in children and, ultimately, for children’s behavioral and educational outcomes (Hetherington 1989; Haveman and Wolfe 1995; Hetherington et al. 1998; Ermisch and Francesconi 2001a; Carneiro and Heckman 2003). As a parallel development, over the last several decades, in terms of school outcomes and college enrollment, an increase in the gender gap in favor of girls has also emerged. Starting in the mid-1980s, girls have begun to surpass boys in college enrollment across the U.S., and more recently, a similar trend has been observed across most OECD countries (OECD 2012). Moreover, girls often perform better at school than boys. According to the results of the PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) study, boys obtain worse test scores than girls in 70 percent of the 74 countries evaluated (Stoet and Geary 2015), although there are some differences in the results among the three fields (reading, mathematics and science) included in the tests.Footnote 1 In addition to the gender gap in cognitive skills, boys underperform girls in different measures of non-cognitive skills, such as behavioral problems, approaches to learning, self-control and discipline (Jacob 2002). Boys are also more likely than girls to have attention and behavioral difficulties or hyperactivity disorders (Szatmari et al. 1989). Indeed, a few studies have attributed this gender gap in educational outcomes to differences in non-cognitive skills (Jacob 2002; Goldin et al. 2006; Becker et al. 2010). In turn, children’s non-cognitive skills have been shown to be strongly affected by parental time investment (Carneiro and Heckman 2003; Cunha and Heckman 2007) and are thus dependent on family structure and background. Different family structures may result in different parental investments, with consequences for both non-cognitive and cognitive skills and for the amount of the child’s time devoted to studying. The observed reversal in the gender gap in education and in the growth of employment and real wages of high school graduates across the U.S. has consistently been hypothesized as being linked to the rising share of single-parent households (Autor and Wasserman 2013). Furthermore, previous studies have shown that boys are more affected than girls by family problems, poor family backgrounds and bad social environments (Amato 2001; Jacob 2002; Bertrand and Pan 2013). The aim of this paper is to contribute to the literature by evaluating how family structure differently affects the time that boys and girls devote to studying and the effort that they put into studying. Despite some evidence regarding non-cognitive skills, to date, no study has analyzed whether boys and girls react differently to family structure in terms of their overall investment in studying. Thus, this paper adds evidence to the different effect that family structure may have across gender, focusing on the child’s investment in human capital accumulation outside of school. Our aim is to analyze one of the potential mechanisms that explain the widening gender gap in educational outcomes in favor of girls. We use Italian data and examine the time that the child invests in reading, studying and doing homework, as reported in the 2008 Italian “Time Use Survey”. In addition, we replicate the analysis, using as an alternative outcome a self-reported measure of non-cognitive skill, the child’s study effort provided by the 2008 Italian Multipurpose Survey on “Aspects of Daily Life”. We relate a child’s time and study effort to the type of family in which the child lives, i.e., whether he/she lives with both parents or with a single mother. We also focus on the different effect of family type across gender. After reporting evidence that single-mother families—compared to families in which both parents are present—provide fewer parental inputs to children, regardless of their gender, we analyze whether boys react differently than girls with less time invested in studying or with a poor effort. Unfortunately, no dataset for Italy provides information on both the time and effort exerted in studying by children and the school results. However, following Cunha and Heckman (2006) and Del Boca et al. (2017), our variables can be interpreted as inputs in the child’s skill production function, producing both skills for the immediate period and ultimately the stock of human capital as an adult.Footnote 2 In fact, Duckworth and Seligman (2005) show that self-discipline in studying predicts the academic performance of eighth-grade students to a greater extent than IQ. This paper focuses on Italy for two reasons. First, the percentage of children below the age of 18 living in families with only one parent has steadily increased since the beginning of the century, following the increasing trend in the number of divorced or separated families, which doubled between 1995 and 2009. Only a trivial proportion of children live with only one parent because of reasons other than the voluntary dissolution of the union (i.e., because of a parent’s death or because the father did not recognize the child or lives separately from the birthplace of the childFootnote 3). In 2010, the absolute number of minors involved in separations and divorces in Italy was over 65,000; most of these children were living in a single-mother family (ISTAT 2012). In 2008, approximately 10 percent of all children were living in a single-parent family. This percentage was similar for other Southern European countries, such as Greece and Spain. However, it was much lower than in the U.K. and the U.S., where in the same year, more than 20 percent of minors were living with a single parent (OECD 2011). Second, Italy, similar to many other developed countries, has experienced a gender gap in educational outcomes in favor of females. According to the 2012 PISA test scores, 15-year-old girls performed better than their male peers. Such a gender gap is also confirmed by the marks obtained in the eighth-grade final school exam. There, girls scored a high markFootnote 4 in 45% of cases, and boys scored a high mark in 29% of cases (ISTAT data warehouseFootnote 5). Simultaneously, in Italy, as in most OECD countries, beginning in the 1990s, the gender gap in university enrollment has reversed in favor of girls, reaching a female/male college enrolment ratio of 1.3 in 2013 (ISTAT data warehouse). Since the focus of our paper is on the differential effect of family type between boys and girls, in our empirical analysis, we use a difference-in-differences (DD) specification comparing children’s outcomes in single- vs. two-parent families for boys compared to girls. In addition, we allow the effect of all regressors to vary across gender. In our case, a major threat to the identification is the selection by gender into different family types (single-mother vs. two-parent) if this is correlated with unobservable factors that are also correlated with children’s outcomes. We attempt to address this issue by checking the random assignment of gender to family type. In particular, we regress a dummy variable for being a single mother on a dummy variable for boy and on child’s age. We find no evidence of a correlation between gender and having a single mother or between gender and other family characteristics, such as parental education, being a single child, or family economic conditions. Our results show that living in single-mother families has a significantly greater (negative) effect for boys than for girls on the time invested in studying, reading and doing homework. Similar gender differences are found for the outcome of study effort. The increase in the gender gap (boy–girl) due to living with a single mother is stronger for older boys, boys with lower educated or less well-off mothers, or boys with working mothers. These results cannot be explained by the differences in the observed parental inputs between boys and girls because they both receive equally less parental time if they live with a single mother compared to those living with two parents. Therefore, we argue that our results may indicate that boys are more affected than girls by lower parental inputs. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant literature. Section 3 presents the datasets, and Section 4 describes the empirical strategy. Section 5 shows the descriptive statistics for the gender difference in the children’s outcomes and the gender differences in the parental inputs received by children living in single-mother and two-parent families. Section 6 discusses our main results. Our conclusions follow in Section 7.",11

However, domestic violence appears to be more severe in developing countries. In Mexico, surveys indicate that at least one third of women report being in a violent relationship with a spouse, boyfriend, or partner (INSP 2009; Eternod Aramburu 2013). Besides the physical and socioeconomic impacts,Footnote 1 domestic violence can affect the mental health of the victim and lead to depression, low self-esteem, low self-reported happiness, and suicidal behavior (INEGI 2013; Diette et al. 2016). In fact, studies have reported a positive association between domestic violence and suicidal behavior (e.g., INEGI 2005; Stevenson and Wolfers 2006). This may not be surprising given that suicide rates have been shown to co-move with measures of well-being (Di Tella et al. 2003; Castillo-Manzano and Arankowsky-Sandoval 2008). Studies have shown that public policy can alter violent behavior. Stevenson and Wolfers (2006) find that states in the US which facilitated the divorce process saw declines in the number of women murdered by their partners, as well as in female suicide and domestic violence for both men and women. Stevenson and Wolfers show that the change is mediated through improved intra-household bargaining power for the unhappy spouse. These findings are in line with traditional economic theories of the family, which generally predict that both physical and emotional violence may be reduced by improving women’s bargaining power through safety net programs such as conditional cash transfers, or legal reforms (e.g., Brassiolo 2016). More recent studies have shown that policies that are intended to improve a woman’s outside opportunities but also challenge traditional roles can exacerbate conflict within the household. For example, Angelucci (2009) concludes that changes in a wife’s income brought by Mexico’s conditional cash transfer program Oportunidades led to reductions in physical abuse when the amount of the cash transfer was small, but that large cash transfers were associated with an increase in aggressive behavior by husbands with traditional gender role views. On the other hand, Bobonis et al. (2013) found that beneficiaries of Oportunidades were less likely to be victims of physical abuse, but more likely to be victims of violent threats without physical abuse. In a separate study, Anderson and Genicot (2015) found that improved female property rights in India increased suicide rates for men and women, which occurred due to increased conflict between the victim and the perpetrator. All of these studies point out that further research is needed to understand the various mechanisms and unintended consequences of such policies (Bowlus and Seitz 2006). This paper contributes to this literature by examining the impact of the following three policies that address domestic violence in various institutional settings in Mexico: A Penal Code Reform that explicitly defined and criminalized domestic violence in a state’s criminal code (the Penal Code Reform); A Civil Code Reform (also referred to as the Divorce Law) that added domestic violence as grounds for divorce in a state’s code of civil procedures; and The Law of Access, Assistance and Prevention against Intra-Family Violence (the Assist Law) which established procedures for government entities to provide assistance programs to prevent domestic violence. Using the heterogeneity in the adoption of these policies across time and states I find that only one of the policies—the one that for the first time criminalized domestic violence in a state’s criminal code—is associated with a decrease in female suicide rates. The estimated effect of the Penal Code Reform represents a 22–34% decrease in female suicide rates, which is more than double the effect of adopting unilateral divorce laws in the United States reported by Stevenson and Wolfers (2006). Data from a nationally representative survey of partner violence against women allow me to investigate a possible mechanism and suggest that the effects are channeled through reduction in violence against women. The findings of an effect on the Penal Code Reform are consistent with Anderson and Genicot’s (2015) model, which predicts a decrease in female suicide rates associated with policies that decrease conflict during the intra-household bargaining process. This paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief background of the policies studied in the context of the Mexican legislature. The economic framework is discussed in Section 3, followed by the Methodology and Data (Section 4). The results and robustness checks are presented in Section 5, which leads to a discussion and conclusion (Section 6).",17

Given its importance as a potential means of poverty alleviation, researchers have investigated methods to enhance women’s empowerment. Microeconomists consider women’s bargaining position within the household as key to determining women’s empowerment. Women with more outside options have a higher reservation utility and thus, relatively more bargaining power within the household (the Nash bargaining model: for example, Manser and Brown 1980; McElroy and Horney 1981). A typical outside option is based on employment opportunities for women because it is easier for women with a lucrative job to make a living without their husbands. The amount of immovable assets (e.g., land and houses) that women possess, either via inheritance or purchase, is also important because securing a place to stay is indispensable when leaving their husbands (Panda and Agarwal 2005). Outside options may also be broadened by the ease of divorce without spousal consent (Friedberg 1998; Wolfers 2006) and favorable marriage-market situations (e.g., Becker 1991; Chiappori et al. 2002). In the context of South Asian countries, where divorce is very rare and women usually do not work outside the home or have access to immovable assets in reality, the aforementioned outside options are irrelevant in most cases. While the outside options are usually interpreted in terms of opportunities when the current marriage dissolves (Manser and Brown 1980; McElroy and Horney 1981), they do not necessarily require divorce. Theoretically, a non-cooperative equilibrium can be an outside option (Lundberg and Pollak 1993). Without divorce, women may go back to their natal families. In this case, the level of support that these families can offer is important, as measured by the strength of women’s bonds with their natal families and the assets owned by the natal families. Furthermore, the status of working women is not particularly high in South Asian countries. There is no consensus on the relationship between women’s employment and their status within the household, but several studies indicate that women’s employment opportunities and wages do not affect their bargaining position within the household in India, unlike the possession of immovable assets such as land and house (e.g., Sen 1999; Panda and Agarwal 2005). In particular, the northern states of India are well known for women’s lower status in every aspect, such as inheritance rights, sex ratio, fertility, and gender gap in education and mortality (Dyson and Moore 1983; Jejeebhoy and Sathar 2001). In northern India, traditional factors such as the number of sons to whom a woman gives birth and the amount of dowry that they bring at the time of marriage are believed to positively affect women’s empowerment (Jejeebhoy 2000). This study examines the above hypothesis suggested by Jejeebhoy (2000). The focus is on the relationship between dowry and women’s status in the marital household. In particular, we investigate the difference between the environments where women have no inheritance rights and where they have equal inheritance rights as their brothers. We exploit a natural experimental situation in India that generated such environmental differences across states, namely, the amendment of the Hindu Succession Act of 1956 in five states, from 1976 to 1994. The amendment assures equal inheritance rights for daughters and sons with respect to joint family property. The empirical results reveal that the amount of dowry is positively associated with women’s empowerment when women have no inheritance rights. Although the focus of this study is the relationship between women’s status and dowry, we also examine the relationship between women’s status and bride price. Bride price is paid by the groom’s side at the time of marriage, and often coexists with dowry in the same marriage, in many cultures (Zhang and Chan 1999; Anderson 2007; Maitra 2007; Makino 2015). In comparison with dowry, few studies look at how bride price is related to women’s status within the household. If bride price is offered to the bride’s parents, it may decrease her bargaining position within the marital household because she may be under pressure not to go back to her natal family (Ashraf et al. 2015). In contrast, if bride price is offered to the bride, the fact that it becomes her property may enhance her bargaining position, or may decrease it by obliging her to perform more household production such as providing eldercare to her parents-in-law (Grossbard 2017). In reality, bride price seems to be offered to both the bride and her parents, and which party gets to keep its majority share seems to vary across regions and families (Anderson 2007). Our empirical results show that in most cases, the relationship between women’s status and bride price is the opposite to that of dowry. The closest to this study may be those by Zhang and Chan (1999) and Brown (2009), which test the Nash bargaining model with the amount of dowry as an outside option, using datasets for Taiwan and China, respectively. Using the same theoretical framework, this study tests whether dowry enhances women’s welfare in the context of India where, traditionally, women had no inheritance rights. While the study by Jejeebhoy (2000) demonstrates that dowry enhances women’s decision-making power in a northern state (i.e., Uttar Pradesh) but not in a southern state (i.e., Tamil Nadu), it does not investigate which factor generates such regional differences. By explicitly examining the relationship between women’s empowerment and the legal provision of inheritance rights, this study fills the gap. The results also suggest that the argument that dowry represents a pre-mortem inheritance (Tambiah 1973; Botticini and Siow 2003) is also applicable in modern India. The results have several important policy implications. They suggest that the universal ban on dowry does not necessarily achieve its intended policy consequences, such as the welfare improvement and empowerment of women. Rather, dowry may function as the only measure to protect women in situations where women have no inheritance rights in reality. Thus, parents may be willing to pay the highest dowry possible at the time of their daughter’s marriage, with the expectation of her better treatment in the marital household. This may be one of the reasons for the well-known ineffectiveness of India’s Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961. The results simultaneously suggest that the legal provision of equal inheritance rights for daughters and sons, regardless of whether equal inheritance is actually realized, may be effective if the policymakers’ aim is to end the practice of dowry. This is because parents would not have any incentive to give dowry to their daughter if it does not affect their daughter’s status in the marital household. Legal provisions can be one of the many factors that generate dissociation between dowry and a daughter’s status. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the background, namely, the practice of dowry and the amendment of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Section 3 describes the dataset used in this empirical study. Section 4 presents the estimation strategy. Section 5 provides the empirical results. Section 6 presents the conclusions.",3

It culminates with the formation of an independent household, possibly with a partner, and usually implies moving out of the parental home. From an economic point of view, the time at which such residential shift occurs is relevant at both individual, household and aggregate levels. When an individual separates from his/her parents, the child’s and parents’ budget constraints split, influencing the future choices of both. Parents are, at least partially, freed from the obligation of providing housing and financial support, while the child must find a new shelter and rely on alternative sources of income: a job, a partner’s income, or both. From an aggregate point of view, a late exit might have important demographic and economic implications. For instance, as long as living on one’s own is considered a desirable precondition for having children, a delayed nest leaving might translate into lower fertility rates. Also, as long as young adults can rely on their parents’ financial support, they might choose not to work, causing a loss in the country’s aggregate productivity. Finally, the combination of a delay in the labor force entry and of lower fertility rates (if not compensated by legal immigration) might generate, at some point, issues about the sustainability of a country’s pension system. In Italy, the exit from the family of origin occurs relatively late. At the age of 30, almost 30% of men and 21% of women are still reported to live with their parents, compared to only 9 and 5%, respectively, in the United States. The delay is found to be more severe among men and younger generations. Several papers study the determinants of young adults living arrangements. A great amount of literature focuses on the role of parental resources (Avery et al. 1992; le Blanc and Wolff 2006). But the family of origin could influence the timing of home exit through other channels as well. For instance, Fogli (2004) finds that the family of origin may act as an insurance mechanism against unemployment or credit market imperfections, while Stella (2016) finds that the increase in childrens nest-leaving, observed around the time of paternal retirement, does not appear to be fully justified by changes in parental resources and suggests that channels involving the supply of informal child care provided by grandparents or the quality of the home should be explored. The role of the housing market is explored by Ermisch and Di Salvo (1997) who look at the impact of the price of housing on both the timing and destination of first departure. Haurin et al. (1993) suggest that the impact of the housing cost may be different depending on the level of wages and on labor market conditions available to young individuals. Modena and Rondinelli (2011) find similar results with Italian data. The Italian case is also studied by Manacorda and Moretti (2001, 2005) who focus on the role of parental income and labor market regulations in the residential choices within a bargaining framework of parents vs. children. More recently, Billari and Tabellini (2010) explore to what extent the late transition to adulthood contributed to the disappointing performance of the Italian economy of recent years. Taking the opposite point of view, Ahn and Sánchez-Marcos (2017) focus, instead, on the effect of the Spanish recession of 2009–2013 on the emancipation rate of young adults. Several researchers have looked at the role of cultural differences and social norms. Giuliano (2006) looks at second-generation European immigrants to the US. She finds that their living arrangements mimic those in the countries of origin; and that the changes in the US over time by country of origin mimic the European changes; the duplication of the European pattern in a neutral environment, suggests a major role for culture in determining living arrangements. Alesina and Giuliano (2007) confirm a significant influence of the strength of family ties on economic outcomes by looking at a larger number of countries. More recently, Aparicio-Fenoll and Oppedisano (2016) find that peer effects among siblings do have a role in the decision of leaving the parental home and that imitation is more likely to prevail among close-in-age siblings. Relatively few papers model the residential choice together with other choices that typically describe the transition to adulthood, namely the entrance in the labor market and marriage. Relevant exceptions exist. McElroy (1985) is the first to model the joint determination of household membership and work supply with parents and children interacting in a game and choosing the family resources allocation according to a Nash criterion function. Later, Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1993, 1994) consider the choice of co-residence as the outcome of a game between parents and children under the assumption that parents care for their children (and make transfers to them) but, at the same time, suffer from a ‘privacy cost’ that is increasing in time. This work is more closely related to this branch of research. For an excellent survey on dynamic discrete choice model refer to Eckstein and Wolpin (1989). This paper proposes a dynamic stochastic discrete choice model in which the young adults choose their residential arrangement simultaneously with labor supply and marital status. Since the school/work choice is not included, only individuals homogeneous in terms of educational attainments and investment in human capital are selected. The residential choice also responds to the external environment. Labor market conditions (unemployment rates, wage levels, etc.), labor market regulations (e.g. unemployment benefits access rules), and housing market conditions are modeled explicitly. In particular, the labor market regulations refer to the qualification requirements for unemployment benefits (UB). These may influence the choice of forming a separate household because, a risk averse young worker who does not qualify for UB payments might postpone the exit from the parental home and wait for a better job. This effect could be significant when finding another job requires a lot of time or when the value of parental transfers is high, or both. Other aspects, such as the quality of the institutions or cultural norms, are indirectly taken into account estimating the model on separate subsamples considered to be homogeneous in terms of those qualitative aspects. Finally, the role of social interaction is modeled by assuming that agents tend to conform to their peers’ behaviors. In particular, agents interact with each other in a non-cooperative game in which they tend to conform to the prevailing social norm on the age at first marriage. Every agent is therefore influenced by the expected behavior of the other agents. In this framework, the strategic interaction is not between parents and children but rather between the young adults and their peers. The model is structurally estimated on a subset of high-school male graduates with the Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) using the Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) of the Bank of Italy. The estimated model is then used to perform a variety of counterfactual experiments to explore the role of labor market conditions, parental resources, housing market conditions, and social interaction on the observed patterns of residential, employment and marriage choices. It is also discussed which policies could be more effective in anticipating the exit from the family of origin. This work contributes to the existing literature with a structural model that can account for most of the described mechanisms within a unique framework. It allows residential, working and marriage choices to be made simultaneously and in a dynamic setting. The structural estimation allows to assess the efficacy on the home leaving choice of alternative economic policies and the relative importance of parental resources, labor market conditions and other environmental characteristics. Finally, although estimated for Italy, the setting can be easily applied to other countries. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, I provide some evidence from the data on the late transition to adulthood in Italy compared to other countries. Section 3 presents the model and the solution technique. The estimation method and the results are discussed in Sections 4 and 5. The last section concludes.",7

Despite several contributions over the past decade in a number of fields, which have found robust correlations using data from different countries, it is still not entirely clear whether such a positive association is the result of a causal relationship between income and health. There are good reasons to believe that a causal effect between income and health exists. Higher income families may have better access to care as well as more opportunities to purchase care; whereas people with lower income may be confronted with more stressful situations, which are detrimental to health. This study tests whether the well-established health gradient exists once the endogeneity of income is accounted for by using expansions in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the mid-1990s as a source of exogenous income variation. I find that higher EITC payments lead to significant improvements in self-assessed health, while changes in food expenditures and insurance coverage are shown to be likely mechanisms underlying the relationship between income and health. By using data from the Panel Data of Income Dynamics (PSID) for the years 1990–2003, this study exploits the expansion of the EITC, which was part of OBRA 1993, to test for the relationship between income and health outcomes of heads of households. This approach can eliminate or significantly reduce the omitted variable bias due to shocks correlated with income and give estimates for treatment effects of receiving a boost in income on health of treated individuals. Findings for the relationship between income and health in this setting add to previous work on the gradient and provide evidence for a causal effect of income on health. Additionally, the later part of the study tests for the role of food expenditures and health insurance as potential mechanisms underlying the link between income and health. Several recent studies on the EITC have examine whether the program is able to improve health outcomes of children (Baughman and Duchovny 2016; Averett and Wang 2016), infants (Hoynes et al. 2015), mothers (Evans and Garthwaite 2014), and low-income adults (Larrimore 2011). This study joins this small group of papers and adds to them by making five contributions. First, the use of a longitudinal data set and individual fixed effects models can improve the identification strategy by accounting for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity, potential changes in the sample composition, and measurement error in self-assessed health. Since it is possible that there are systematic differences between families with one child and two or more children that change over time, accounting for individual un-observables can reduce the potential bias of the results. Given that the EITC provides incentives for low-income individuals to enter the labor force, the use of longitudinal data helps account for differences in the composition of sample before and after an expansion of the program. Additionally, potential measurement errors can be reduced since each individual’s health is only compared to their own prior assessment, which takes into account that respondents might have their own scales in ranking their health (reference bias). To my knowledge, only one previous paper uses longitudinal data to analyze the relationship between the EITC and health (Averett and Wang 2016). Second, I use a tax simulator program to obtain predicted EITC payments and to examine health changes among a sample of individuals eligible to receive EITC benefits. Previous studies testing for health effects of the EITC have focused on low-educated individuals, a group most likely affected by changes to the program. Examining health changes among low-educated samples provides intent-to-treat estimates for the effects of the policy change. Given that take-up rates for the EITC have been shown to be between, 80 and 87% (IRS 2002; Scholz 1994), I believe that my analysis is able to provide estimates that are closer to treatment effects on the treated. These can provide evidence for whether income in general has causal effects on health. It should be noted that my study assumes full take-up rates of the EITC and therefore the estimated effects will underestimate the true effects on treated individuals. Overall, the findings from this study complement the great work previously conducted on the relationship between the EITC and health, while specifically addressing the relationship between income and health. Third, the study uses the imputed simulated EITC amounts which respondents are eligible to receive in order to further examine the link between income and health in more detail. Specifically, I test whether the expansion had different health impacts for individuals falling in different parts of the EITC schedule (phase-in, plateau, and phase-out range). Previous work has established that individuals in the plateau part receive close to pure income effect (Athreya et al. 2010; Gunter 2013), while those in the phase-in part have been found to work more on the extensive margin (Eissa and Liebman 1996; Eissa et al. 2008; Meyer 2010). Thus, testing for different health effects across the three parts of the schedule can provide evidence whether cash transfer programs have different effects depending on if they are conditional on earned income. Additionally, I test whether health effects differ for individuals who experienced relatively large increases in EITC compared to those who experienced smaller increases, which can provide additional evidence for the effects of income on health. Fourth, this study contributes to the remaining uncertainty regarding the mechanisms through which income can affect health outcomes by investigating the role of two potential channels. To my knowledge, this is the first study that examines the role of changes in food expenditures as a potential channel through which higher EITC benefits might affect health. Given that there is a close link between income and food insecurity, additional income in the hands of vulnerable groups of the population could affect their levels of food security. Furthermore, similar to work by Baughman (2005) and Hoynes et al. (2015), this study tests for the role of changes in health insurance coverage following an expansion of the EITC. Fifth, besides estimating DD models, I test for the robustness of the findings by additionally estimating several other specifications. These include: (1) a DDD model that accounts for the fact that other events at the time could impact health outcomes of individuals in the sample; (2) a semi-parametric DD model which loosens some assumptions about a linear relationship between income and health; (3) a model that only includes individuals who are eligible to receive EITC benefits prior to the policy change; (4) a model that includes all individual below certain income thresholds, irrespective of eligibility; (5) a falsification test that compares health changes of two groups that were equally affected by the expansion, (6) three different specifications that test for the presence of reverse causality. This study finds that increases in income following the expansion of the EITC leads to improvements in self-reported health status among heads of household affected by the policy change. Affected individuals are 6.9 to 8.9 percentage points more likely to report excellent or very good health status following the policy change. The positive health effects are robust to variations in both sample selection and methodology and become larger when the policy change is allowed to have a 1-year adjustment period after its implementation. The analysis shows that health benefits were largest for people in the plateau phase of the EITC, which provides further evidence that the health improvements are the result of increases in income. When examining potential mechanisms underlying the link between income and health, this paper provides evidence that increases in food expenditures and take-up rates of insurance can explain the observed health improvements. Specifically, I find that affected household increase their food expenditures by 10.5 to 20.3% and are 1.52% more likely to have health insurance coverage",36
17.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,09 November 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-018-9439-8,National identity among economic and non-economic immigrants,June 2019,Stuart Campbell,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"National identity binds together heterogeneous groups of individuals within and across national borders. Governments have actively cultivated unified national identities within their own territories, in the belief that these collective affiliations foster social cohesion (Berry 1974; Uberoi and McLean 2007). The existing empirical evidence on pro-social behaviour and redistributive preferences is broadly supportive of this belief: people do seem to be more generous and cooperative towards those with whom they share a common identity (Bernhard et al. 2006; Chen and Li 2009; Costa i Font and Cowell 2015). In an age of rising tension over international migration, a key question for policy-makers in immigrant-receiving countries is therefore whether the foreign-born retain the identity of their origin country, or come to adopt the identity of their hosts. Public concern over these matters is high (Kellner 2007; Kiss and Park 2014). There is a literature in economics which responds to this concern, much of which has been guided by Akerlof and Kranton’s (2000) contribution on the economics of identity (Casey and Dustmann 2010; Constant et al. 2009; Constant and Zimmermann 2008; Dustmann 1996; Georgiadis and Manning 2013; Manning and Roy 2010; Masella 2013). One of the key insights driving this work is that adopting a new national identity involves social and psychological costs and benefits. The costs arise from abandoning the previous identity and adapting to new behavioural reference points in the host country, while the benefits are associated with increasing prospects for social integration. As with other country-specific investments, the relative weight of these costs and benefits must partly be determined by the length of time that an immigrant intends to stay in the host country. The expected gains from adopting the host national identity should be greatest for those who intend to stay permanently, but lower for those with uncertain time horizons, and lower still for those who intend to return to the home country after a short period of time. Time horizons are partially embedded in the original motive for migration. For example, refugees often expect to stay longer than those in other immigrant groups, since safety concerns reduce the possibility of return to the home country. Family immigrants are also likely to envision a longer stay than others on average, since co-ordinated relocation of partners and children is costly, both on arrival in the host country and for any proposed departure. In contrast, economic and student immigrants often have the option or the explicit intent to return to their home country more quickly. Although we cannot observe these average differences in time horizons directly, existing empirical work does suggest that family immigrants are less prone to out-migration than others (Bijwaard 2010; Home Office 2014), and that patterns of human capital investment and earnings assimilation among refugees are also consistent with a longer intended stay (Borjas 1982; Cortes 2004; Khan 1997). My innovation is to introduce these implicit differences in time horizons to the analysis of immigrant national identity. Given a longer expected length of stay, refugees and family immigrants have the most to gain from adopting the host national identity, while economic and student immigrants have the least. Although it is well established that time horizons are important for the economic assimilation of immigrants, the question of whether immigrant national identity may also be responsive to the expected length of stay has so far remained unanswered. This is an important omission, since immigrant national identity matters both for the wellbeing of immigrants themselves (Akerlof and Kranton 2000, suggest that the choice of identity may be “…the most important ‘economic’ decision people make”) as well as for the acceptance of immigrants in the host population (Manning and Roy 2010). I examine how uptake of the host national identity varies between economic, student, family, and refugee immigrants. I use a unique survey measure to distinguish between these groups, and construct a multinational sample of over 76,000 immigrants in a large and diverse immigrant-receiving country. The data I use come from the UK, but the principle should apply more generally: other things equal, longer time horizons in the host country increase the expected gains from adoption of the host national identity. Non-economic immigrants are now a substantial proportion of the foreign-born population in many immigrant-receiving countries. Several host countries saw a shift away from economic migration and towards family reunification over the second half of the twentieth century (Ferrie and Hatton 2015). Large exporters of higher education such as the UK and the USA have also seen a rising proportion of immigrants arrive as students and stay on to work after completing their studies (Bratsberg 1995). Moreover, from the early 2010s onwards, several countries have offered asylum to unprecedented numbers of refugees, particularly those fleeing conflict in North Africa and the Middle East. For Europe, this culminated in a ‘refugee crisis’ in the summer and autumn of 2015. The question of how non-economic immigrants adjust to life in the host country has rarely been more important for government policy or for human welfare. My primary finding is that refugees and family immigrants are substantially more likely to report the host national identity than economic or student immigrants. A large part of this elevated tendency is explained by differences in observed demographic and human capital characteristics, but even after accounting for such differences, family immigrants and refugees remain around 13 and 8% more likely to report a host national identity respectively. These two groups still remain more likely to report the host national identity when restricting the analysis to immigrants without citizenship, to those with only weak incentives to acquire citizenship, or to those from origin countries without linguistic or cultural connections to the UK via the British Commonwealth.",3
17.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,23 June 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-018-9421-5,Occupational segregation by sexual orientation in the U.S.: exploring its economic effects on same-sex couples,June 2019,Coral del Río,Olga Alonso-Villar,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In recent years, increasing empirical research has been done on same-sex households, mainly based on U.S. data, which explores whether patterns observed in these households—in particular, the ones involving the labor market—are the same as those found in the literature for different-sex couples. Thus, Oreffice (2011) reveals that intra-household bargaining power affects the labor supply decisions made in homosexual couples, which is already known for heterosexuals. As for household specialization (i.e., whether a partner is more devoted to the labor market than the other is), Giddings et al. (2014) and Jepsen and Jepsen (2015) show that all types of households, whether heterosexual or homosexual, have certain levels of specialization, although this is more intense for the former. Their results are in line with previous studies that suggest a more egalitarian distribution of household work in same-sex households (Solomon et al. 2005) and those that show the existence of fewer differences between same-sex partners in terms of labor participation (Leppel 2009). The literature also shows that sexual orientation affects the labor supply (Tebaldi and Elmslie 2006), with men (women) in same-sex couples working fewer (more) hours than men (women) in different-sex couples do. The myth of gay affluence has also been debated in the economics literature, at least since the publication of Lee Badgett’s (2001) book “Money, Myths, and Change: The Economic Lives of Lesbians and Gay Men,” where the author refutes the widespread belief that homosexuals enjoy an advantageous position in U.S. society. The portrait of a gay population with fewer family responsibilities, more hedonic attitudes, and in a well-to-do situation, mainly associated with a privileged position in the labor market, has created social narratives that include both the alleged existence of a “pink mafia,” consisting of gay men in economic and political centers of power helping one another, and a “queer conspicuous consumer” whom various industries/business want to attract. Along with these stories, others have also been built from experiences of legal and/or social discrimination that the homosexual population has faced in areas as diverse as health care, education, welfare protection, the work setting, or economic benefits linked to marriage, among others (Badgett 2007; Carpenter 2007a, b). Different studies show that lesbian women and gay men in the U.S. have higher educational achievements than heterosexuals. Given that the position of a group in the labor market is certainly not independent of its educational attainments, gay people are expected to achieve a good economic position. However, if occupational segregation exists—in our case, by sexual orientation and gender—higher educational achievements may not necessarily go hand-in-hand with higher wages, as occupations requiring common educational levels may pay differently. In fact, occupations are a mechanism that generates social stratification and inequality (Mouw and Kalleberg 2010). In particular, evidence exists that occupational segregation explains a large part of the gender pay gap (Petersen and Morgan 1995; Cotter et al. 1997; Blau and Kahn 2017), despite the higher educational achievements of women compared with men. However, although segregation by gender—and the consequences it has on women’s economic position—has been extensively studied in the literature,Footnote 1 segregation by sexual orientation remains almost unexplored. As Tilcsik et al. (2015, p. 2) point out, “the occupational segregation of gay and lesbian workers—‘one of the largest, but least studied minority groups in the workforce’ (Ragins 2004:35)—presents an unresolved puzzle for researchers.” A few studies document high concentrations of homosexuals in certain occupations, although the reasons behind these concentrations are not easy to determine because many factors seem to be involved (Badgett and King 1997; Baumle et al. 2009). Some scholars argue that gay people may perceive some occupations as more suitable—perhaps because they are more tolerant than others are (Badgett and King 1997; Plug et al. 2014)—or because they entail higher levels of task independence (Tilcsik et al. 2015). A larger representation of this group in some occupations could arise from a stronger discrimination in others or to avoid major penalties in the case of disclosure.Footnote 2 The aim of this paper is to explore the occupational sorting of lesbian women, gay men, straight women, and straight men in couples so as to answer four questions: (1) Do same-sex partnered workers have a more (less) uneven distribution across occupations compared with different-sex partnered workers; (2) Do occupations in which same-sex partnered workers are overrepresented pay less than those in which they are underrepresented?; (3) Does the occupational sorting of these groups play an important role in the economic positions they have?; and (4) Do the answers to the last two questions change when accounting for differences in basic characteristics among the four groups? For undertaking the analysis, this paper uses the 2010–2014 5-year sample of the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), which is drawn from the American Community Survey (Ruggles et al. 2015). This survey includes occupation, using a detailed classification that accounts for more than 450 occupational titles, and provides a wide range of economic and demographic information regarding individuals and households. Although this large survey does not offer information about individuals’ sexual orientations, it does allow for identifying individuals in same-sex couples. More than 53,000 of such workers are in the sample, which is a higher number than that provided by alternative datasets with more information about sexual orientation. To answer the above questions, we use novel tools that have been recently put forward in the literature. Thus, the indices proposed by Alonso-Villar and del Río (2010) allow us to calculate the segregation level of a group in a multigroup context without making pairwise comparisons. The strategy we follow to quantify a group’s occupational segregation is to compare its occupational sorting with the occupational structure of the benchmark economy. This benchmark could be total employment in the economy but also the employment of individuals living with a partner. This paper explores both scenarios. With these measures we quantify the segregation levels of lesbian women and gay men, which remained unknown. To appraise the occupational sorting of each target group, we use the tools developed by Del Río and Alonso-Villar (2015) and Alonso-Villar and Del Río (2017a). These measures take into account the relative pay of the occupations that a group tends to fill or, on the contrary, not to fill—that relative pay being the average wage of the occupation divided by the average wage of the economy. These measures allow for not only assessing the occupational sorting of each group—both in monetary terms and in terms of (objective) well-being—but also quantifying the extent to which occupational sorting explains a large part of the earnings of each group. Finally, to calculate the wage advantage/disadvantage of each group while controlling for the basic characteristics of the groups, such as education, age, racial/ethnic composition, and immigration profile, we built counterfactual distributions following DiNardo et al. (1996) and Gradín (2013). As in Antecol et al. (2008), our analysis shows that the educational achievements of gay men and lesbian women help with understanding the positions of these two groups in the labor market. However, unlike this study, we find that the occupational sorting of the four groups plays an important role in explaining the earnings of workers in same-sex couples once we control for characteristics. In fact, the sorting negatively affects gay men and, especially, lesbian women compared with straight men who have “similar” attributes. Our approach departs from the one followed in earlier studies in various ways. First, this paper analyzes the four groups using a common reference, the average wage of the benchmark economy, rather than comparing lesbian women and gay men only with their respective straight counterparts. In other words, it places the emphasis on the interaction between sexual orientation and gender, as the combination of the two characteristics provides a unique position for each group in the labor market. Second, our approach allows focusing the lens on occupations, distinguishing among more than 450 titles, which is unusual in analyses aimed at exploring the role of occupational sorting in explaining the wage gap. Note that carrying out the popular Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition with a fine occupational classification would be difficult because the regression analysis would require considering a dummy for each occupational title. A fine classification would also be problematic when one builds counterfactuals that involve making gay people with certain characteristics, who are quite small groups, sort into these occupational titles similarly to their straight counterparts (which may explain why Antecol et al. 2008 use a broad classification that accounts for only 21 occupations). By using a fine classification and a suitable methodology in which occupations are the core of the analysis, we offer a more precise estimate of the role played by occupational sorting in explaining the earnings differences among the groups. Third, this paper quantifies the fraction of the earning advantage (disadvantage) that each gender-sexual orientation group faces due to its occupational sorting, which had not been quantified so far. Forth, to determine the contribution of each factor in explaining the changes between each group’s initial situation and its situation in the counterfactual analysis (i.e., after controlling for characteristics), we use the Shapley decomposition (Sastre and Trannoy 2002; Shorrocks 2013; Gradín 2013). This decomposition does not depend on the order in which the attributes of the groups are included in the analysis, which is also a novelty compared with what is usually done in the wage gap literature.",10

While redistribution can help insure individuals against risks, relax credit constraints, and reduce the variance in lifetime incomes (Benabou 2000), it may likewise distort individuals labor-leisure choices (Kleven and Schultz 2014) and human capital investment decisions, as the rate of return is reduced (Bovenberg and Jacobs 2005; Jacobs and Yang 2016). Assuming that, in democratic societies, the actual realized scope of redistributive politics largely reflects individuals’ redistributive preferences, e.g., aggregated through collective choice mechanisms (Borck 2007), understanding the determinants of these preferences is deemed important. Empirically, income inequality has—besides other factorsFootnote 1—regularly been proven to be a significant predictor of individuals’ redistributive preferences (see, e.g., Ravallion and Lokshin 2000; Fong 2001; Acemoglu and Robinson 2005; Alesina and Fuchs-Schuendeln 2007; Rainer and Siedler 2008; Yamamura 2012). However, empirical studies on this topic often use household income as a measure of income (Couprie 2007; Grabka et al. 2015), which neglects that income inequality may also exist within households, e.g., between partners. Using data of cohabiting individuals from the German Socio-Economic Panel, the goal of this paper is to empirically analyze the relationship between income inequality and individual preferences for public redistribution, placing special emphasis on the role of intra-household income inequality. Under the assumption of self-interest, economists traditionally model individuals’ preferences for public income redistribution as being defined by their position in their society’s income distribution and, thus, income inequality (Romer 1975; Meltzer and Richard 1981). With public redistribution from the rich to the poor by means of a progressive income tax, one would expect individuals who earn a comparatively low pre-tax income to favor such redistribution, since they are more likely to benefit from it and less likely to pay for it. Conversely, relatively richer individuals within a society should oppose income redistribution (Alesina and La Ferrara 2005). Since, based on Meltzer and Richard’s (1981) theory, individuals first draw their income and then build their preference for redistribution, the actual (earned) income, i.e., income pre-taxes and pre-transfers, should be used to estimate the determinants of individuals’ redistributive preferences (Milanovic 2010). Furthermore, we argue that household income, which is often used in empirical studies on that topic, does not adequately reflect the income inequality faced by individuals. Instead, individual income, on the one hand, and income inequality within households, on the other hand, should be used, for several reasons. First, and most generally, by using the income of individuals, not the income of their households, we take into consideration the fact that individuals are independent decision makers who have separate finances, utility functions, and, thus, preferences (Grossbard 2011, 2015). This standpoint places this paper on the individualistic—the nonunitary—side within household economics.Footnote 2 Second, additionally accounting for differences in earned incomes within households is important. Although applying the household income may be reasonable for single people, a large fraction of individuals does not live in single households but in multi-person households. In Germany—the country under focus in the present paper—this applied to more than 80% of the population in 2013 (German Federal Statistical Office 2017). For such households, using the household income implicitly assumes that there is no income inequality within households (Couprie 2007). However, this is typically not the case, as incomes within households have been found to be considerably unequally distributed. Lise and Seitz (2011) and Haddad and Kanbur (1990), for example, find for the UK and the Philippines, respectively, that total income inequality is underestimated by approximately 30–50% when only measuring income inequality between, but not within, households. Third, it is particularly relevant to account for differences in earned incomes among spouses as the cohabitational status either may or may not change their eligibility for some forms of public assistance. This, in turn, should affect utility maximization of individuals’ preferences for governmental income redistribution. In Germany, eligibility for some transfer payments, e.g., specific unemployment benefits, are based on the income of the household economic community of need, i.e., on the assets of the claimant’s partner, if either he or she is in a committed marriage-like partnership (Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs 2015). Put differently, if the richer partner’s income is sufficiently large, the poorer partner may not be entitled to redistribution through either specific public funds or benefits. Given the assumption that an individual should favor public redistribution if either he or she can gain from it, we may expect the non-entitled individuals to oppose public redistribution. Fourth, just as individuals decide on the extent of redistribution they prefer within society, they may also do the same within their own household. Living together with the partner, for example, opens up the possibility for redistribution among spouses (henceforth “private redistribution”); typically from the richer to the poorer partner.Footnote 3 If private redistribution is considered to be more advantageous than is public redistribution, the former may be regarded as a (partial) substitute for the latter.Footnote 4 Nevertheless, it may make a difference whether redistributed money comes from the pool of all tax payers or from one’s own partner, given that, while private redistribution will end when cohabitation ends, public redistribution will remain. The end of cohabitation is an ever-present risk, be it from the end of a relationship or the death of one’s partner. Individual preferences for public and private redistribution, therefore, likely also depend on individuals’ expectations about their (financial) well-being at this “threat point”. Our paper differs from the existing empirical literature in several ways regarding the determinants of preferences for public income redistribution. Using data of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) on cohabiting individuals, we explicitly account both for earned individual, but not household, income and for the earned income inequality within households. We can also assess whether individuals are either the poorer or the richer partner within the household and whether they are actually relatively either poor or rich within the society. To be precise, we determine who is either the poorer or the richer partner in the household on the basis of their earned income, i.e., their income before taxes and public or private transfers. Moreover, we calculate the potential earned income of cohabiting individuals, that is, their outside option, if cohabitation ends. We do so by using the earned incomes of the non-cohabiting individuals in our dataset to estimate the determinants of their labor market wages using a Mincer earnings equation. This, in turn, is then applied to the characteristics of the cohabiting individuals. The results of our empirical analysis suggest that not only one’s own earned income but also earned intra-household income inequality and one’s wage potential at the threat point are significantly negatively related to preferences for public redistribution. Moreover, being the poorer (richer) partner makes one more likely to oppose (prefer) public redistribution, with these effects being more pronounced the larger the differences in earned incomes between the partners. The larger the earned income inequality between partners the more likely it is that the richer partner will redistribute resources to the poorer partner intra-household. Then, the poorer partner’s opposition to public redistribution could be an expression either that he or she is less in need of it or that it is less beneficial than is private redistribution. The fact that the richer partners in households with very unequal earned incomes prefer public redistribution could be due to the more beneficial taxation of such kinds of cohabitations in Germany, implying that more public redistribution by means of higher taxation would hit these richer partners less severely. The present paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and 3, we present our data and the empirical strategy. In Section 4, we illustrate our econometric results, i.e., we comment on the effect of being either the poorer or the richer partner in more or less unequal households with respect to one’s preferences for public income redistribution. In Section 5, we conclude.",6

The cooperation of individuals has been widely analyzed in different fields. The analysis of cooperation by experimental science has a reference milestone in Nowak and May (1992), who developed the Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) to prove the survival of the cooperative agent in a network, and since then different versions of the PD have been used to analyze cooperative behaviors. Public Good games, in which individuals secretly choose how many of their private tokens to put into a public pot, have also been used to analyze the cooperative behavior of individuals, finding that individuals contribute more to the Public Good than expected, with observed cooperation declining over time (see, for a survey, Chaudhuri 2011). Among the mechanisms that may help to explain cooperation among individuals, Becker (1962, 1974) established the generosity criterion guiding cooperation or transfer of resources from donor to recipient, with this approach contrasting with alternative hypotheses (Cox 1987), under which donors expect some sort of reciprocity from the receivers in a cooperative context. Furthermore, family relationships (or family ties) may also help to explain cooperation among individuals, so that those who share genes have a cooperative behavior motivated by generosity. This reasoning has been mathematically formalized through Hamilton’s rule (Hamilton 1964), according to which cooperation between two individuals will take place if the benefit obtained, corrected by the kinship relationship between these individuals, exceeds the cost of giving or helping. This concept has been tried and tested empirically in the literature (West et al. 2011; Oli 2003; Peters et al. 2004; Waibel et al. 2011). Prior research has specifically analyzed how cooperative behavior changes with age and/or across generations; for example, experimental research has shown that younger children are less altruistic (Peters et al. 2004; Fehr et al. 2008; Fehr et al. 2011). Charness and Villeval (2009) and Gutiérrez-Roig et al. (2014) have included subjects of different ages who were involved in the same experimental set-up, to test cooperativeness differences across generations, with their main findings being that the elderly are more cooperative. In both studies, individuals of different ages play within the same generation, and while the repeated PD has been used extensively in experiments with adults (Blake et al. 2015), PD experiments with children remain rare, with some few exceptions that include Blake et al. (2015) and Molina et al. (2013). Prior research has also analyzed cooperation in families.Footnote 1 A trust game played by couples and strangers is shown in Görges (2015), finding that women are more likely to cooperate (e.g., give up their income autonomy and perform the unpaid task) when playing with a partner rather than with an unfamiliar man. Beblo and Beninger (2017) test in-couple income pooling in Germany, and find that income pooling, and thus cooperation, is more common among couples in which the spouses’ socio-economic characteristics are more similar. Cochard et al. (2017) test for a willingness to cooperate and share income by men and women who are either in couple with each other or complete strangers, finding that lack of preferences for joint income maximization, having children, and being married lead to higher defection rates in the social dilemma. Dauphin et al. (2017) test the collective rationality (e.g., consumption efficiency) within households in Burkina Faso, using monogamous and polygamous households. They find that while the collective rationality within monogamous households is not rejected, it is rejected in polygamous households. Consumption efficiency is based on Pareto efficiency, where the individuals within the household cooperate, and thus this evidence serves as evidence that households are not as cooperative as previously hypothesized. The issues of family, age/generation, and cooperation have all been studied by Peters et al. (2004), Reynolds (2015) and Porter and Adams (2016). Peters et al. (2004) place parents and children in a laboratory to participate in a Public Good game, where subjects are endowed with an initial income and must choose how to allocate that income between private and group accounts. The study finds that parents may behave more altruistically than do their children in a family setting, and that parents and children contribute more to a Public Good when grouped with family members than when grouped with strangers. Reynolds (2015) applies two games to test for Pareto efficiency and bargaining in a sample of adolescent women who live with their mothers in Brazil, and the results confirm a cooperative relationship. Porter and Adams (2016) study the motivations behind transfers between two generations (adult children and their parents) in an experimental setting, with results indicating that a greater proclivity for giving appears when parents, rather than strangers, are the recipients of transfers while playing a series of dictator games. Against this background, we contribute to the literature on the factors affecting the cooperative behavior of individuals, by focusing on the relationship between family ties, age/generation, and cooperation. In particular, we focus on how family ties are related to cooperation, and also on whether older generations cooperate more than younger ones. To that end, in an experimental setting, three generations of individuals from the same family (youth, parent, and grandparent) play a repeated Public Good game in three different treatments: one in which three members of the same family play each other (family), a second with the youth and two non-family members, but preserving the previous generational structure (intergenerational), and a third in which three randomly-selected individuals play each other (random). Several conclusions can be drawn from our experiment. We find that the level of cooperation of the youths is significantly lower than that of the parents and the grandparents, consistent with prior literature showing that young people are less cooperative (Peters et al. 2004; Charness and Villeval 2009; Gutiérrez-Roig et al. 2014). Furthermore, in comparison with a setting where players are randomly assigned to a group, family ties have a positive relationship to the contributions to the Public Good, with this effect being greater for the youths than for the parents and the grandparents. Also, youths and parents contribute more to the Public Good when the group has a generational structure, while grandparents are not affected in this behavior. This evidence indicates that the behavior of parents and grandparents is not greatly affected by the treatment, while youths contribute significantly less when not playing with their own family members. Finally, the differences in the contribution by youths, on the one hand, and parents and grandparents, on the other, are larger when playing with randomly-assigned players. The results shown are interesting, and represent an important contribution to the literature. Despite that we cannot know the mechanisms behind the differential behavior of youths in comparison to parents and grandparents, we can hypothesize several possible explanations: an age effect (i.e., older individuals may have more income, increasing their level of generosity), a cohort effect (i.e., individuals become less generous towards strangers) or a selection effect (i.e., those who become parents are more generous). Furthermore, family ties may have a positive effect on the cooperation of individuals, which may serve as a mechanism to stabilize cooperation in different settings. The evidence presented here opens interesting lines of research. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the inter-generational Public Good game. Section 3 presents the lab-in-the-field results. Section 4 shows the empirical strategy and the estimation of results, and Section 5 sets out our main conclusions.",7

The effect of childcare on grandparents’ depression,June 2019,Giorgio Brunello,Lorenzo Rocco,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In most families, parents and children are engaged in an intense and continuous informal exchange, made of transfers and reciprocal help. Parents often support their children either financially or with transfers in kind, even when the latter are grown up. According to a recent report by the Pew Research CenterFootnote 1, in Italy and Germany 60 and 48 percent of parents provide financial support to their adult children; 58 and 44 percent help with errands or house repairs, and 71 and 58 percent are involved in child care. These percentages are similar or only slightly lower in the US. Childcare is one of the most common services supplied by grandparents. Grand-parenting is valuable both individually and socially, because it makes up for the often insufficient supply of kindergartens and formal childcare and because it allows mothers to participate more intensively to the labor market, with important economic benefits.Footnote 2 But does child caring benefit grandparents as well? On the positive side, care can be rewarding and a source of higher satisfaction, and lead to more physical exercise and mental activity, which improve grandparents’ health (see Silverstein et al. 2003; Coall and Hertwig 2011; Powdthavee 2011). On the negative side, caring means also responsibility and stress, which may harm grandparents’ health and lead to depression, and also reduces leisure and alternative uses of time (see Minkler 1999). The balance of positive and negative effects is not clear a priori. The early literature in this area has focused on the grandparents who are primary caregivers of their grandchildren. Research based on nationally representative U.S. data, such as the Health and Retirement Study, has found that grand-parenting is associated to poorer health, lack of privacy and leisure time, a heightened risk of isolation, and depression (Baker and Silverstein 2008). Clearly, providing care on a supplementary rather than on a primary basis is likely to have smaller negative or perhaps even positive effects on grandparents’ health. In a study that examines both primary and supplementary grandparent childcare, Hughes et al. (2007), have found that grandmothers raising children in skipped-generation households, where parents were absent, had higher rates of depression, whereas grandmothers providing supplementary care were in better health (see the discussion in Arpino and Bordone 2014). In this paper, we estimate the causal effects of regular and occasional grandchild care on the depression of grandmothers and grandfathers, using data from the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), a representative survey of European individuals aged 50+.Footnote 3 Depression is the second leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the burden of suicide and ischemic heart disease (Ferrari et al. 2013). It is a syndrome characterized by the presence of specific symptoms, including anxiety, insomnia, fatigue and a number of psychosomatic disorders, that can be triggered by biological, psychological and socio-economic factors, such as negative life events, stress and high psychological strain (high psychologic demands and low decision authority) (Mausner-Dorsch and Eaton 2000). We are not the first to use SHARE data to address a similar question. Di Gessa et al. (2016), for instance, use these data to explore the association between the care of grandchildren and the health of grandparents, and find that caring grandparents experience some health benefits, independently of the intensity of care. This positive association, however, could simply reflect the fact that grandparents in better health are more likely to be engaged in childcare. Since the allocation of grandparents to childcare is unlikely to be random, but depends instead both on individual characteristics and on perceived mental health, the identification of causal effects requires a source of exogenous variation in the provision of childcare. Recently, a few studies have tried to address the endogenous selection of grandparents into childcare using an instrumental variables (IV) strategy. Arpino and Bordone (2014), for instance, look at the effect of childcare on grandparents’ cognitive functioning and find that providing childcare has a positive effect only on one of the four cognitive tests considered, verbal fluency. Their selected instrument is the availability of grandchildren, under the assumption that children do not take the provision of grandchild care by their parents into account when making fertility choices. On the one hand, it is questionable whether this assumption is tenable. On the other hand, the availability of grandchildren could affect grandparents’ welfare independently of whether they engage in childcare or not. Ku et al. (2012), use Taiwanese data and show that caregivers have better self-rated health, fewer mobility limitations and fewer depressive symptoms compared to non-caregivers. Their analysis relies for identification on two instruments: the number of grandchildren and marital status of adult children. However, one wonders whether these variables affect grandparents’ health only by influencing their engagement in childcare activities. Finally, Reinkowski (2013), estimates the effects of childcare on grandparents’ health in the European countries participating to SHARE, using the gender of the firstborn child as instrument for the provision of childcare. She finds that childcare has no statistically significant effect on both physical and mental health. However, since the gender of the oldest child may affect the quality of social interactions between grandparents and children independently of whether the former provide childcare, it seems difficult to defend the key exclusion restriction. In this paper, we propose to identify the causal effect of childcare on grandparents’ depression using both the variation induced by the distance (in months) of the interview from the onset of the (wave-specific) survey fieldwork, that we show to be distributed as good as random, and the fact—documented below—that childcare declines with the age of grandchildren. We show that grandparents with the same observable characteristics and with grandchildren born in the same date are less involved in childcare if they are interviewed later, when their grandchildren are marginally older. A few additional months can impact significantly on grandchildren’s age and their demand for childcare—both because alternative services for very young children are not widespread in many European countries,Footnote 4 and because younger children are often ill and unable to attend nurseries or kindergartens compared to older children—but have negligible effects on grandparents’ age and on age-related mental conditions. In support of instrument validity, we show that the date of the interview depends on the way interviewers organize their fieldwork rather than on the characteristics of respondents. We also run falsification tests by estimating the effect of being interviewed later on the probability of being depressed for comparable seniors who do not provide childcare, either because they do not have grandchildren or because their grandchildren are grown up and do not require care, or finally because their grandchildren reside far away. In no case do we find evidence that the date of the interview significantly predicts depression, dispelling concerns that the instrument influences depression independently of childcare. Our IV estimates identify a local average treatment effect (LATE). They show that childcare has a positive and statistically significant effect on the depression of compliers, defined as the grandparents who respond to a marginal increase in their grandchildren’s age with a reduction in the hours of childcare. The estimated effect is sizeable: we find that ten additional hours of childcare per monthFootnote 5 increase the probability that complying grandmothers and grandfathers develop depressive symptoms by 3.2 to 3.3 and by 5.4 to 6.1 percentage points respectively. We stress that compliers differ from the average grandparent. First, they provide childcare with a much higher intensity than the typical grandparent and use a sizeable proportion of their time to look after their grandchildren. Second, they have higher than median (country-specific) household income and few children. Their relatively high value of time suggests that they are ready to reduce childcare as soon as their grandchildren become older and more independent. Compliers are also more likely to live in Southern and Eastern Europe (Italy, Spain and Poland), where activity rates are lower and the intensity of informal childcare is higher than in Central and Northern Europe. There is evidence that a division of roles in the household that assigns childcare mainly to mothers and grandmothers is more widespread in Southern and Eastern Europe, suggesting that grandmothers in these countries are more used than grandfathers to care for other family members, and therefore less likely to be emotionally affected by grand-parenting. Our findings suggest that the negative effects of childcare on the mental health of complying grandparents more than offset the potential benefits, and that males suffer significantly more than females.Footnote 6 To further investigate these effects, we decompose depression into two main factors, called in the literature affective suffering—which includes depression, tearfulness, wishing death, lack of sleep, guilt, irritability and fatigue - and lack of motivation, which includes pessimism, lack of enjoyment, interest and concentration, and find that childcare affects both factors for grandfathers but only lack of motivation for grandmothers. The importance of healthy ageing cannot be understated for the rapidly ageing populations of Europe and especially Southern Europe. The costs of healthcare are likely to be unsustainable if life in good health does not increase at the same pace as life expectancy. Preventing depression in the senior population should be a key concern, because depression is a risk factor for other diseases and a leading contributor to disability.Footnote 7 Our results indicate that, since grandparents who provide intensive childcare are at risk of depression, they would benefit from policies that favor the expansion of formal childcare, parental care and alternative forms of informal care. The European Council at the Barcelona Summit in 2002 established that at least 90 percent of the children aged between 3 years and the mandatory school age, and at least 33 percent of the children aged less than three should have access to formal childcare provision. With some delay, steps in this direction have been made by most countries. In order to spread more evenly the burden of childcare across parents, grandparents and other carers, the length and flexibility of parental leave should be enhanced. In Scandinavian countries, both parents are allowed to take paid parental leave for rather long periods and until their children are aged 8 or 9 (in many other countries parental leave is allowed but unpaid). Liquidity constrained parents, who might have little alternative other than asking grandparents to look after their children, might turn to private childcare centers or child minders if they were assigned child allowances of the type paid in the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. In some Swedish municipalities, parents who stay home purposefully to look after their young children receive a significant cash transfer (Glaser et al. 2013). Conversely, policies that favor grandparental care, such as subsidized early retirement, paid leave to provide grandchildren care,Footnote 8 or the right granted to parents to receive a reimbursement of childcare costs even if childcare is provided by grandparents, as established by the Childcare Act enacted in 2005 in the Netherlands, should be re-evaluated by considering the negative impact of childcare on grandparents’ mental health. The paper is organized as follows. We introduce the data in Section 1, describe our empirical strategy in Section 2 and present our main results in Section 3. Instrument validity and robustness checks are discussed in Section 4. Conclusions follow.",21

Why do individuals marry, or live together as married? From an economic point of view, both married and unmarried couples living together are modes of partnership that can have the goal of joint production and joint consumption in order to maximize the welfare of the individuals involved. Becker (1973) was one of the first researchers to focus on the gains of marriage versus remaining single. Following his work, an extensive body of theoretical and empirical literature explores the phenomenon from other perspectives, especially considering intra-household bargaining (Andaluz et al. 2017; Chiappori et al. 2002; Grossbard-Shechtman 1993; Lundberg and Pollak 1996). Very recently, Browning et al. (2014) review in detail the reasons why “two are better than one”, which include the sharing of public goods, the division of labor to exploit comparative advantage and increasing returns to scale, extending credit and coordination of investment activities, risk pooling, and coordinating child care. There are other factors to be found in the literature, such as the improvement in the health status of the individuals living together as married or unmarried couples (Perelli-Harris et al. 2017; Waite 1995), the impact on health-care (Marcén and Molina 2012; Pylypchuk and Kirby 2017; Simeonova 2013), and the benefits of children living with their parents versus those living with a single mother, in terms, for example, of poverty and education (Mencarini et al. 2017; Waite 1995). The exploration of the determinants of the living-together decision has not lost its importance in the literature. Stevenson and Wolfers (2007) review the changes and the driving forces of marriage, divorce, and cohabitation, suggesting that the characteristics of individuals, such as their race, gender, and their educational level, appear to be related to the choice of marital status, in addition to outside-of-marriage options, social norms/culture, and legal factors that can affect the bargaining power in determining household arrangements (Angrist 2002; Browning et al. 2014; Chiappori et al. 2002; Grossbard-Shechtman 1993; Negrusa and Oreffice 2010). Economic conditions (Ahituv and Lerman 2011; Bellido and Marcén 2018; González-Val and Marcén 2017, 2018), family laws (González-Val and Marcén 2012a, 2012b, 2017; Bellido and Marcén 2018; Stevenson and Wolfers 2007), parenthood (Bellido et al. 2016; Steele et al. 2005) and welfare reforms (Bitler et al. 2004) all appear to affect the transitions into and out of marriage. We add to this literature by exploring empirically whether culture is a factor in the decision to live together (as a married or unmarried couple). The importance of culture is a pertinent question for many researchers, but it is not easy to measure. Culture is normally defined as a set of beliefs and preferences that varies across space, time, and social groups (Fernández 2007). Similarly, culture is described by UNESCO (2001) as the set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of society or a social group. Not only does this encompass art and literature, but it also includes lifestyles, ways of living together, value systems, traditions, and beliefs. This definition is interesting for our work, since it suggests that ways of living are part of the culture or social norms of a society. Individuals form their own attitudes based on what their parents instill in them, but their preferences and beliefs may be influenced by the role models within their communities (Furtado et al. 2013). Those who remain without a partner as single or divorced can be ostracized in some countries, because that life-style is different from the one(s) established by the prevailing social norms (Furtado et al. 2013; Kalmijn and Groenou 2005; Kalmijn and Uunk 2007). Then, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that, if an individual does not want to be ostracized, they will follow the social norms (or culture) and will decide to live with a partner, pointing to the culture as a potential factor in the way-of-life decision. Additionally, social norms may affect the way in which individuals search for a matching partner. In a theoretical framework, Ishida (2003) suggests that social norms may force individuals to commit more cost to the search process. Culture can also be important in the intra-household bargaining in labor and leisure supply (Datta Gupta and Stratton 2010; Oreffice 2014). To analyze the cultural effect on the decision to live together (as married or unmarried couples), we follow the epidemiological approach (Fernández 2007) by exploring the behavior of immigrants who arrived in the US at or before the age of 5, and whose ethnicity or country of origin is known. In order to capture the effect of culture, we exploit the variation in the proportion of individuals living with a partner (as married or unmarried couples) by country of origin. As the epidemiological approach establishes, since immigrant attitudes are probably similar to the preferences and beliefs of their parents, forbears, and ethnic communities, differences in the proportion of individuals living with a partner (married or unmarried) by home country can be interpreted as evidence of the existence of a cultural effect. Our work contributes to the literature on the effect of culture on socio-economic and demographic variables, which is becoming more and more common (Fernández 2011; Giuliano 2016). Related to our research are those studies that examine the impact of culture on living arrangements (Giuliano 2007), and divorce (Furtado et al. 2013). Giuliano (2007) finds that individuals originating from countries whose counterparts leave the nest later in life are more likely to delay the decision to live without their parents. Furtado et al. (2013) show a positive relationship between the home-country divorce rates and the probability that the immigrants from those countries report being divorced. Utilizing methodologies quite analogous to ours, there are several papers showing the role of culture in women’s labor force participation and fertility (Bellido et al. 2016; Contreras and Plaza 2010; Fernández 2007; Fernández and Fogli 2006; Fernández and Fogli 2009; Marcén et al. 2018), self-employment (Marcén 2014), the search for a job (Eugster et al. 2016), and even on the math gender gap (Nollenberger et al. 2016). Our sample is obtained from the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS) of the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) (Ruggles et al. 2017). The cultural proxy is calculated by utilizing data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series International (IPUMS International), Minnesota Population Center (2017), which allows us to measure the variable of interest more precisely by age and education, as in Marcén et al. (2018). Results point to culture as an important factor in the living-together decision. This is maintained after adding controls for unobservable characteristics (including country of origin fixed effects and year of immigration fixed effects), and carrying out several robustness checks. Since we only consider the ethnic origin of heads of household in the main sample, we have re-examined the effect of culture, taking into account the fact that individuals can live together with a partner of the same or different country of origin.Footnote 1 It is worth noting that a separate gender analysis has been considered including heads and non-heads of household, to mitigate the concerns that the use of a sample of heads of household, who have traditionally been men (Hobbs and Stoops 2002), may generate. Our findings do not vary. In our main analysis, living together includes both married and unmarried couples. However, there are other modes of household arrangements in which culture may play a role. Furtado et al. (2013) point to the existence of a divorce culture. Here, we show evidence in favor of a living-together culture jointly for married and unmarried couples, but also when we separate those kinds of couples. This finding should reduce the potential concerns that social norms regarding marriage can differ from those of unmarried cohabitation, which can generate doubts as to whether we are capturing the social norms affecting marriage decisions or those affecting unmarried cohabitation. With respect to other household arrangements of individuals living together, culture appears to be a determinant of the decision to live with an adult child or with a grandparent, of the choice of same-gender couples, of the family size, of the age differences between the members of the couple, and of the decision to remain single. We cannot study whether culture is transmitted vertically, that is, from parents to their children, since there is no data on parents’ characteristics, but we can examine whether an increase in the concentration of individuals of the same country of origin has an effect on the number of individuals who choose to live with a partner. As Furtado et al. (2013) and Marcén et al. (2018) show, that relationship may reflect the sensitivity of immigrants to the community in which they live, providing empirical evidence of a possible horizontal transmission of culture. Following the same strategy, we also study whether immigrants respond to the concentration of elderly individuals of the same ethnicity which can be considered as a channel of how culture operates. Similarly, the possible impact on our analysis of the US cultural-assimilation process is included in our study. Differences in the way a culture can be classified (individualism, or collectivism) and in gender roles, measured through the native language of the immigrants, are added to the work as potential determinants of how culture operates. Our findings reinforce the idea that culture is important in the decision to live with a partner. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical strategy. Section 3 describes the data. Baseline results and robustness checks are discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 sets out our main conclusions.",11
17.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,23 July 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-018-9424-2,Debt repayment problems: short-term and long-term implications for spending,June 2019,Merike Kukk,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The spread of debt has increased among households in recent decades, in an evolution that is also knowns as “democratisation of credit”. However, research on the economic implications of indebtedness started only after the 2008–2009 recession. Mian and Sufi (2009) suggest that household debt played an important role in the economic boom and subsequent bust in the 2000s by affecting households’ consumption decisions. The studies by Dynan (2012), Andersen et al. (2016) and Kukk (2016) show that the indebtedness of households does indeed affect their spending behaviour. However, these studies focus on overall household indebtedness while leaving aside the linkage between debt repayment problems and spending on top of the overall indebtedness. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring how debt repayment problems affect spending behaviour beyond other confounding factors, distinguishing between the effects of temporary and more persistent problems. Debt repayment problems may affect households’ behaviour if households adjust their spending when they face financial difficulties. Furthermore, the effect can last longer than the problems as their experience of financial difficulties may lead households to make more cautious spending decisions. Several studies emphasise that indebtedness can cause anxiety and stress if unsustainable commitments lead to repayment problems (Drentea 2000; Taylor et al. 2007; Bridges and Disney 2010). We explore the implications of financial difficulties further and explore whether the experience of debt repayment problems still influences spending after the problems have been solved. A study by May and Tudela (2005) suggests a contemporaneous linkage between debt repayment problems and spending but we are not aware of any study which explores the long-term effect. We see a research gap in the literature as there is a need to assess both the short-term and the long-term effects of debt repayment problems on spending. The ability to study debt repayment problems has been constrained by the availability of suitable databases. Mocetti and Viviano (2014) point out that studies which use survey data are subject to several limitations. First, the spread of the problems in the population is relatively small, so the result is a small sample, limiting the investigation of sub-samples. And second, individuals are sensitive about revealing information on their problems and this leads to measurement error. Karlan and Zinman (2008) show that there is substantial under-reporting of consumer loans in self-reported data. There are no studies that analyse self-reporting of arrears but the issue is apparently more severe with the reporting of arrears than with the reporting of loans. There is no issue with under-reporting when the data used are taken from loan registers which provide detailed information on loan contracts. Register data have been used to investigate the triggers of default, as in Agarwal et al. (2011) and Connor and Flavin (2015) among others. Loan register data contain quite limited information on the behaviour of the borrower beyond the given loan contract and this makes studies on the economic implications of financial difficulties rare. The upshot of the overview is that different channels through which debt repayment problems affect spending behaviour are little explored. This paper aims to fill this gap by using quarterly individual level panel data covering around 12% of the working age population in Estonia, a euro area country since 2011. The extensive dataset from 2004 to 2011 makes it possible to trace quarterly spending and debt repayment problems over 7 years. The paper takes a closer look at the quarterly spending behaviour of those who face difficulties in making their regular debt repayments. The paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it is possible to investigate not only short-term changes in spending but also the longer-term effect after the problems have been solved. Second, the panel dimension of the dataset makes it possible to compare the spending dynamics after debt repayment problems of different durations. Third, large dataset makes it possible to compare spending in different sub-groups. The findings provide novel insights into the relationship between spending and debt repayment problems, improving the understanding of the implications of over-indebtedness. The results of the paper are not expected to be driven by country-specific factors and the lessons should be generally applicable. The accumulation of debt in Estonia was among the fastest in Europe in the 2000s, but the presence of debt repayment problems or arrears is comparable to that in other European countries. The EU-SILC puts the share of the population reporting arrears on a mortgage or rent at below the EU average level, as the share in Estonia was 2.7 per cent in 2010 while the EU average was 4.0 per cent.Footnote 1 Statistics from the EU-SILC suggest that the evolution of arrears in Estonia has been less pronounced than that in Spain, Italy or France and it has been quite similar to the developments in Denmark, Sweden or the Netherlands, implying that debt repayment problems have not been driven by features related to the fast rates of debt growth in the first half of the 2000s. Therefore the lessons on what debt repayment problems imply for spending behaviour are not expected to be country-specific but should be widely applicable. The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 discusses the literature and sets up the hypothesis while Section 3 presents the dataset. Section 4 introduces the hypothesis to be tested and the empirical model. Section 5 delivers the estimation results and provides the robustness tests. Finally, Section 6 summarises the findings.",7
17.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,02 August 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-018-9428-y,"Child’s gender, parental monetary investments and care of elderly parents in China",September 2019,Christine Ho,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Children have long been viewed as a source of support to parents, especially in societies with less developed financial and insurance markets (Caldwell 1976; Cigno 1992). Parents may thus view children as a form of investment that may yield some degree of security in their old age. Studies that consider the old age security motive have analyzed the links between parental investments in children in terms of fertility, education attainment, and marital status, and intergenerational support from children in terms of instrumental and material support. However, the link between parental long-term monetary investments in children and intergenerational support from children has so far not been empirically corroborated. This study addresses the following questions: Do past monetary investments in children’s college education and marriage stimulate current instrumental and material support from children? Are there gender differences in marginal parental support returns to monetary investments in children? The paper first describes how parental monetary investments in children and support from children differ by children’s gender using data from the 2013 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a nationally representative data set of older Chinese residents. The dataset contains rich information on intergenerational transfers and on the demographic characteristics of each coresident and non-coresident child. The analysis can thus be conducted at the child level, with one observation per child in the sample, such that one may infer the marginal support returns to investment per child. The descriptive statistics reveal that parents invested twice more in sons than in daughters in terms of education spending and marriage gifts, which are inclusive of house and betrothal gifts. Sons were more likely to have a living proximity, inclusive of coresidence and living in the same neighborhood, that parents deemed to be the best for an elderly person. Sons and daughters-in-law were also more likely to help the most with activities of daily living (ADL). Conversely, daughters were more likely to provide monetary and in-kind transfers, which are inclusive of gifts of food and clothing. I next estimate the annual marginal support returns to long-term parental monetary investments in children. Investments are measured in terms of college education and marriage spending whereas intergenerational supports include instrumental support, measured in terms of best living proximity and most help with ADL, and material support, measured in terms of monetary and in-kind transfers. I employ family fixed effects models to difference out fixed family level unobserved factors that may correlate with both parental investments and intergenerational support. The findings suggest that higher investments in daughters yield higher increases in their probabilities of having the best living proximity to parents compared to sons. Furthermore, higher monetary investments increase the probability that daughters and sons-in-law help the most with ADL compared to sons and daughters-in-law. Higher investments in children do not seem to stimulate children’s probability of providing material support nor the amount of monetary and in-kind transfers from sons and daughters. The results hold for the subsamples of rural and urban households, and are robust across alternative specifications. Overall, the findings suggest that daughters are more responsive to past parental monetary investments than sons in terms of instrumental support. While the slightly decreasing marginal support returns to investments may be a factor in explaining the higher responsiveness of daughters, they do not seem to be the main driver behind such result. Whereas the marginal support returns from daughters are always positive, the marginal support returns from sons tend to be non-positive for the outcomes of best living proximity and most help with ADL. In particular, there are negative (positive) associations between parental monetary investments in sons’ college education and sons’ instrumental support (income). Thus, sons possibly decrease their instrumental support as their time becomes more expensive. Meanwhile, parental monetary investments in daughters’ marriage are positively associated with daughters’ instrumental support, which may occur through an income effect or through reciprocity. There is no conclusive evidence that parental investments stimulate monetary and in-kind transfers from children, suggesting that material support possibly occurs out of social norm courtesy.Footnote 1 It is well-documented that sons tend to be valued as a potential source of support for the elderly in China. Ebeinstein and Leung (2010) found that parents who have at least one son were less likely to enroll in a pension program whereas Huang et al. (2017) found that parents who expect support from sons were more likely to match-make their sons to daughters-in-laws who would be more suited to household production. There is also evidence of higher school enrollment rates for boys and higher spending on sons’ private education in Asia (Alderman and Gertler 1997; Bauer et al. 1992; Chen et al. 2017; Choi and Hwang 2015).Footnote 2 Despite sons being perceived as an important source of support, there has been increasing accounts of daughters providing support or comfort to parents in Asia (Salaff 1976; Yi et al. 2016). This suggests that even though son favoring parental investments are still prevalent, a feature attributed to highly persistent patriarchal values, daughters may also provide a non-trivial source of help to parents. Given the reliance of parents on children for old age support in developing countries, it is important to understand whether parental investments pay off by eliciting higher support, and whether daughters are as “useless” in that respect as customarily believed. Studies that consider the old age security motive have found positive associations between intergenerational support from children and fertility (Lee and Xiao 1998; Oliveira 2016). The literature has also examined the links between intergenerational support from children and parental investments in the form of children’s education attainment and marital status. Cunningham et al. (2013) found no evidence that education attainment or marital status were linked to either financial or instrumental help in Egypt. Lillard and Willis (1997) also found no evidence of associations between education attainment and the probability and amount of household chores help provided by children in Malaysia. Conversely, they found that higher education attainment was associated with a higher probability that children made financial transfers to parents as well as a higher transfer amount. Similarly, Raut and Tran (2005) found that higher education attainment was associated with higher amounts of financial transfers from children in Indonesia. The link between time transfers from children and contemporaneous financial transfers or expected bequests from parents is also well-documented. Norton et al. (2014) found positive correlations between the probability of providing care to parents and the probability of receiving contemporaneous financial transfers from parents in the US. Bernheim et al. (1985) found positive associations between contact from children and parental bequeathable wealth in the US while Brown (2006) found evidence that children who are more likely to provide care are also more likely to be included in parents’ will. Similarly, Horioka et al. (2018) found that the expectations of receiving a bequest is positively associated with coresidence and time transfers from children in Japan. To the best of my knowledge, this paper is the first that analyses the links between parental long-term monetary investments in children and intergenerational support from children, and how such links differ by gender. Parental spending on college education and marriage represent two major components of investment in children in China.Footnote 3 Whereas college education attainment and marital status may capture parental investments at the extensive margin, they do not capture the intensive margin as measured by the actual amount contributed by parents. A child who benefited from parental monetary investments may achieve higher income either through better education quality or through marrying a spouse with higher earnings capacity, and may also be more inclined to reciprocate in terms of support to parents. Furthermore, one may infer how marginal returns change non-linearly with the investment amount. This study thus contributes to the literature by studying the intensive margin of investment, as measured by parental spending on children’s college education and marriage gifts, as well as gender differences in the associations between parental monetary investments and intergenerational support. Section 2 presents the conceptual framework on how parental investments in children may stimulate intergenerational support, and discusses the implications for the empirical analysis. Section 3 presents the data, measures, and empirical models. The results on marginal parental returns from children and some suggestive insights on potential mechanisms are presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.",12
17.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,23 May 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-018-9416-2,Birth order and the gender gap in educational attainment,September 2019,Jaqueline Oliveira,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"A central problem in various fields of economics and other social sciences is to understand what drives intra-familial disparities in parental investment and, consequently, economic success across siblings.Footnote 1 Within this research agenda, an important question concerns the role of birth order in explaining differences in children’s outcomes. Traditionally, studies addressing this question focused on developed countries and, with a few exceptions, concluded that being the earliest born confers many benefits.Footnote 2 More recently, however, attention has shifted to developing countries (e.g., Ejrnæs and Pörtner (2004), Edmonds (2006), Emerson and Souza (2008), Dammert (2010), Tenikue and Verheyden (2010), and De Haan et al. (2014)) and, interestingly, the findings suggest a reverse pattern: earlier-born children fare worse than later borns.Footnote 3 In this paper, I contribute to this expanding literature by (i) estimating birth order effects on completed years of schooling in China, (ii) examining how the effects differ across gender, and (iii) investigating novel mechanisms that might give rise to these effects. Gender heterogeneity in birth order effects are plausible, especially in the Chinese context where traditional gender roles and other social norms are likely to shape parents’ perception of the returns to resource investment in their children. Different from previous studies in developing countries I focus on adult children outcomes.Footnote 4 I harness rich retrospective data on childbearing history collected for a nationally-representative sample of senior Chinese women and their adult children. The data enables me to produce estimates rid of bias resulting from correlation between a child’s birth order and any other unobservable attributes shared by siblings. I also utilize information on adult children’s marriage market outcomes, their financial and instrumental support to old-age parents, and early-life parental time inputs to elucidate some of the possible mechanisms underlying the birth order patterns by gender in China. The data for this study come from the 2013 and 2014 waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The 2013 CHARLS provides information on the date of birth of every child ever born, which allows me to accurately measure birth order among adult siblings. For every living child the survey collects data on the educational attainment, income level, living arrangement, and financial support given and received, among others. The 2014 CHARLS Life History survey gathers additional information on early-life outcomes such as early-childhood care, age at first marriage, and marriage partner characteristics. The CHARLS, therefore, provides a unique opportunity to explore channels leading to birth order effects by gender in the Chinese context. Gender determination technology, coupled with stringent caps on number of births due to the one-child policy, has contributed to the sex-ratio imbalance in China. Sex-selective abortion also poses a threat to identification as gender is no longer randomly distributed across birth rank. To circumvent this problem, I carry out the empirical analysis on different samples depending on the senior mother’s exposure to the policy and run a series of robustness checks on alternative samples and using different specifications. My preferred estimates are obtained using the adult children born to women above childbearing age when the family planning policy came into effect and before ultrasound technology was popularized. My within-family estimates show that, holding family size constant, lowering the birth order of a child by one is associated with a 0.31 year reduction in schooling if the child is a female but a 0.26 year increase in the schooling if the child is a male. The results are similar when estimates are produced after splitting the sample between rural and urban residents. Results obtained using an alternative sample of younger children drawn from the 1982 Population Census of China confirm my main findings: birth order effects on literacy rates, primary school completion, and accumulated years of schooling are positive for girls and negative for boys. Additionally, birth order reduces the likelihood girls do housework but increases the probability for boys. The exception is paid work, where positive birth order effects are observed for boys and girls. Next, I turn to possible mechanisms underlying gender differences in birth order effects. First, birth order effects are not significant among daughters from a subsample of educated urban parents, but negative birth order effects among sons are stronger in this group. This might suggest that resource constraint could lead to worse outcomes for older daughters but cannot account for the reverse pattern for sons. Second, older children marry at an earlier age and are more likely to marry young, which could explain the lower educational attainment of older daughters if marriage migration interrupts schooling. Finally, older daughters are less likely to help their senior parents financially than younger siblings and older sons transfer larger sums of money. Therefore, from an efficiency standpoint, parents might perceive the returns to investing in the schooling of older sons as larger and of older daughters as smaller. There is still the possibility that my findings are explained by preferential treatment of children according to birth order and gender. If that were the case, I should see the same patterns in other early-life outcomes. I find no evidence, however, of birth order differences in the likelihood of being cared for by both biological parents at the ages 0 to 5, nor on the likelihood that the mother was working at the time the child was born. Assessing the differential role birth order plays in the human capital formation of boys and girls is key to evaluating the impact of family planning policies implemented throughout the developing world, as it introduces another margin by which family size influences outcomes. This is particularly true of China, where the ramifications of the one-child policy are yet to be fully understood. My findings suggest that, by curbing family size, the policy had a stronger positive effect on human capital formation of females relative to males; despite having contributed to the sex-ratio imbalance in China, it might have helped to reduce the gender gap in educational attainment among surviving children. The next sections are organized as follows. “The Chinese context” section highlights the characteristics of the Chinese society and economy that are relevant to the study of birth order effects. “Data and empirical strategy” section presents the empirical strategy and provides a detailed description of the data used in the empirical analysis. “Effect of birth order on schooling” section shows the main findings and discusses possible threats to identification and choice of functional forms. “Channels” section sheds light on possible mechanisms explaining birth order effects by gender. “Concluding remarks” section concludes.",6
17.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,13 August 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-018-9426-0,Do American mothers use self-employment as a flexible work alternative?,September 2019,Katherine Lim,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Many American women reduce their labor supply when they have children, which can have lasting negative consequences on their earning potential. Previous research suggests that one important determinant of mothers’ labor force participation is workplace flexibility (e.g. Herr and Wolfram 2012; Goldin 2014). In this paper, I show that self-employment is an empirically important work alternative for mothers of young children and provide evidence that it offers them a flexible work environment. Using panel data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), I find that mothers of young children are more likely to be self-employed with the largest estimated effect for mothers whose youngest child is two years of age. My results provide evidence that self-employment is associated with time periods when children require a large amount of care, suggesting that self-employment offers the flexibility to more easily provide that care. In order to further understand this relationship, I use the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to investigate the mechanisms through which self-employment might be more compatible with household responsibilities. Relative to women working in wage and salary positions, I find that self-employed women work fewer hours, are more likely to work from home, and spend more time as the primary caretaker of their children. These patterns remain true after controlling for demographic characteristics providing suggestive evidence that self-employment allows women to structure their time differently. The time use results offer context for the strong positive estimated relationship between self-employment and the presence of young children and are consistent with previous work suggesting that many women become self-employed to manage family responsibilities (Hundley 2000; Devine 2001; Wellington 2006; Gurley-Calvez et al. 2009). The paper makes a number of contributions to the existing literature on female self-employment and children. First, using a large panel dataset allows me to implement an improved empirical design that controls for unobserved time invariant differences across individuals that could drive both self-employment behavior and fertility. Previous work using cross sectional or two year panel data could not exclude correlated preferences for children and self-employment as the explanation for the positive association between self-employment and children (e.g. Connelly 1992; Boden 1999; Edwards and Field-Hendrey 2001). By using within person variation in the age of a woman’s youngest child and self-employment behavior, I am better able to control for women’s underlying preferences. Second, my analysis traces out the relationship between self-employment behavior and the age of a woman’s youngest child (Fig. 1) providing further evidence that self-employment is associated with ages when children require more care. The results complement previous work showing a positive correlation between children and female self-employment. The estimated relationship is statistically and economically significant. Women whose youngest child is two years old have predicted self-employment rates that are 14% higher than their predicted rates without their youngest child. Female self-employment rates and the age of the youngest child. Notes: The regressions predict self-employment status controlling for age, marital status, number of children, and fixed effects with standard errors clustered at the individual level. The markers denote statistical significance at the 5% level and the light lines represent the 95% confidence interval. The estimation sample includes women ages 18–55 who are present in the first wave of each SIPP panel (1984–1986, 1996, 2008). Observations are weighted using the monthly weight from the individual’s final month in the survey Third, I provide evidence that mothers’ self-employment behavior has changed very little between 1984 and 2012 making self-employment a long-standing work alternative for mothers of young children. The increase in mothers entering the labor force during this time period likely altered the composition of working mothers, which could have changed self-employment rates and patterns. I find no evidence that the relationship has changed between the late 1980s and early 2010s (Fig. 2), and the estimates are robust to a variety of sample restrictions and weighting schemes. Similarly, I find that the effect of the age of the youngest child on women’s wage and salary employment has changed very little over that time period (Fig. 3), which is consistent with Byker’s (2016) findings. Female self-employment rates and the age of the youngest child. Notes: The three lines are plots of the coefficients on the age of the youngest child from regressions using different SIPP panels. The regressions predict self-employment status controlling for age, marital status, number of children, and fixed effects with standard errors clustered at the individual level. The markers denote statistical significance at the 5% level. The estimation sample includes women ages 18–55 who are present in the first wave of each SIPP panel. Observations are weighted using the monthly weight from the individual’s final month in the survey Percentage of women working by the age of the youngest child.

The markers denote statistical significance at the 5% level. The estimation sample includes women ages 18–55 who are present in the first wave of each SIPP panel. Observations are weighted using the monthly weight from the individual’s final month in the survey Finally, I examine occupational transitions into and out of self-employment to highlight the variety of self-employment experiences across women and to understand how this experience fits into their career trajectories. I show that around 40% of transitions to self-employment are movements from non-employment. Among the 25% of transitions that are movements from wage and salary employment, the switch to self-employment often involves a change in occupation as well. My time use analysis illustrates differences in how self-employed and wage and salary employed mothers structure their work and non-work time. These comparisons provide context to understand why self-employment might be relatively more attractive to women with young kids. The analysis expands on previous work connecting parents’ time-use with flexible work by Gurley-Calvez et al. (2009) who also find that self-employed women spend more time with their children and less time working and Bryan and Sevilla (2017) who find that flexible work schedules help parents synchronize their schedules. Overall, my findings suggest that self-employment provides a flexible alternative to wage and salary employment for women with young children, and they provide a deeper understanding of employment decisions during an important time in women’s working lives. The higher self-employment rates among women with young children contrast starkly with lower levels of labor force participation among mothers of young children. There is evidence that the gender wage gap in the U.S. grows between ages 30 and 35 when women are more likely than men to decrease their labor supply (Bertrand et al. 2010; Goldin 2014; Guvenen et al. 2014).Footnote 1 These reductions in labor supply often coincide with the time period when women are building their careers so they may have an especially large impact on women’s future earning potential. Previous work suggests that self-employment experience is better for women’s future earnings than time out of the labor force (Williams 2000; Bruce and Schuetze 2004). My findings suggest that self-employment may provide a flexible work environment that encourages women to work while they have young children, which could have positive effects on their future earnings. Finally, my focus on self-employment as a long-standing flexible work alternative offers insight into mothers’ use of alternative work arrangements more generally, which make up a growing share of U.S. employment (Katz and Krueger 2016). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I discuss the previous literature on female self-employment and the labor supply of mothers. In Section 3, I describe my two data sources: the SIPP and the ATUS. In Section 4, I outline my empirical strategy for estimating the relationship between having young children and self-employment. I also describe my analysis on time use differences between self-employed women and wage and salary workers. I present my results in Sections 5 and 6 and offer concluding thoughts in Section 7.",12

Evidence from Nigeria,September 2019,Joseph Boniface Ajefu,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Studies in the social sciences have long been concerned with the impact of women’s decision on childbearing and labour market outcomes. For instance, existing evidence supports the assertion that having children is likely to be associated with less labour market participation in paid employment for women (Besamusca et al. 2015; Canning and Schultz 2012; Engelhardt and Prskawetz 2004; Becker 1985; Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1980a, 1980b; Gronau 1973; Mincer 1962). Moreover, the presence of children in the household can be an important factor in explaining variation in women’s labour market participation (Contreras and Plaza 2010; Spierings et al. 2010; Browning 1992; Becker 1985). Further, existing theoretical models have established a link between fertility and labour market outcomes (Becker 1985; Gronau 1973; Mincer 1962; Schultz 2009). For example, Mincer (1962) argues that maternal childcare is difficult to be substituted compared to other domestic works. Labour supply of married women with young children is likely to be affected than married women without young children. Due to the prevailing cultural norms and the absence of organised childcare policies in many developing countries, women are often responsible for childcare and other domestic duties (Maume 2006; Moghadam 2004). Becker (1985) shows that childcare is more effort-intensive than other domestic activities, which has the propensity to affect women’s labour market performance. In order to meet family obligations, or balance work and family commitments, recent evidence suggests that many women’s labour force participation are significantly affected, while others may consider either part-time or less demanding jobs, such as self-employmentFootnote 1 (Boden 1996; Budig 2006; Wellington 2006; Simoes et al. 2016; Joona 2017). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between fertility and self-employment across a sample of women in Nigeria. Nigeria presents a compelling context to examine the causal effect of fertility on self-employment because of the high fertility and self-employment rates in the country. The fertility rate in Nigeria is one of the highest in the world. For instance, in 1960, the fertility was 6.4 and had only a slight decline to 5.6 in 2015 (World Development Indicators 2015)Footnote 2. Factors responsible for the high fertility rate in Nigeria include: high level of infant and child mortality, early marriage, low use of contraception, high value placed on childbearing, and the prevalence of polygamous marriges (Feyisetan and Bankole 2002). Nigeria accounts for a significant proportion of global female entrepreneurs (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2013). Compared to other countries, about 40.7% of female adults in Nigeria are either nascent entrepreneurs or owner-managers of a new business, while countries like the United States (10.4%), the United Kingdom (5.5%), Norway (3.6%) and France (3.1%) are lagging behind (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2013). Previous studies on fertility and female labour force participation in Nigeria focus on the correlation (rather than the causal impact), and most of the results show that the correlation is negative. For example, Okpala (1984) investigates the relationship between female labour force participation and fertility in Lagos, Nigeria. Also, Okpala (1984) finds a negative correlation between female employment and the number of children. On the other hand, Nwakeze (1987) using the incompatibility and opportunity cost hypotheses finds inconsistent estimates on the relationship between fertility and labour force participation in Nigeria. Though there is a growing literature that reports positive associations between the presence of children and female self-employment (Caceres-Delpiano 2012; Noseleit 2014; Joona 2017)Footnote 3. The causal interpretation, however, of the relationship between the number of children and female self-employment can be made complex by the endogeneity of fertility. The presence of unobserved factors is likely to influence both fertility and female self-employment. For instance, independent women may choose to have fewer children and more likely to pursue full-time wage employment instead of part-time or self-employment. Therefore, the observed positive relationship between fertility and self-employment could be biased. Moreover, having more children could increase the demand for flexible employment which self-employment can offer, and self-employment allows women more flexible time to have more children. This leads to a sort of reverse causality. This paper aims to extend the existing literature by investigating the causal relationship between fertility and female self-employment in Nigeria. The paper provides answers to the following research questions. Is there a causal relationship between fertility and female entrepreneurship in Nigeria? Are there heterogeneities across the sampled population of women in explaining the relationship between fertility and female entrepreneurship? The objective of this paper is to provide answers to these research questions using a micro perspective under an instrumental variable estimation framework. To address the potential endogeneity and identify the causal relationship between the number of children and self-employment, this paper uses an exogenous source of variation in fertility, which is twin birth as an instrument for the number of children. The choice of this instrument stems from the positive relationship between twin births and the number of children. This paper is broadly related to two strands of empirical literature. The first category examines the impact of fertility on female labour force participation, taking into account the endogeneity of fertility decisions. The concern of endogeneity was addressed by most of these studies using either mixed sibling-sex composition as an instrumental variable (IV), or twin births as an instrument for fertility to analyse the effects of number of children on labour supply through the use of instrumental variables techniques (Bronars and Grogger 1994; Angrist and Evans 1998; Jacobsen et al. 1999; Cruces and Galiani 2007; He and Zhu 2016; De Jong et al. 2017; Zhang 2017; Heath 2017). There exists a growing number of studies in this category that find that a negative relationship exists between fertility and female labour force participation (Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1980a; Vere 2007; Sprague 1988; Black et al. 2005; Del Boca et al. 2009). For instance, De Jong et al. (2017) used a database of 250,000 women living in Sub-Saharan Africa reported to have twin births to investigate the effect of fertility on women’s employment. They find that the number of children below age 6 has a significantly negative effect on women’s ability to work in the non-farm sector. The effects of the number of children are stronger for older women and those with more years of education. However, a small but growing literature find less consistent or no evidence on the effect of presence of children on women’s labour force participation (Guo et al. 2018; Cruces and He and Zhu 2016; Azimi 2015; Cáceres-Delpiano 2012; Agüero and Marks 2011; Aguero and Marks 2008; Orbeta 2005; Benefo and Pillai 2003). Using twin birth as a natural experiment, Cáceres-Delpiano (2012) finds that fertility decreases labour supply for mothers with more schooling years and living in urban areas, but it does not have a significant effect on maternal labour supply for residents from rural areas.The second strand of literature is related to studies on the relationship between fertility and female self-employment. A growing number of empirical studies have found a positive relationship between fertility and female self-employment (MacPherson 1988; Arai 2000; Caputo and Dolinsky 1998; Carr 1996; Carrasco and Ejrnæs 2003; Cowling and Taylor 2001; Edwards and Field-Hendrey 2002; Kuhn and Schuetze 2001; Wellington 2006). The mechanisms for the above relationship stem from women being responsible for childcare and household labour, hence their need for flexibility offered by self-employment. Other empirical evidence, however, has shown that the relationship between fertility and self-employment could differ across different types of self-employment. The pattern of self-employment can be determined by the nature of the labour market institutions, the nature of self-employment (having children increases women’s non-professional self-employment), and the age of the children (Budig 2006; Joona 2017)Footnote 4. This paper differs from previous studies in a number of important ways. First, this paper examines the relationship between the number of children and female self-employment in Nigeria-country with high fertility rate and high female self-employment in which empirical evidence on the causal relationship of the phenomenon under investigation is scarce. Second, until recently, a study of this nature was not feasible due to the lack of survey data and plausible instrumental variables that can correct for the endogeneity of fertility most developing countries. This paper therefore fills the gap in the literature on the relationship between fertility and female labour market outcomes using twin births as positive shocks to the number of children. Third, the paper contributes to the broad literature of family size and labour force participation, which is relevant to issues of gender equality as well as living standard, dependency burden, and money-saving behaviour of households (Anderson and Eswaran 2009; Buvinic et al. 2009; Fallon and Lucas 2002; Kritz and Makinwa-Adebusoye 1999; Yount and Li 2009). Fourth, the focus of the study on Nigeria offers new insights into understanding the relationship between fertility and female self-employment, and this would aid in developing innovative policies for achieving optimal family size, which is essential for women’s long-term career outcomes (Albrecht et al. 1999; Herr 2007). The relevance of this study is underscored by the increasing recognition of gender equality as one of the pillars of sustainable development (UNDP 2013; World Economic Forum). Policy makers have over the years given priority to women’s emancipation, which has been a proxy or measure for equal opportunities (UNDP 1995). Evidence shows that women’s labour market integration enhances the prospects for economic growth (World Economic Forum 2014), and an increase in female labour incomes through labour market activities help to reduce poverty (Buvinic and Gupta 1997). Thus, women’s labour force participation can be a vital force in shaping a country’s economic and human development (Besamusca et al. 2015). The empirical results from the study confirm the hypothesis that the number of children is causally related to women being self-employed. Specifically, using the instrumental variable approach, having children increases women’s probability of being self-employed. In addition, there is a heterogeneous impact across the sub-population through women’s age. These results are consistent with evidence from Noseleit (2014)Footnote 5 and Joona (2017). The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the labour market context in Nigeria. Section 3 introduces the data and empirical methodology. Section 4 presents the main results and, Section 5 concludes the paper.",6
17.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,16 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-019-09442-5,The time and the transitions back to work in France after maternity,September 2019,Bruno Rodrigues,Vincent Vergnat,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The birth of a first child is an important event in a woman’s life, not only from a personal but also a professional point of view. For France, Pailhé and Solaz (2007) show that 34.1% of women make a professional transition after the birth of a first child. For several decades, the economic literature has been interested in the impact of the birth of a child and seeks to understand the determinants and causes of these changes. Waldfogel (1997), for example, studied the question of the family wage gap, that is, to understand where the differences in wages between women with children and women without children come from. The family wage gap has been studied in most developed countries (Gangl & Ziefle, 2009, for the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States; Davies & Pierre, 2005, for a European comparison; Meurs et al., 2010 and Wilner, 2016, for France). The main reasons given to explain the family wage gap are a lower accumulation (or depreciation) of human capital, statistical discrimination, presence of unobserved heterogeneity and self-selection of mothers in lower-paying firms. The effect of birth on wages is not the only interesting aspect to study. Indeed, understanding the determinants of professional transitions made by mothers is a major issue for employers and public decision-makers. From the employer’s point of view, anticipating the length of parental leave and understanding the determinants of young mothers’ choices can help companies adopt internal policies to minimize replacement costs for absent women workers and increase women’s devotion to their firm. From the public policy point of view, understanding mothers’ behaviors makes it possible to adapt and propose policies concerning, in particular, the provision of childcare or the duration of parental leave, which minimizes economic costs for society. More generally, it is interesting to understand when and how mothers are coming back to work after giving birth. This paper attempts to answer this question in the case of France, by estimating a competing risks model as in Arntz et al. (2017). Literature in this area has often used reforms of maternity (or parental) leave policies to study the labour supply behavior of women after birth. For example, Lalive & Zweimüller (2009) study the impact of two maternity leave reforms in Austria on future fertility decisions and on the career of mothers. The first reform, in 1990, was an extension of the job protection period, which, before the reform ended with the first birthday of the first child, and after the reform with the first birthday of the second child. The second reform, in 1996, was a six months reduction of the job protection period. The first reform increased fertility and return to work was delayed even after the job protection period had ended. The second reform shortened the pacing between the first and the second birth, but without major impact on total fertility. In a subsequent article, Lalive et al. (2014) study the impact of a third reform which was implemented in the year 2000. This reform increased the maximum duration of cash benefits the parents were entitled to for having the first child. This reform increased the time mothers spent at home before returning to work. Schönberg and Ludsteck (2014) show that successive expansions of maternity leave coverage in Germany has reduced the employment rate of mothers in the short term. For the case of Japan, Asai (2015), shows that the increase in cash benefits given during parental leave has only a small effect on working behavior of Japanese women. Another branch of literature has focused on availability of child care on labour force participation. A poorly developed public child care system may encourage or force mothers not to return to work in the years following birth. For example, Mahringer & Zulehner (2015) use, for the Austrian case, the various local regulations to estimate the impact of child-care costs on the participation of mothers in the labour market. Despite the negative effect of the cost of childcare on employment, the authors show that increasing the availability of child-care can have the same effect on employment as reducing costs. Finseraas et al. (2017) also show that, with Norwegian data, free childcare increase the extensive labor supply of low earnings mothers. Morrissey (2017) carries out a detailed literature review of papers studying the link between the availability of childcare, childcare costs and the parental participation to the labour market. He shows a significant heterogeneity in the results of different studies based on the American case or other developed countries. Part of this heterogeneity could be due to the specific context of each country in terms of public policies or culture. For this reason, country-specific studies are needed to understand child care issues in different national contexts. Other articles have studied the determinants of mothers’ transitions from employment to non-employment. For example, Gustafsson et al. (1996) make a comparative study between Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. They show that a higher accumulation of human capital increases the likelihood of a mother in West Germany returning to employment and increases the speed at which the mother returns to employment. In their study this variable does not seem to have any effect for the Swedish case. Ondrich et al. (2003) study German women and show that mothers with a high level of education and women with a lot of experience are more likely to return to work. They show that firm size before birth does not seem to play a role. Gutiérrez-Domenèch (2005) carries out a comparative study on transition to non-employment for Belgium, West Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden. The level of education increases the probability of being employed after the birth of a first child, except in Sweden where the variable has no effect, the latter result confirming the work of Gustafsson et al. (1996). On the other hand, Gutiérrez-Domenèch (2005) finds that professional experience plays a positive role in the probability of being employed after birth for all countries. Studies based on French data have mainly focused on the family wage gap (Davies and Pierre, 2005; Meurs et al., 2010; Wilner, 2016) or on the impact of reform on parental leave (Joseph et al., 2013; Lequien, 2012; Piketty, 2005). Only a few articles were interested in transitions made by mothers after birth. For example, Pailhé & Solaz (2007) study the impact of a birth on the probability, for mothers, to invest less in the labour market. The authors show that the higher the birth order, the greater the likelihood of reducing working hours. Age at birth reduces the probability to invest less in the labour market and the opposite effect is observed with the level of education. Similarly, Domingo & Marc (2012), analyze the professional trajectories of mothers with at least two children in France. In particular, they study the effects of a break or a reduction of work on the probability of working full-time or to be in involuntary part-time work 12 years after the birth of the last child. They show the importance of personal characteristics and the conditions of the last job on the occupational situation of the mothers after a birth. Thus, being young at the time of birth, having high level of education or not taking parental leave will increase the probability of being employed 12 years after the last child was born. Despite these different works, there are no studies on French data, as far as we know, which have been concerned with the determinants of transitions achieved by mothers after birth, including a broad set of possible transitions and studying the probabilities of return in continuous time. The papers from which we draw the most inspiration are Fitzenberger et al. (2016) and Arntz et al. (2017), which focus on Germany. Fitzenberger et al. (2016) use a dataset from a large German company to study the return to job of women after giving birth to the first child. Their data, covering the years from 2000 to 2008, show that return-to-job after the first birth is a source of high uncertainty for firms. Indeed, an important part of the first-time mothers do not return to work after the parental leave. This is less the case for women who are more involved in their careers. This paper offers a very interesting and detailed analysis, however the conclusions are drawn from female workers of a single firm. Therefore results from Fitzenberger et al. (2016) should be taken with caution. Arntz et al. (2017) use German data from 1985–2005, and focus on the link between labour market conditions, legislation, the length of maternity duration and the return to work. The authors show that there have been important changes in the behaviour of women during the last three decades. Women are more likely to give birth to the second child or to work again for the same employer, but part time, than getting back to work full time or dropping completely out of the labour market. It seems that the maternity leave legislation plays a role in this pattern. The authors show that the longer the job protection period, the longer the maternity leave taken by the mothers. This fact leads to important costs for the employer and for the economy as a whole. However, these findings might not be generalizable to France. Fertility and labour supply decisions of French women are quite different from their German counterparts. For example, total fertility rate is 1.60 in Germany while it is 1.92 for France in 2016. The percentage of part time working women aged 20 to 49 is 43.9% for Germany, against 29.1% for France in 2017.Footnote 1 Using a rich administrative dataset, we study young mothers’ decisions; how long mothers decide to stay in post-natal leave after the first birth, and how mothers come back to work. Different mothers, with different careers and working in different environments will take different decisions as to how long their break will be, and how they will come back to work. We use, as in Arntz et al. (2017), a competing risks model to study this question for France. After estimating the model, we discuss which variables affect how mothers return to work. The paper is constructed as follows: in Section 2 we present France’s institutional setting to give the reader a better understanding of the particularities of France, Section 3 presents the studied transitions, Section 4 describes the data, Section 5 explains the methodology employed and Section 6 presents and discusses the results. We conclude in Section 7.",3

Why would one expect that relative consumption concerns should have any effect on household fertility? A household, which has relative consumption concerns, derives utility not from the absolute level of consumption, but rather from the relative level of consumption. This latter is usually defined as a difference or a ratio between an absolute consumption level and some type of benchmark or reference consumption level. A household that tries to “keep up with the Joneses” usually has higher marginal utility from consumption for every dollar spent on consumption goods. Thus, it tends to dedicate more resources to consumption than a household that cares about absolute consumption level. Obviously, dedicating a larger share of resources to consumption may come at the expense of saving, fertility, investment in human capital of children, etc. What is the role of local income inequality? Household’s reference consumption is determined by those who live in close proximity, within small geographic area where households interact frequently and can get their perceptions of desirable living standards. Higher income inequality is driven by higher earnings of high-income households (as will be shown later) and thus implies variation in the reference consumption level (with high inequality areas having, on average, higher reference levels of consumption). So if households exhibit (upward-lookingFootnote 2) relative consumption concerns, then two identical (up to their location) households who reside in areas with different inequality will have different reference consumption levels and therefore different choices. The model developed in this paper predicts that households facing higher reference consumption levels, i.e. those living in more unequal areas, will have fewer children. This implication of the model is tested using American Community Survey (ACS) 2010 data, which can identify a household’s place of residence (metropolitan area) and allow us to construct measures of local income inequality. There are more than 500 identifiable locations allowing for a cross-sectional variation in income inequality. The prediction that fertility is lower in more unequal locations is supported empirically: households in the least unequal areas have more children than in the most unequal areas, and the differential ranges from 0.17 to 0.24 children, depending on the measure of income inequality employed. Thus, this study achieves two things first, it offers additional support to the “keeping up with the Joneses” hypothesis by finding empirical evidence of the effect of “envy” on fertility. This first result further reinforces the idea that policy makers should take into account households’ “envy”, when they make decisions regarding financial regulation, taxation of consumption/inheritance, social security, etc. Second, it offers a possibility that one-time surge in income inequality may not necessarily lead to ever-increasing income inequality, possibility of which is often found in the literature. For example in de la Croix and Doepke (2003) a macroeconomic shock resulting in an increased variation in income (inequality) may lead to increasing fertility differentials between high- and low-income households. This happens due to “quality-quantity” trade-off, which implies that those whose income decreased have more children while those whose income increased have fewer. More children born to low-income households further increase income inequality in the next generation, thus kicking in a vicious cycle of ever-increasing inequality. However these studies do not take into account that desire to “keep up with the Joneses” may be a restraining factor on the fertility of low-income households. In essence, this suggested relationship between household’ s relative consumption concern and fertility is a reformulation of Easterlin’s hypothesis within the framework set by Becker and Murphy (2003). Easterlin (1975) states that agents acquire their concept of “normal” living standards during their formative years, and thus their reference group consists of their parents. This hypothesis is used to explain the “baby boom” and the “baby bust” phenomena. The reformulation involves substituting inter-temporal (inter-generational) comparisons with cross-sectional (intra-generational) comparisons, meaning that households compare not to their parents, but rather to their peers whose consumption levels are visible due to the proximity of habitation. Becker and Murphy (2003) set up a framework for modeling peer effects. In their discussion of the role of social capital they present a utility function which, in addition to standard inputs, has group’s (to which an individual/household in question refers to) average consumption as a measure of social capital. The group consists of people who live in close proximity as authors mention neighborhood as a main place of influence. Thus, all three crucial ingredients of the model to be presented below, namely the desire to match benchmark consumption level, which is the group’s average consumption, where group is defined by geographic proximity, are within the Becker and Murphy (2003) framework. The rest of the paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 presents the relevant literature on interrelations between relative consumption concerns, inequality and fertility.

Considered by international financial institutions as a means to reach female empowerment, microfinance programs have recently gained importance in development policies. The economic literature remains however divided on the effect of the supposed resulting empowerment on the economic welfare at the household level, and specifically on domestic violence. Inspired by the theory of marital bargaining, advocates of a beneficial impact of microfinance on domestic violence postulate that microfinance participation reduces domestic violence because of woman’s higher bargaining power resulting from finance that improves their outside option or fallback position (Tauchen et al. 1991; Farmer and Thienfenthaler 1997). In contrast, for many scholars, notably those adhering to the theory of male backlash, in a patriarchal society where options outside marriage are less frequent, an increase in women’s financial empowerment due to microfinance programs participation might challenge the social norm of male dominance. A husband’s attempts to restore his authority in such a situation will therefore result in more domestic violence (Aizer 2010; Luke and Munki 2011). Empirical evaluation of these opposed predictions in various contexts remains inconclusive.Footnote 1 In rural areas of the northern regions of Cameroon, the rural familial income improvement program (PARFAR) established by the State of Cameroon with financial support from the African Bank for Development (ADB) is a program with a microfinance component, whose funds are intended mostly for women empowerment. This program is in a context where social and traditional perceptions of the role of women are governed by rules defining their behavior towards husbands and other men. These standards exclude educational options and opportunities to work for a salary. Women’s destiny is to marry and ensure offspring to their husbands. Their main activities are then housework and childcare. The bulk of the family income comes from men. The reversal of these relationships due to the contribution of microfinance institutions is an element that can result in adversarial dynamics in families due to incompatibility with traditional norms. The question then arises as to whether desired empowerment of women by microfinance programs in the northern regions of Cameroon is at the cost of increasing domestic violence and accentuating the risk of dislocating family units. This question is of real importance as Cameroonian authorities consider the sustainability of the program’s credit component with regard to its significant contribution to the increase in household income, health, children education etc. However, despite recent interest in the literature on microfinance’s impact on domestic violence, there is no research on this topic in Cameroon to guide governmental interventions.Footnote 2 As such, our research will add empirical evidence in the Cameroonians’ context and allow comparisons with what is observed in other countries. The approach adopted by many researchers is to compare participating and non-participating households using observed levels of violence. One limitation of such an approach in the rural savanna area of Cameroon is that the choice of pilot villages by the program is not random and thus may affect women’s propensity to participate. It is therefore difficult to attribute high levels of violence in a household to PARFAR participation as there are pre-existing differences between participants and non-participants. In this case, differences in the observed level of violence could result from selection bias. The statistical method of matching on propensity scores will enable us to take this potential bias into account in our analysis. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second section reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on the microfinance participation-domestic violence nexus. Section 3 presents the context and discusses the status of women in the rural savanna area of Cameroon. Section 4 is devoted to the presentation of methods and data. Section 5 presents and discusses the results of the study while Section 6 concludes.",4
17.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,26 September 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-018-9434-0,"Performance pay, the marriage market and rising income inequality in Taiwan",September 2019,Shao-Hsun Keng,Peter F. Orazem,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In Taiwan, the household Gini coefficient climbed from 0.25 to 0.34 between 1980 and 2014 as shown in Fig. 1. While rising inequality is common across most developed economies (OECD 2012), the Taiwan case offers some unique features. First, despite rising household income inequality, several studies have found thtablat wage inequality for individual workers is declining or stable (Cheng 2004; Chen and Hsu 2001; Chan et al. 1999). These studies were based on wages without including bonuses.Footnote 1 The Gini coefficients in Fig. 1 that were based solely on individual wages fell from 0.30 to 0.26 between 1980 and 2014. Gini coefficients in Taiwan based on individual wage income excluding bonus, individual wage income including bonus, and household wage income including bonus Second, slow growth of college-educated labor relative to the pace of technical change is viewed as a major cause of rising inequality in other developed economies (OECD 2015; Goldin and Katz 2008). That was not the case in Taiwan where a government policy that converted junior colleges to 4-year colleges and relaxed college entrance requirements increased college enrollments dramatically.Footnote 2 As a result, the college share of the workforce rose from 5 to 34% since 1980. The college share among the youngest workers was 74% by 2014. Such a rapid increase in the supply of college graduates should have outpaced technology growth and moderated income inequality.Footnote 3 Keng et al. (2017) confirmed that the wage premium of young college-educated workers did fall substantially so that the average return to college in 2014 was at the same level as in 1980. Nevertheless, household income inequality continued to rise. Our departure from past studies is to investigate how a rapid expansion of access to higher education affects both inequality in labor and in marriage markets. College access was expanded by raising the pass rate of the college entrance exam and by converting 2-year vocational colleges to 4-year colleges. As shown in Keng et al. (2017), these changes dictated by the Taiwan Ministry of Education resulted in dramatic increases in college access compared to the past, and so would be plausibly unanticipated and hence exogenous to an individual’s decision to enroll in colleges. Because the rollout of these national policies occurs gradually, they would have different effects across birth cohorts on expected college returns and educational plans. To show the linkage between increased college access and cohort lifetime plans, we divide the sample into 14 birth cohorts. For each cohort, we derive measures of the share of males and females obtaining a college degree, the proportion of employed cohort members who receive performance pay, and the proportion of married households that have two college-educated spouses or two high school-educated spouses. We regress each of these measures on the cohort-specific pass rate of the college entrance exam and the number of converted two-year vocational colleges at the time the cohort was age 18.Footnote 4 Table 1 shows that both measures of college access have a significant positive effect on the proportion of males and females with a college degree or above, with a slightly larger effect on the fraction of women getting a college degree. The share of workers with a performance pay job also rose significantly with the expansion of higher education. Finally, and key to the theme of our study, the cohort share of married households with two college-educated spouses increased while the share of married households with two high school educated spouses declined substantially. Expanding college access in Taiwan transformed the college composition of Taiwan’s labor and marriage markets and thus altered the distribution of household incomes. In this paper, we propose two factors that are highly correlated with the expansion of higher education and yet may have offset the equalizing effect of greater college access. First, the share of performance pay in total compensation grew as the successive birth cohorts attended college in rising proportions and exited with greater variation in the quality of their degrees. As shown by Lemieux et al. (2009), performance pay can increase compensation inequality. Second, women disproportionally benefited from the expansion of college access, and their labor force participation rose accordingly. Greenwood et al. (2016) showed that women’s earnings can strongly influence household income inequality through sorting in the marriage market. We test these propositions using data from the Taiwan Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (SFIE). Taiwan’s experience brings new insight to the potential effect of expanding college access on household income inequality, especially for developing countries planning to implement similar policies. We find that rising household income inequality can be tied to three forces. First, employers increasingly relied on bonus over the period with the share of wage earners receiving bonus pay increasing from 48% in 1980 to 71% in 2014. Second, women’s labor force participation rate rose from 39% in 1980 to 50% in 2014. The greatest increases in female labor force participation was among the most educated. Third, positive assortative mating on education combined with rising female labor force participation to add additional upward pressure on household income inequality. These forces outweighed the equalizing effects of rapidly rising college graduation which lowered the college wage premium for the youngest cohorts. Performance pay and positive assortative mating combine to explain 46.5% of the increase in household income inequality from 1980 to 2014, with increased use of bonuses accounting for 28.3% and the marriage market accounting for 18.2%. While it seems that expanding access to college should be a means of reducing income inequality in the presence of skill-biased technical change, Taiwan presents an example that income inequality can rise, even in a country experiencing one of the fastest expanding college labor forces among developed countries. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present a review of the relevant literature. In section III, we use a simple empirical model to estimate the contribution of performance pay and marriage market on the income inequality, followed by Section IV that examines the effect of assortative mating and married female labor force participation on inequality. Section V employs a decomposition approach to explore the contribution of the household composition to the rising income inequality. We conclude the paper in section VI.",1
17.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,07 February 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-018-9404-6,Women’s welfare and livelihoods outside of marriage: evidence from rural Tanzania,September 2019,Ayala Wineman,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Marital status can be an important determinant of living standards for women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In the development economics literature, women’s welfare outside of marriage is often examined through an analysis of gendered household headship (e.g., Appleton 1996; Horrell and Krishnan 2007; Quisumbing et al. 2001). However, this approach necessarily overlooks unmarried women who are not the household head. It further obscures the potentially divergent effects of widowhood and divorce—a theme not explored in studies that overwhelmingly focus on widowhood (Clark and Brauner-Otto 2015). In this paper, we begin to address this oversight by investigating the welfare outcomes of marriage exitFootnote 1for women in rural Tanzania, inclusive of the various ways a woman may lose or shed her married status. After marriage, a woman’s welfare may suffer if she loses access to land, a key factor of production in agricultural economies. In fact, a number of studies note that women in SSA commonly lose access to land or other assets when they become widowed (Chapoto et al. 2011; Peterman 2012). At the same time, women may implement coping mechanisms in response to their shifting circumstances. For example, in many developing countries, rural women comprise a significant share of the non-farm workforce (Fontana and Paciello 2010), and the incorporation of off-farm or non-farm activities into a livelihood portfolio may offset the income loss from reduced on-farm options. It is therefore worth evaluating how women’s welfare and livelihoods are influenced by a change in their marital status. In this paper, we first describe the frequency with which women in rural Tanzania find themselves ‘outside’ of marriage, whether through widowhood or divorce. We then investigate the following research questions: How do women’s consumption levels change after marriage exit, and does this pattern vary depending on whether a woman becomes divorced or widowed, or whether she becomes a household head or not? Similarly, how do measures of land access change after marriage exit? And, at the same time, how do women adjust their livelihood portfolios? These questions are explored through a regression analysis that controls for individual time-constant effects while accounting for changes in women’s marital status over time. As a preview of our results, we find that marriage exit (and widowhood, in particular) is associated with a higher likelihood of poverty. Upon marriage exit, women are also less likely to cite agriculture as their main occupation and more likely to derive income from various off-farm sources, including self-employment and both agricultural and non-agricultural wage labor. Only women who join other households do not seem to experience a significant decline in land access, suggesting that family networks may cushion the effects of being single, at least in this regard. We contribute to the existing literature on women’s livelihoods in developing countries in several ways. First, as noted, we consider the experience of marriage exit in rural Tanzania by exploiting a tracking survey that follows individuals, rather than households, over time. We therefore capture the outcomes for all women, including those who shift to (or form) new households after marriage exit. The use of a panel survey further allows us to control for individual fixed effects, unlike cross-sectional analyses of women’s welfare (e.g., van de Walle 2013). Second, we analyze marriage exit along two distinct axes, including how the marriage ended (widowhood or divorce) and a woman’s headship position within her post-marriage household. It is common for papers to focus on widowhood (Chapoto et al. 2011; Peterman 2012; van de Walle 2013), while divorce in SSA has attracted relatively little attention (Clark and Brauner-Otto 2015). Furthermore, we know of no other study that specifically considers the experiences of women who exit marriage and join another’s household. Third, in examining the livelihood strategies of women upon marriage exit, we extend the analysis of Chapoto et al. (2011) by looking beyond agriculture to consider all sources of income. This allows us to discern if and how women compensate for any land lost at the end of their marriage. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of the literature on women’s experiences outside of marriage in (primarily) rural SSA. This covers the topics of women’s welfare, as well as land access and participation in rural labor markets. Section 3 introduces the data set and methods used to evaluate our research questions. Section 4 presents descriptive and econometric results, along with a set of robustness checks using alternative variable definitions and model specifications. Section 5 includes a discussion of the econometric results, and Section 6 concludes.",

Evidence from Ireland,September 2019,Sanna Nivakoski,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"This article examines the presence of the exchange motive in intergenerational monetary transfers. The exchange motive is in operation if parents make transfers to their children in exchange for services. The main alternative explanation for intergenerational transfers is altruistic behaviour, meaning that parents derive utility from their children’s utility. The analysis aims to explore the existence of the exchange motive, by examining the link between child-provided services and transfers from parents to children. Cox and Rank (1992) suggest this approach but it has rarely been implemented in empirical work. In contrast, a more often-explored way to identify transfer motives is to estimate the effect of child income on the value of transfers. The difficulties with the latter approach are that the exchange motive can only be identified if the demand for child-provided services is own-price inelastic, and that it requires longitudinal data on the value of transfers and child income. For these reasons, this analysis adopts the former approach. This work expands on previous literature by using longitudinal data from two survey waves, and by examining whether the relationship between child-provided care and transfers differs depending on the size of the transfer. The data for this analysis are obtained from the first two waves of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), focusing on a sample of parent households who have non-resident adult children. Both kinds of monetary intergenerational transfers are modelled: inter vivos transfers (while parents are alive) and future transfers via bequests (after parents’ death). Data on the two transfer types are reported differently in the data: while the inter vivos transfer measure available in TILDA measures the transfers that parents are making to their children between the survey waves, the bequest data consists of respondents’ self-assessed probabilities of leaving a bequest at the end of life. In the analyses that follow, inter vivos transfers and bequests are modelled separately. The regressor of interest is the practical help that children provide to their parents with household chores and paperwork. Transfers from parents to their adult children are common even in developed countries with public income redistribution and public care provision. Kotlikoff and Summers (1981), Modigliani (1988), Gale and Scholz (1994), Piketty (2011) and Ohlsson et al. (2014) examine the magnitude of intergenerational transfers in the US and in Europe. They generally find that a large proportion of people’s wealth is passed on from one generation to the next, rather than accumulated over the individual’s life-cycle. Existing empirical evidence suggests that sizeable proportions of older households in the US and Europe receive informal care from their children—see Cox and Rank (1992), Norton and Van Houtven (2006) and Alessie et al. (2014). Examining the latest wave of the sample of TILDA data used in this analysis, 47% of parent households have made inter vivos transfers to their non-resident adult children over the past 2 years with a total unconditional mean value of just over EUR 4,000. Of the parent households, 90% expect to leave (a non-zero) inheritance and two-thirds expect to leave an inheritance worth EUR 150,000 or more. Nearly 40% of parent households received help from their children with household chores or paperwork over the past 2 years, with an unconditional mean of 6 h per month. In multivariate cross-sectional analysis, a positive and significant relationship between help and the probability of inter vivos transfers is found. The strength of the relationship is inversely related to the size of the transfer: it is only statistically significant in the case of small (between EUR 250 and EUR 5,000) transfers whereas it is not significant for larger transfers. Evidence of a causal relationship is necessary for identifying the exchange motive and differentiating it from two-way altruism (Cox and Rank 1992). The cross-sectional results are robust to the inclusion of a measure of the emotional closeness between the children and parents, proxy measures of the parents’ personality, and a lagged value of child-provided help. Because of the availability of only two waves of data, the scope of longitudinal analysis is restricted by the limited variability in the relevant measures over time. Though limited, the longitudinal data analysis enables the incorporation of fixed effects that account for unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity: factors such as preferences and the type of relationship between the parents and their children are likely to be correlated with within-family flows of both monetary transfers and services. In fixed effects estimates, even with limited variation available for identification of effects, the correlation between help provision and the probability of a transfer remains positive and statistically significant at the 10% level. Because bequest data were not collected in the first wave of TILDA, the analysis on the self-assessed probability of making future transfers via bequests is restricted to Wave 2 data. A cross-sectional examination of the probability of future bequests reveals no relationship with help provided by children. As the relationship between help and bequests is insignificant in cross-sectional analysis, an endogeneity-corrected estimate of the relationship is likely to be even less significant. The analysis of the bequest data has its limitations because parents who report a high probability of leaving a bequest may simply be risk averse, uncertain about their individual mortality risk, or a homeowner (with illiquid wealth)—therefore expecting to reach the end of life with positive wealth, rather than explicitly wishing to transfer that wealth to their children. These findings support the hypotheses of McGarry (1999) and Bernheim and Severinov (2003), who suggest that inter vivos transfers are better suited to exchange, and therefore are likely not to be influenced by the same motives as bequests. The finding that the exchange motive only drives small inter vivos transfers is also consistent with this prediction: if transfers are made in small quantities, they can be made more frequently which in turn makes the enforcement of the contract between the parent and the child easier. Another possible explanation for the finding that child-provided help is found to only be associated with small transfers (but not with large transfers or the likelihood of future bequests) is the time disconnect between reports of the help and the transfers. In the first wave of data analysed in this paper, help and small inter vivos transfers are recorded over the preceding two years, whereas large inter vivos transfers are recorded over the preceding decade. The probability of leaving a bequest, by definition, relates to transfers made at the end of life. If transfers in the form of bequests are driven by exchange motives, the identification of such activity would possibly require data about the interactions between parents and children spanning decades. Intergenerational transfers play a role in saving behaviour and decisions about investment in human and physical capital. They affect the distribution of wealth within families and have an impact on the equality of opportunities between individuals. From a public policy point of view, understanding the motives behind transfer behaviour is relevant for predicting the likely consequences of changes to public provision of care, taxation of estates and gifts and public income redistribution. Depending on what motivates intergenerational transfers, changes to public income distribution may either crowd out or reinforce private flows of intergenerational monetary transfers (Cox 1987; Cox and Rank 1992). The remainder of this article is structured as follows: Section 2 summarises the existing theoretical and empirical literatures. Section 3 describes the data and provides summary statistics. Section 4 presents the empirical findings, while Section 5 offers concluding remarks.",9

A substantial literature finds evidence of adverse impacts of divorce on mental and physical health (Waite and Gallagher 2000; Hughes and Waite 2009; Bronselaer et al. 2008). Married persons have health advantages that vary by gender, health outcome, as well as the duration of marriage. Marriage has been linked to lower risks of mortality, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Lillard and Waite 1995; Goodwin et al. 1987; Reczek et al. 2016). Despite evidence relating marriage to health, few studies correlate health transitions with divorce and remarriage at middle and older ages. Those that do find more evidence of changes in mental than physical health following divorce (Hughes and Waite 2009, p. 344). Even fewer use prospective data to track health transitions of respondents who undergo marital transitions in middle and older ages, the purpose of the present paper.Footnote 1 This study investigates whether divorcing later in life is associated with deteriorating health using the first 10 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS has followed middle-aged and elderly individuals since 1992.Footnote 2 The HRS follows couples longitudinally even when they are no longer married, providing a unique opportunity to compare changes in spouses’ health following divorce. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe differences between spouses, within couples, in health transitions following divorce or remarriage. Our research questions include: Do people who divorce at middle and older ages experience greater declines in physical and mental health than their married same-sex counterparts? Do changes in health associated with divorce and remarriage differ between men and women? Are divorce and remarriage associated with changes in health trajectories? What mechanisms link divorce and health? Following couples, do wives differ from their husbands in the physical and mental health transitions they experience following divorce and remarriage at middle and older ages? The next section summarizes theories and evidence linking divorce to health with a focus on longitudinal evidence. Section 3 describes the data and empirical approach. Summary statistics and results from multivariate models are presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.",6

The literature refers to this life satisfaction difference as the ‘cohabitation gap’ (Stavrova et al. 2012; Stavrova and Fetchenhauer 2015). Some researchers suggest that the cohabitation gap is due to a selection mechanism, as cohabiting partners differ from those who marry in a number of sociodemographic characteristics which are impactful for life satisfaction, such as economic attainment (Stutzer and Frey 2006; Jepsen and Jepsen 2006) and personality traits (Clarkberg et al. 1995). Other researchers acknowledge that cohabitation entails a lower level of commitment and public recognition than marriage (Brown and Booth 1996; Wiik et al. 2009, 2012), and that cohabiting partners face fewer barriers should they desire to dissolve their unions (Kurdek 1998). These aspects of cohabitation are surmised to reduce the quality of the relationship and its ensuing satisfaction, compared with legal marriage. The association of gender with the cohabitation gap has been examined in a few studies (Brown et al. 2015; Rhoades et al. 2009). Both the cohabitation gap and the gender differences in the cohabitation gap are reported to vary by cultural context (Hansen et al. 2007; Pirani and Vignoli 2016; Soons and Kalmijn 2009). More recently, the cohabitation gap is found to vary by the degree of gender specialization imbedded in a society (Mikucka 2016). No attention has been paid to the association of sexual orientation with the cohabitation gap. But, previous literature provides several reasons to expect that the cohabitation gap varies by the sex composition of the unions. First, the sameness of sex between the partners to a married or cohabiting union affects the extent of specialization within the household (Becker 1981, 1985; Jepsen and Jepsen 2006). The benefits of marriage over unmarried cohabitation is suggested to reside in the greater incentive it provides for within household specialization (Bardasi and Taylor 2008; Davis et al. 2007; Hersch 2009). With greater specialization, the efficiency of a household and its utility increase (Becker 1981, 1985). Assuming a cardinal utility significance for life satisfaction scores (Binder and Freytag 2013; Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Frijters 2004; Ng 1992, 1997), this increased utility translates itself to a higher self-reported life satisfaction. The lower comparative advantage entailed by the sameness of sex implies that homosexual couples are likely to specialize less. There are studies which provide empirical evidence for a lower level of specialization in same-sex couples (Ahmed et al. 2011; Jepsen and Jepsen 2006; Giddings et al. 2014). This lower specialization diminishes the utility gain ensuing from marriage compared with unmarried cohabitation. Hence, all else equal, the cohabitation gap in life satisfaction is expected to be lower among homosexuals. Second, in spite of the increasing prevalence and perceived normalization of unmarried cohabitation, many societies’ informal norms attribute a greater status and a higher legitimacy to legal marriage over other types of intimate partnership arrangements (Le Bourdais and Lapierre-Adamcyk 2004; Nazio and Blossfeld 2003). It is well documented that the tendency to conform to social norms is greater in women (Diener et al. 2000; Soons and Kalmijn 2009), who incur a larger satisfaction loss following the stances of non-conformity (Mikucka 2016). From this perspective, the cohabitation gap is likely to be smaller for lesbians, presumed to have a lower inclination to conform to social norms than heterosexual women (Rottnek 1999; Toomey et al. 2010). Third, the level of commitment in unmarried cohabitation is reported to vary by gender, with women generally more committed to the relationship in unmarried cohabitation than men (Eggebeen 2005; Kwang et al. 2013; Wolfinger and Wilcox 2008). The existence of two male partners in a gay male couple may exercise a negative influence on the implied commitment level of the cohabitation and reduce its satisfaction, compared with legal marriage (Kurdek 2000; Peplau and Fingerhut 2007). Considering the above factors, this paper is conceived around the premise that the cohabitation gap varies by the sex composition of the unions. Sexual orientation scholarship has been constrained by data availability. Previously, the relationship between sexual orientation and life satisfaction has only been examined using probability samples from the US, the UK and Australia (Blanchflower and Oswald 2004; Chakraborty et al. 2011; Powdthavee and Wooden 2015). But, same-sex marriage was not legally recognized in these countries at the time of data collection. Hence, these studies are not informative on the cohabitation gap. The Canadian context provides a unique opportunity for examining this question. In July 2005, same-sex marriage became legally recognized across Canada. Thus, for more than ten years, both legal marriage and unmarried cohabitation were possible options for Canadian homosexuals. In parallel, nearly all the cycles of the Canadian General Social Survey contain a life satisfaction question. This paper uses Canadian data of 2010 to 2015 to examine the influence of the legal status of the unions on life satisfaction by sexual orientation for the first time. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section II reviews the related literature. Section III presents the data and the descriptive statistics. Section IV outlines the methodology. The results are reported in Section V. The next section is concerned with the robustness and sensitivity of the results. The concluding remarks follow.",12

In addition, they have been a means to protect the welfare state from benefit claims, by balancing (tax) benefits for married couples with (post-)marital duties. Even after the introduction of ‘no-fault divorce’ in the 20th century, alimony regulations were preserved, and some countries such as Canada and Brazil further introduced alimony claims for non-married couples upon separation, this way harmonizing the legal rights of marital and non-marital unions. The 2008 alimony reform in Germany, in contrast, harmonized the rulings for married and non-married couples from the opposite direction, by reducing the entitlements for married couples. In this paper, we analyze the behavioral responses of married couples to this reform in terms of labor supply, the intra-household allocation of leisure, and marital stability. The empirical investigation of such effects is crucial to assess the longer-term consequences of the reform. When female labor force participation does not increase, the objective of increased economic post-marital self-responsibility cannot be reached and the state might be forced to compensate a part of the reduced alimony payments in terms of unemployment benefits or social welfare. Since alimony payments have been mostly received by women and paid by men, opposed reactions of men and women to the reform are expected. From the perspective of a labor supply model, the alimony reform translates into a negative income effect for women, who can now expect less post-marital and caregiver alimony upon divorce. Therefore, women’s labor supply is expected to increase as to balance the adverse effect, while their leisure should decrease. For men, the income effect works in the opposite direction, i.e., the increased income after the reform is expected to reduce men’s labor supply. However, as alimony payments depend on men’s income, the substitution effect associated with the alimony reform would induce men to increase their labor supply, so that the overall effect on men’s labor supply is ambiguous. Intra-household bargaining models further suggest that the shift of financial resources from wives to husbands in the case of divorce changes the intra-household allocation of resources even within marriage. Transferring leisure (or other goods) from women to men could balance the altered options outside marriage, such that the decision to divorce would not be affected. However, if the assumptions of transferable utility and low-cost bargaining are not fulfilled, the divorce rate could also increase, because men face lower alimony payments, or decrease, because less women file for divorce due to the increased financial consequences. The expected effect of the reform on separation rates is therefore ambiguous. Previous studies on changes in divorce law have mainly focused on evaluating the effects of the introduction of the ‘no-fault’ or ‘unilateral divorce’Footnote 1, showing that individuals indeed react to such reforms. Friedberg (1998) and Wolfers (2006) find increases in divorce rates after the introduction of unilateral divorce in the USA. For a panel of European countries, González and Viitanen (2009) obtain similar results, and find even stronger effects for the introduction of no-fault divorce schemes. Further studies show that divorce laws can also affect outcomes other than the divorce rate. Peters (1986), for example, finds no effect of the introduction of unilateral divorce in the USA on divorce rates or fertility, but on female labor force participation, divorce settlement payments and remarriage rates. Gray (1998) analyzes heterogeneous effects by type of marital property regime and shows that with community-property law, the bargaining position of women improved with the introduction of unilateral divorce and led women to decrease their home production and increase their leisure, while opposite effects are found under separate property systems. Focusing on alternative measures of bargaining power, Stevenson and Wolfers (2006) demonstrate that the introduction of unilateral divorce in the USA had a negative effect on domestic violence, suicides, and homicides with female victims. Brassiolo (2016) finds decreased domestic violence as a result from facilitations of divorce in Spain. For the European case as a whole, Kneip und Bauer (2007) show that the introduction of unilateral divorce led to rising divorce rates and thereby increased female labor force participation and lowered fertility. Analyses of the behavioral responses to changes in alimony law, however, are relatively scarce. Exceptions are Rangel (2006) and Chiappori et al. (2017), who investigate the effects of the introduction of alimony claims for cohabiting couples in Brazil and Canada, respectively. Both studies apply difference-in-difference analyses using couples who were not affected by the reform as control groups. The authors find that, as expected by theory, those women who benefitted from the reform decreased their labor supply, at least at the intensive margin. Rangel (2006) finds reductions in women’s working hours by 3%. Chiappori et al. (2017) show that for women who were surprised by the reform, the probability to work full-time decreased by 4.7% points, while no such effects, or even reversed patterns, are found for couples that were formed after the legal change, possibly because of changes at the matching stage. At the extensive margin, i.e., for women’s labor force participation, neither of the two studies finds significant changes. The result of stronger reactions at the intensive rather than the extensive margin of labor supply is confirmed by Altindag et al. (2017), who study shifts in the intra-household allocation of market work and housework as a response to the introduction of joint custody law in the USA. The authors find that mothers increased their working hours and fathers decreased their household work by 8% each. Mothers’ probability to work, however, was not affected by the reform. With respect to the introduction of alimony claims for cohabiting couples in Brazil, Rangel (2006) further shows that the years of schooling of first-born daughters of these couples increased and that cohabiting women significantly reduced their housekeeping activities. For men, he does not find corresponding changes in working or housekeeping activities. For the Canadian case, Chiappori et al. (2017) reveal that those couples who were surprised by the reform were less likely to get married and the cohabitation period was longer, while the total duration of the relationship was not affected. The fact that divorce laws play an important role at the matching stage has also been shown for the USA. Wong (2016) uses the introduction of homemaking provisions that take into account the spouses’ contribution to household production for property division after divorce and shows that this let marriage rates to increase by up to 10%. For Germany, empirical evidence on the behavioral response to changes in alimony law is even rarer. In the year following the 2008 reform, the Bertelsmann Foundation conducted a survey on the public awareness of the changes in alimony law, and on the reactions to and the opinion on the reform. Overall, 16% of the 1560 interviewed persons (from randomly drawn households with children up to age 25) had not heard about the reform, 57% had at least heard about it, and 17% reported to know details. The results further reveal that men evaluated the reform more positively than women. However, both men and women stated that the reform had incentivized them to increase their labor supply and to share childcare and paid labor in a more egalitarian way (Bertelsmann Stiftung 2009, pp. 7, 9, 11, 12). In terms of causal evaluations, the study by Fahn et al. (2016) represents the only quantitative analysis of the effects of the German alimony reform so far. Using administrative vital statistics as well as data from the German Microcensus, the authors find that the abolition of caregiver alimony for married parents with children above the age of three years led to a decrease in relative in-wedlock fertility and fewer marriages. We contribute to this literature by evaluating couples’ behavioral responses to the reform more broadly. In contrast to the reforms investigated in the previous literature, the 2008 alimony reform in Germany did not introduce new alimony claims, but rather reduced the entitlements for married couples, this way changing the expected financial situation after divorce. Unlike Fahn et al. (2016), we do not only focus on the changes in caregiver alimony, but more generally on different types of alimony payments after divorce. Accordingly, we do not exclusively target couples’ outcomes such as separation or divorce but include analyses on individual adaptations to the reform in terms of labor supply and leisure. In the empirical analysis, we use the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and apply a difference-in-difference model to estimate spouses’ reactions to the reform. As the reform was universal in the sense that it changed the legal basis for all (back then) current and future alimony payments after divorce, without any cut-off rules or other exogenous variation, our aim is not to disentangle the overall causal effect of the reform. Rather, we focus on analyzing differences in the behavioral response of never-married cohabiting couples and couples who had first married in the years before the 2008 reform and were then ‘surprised’ by the new ruling. Accordingly, our results provide evidence on the short-term effects on those who were already married before the reform, while they do not tell us anything about the long-term effects on couples who were formed after the reform. We further explore the heterogeneous effects of the reform by conducting sub-sample regressions for different groups of individuals. Overall, we do not find strong behavioral responses in terms of intra-household time allocation. In particular, female labor supply did not increase significantly, and no shifts of leisure from women to men are found. We do find some evidence that the reform increased the separation rate of married couples, but this effect vanishes once unobserved heterogeneity at the couple level is controlled for. The remainder of this article is structured as follows: In Section 2, we describe the main features of the German alimony law and of the 2008 reform and derive its expected effects based on different theoretical approaches. The empirical strategy and the data used are described in Section 3. In Section 4, we present our estimation results, and Section 5 concludes.",3

Recent studies have evaluated the consequences of the economic downturn for different demographic aspects – for example, emancipation from the parental home (Becker et al. 2010; Matsudaira 2016), divorce (González-Val and Marcén 2017) or marriage (Berghammer and Sobotka 2016). This paper focuses on the potential impact of the high levels of job insecurity caused by the recession on fertility decisions across Europe. From a theoretical point of view, the impact of an economic downturn on the probability of having children can be negative, positive or null. First, a bad economy could reduce fertility, because increased levels of job insecurity could exacerbate the economic constraints facing couples, making the cost of having a child more difficult to bear (Adsera 2005; Andersson 2000; Ben-Porath 1973; Lindo 2015; Macunovich 1995; Mincer 1963). Such a mechanism may be aggravated if an ‘added-worker effect’ is in place and women try to compensate in the labour market for their partners’ loss of income (Starr 2014; Bredtmann et al. 2018). Moreover, the economic stress associated with high levels of job insecurity may result in a decision to postpone the decision to have a child, or not even consider it (Catalano et al. 2011; Sobotka et al. 2011). Economic uncertainty can also reduce relationship quality, rendering childbearing less likely (Schneider et al. 2016).Footnote 1 Furthermore, stress is found to make conception more difficult (Buck Louis et al. 2010) and to increase the possibility of miscarriage (Burton and Jauniaux 2004; Nepomnaschy et al. 2006). Thus, if such income and economic stress effects dominate, we should observe a negative association between the probability of having children and increasing job insecurity.Footnote 2 Second, it is also true that the opportunity cost of having a child is much lower when the labour market has little to offer potential parents (Butz and Ward 1979). If this effect dominates, women could trade in low wages and few prospects in the labour market for the possibility of providing their own childcare. In this case, we could find a positive relationship between worsening economic conditions and the number of children being born. Moreover, because women’s earnings are typically lower than men’s, a bad economy may be viewed as a good moment to move away from the labour market (especially if the female unemployment rate is increasing more than the male). This may be especially the case where the welfare state is generous and benefits provide a high replacement rate (as in the Nordic countries within Europe). Furthermore, in countries where women are more likely to provide their own childcare (rather than rely on different childcare options or even a partner), such substitution effects can be strong, rendering a positive relationship between fertility and bad economic conditions.Footnote 3 Finally, it could also be the case that a bad economy and the associated high levels of unemployment and job precariousness have no impact on fertility decisions. Given that in Europe, women tend to postpone their fertility much more than in other contexts, it is also possible that couples decide to move on with their childbearing choices, independently of the economic environment, once they feel that fertility cannot be postponed any longer. If this ticking biological clock effect is operating, we will not observe any impact of the Great Recession on fertility in Europe (Bellido and Marcén 2016).Footnote 4 All in all, and a priori, we cannot know which of the aforementioned effects is dominant, and so the impact of the Great Recession on fertility decisions in Europe is an empirical question that I address below. Gaining a better understanding of the relationship between job insecurity and fertility in Europe is important, because it allows us to learn about the relationship between the business cycle and the number and quality of children.Footnote 5 It can also help with predictions for future tax revenue, the requirements of welfare programmes and the rhythm at which societies age. It enables us to learn more about labour force behaviour. And, among many other things, it allows understanding of the extent to which women can complete their fertility in relation to the economic environment. My findings are based on data for 31 European countries from the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) and the European Union - Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) for the period 2004–2015. In a first stage of the analysis, I use the EU-LFS to build 10 indicators that can be thought of as proxies for the business cycle and/or the macroeconomic conditions. Five are intended as objective measures and include, for example, the unemployment rate, the percentage of individuals in a temporary contract and the ratio of jobless individuals who transited into unemployment because they were made redundant. However, given the complexity of the Great Recession and the uncertainty it generated, I also build five more indicators that may be said to capture perceptions of economic insecurity and serve as proxies for the economic environment where fertility decisions are taken. For example, I use the percentage of individuals with a temporary contract who state that they could not find a permanent job, the proportion of workers who are looking for a job while working because of the high risk of job loss, and the ratio of unemployed who have given up job-seeking because they believe no work is available.Footnote 6 In a second stage, I aggregate the aforementioned indicators at the country and sub-country regional level for each of the years under analysis, and merge this information with individual data from the EU-SILC. This way, I take full advantage of the rich information on the labour market contained in the EU-LFS, while being able to exploit the richness of individual and household characteristics of the EU-SILC.Footnote 7 To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to combine both datasets in order to gain a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between fertility and job insecurity, while using a large number of indicators. This paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between fertility and the Great Recession in Europe in several important ways. First, it is not based on aggregated data at the country level, as is the case with the vast majority of studies cited (see literature review below). My analysis is the first to rely on individual data, which allow the heterogeneity behind the trends observed at the aggregated level to be revealed. This is important in order to gain a more nuanced understanding of the impact of the local macroeconomic conditions on fertility behaviour.Footnote 8 Second, I not only rely on structural measures of the economic environment, but also consider perceptions of the state of the economy. Finally, I provide an analysis by subgroup, in order to understand if the impact of the Great Recession has been different for different groups and in different contexts. The main results show that not all indicators of job insecurity have an unequivocally negative association with fertility. Unemployment, long-term unemployment and the impossibility of finding a full-time job are the three indicators that most clearly have a negative relationship with the probability of having a baby. However, the results differ by age, gender and especially country cluster, highlighting the large differences in institutional arrangements for childbearing across Europe. Moreover, the results show a social gradient in terms of the chances of starting a family (or expanding it), depending on socio-economic background: in particular, low-income households and those of non-EU immigrant origin have suffered the most from the Great Recession in terms of their fertility decisions. After this introduction, the paper continues as follows. The next section reviews the literature on the influence of the business cycle on fertility decisions during the Great Recession. Section 3 presents the datasets and gives details of the different job insecurity indicators. Section 4 introduces the econometric technique used throughout the paper. Section 5 shows my main results, and finally, the conclusions briefly summarize the most important findings.",11
17.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,02 July 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-019-09458-x,The demand for child care subsidies under rationing,December 2019,Julio J. Guzman,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) became the main source of funding for child care subsidies in the U.S. after the 1996 welfare reform. Although this fund has more than doubled in the past twenty years, it is still unable to meet the increasing demand for subsidies caused by the welfare reform, which encouraged families to move from welfare to work. Since these subsidies are not entitled, there is rationing, i.e. not all eligible families who demand a subsidy receive one (GAO 2016). In the presence of rationing a combination of demand- and supply-side factors play a role in determining subsidy utilization (Herbst and Tekin 2012). In this case, the propensity to receive a subsidy is no longer determined by only the “demand” side. As a result, the parameter estimates derived from a subsidy receipt equation cannot reveal the underlying preferences for child care subsidies unless more structure is added to the model. Generally previous studies do not distinguish among these factors and instead estimate their net effect on subsidy receipt (see e.g. Durfee and Meyers 2006; and Blau and Tekin 2007). From a policy perspective, it is important to disentangle whether the low take-up rate of child care subsidies is more influenced by limited funding, state subsidy policies, barriers to subsidy access, or families choosing to opt out of the subsidies. In particular, the presence of rationing generates a latent demand for subsidies, defined as the sum of: (1) those receiving subsidies, (2) those rationed out, and (3) those discouraged from applying because they did not think they had a good chance of receiving subsidies (Witte and Queralt 2002). Families in (1) are directly observable, since they correspond to actual beneficiaries. Families in (2) correspond to families put in waiting lists and then, they could be observed in states that keep records of waiting lists. However, families in (3) are not observable, because they correspond to a counterfactual scenario; families that would decide to apply for the subsidy if there were no rationing conditions. To estimate the number of those families, we need to build a model that allows us to construct this counterfactual scenario. This paper contributes in this respect by modeling the mothers’ decision to apply for a child care subsidy as a partially strategic game, in which mothers consider their probability of being rationed out of the subsidy when they decide whether or not to apply. Thus the mothers’ decision to apply depends on what they think the subsidy agency will do. I estimate the model via a Maximum Likelihood approach using data from 13 over-sampled states from the National Survey of America’s Families (NSAF).Footnote 1 The results enable us to separately estimate the effects of demand- and supply-side variables on subsidy receipt, to estimate the direct and indirect effects of rationing on subsidy utilization, and to simulate the effect of different subsidy policies. The model also permits for the estimation of the latent demand for subsidies, which includes families discouraged from applying who would demand a subsidy if there were no rationing in the subsidy receipt, and to estimate an upper-bound for the demand for subsidies under the most favorable rules for applicants. The existing literature focuses mainly on three aspects of child care: price, quality, and availability (Vandelannoote et al. 2015). The price literature highlights the monetary costs of child care, estimating child care price elasticities of employment (see Blau 2003; and Morrissey 2017 for a summary of studies estimating these elasticities). The quality literature examines the purchase of child care quality as one of the critical elements to be considered (e.g. Blau and Hagy 1998; and the studies cited in Kalb 2009). Meanwhile, the availability literature focuses on the supply restrictions arising from the lack of public or subsidized child care, mostly in European countries (e.g. Del Boca and Vuri 2007; Wrohlich 2008; Vandelannoote et al. 2015; and Brilli et al. 2016). Specifically Wrohlich (2008) estimates the excess demand for subsidized child care in Germany, while Vandelannoote et al. (2015) estimate the perceived supply probabilities of child care for each family in their model using data from Belgium. In these two studies the authors only observe child care utilization, which is the joint outcome of two unobserved binary elements: a family demanding child care services and a local provider supplying a subsidized spot. As a result, to estimate the demand- and supply-side child care equations separately, they must rely on a partial observability probit framework in the style of Poirier (1980). This article fits into the availability branch of child care literature. It exploits the properties of the data from the NSAF survey, which allows us to know whether a family applied for a child care subsidy and did not receive it, or simply chose to opt out of the subsidy by not applying. Hence, these data enable us to calculate the rationing status for each applicant family in the sample. Thus we can separately estimate the demand and supply for child care subsidies. Policy simulations using the estimated model suggest that the latent demand for subsidies is 16% larger than the observed demand in the sample. In other words, if the subsidy were an entitled benefit, 16% more qualified families would apply for the subsidy in those 13 states. In this case, subsidy utilization would increase from 9 to 13% of the selected sample. The combined effect of eliminating rationing, increasing the income limit to the federal maximum limit, reducing copayments, and decreasing barriers for application would imply an upper-bound for the applying rate and subsidy utilization rate of about 23%. These results indicate that even under these more favorable conditions, a significant fraction of families would still not demand a subsidy. Thus it is more affordable to alleviate this program’s prolonged underfunding than generally assumed since most of those who qualify would still opt out. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes child care subsidies under the CCDF program. Section 3 models the propensity of receiving a child-care subsidy under rationing. Section 4 presents the econometric model. Section 5 describes the data and the selected sample used to estimate the model. Section 6 discusses the estimation results and the policy simulations. Section 7 concludes.",1

Self-employment may be a route into the labour market for individuals who would like to make a living in a new country; moreover, immigrants who start their own businesses may also offer employment opportunities for other immigrants. Research has shown there are differences in self-employment rates between the foreign-born population and natives in several OECD countries.Footnote 1 Much research has been devoted to explanations behind these observed differences, and scholars have attributed these differences to such factors as discrimination in wage-employment, traditions from the home country, the existence of ethnic enclaves, and family traditions.Footnote 2 This paper presents new knowledge regarding immigrant self-employment by focusing on self-employed immigrants and their employees in Sweden. Regarding employees of self-employed individuals with an immigrant background, Henley (2005) shows that in the UK, self-employed individuals from ethnic minority groups are less likely to hire employees than self-employed natives are, while Clark et al. (2017) show that self-employed immigrants with a recent year of arrival are less likely to have employees than self-employed immigrants who arrived earlier. In the US, Fairlie and Miranda (2017) show that self-employed individuals from certain ethnic groups, such as Asians and Hispanics, have a higher probability of hiring employees in their firms than natives are. Furthermore, Fairlie and Miranda (2017) have found that female-owned businesses are less likely to hire employees than male-owned businesses are. Furthermore, the literature has shown that a common culture between managers and workers may facilitate communication and increase productivity.Footnote 3 Empirical studies have focused on the extent to which managers hire workers with a background similar to their own, and workers to whom they are socially connected. In the US, Bandiera et al. (2009) and Giuliano et al. (2009) have documented biases in hiring and that managers’ origin matters for recruitment patterns. Åslund et al. (2014) have reported similar results in Sweden. Against this background, we have different reasons for conducting a study that focuses on the employees of self-employed immigrants in Sweden. First, integration problems encountered by non-European immigrants in entering the Swedish labour market are well documented.Footnote 4 Furthermore, high rates of self-employment for certain groups of non-European immigrants have also been documented.Footnote 5 Accordingly, the policy relevance of studying the employees of self-employed immigrants is evident. If self-employed immigrants employ other immigrants, especially those who have problems entering the labour market, they will play an important role in the integration process of immigrants in the labour market. In a previous study Andersson and Wadensjö (2009) have illustrated that both self-employed natives and self-employed immigrants in Sweden are likely to employ workers of their own nationality in their firms.Footnote 6 We contribute knowledge to this field since we are focusing on the extent to which self-employed immigrants from different regions employ certain groups of immigrants, such as immigrants from their own group, recently arrived immigrants and immigrants with different educational attainments in their firms. We also explore the extent to which there are differences between self-employed male and female immigrants and between self-employed immigrants with different times of arrival in Sweden regarding these issues. Accordingly, our study highlights several dimensions of immigrant self-employment and the role self-employed immigrants play in the process of integrating immigrants into the labour market. Our study is supported by unique matched employer-employee data obtained from Statistics Sweden for the year 2014. We focus on unincorporated firms with single owners.Footnote 7 Because those firms are usually small and typically have an owner-manager structure, it makes the owners more likely to be involved in the recruitment process than owners of incorporated firms. Our results reveal that non-European immigrants are more likely to have employees in their firms than natives and European immigrants are. Furthermore, immigrants are more likely to have immigrants as employees in the firms than natives are. Non-European immigrants are most likely to hire recently arrived non-European immigrants with low education as employees. Males are more likely to have employees in their firms than females are, but self-employed females are more likely to employ other females. This is the case for all immigrant groups as well as for natives. Self-employment among immigrants may therefore play an important role in the integration process, since being employed by an immigrant may be a route into the Swedish labour market for newly arrived immigrants. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The immigrant population in Sweden is described in Section 2. Section 3 contains the data; Section 4 explains the empirical strategy. Section 5 offers some descriptive statistics, and Section 6 presents the results. Finally, Section 7 concludes.",15

18.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,28 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-019-09471-0,Is the basic life-cycle theory of consumption becoming more relevant? Evidence from Portugal,March 2020,Fernando Alexandre,Pedro Bação,Miguel Portela,Male,Male,Male,Male,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to report estimates of a life-cycle consumption profile for Portuguese households allowing for time and cohort effects. We find a much flatter life-cycle consumption profile than the profiles reported in the literature for other countries—see, e.g. Alessie and Ree (2009) for the Netherlands, Banks et al. (2016) for the UK, and Gourinchas and Parker (2002), Aguiar and Hurst (2013) and Fernández-Villaverde and Krueger (2007) for the USA. In the present paper we focus exclusively on estimating a life-cycle consumption profile, in the vein of Fernández-Villaverde and Krueger (2007). In this context, consumption is modelled as the result of three effects: age, time and cohort. Age effects correspond to the life cycle: how consumption varies as individuals grow older. Time effects correspond to the “business cycle”: the economic conditions prevailing in each year may induce more or less consumption relative to average consumption. While time effects are temporary, cohort effects represent permanent effects on average lifetime consumption related to the period during which an individual is active. For example, individuals that entered the labour market in 1980 faced a very different environment than individuals that entered the labour market in 2000, with consequences for lifetime consumption. The estimation of cohort effects attempts to quantify such differences. It must be noted that, during the twentieth century, Portugal went through a process of growth and structural transformation. The main transformations occurred in the final quarter of the twentieth century, decades after the more advanced European countries. The drivers of that transformation were democracy and the accession to the European Union. The creation of a universal welfare state in Portugal took place after the democratic regime was installed. The development of financial markets accelerated during the 1980s, and greatly benefited from the participation in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Expenditure on education and health increased substantially. One of the most visible consequences of this evolution was the increase in life expectancy—according to data from PORDATAFootnote 1, life expectancy for women rose from 66.4 years in 1960 to 83.4 years in 2016. All these factors are relevant for consumption choices over the life cycle and make Portugal an interesting subject of research. The behaviour of consumption has been one of the most controversial issues in the debate about the causes and consequences of the dismal performance of the Portuguese economy in the twenty-first century. The drop in the level of aggregate savings is a proximate cause of the external imbalances that led to the bailout of 2011—see, e.g. Reis (2013), Baldwin et al. (2015) and Alexandre et al. (2017)—as it had been of the previous two interventions of the IMF in Portugal (in 1977 and in 1983/84). Understanding consumption behaviour is therefore an important issue for the Portuguese economy. Previously reported life-cycle profiles of consumption in Portugal have been based on a cross-section of household data—see Alves and Cardoso (2010) and Banco de Portugal (2018). The use of just a cross-section to estimate the life-cycle profile of expenditure makes the time effects irrelevant, but confounds the life-cycle and cohort effects. The procedure we use to separate the three effects follows Fernández-Villaverde and Krueger (2007), which is based on the framework developed by Deaton and co-authors—see Deaton (1997) and the references therein. To that end, we use microdata extracted from household budget surveys to construct a pseudopanel that follows cohorts over time. The pseudopanel includes a measure of consumption (the median consumption of the cohort in each year), besides cohort (defined by the year of birth of the reference person) and time (year of the survey) dummies—details are provided in Section 3. Other studies that employ a similar procedure are Zhou (2012) for China, Jappelli (1999) for Italy, Alessie and Ree (2009) for the Netherlands, Banks et al. (1998) for the UK, Attanasio and Weber (1995), Attanasio (1998), Gourinchas and Parker (2002), Aguiar and Hurst (2013), and Lim and Zeng (2016) for the USA, and Banks et al. (2016) for both the UK and the USA. Our study also contributes to the issue of the empirical adequacy of the life-cycle/permanent income consumption theory—see the surveys in Browning and Crossley (2001) and Attanasio and Weber (2010). This theory predicts that the consumer will try to smooth consumption over the life cycle. In the simplest models, the slope of the (linear) consumption profile will depend on the comparison between the interest rate and the rate of discount (time preference). As discussed in the surveys mentioned above, there are other versions of the model that consider issues such as end-of-life uncertainty, bequests and liquidity constraints. These versions may produce a hump-shaped consumption profile, as found, for example, in Fernández-Villaverde and Krueger (2007) and Gourinchas and Parker (2002). In line with previous results based on cross-sectional data (Alves and Cardoso 2010; Banco de Portugal 2018), our estimated consumption profiles for the Portuguese households appear to be much flatter than the usual estimates. In this sense, our results are closer to what the life-cycle theory of consumption predicts. However, consumption of older households, namely those over sixty years old, tends to decrease, as has been reported in the literature—see, e.g. Banks et al. (1998, 2016). The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data from the Household Expenditure and Budget Surveys for Portugal. In Section 3, we describe the methodology to identify the life cycle, the cohort and the business cycle effects. In Section 4, we present the estimates of the life-cycle consumption profile, as well as of cohort and business cycle effects on households’ consumption. Section 5 concludes and suggests some hypotheses that may be investigated by future research on the flatter life-cycle profile found for Portuguese households.",1

Motivated by the increase in civil conflicts, there has been an increasing interest in understanding the role of violent conflict, war, and terrorism in fertility decisions.Footnote 1 For example, Lindstrom and Berhanu (1999), Agadjanian and Prata (2002), and Woldemicael (2008) find that interstate conflict in developing countries is associated with lower fertility, including teenage childbearing.Footnote 2 Yet, there is little rigorous empirical evidence estimating the causal effects of violence on fertility. An exception is Berrebi and Ostwald (2015), who use an instrumental variables approach and find that terrorist attacks reduce the total fertility rate in developed but not in developing countries. This paper contributes to the literature by rigorously exploring the effect of the unanticipated increase in drug-related violent crime in Mexico between 2007 and 2010 on teenage pregnancy. Our focus on teenage pregnancy is motivated by the fact that teenage fertility is widely believed to be a primary driver of adverse long-run socioeconomic outcomes and is of great policy concern in reducing poverty and empowering women, especially in developing countries with high adolescent fertility rates (Ardington et al. 2015; Branson et al. 2015). Mexico, despite a reduction in total fertility rates from about 3.5 in early 1990s to 2.3 in 2013, has high teenage fertility rates. Teenage fertility rate (that is, total number of live births per 1000 women ages 15–19) in Mexico in 2005 was significantly higher than the OECD countries and the US (73.4 vs. 30.2 and 41.1, respectively) (WDI 2017). Moreover, in Mexico, Arceo-Gomez and Campos-Vazquez (2014) find that teenage pregnancy is associated with reductions in the years of schooling and hours of work, while Gunes and Tsaneva (2016) find that teenage pregnancy has adverse health consequences for young mothers. Furthermore, two-thirds of teenage mothers in Mexico are born to teenage mothers themselves, highlighting the role of teenage pregnancy in the intergenerational transmission of education outcomes and poverty (Buvinic 1998). Our paper links household-level data from two waves of the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS) to municipality-level data on homicides from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). The MxFLS is uniquely suited to study the effects of violence as the second and third waves were conducted before and after the unexpected surge in drug-related violence in 2007. We use a triple difference-in-differences estimation strategy exploiting variation in (i) exposure to the surge in violence between sample periods, (ii) the intensity of violence as measured by municipal homicide rates, and (iii) age of different cohorts. We find that violent crime significantly reduces teenage pregnancy in Mexico. Specifically, the average increase in homicide rates over the sample period (9 homicides per 100,000 people) reduced the probability of teenage pregnancy by approximately 1.5%. Using the presence of cartel activities in the municipality as a measure of violence corroborates our main finding of a negative association between violence and early pregnancy. We employ various robustness checks to test the sensitivity of the results. First, we control for municipality specific time trends, which account for differential trends in teenage pregnancy across municipalities. Second, we employ a pseudo-test using a sample of (unaffected) older cohorts. Finally, we employ an alternative pseudo-test examining the effect of future homicides using the first and second waves of the MxFLS. The results are also robust to using alternative measures of homicides and teenage pregnancy; controlling for other types of crime (namely, robberies), victimization, and access to a health insurance program; and applying different sample restrictions. We explore several mechanisms linking early fertility and violent crime, including risk, time, and fertility preferences, mental health, sexual behavior, time allocation, marital status, education, and labor force participation. The results demonstrate that reductions in teenage pregnancy are partly explained by changes in the sexual behavior of young women. Further, the effect depends on the pre-surge employment status of the household head. Specifically, the effect is more acute among women in households with worse economic conditions prior to the surge in violence, suggesting budget constraints may be a potential mechanism as well. Next, we provide background on the Mexican war on drugs and discuss several channels linking fertility and violence. Section 3 describes the data and sample construction; Section 4 presents the empirical methodology; Section 5 discusses the results; and Section 6 concludes.",2
18.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,27 August 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-019-09462-1,Born to be more educated? Birth order and schooling,March 2020,Young-Joo Kim,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Economists have long recognized the important role of family inputs for determining children’s educational outcomes. Among many potential family-based determinants of children’s educational attainment, birth order has been discussed as a crucial factor affecting investment. This is because first-born children tend to receive the biggest share of parental time and other family resources. Postulating that such investments along with other childhood experiences may differ according to birth order, economists have made concerted efforts to test whether birth order is associated with educational attainment. The accumulated evidence in the literature, as presented in the next section, appears to support the notion of advantages to first-born children, especially in developed countries. However, little is known about the cause of birth order effects and the evolution of the effects across generations. The educational attainment of a child is a product of parental investment and resources, the child’s capacity - including endowments, and his or her own aspirations and effort. All of these factors, alone or in combination, may contribute to a child’s final level of educational attainment. It is accordingly difficult to separately identify a potential effect of birth order on educational attainment among siblings in a family. Moreover, analysis of sibling outcomes over more than one generation requires unusually comprehensive and detailed data, further limiting the empirical study of birth order effects. In this study, I investigate the effect of birth order on educational attainment and how this effect has evolved over time. With advances in average level of income and education over the past decades, the pattern and size of birth order effect observed in older cohorts may not be repeated in the same way in younger cohorts. By comparing birth order effects between two generations, I present new evidence that can help us understand the nature of the birth order effect on levels of schooling. In order to shed light on some causal channels of birth order effect on educational attainment, I examine how birth order is associated with intermediate outcomes in adolescence. With explicit measures of parental attitude and a child’s capacity for college education, I investigate how birth order is associated with the outcomes that are most closely related to schooling levels. The data for this study are drawn from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS). The WLS is a uniquely rich data set focused on the high school class of 1957. The WLS follows the initial cohort of 10,317 men and women for more than 40 years and contains unparalleled detail about the respondents and their families including the respondent’s siblings and the next generation. I use data on these two generations from the WLS and discuss more information in Section 3. See Herd et al. (2014) for a history and description of the WLS. The current study extends the findings of De Haan (2010) who documents the effects of family size and birth order on schooling using instrumental variables and the children sample of the WLS. I first show that birth order is negatively associated with schooling levels even after accounting for family fixed effects. Then after comparing the data from the sibling sample to the children sample, I show that the magnitudes of the effects are similar across two generations. From both samples, first-borns have 0.22 more years of schooling compared to middle-born children, for an implied effect of 9 percent of a standard deviation. As a new contribution, I further examine whether the birth order effect is transmitted from parents to children. For example, I consider the possibility that children of first-born parents are more successful relative to children of later-born parents holding family size, birth order and the other characteristics constant. I find no evidence of inheritability of the birth order effect on educational attainment from parents to children. This study also extends the literature by providing evidence of potential drivers of the observed negative birth order effect on educational attainment, apart from levels of parental quality-time (Price 2008), financial transfers (De Haan 2010) and other factors that have been discussed in previous studies. Firstly, I show that parental expectations regarding a child’s schooling differ significantly by birth order in a way that favors the first-born. Secondly, I find that an individual’s own attitude and college preparedness also differ systematically by birth order. First-borns are more likely to perceive that college education is valuable for future career than their later-born siblings and prepare accordingly by taking advanced courses in high school years. Lastly, I show that earlier-born children are more likely to have higher IQ scores than the later-born siblings and that IQ scores account for up to half of the birth order effect on schooling. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review and Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents the estimation methods and the findings. Section 5 explores other aspects of birth order effects and Section 6 provides concluding remarks.",4

Despite considerable gains in height and weight amongst children, estimates suggest that in 2015, 50 million infants (7.5%) were wasted and 159 million infants (23.8%) were stunted (UNICEF 2015). Moreover, a vast amount of evidence suggests that childhood health influences health and economic outcomes later in life (Case and Paxson 2010; Currie et al. 2010; Almond and Currie 2011), so that any economic shock or policy reform that impacts children’s health has potentially long lasting economic and social impacts. An important channel through which macroeconomic conditions and policy reforms affect child health is through parental employment. The association between parental employment and child health can be explained from a simple model of child health production, where parents invest both time inputs and material inputs in child health (Currie 2009). A loss of employment is typically associated with income and substitution effects that operate in different directions (Ferreira and Schady 2009). Unemployment will lower income available for spending on market goods, including health care, non-household child care, and nutritious consumption, whilst lowering the opportunity cost of time so that we might observe increases in home-produced and time-intensive health investments.Footnote 1 Available evidence on the child health impacts of macroeconomic conditions indeed suggests an important role for parental employment, particularly mothers’ labor supply. Bhalotra (2010) shows that in rural India, infant mortality is counter-cyclical, because recessions push rural women (but not men) into the agricultural labor force and reduce their use of health care. On the other hand, Miller and Urdinola (2010) find that child mortality in Colombia is pro-cyclical, as reductions in the global coffee price are associated with lower employment for women and increases in prenatal care and child vaccinations.Footnote 2 It thus appears that substitution effects associated with changes in maternal employment dominate the child health impacts of macroeconomic cycles, but the existing studies do not provide direct evidence on the causal effect of paternal and maternal employment on child health in developing countries. Considering aggregate employment opportunities (as opposed to parental employment directly), Page et al. (2019) consider the relationship between labour market conditions and child health in the US. They find improved female employment prospects lead to reduced health, whilst improved male employment improves it, and provide evidence consistent with the notion that income effects dominated time effects for men, whilst the opposite is true for women. Differences in the impacts of maternal and paternal unemployment on children have been studied in most detail in relation to child schooling outcomes. Ruiz-Valenzuela (2015), investigating the impact of the Great Recession in Spain, finds that fathers’ unemployment negatively affects child attainment in school whilst unemployment of mothers has no statistically significant effect. Rege et al. (2011), using plant closures in Norway, find that fathers’ job loss leads to a substantial decline in children’s graduation-year grade point average whilst mothers’ job loss leads to non-significant improvements in school performance. They argue this is consistent with recent evidence suggesting men suffer an increase in mental distress as a result of job loss, and that maternal job loss induces less mental distress than paternal job loss (Kuhn et al. 2009). They also suggest that the positive effect of maternal job loss indicates that mothers respond by allocating greater attention towards child rearing. Kalil and Ziol-Guest (2008) reach similar conclusions from the analysis of children’s academic progress in the US. In this paper we analyze how paternal and maternal unemployment affect the health of children aged 0–17 in China. During the period 1990–2010 the percentage of stunted and underweight children under 5 in China fell from 32 and 13%, respectively, to 9.4 and 4%, but large regional and socio-economic disparities remain (WHO 2014). We analyze child health in the period 1997 to 2004, when the restructuring of state owned enterprises had major labor market impacts, which have been documented widely (e.g. Cai et al. 2008; Meng 2012). As the reforms led to massive layoffs and sharp reductions in labour force participation rates, it provides an excellent setting to study the child health impacts of parental unemployment in a developing country context. Our paper is closely related to two recent studies on parental unemployment and child health in the US and Sweden. Schaller and Zerpa (2019), using panel data for children aged 1–16 from the US medical expenditure survey, find that paternal unemployment reduces parent-rated child physical and mental health, while increasing the likelihood of depression and anxiety. Maternal unemployment also reduces parent-rated child health, but reduces the incidence of infectious diseases and the use of prescription drugs. The unemployment effects are identified based on child fixed effects and a focus on displacements due to business closures. Evidence based on administrative data from Sweden (Mork et al. 2014) shows that maternal unemployment is associated with a small increase in hospitalization of children aged 3–18, while paternal unemployment has no significant effect. Mork et al. (2014) control for child fixed effects in their estimations, but as they are not able to distinguish different causes of unemployment, their estimates might be confounded. Job loss may be correlated with unobserved time-varying determinants of child health, for example if parents of children with poor health progression are more likely to quit work, or if parental productivity shocks affect both job loss and child health (Rege et al. 2011). We use the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), a panel survey with individual, household, and community level data, including measures of health, nutrition, income, and employment. Availability of anthropometric data for children is an important advantage of the CHNS data: unlike Schaller and Zerpa (2019) and Mork et al. (2014), we do not rely solely on medical care utilization or parent-rated health measures that may confound health with other determinants of diagnosis and treatment. In a third recent paper closely related to ours, Liu and Zhao (2014) find a negative association between child health and fathers’ and mothers’ recent job loss (the event of losing one’s job) during the period 1991–2006 in China, although the effect of maternal job loss is statistically insignificant. An important conceptual difference with the present paper is that Liu and Zhao (2014) estimate the effect of recent job loss, rather than unemployment (or joblessness).Footnote 3 We see no reason to believe that parents’ time use and income are affected only by job loss, rather than joblessness and in this paper we focus on joblessness. They also focus on separate estimations for maternal and paternal job loss, only controlling for presence of the other parent in the household, which is potentially endogenous. Instead, we restrict our sample to households in which both parents are present and include the employment status of both parents in each estimation. This results in larger effect sizes of either parent’s unemployment. Our analysis includes individuals across eight provinces for the period 1997–2004, when we observe a strong reduction in employment rates, in line with trends reported from other data sources for China. We estimate child fixed effects models and, to account for time varying unobservables, we instrument parental unemployment using sex-specific employment rates in the household’s county or city of residence. The identification thus comes from local employment fluctuations, and we rule out several other channels by controlling for local average earnings and several indicators of local health infrastructure and economic infrastructure. Similar approaches, exploiting regional labor market fluctuations, have been used in the analysis of schooling choices (Pinger 2015) and returns to education (Carneiro et al. 2011), among others. In line with Schaller and Zerpa (2019), we find that paternal unemployment increases the incidence of low weight-for-age. On the other hand, maternal unemployment reduces the incidence of low weight-for-age, and significantly lowers both the probability that a child has been sick or injured in the last four weeks, and the probability that health care was sought in the last four weeks. To assess the channels through which unemployment affects child health, we estimate the impact of unemployment on household income, health insurance, time use of parents and children, and child diets. Though our estimates are imprecise, the results are in line with the notion that traditional gender roles drive the differential unemployment impacts of mothers and fathers. Paternal unemployment leads to a large and significant drop in household income, and maternal unemployment significantly reduces children’s time on domestic chores. Descriptive statistics for our estimation sample confirm that women earn less than men and spend considerably more time on caring for young children and on domestic chores. Turning to child diets, which we analyze as indicators of child health investments, we find that maternal unemployment increases children’s dietary diversity score (an indicator of the nutrient adequacy of diets), whereas paternal unemployment reduces children’s dietary diversity score, and reduces the intake of fats. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the causal effect of parental unemployment on the quality of children’s diets, and the results suggest that this is one of the channels through which parental unemployment affects child health. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the reforms in China and evidence of their impact on employment, and briefly outlines the theoretical framework. Section 3 describes the data, Section 4 describes the methodology, and Sections 5 and 6 discuss the main results and analysis of heterogeneity. Section 7 concludes.",23

Female Labor Force Participation (FLFP) is one of the main economic outcomes varies remarkably across countries (Fernández and Fogli 2009; Fogli and Veldkamp 2011). Several studies suggest that cultural factors can explain this variation across countries (Fernández 2011, 2007; Fernández and Fogli 2009; Guiso et al. 2006; Marcén 2014; Salari 2018). Culture plays an important role in economic decisions, however designing testable hypotheses for measuring the cultural effect is quite challenging (Alesina and Giuliano 2010; Tabellini 2010). Each immigrant has a specific culture that he/she brings to the host country and this culture may be passed on to his/her child (Bisin and Topa 2003). Immigrant families may present their origin cultures to the children through speaking their heritage languages (HLs) (Hughes et al. 2006; Tsai et al. 2012). A HL is a language that is often spoken at home and is inherited from the parent’s heritage country. The HL is the primary channel that parents use to pass their cultural beliefs and values on to their children (Fillmore 1991; Tsai et al. 2012). There are two main reasons why parents desire to transmit their heritage cultures through speaking HLs to their children. First, immigrants who have strong ethnic orientations like to be involved in activities that present their cultures to their families; therefore, their children may need to speak their HLs if they want to feel comfortable in the heritage cultural events. Second, speaking a HL is an important factor for children to make sense of themselves being as a part of their heritage groups (Kim and Chao 2009; Tsai et al. 2012). HL is not only an instrument for transmitting intergenerational cultural effects but also indicates the degree of parent assimilation. To capture the effect of culture, this study focuses on the analysis of second-generation immigrant women in the US who are all living under the same laws, economic conditions, and institutions. Additionally, second-generation immigrant women have the same opportunity to find jobs compared to the other native women since they were born and raised in the US. Thus, this strategy compares second-generation women’s working behaviors while they are exposed to the various cultures. The main assumption is that parents can pass on their cultures to their children through speaking HLs, which has not been investigated in previous studies. The main finding shows women who kept their HLs and whose parents immigrated from higher/lower FLFP countries, they tend to work more/less hours in the US, respectively. This section is followed by literature review, theoretical frameworks, and motivations, which is then succeeded by dataset descriptions and sample selection. Empirical approach and results are presented in subsequent sections. Finally, the last section presents the conclusion.",4

Family bargaining and public policy in contemporary Russia",June 2020,Natalya Y. Shelkova,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Family bargaining literature, focused on distribution of power between husbands and wives, has traditionally looked at its effects on women and children. This paper is no exception and also looks at the recent strengthening of women’s bargaining positions in Russia, however, it shifts attention on what a stronger women’s position means for men. Specifically, the paper looks at the effects of Russia’s 2007 Maternity Capital Assistance Policy, known as ‘Maternal Capital Law’, on male consumption of alcohol. In doing so the paper employs traditional difference-in-difference methodology, using 2003–2012 data of the Russia’s Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS-HSE). In the past century Russian society, and men in particular, had experienced a number of traumatic historical events that affected both men’s position in the family and their consumption of addictive substances, such as alcohol. Throughout the 20th century family life in Russia was largely traditional, despite the fact that both men and women participated heavily in the work force. Regardless of this ‘equality’, women carried out a disproportionately large share of domestic duties, including child care, suggesting their weak power position in the family. One can argue that this was a result of historical events that had repeatedly reduced the number of men in Russian society: the wars, the 1917 revolution, and Stalinist repressions. Following Russia’s 1917 revolution about 13 million people, mostly men, died in the civil war. Soon after a large number of educated Russian men fled the country as a part of ‘White’ emigration and, according to some sources, it cost Russian society an additional two million people. The best representatives of the intelligentsia in sciences and art left the country, including Vladimir Nabokov, Igor Sikorski, Sergey Rachmaninov and many others (The Losses… 2007). The male population was also greatly reduced by Stalin-era repressions that took place in the 1930’s through the mid-1950’s. Millions of successful and productive men were arrested and sent to labor camps, many were executed. Last, but certainly not least, the number of men was greatly reduced during the Second World War in which the Soviet Union lost more than 11 million members of the armed forces (Zemskov 2012). Combination of the above events resulted in Russia’s long-term gender imbalances. For instance, at the end of the Second World War for every two Russian women of prime marriage and child-bearing age (20–29 years old) there was only one man. The intensified competition in the marriage markets tipped the balance of power in Russian families, making married women’s share of family work unequal with men’s (see for ex., Brainard 2016). Still, while the marriage market conditions were favorable for men, the psychological traumas of war and repressions pushed many men to the escapes of addictive behavior. Alcohol addiction in the post-war Russia was widespread, especially among men. Women, disempowered by the large demographic imbalances, were complacent and did not actively resist the destructive behavior of their male partners. As the demographic situation improved in the 1960s and new cohorts of men entered the marriage markets women’s position in the family did not change. Chronic shortages of consumer goods, coupled with low pay, forced many Soviet families to engage in substantial home production, which in the absence of household technology needed ‘strong male hands’. This kept women dependent and often attached to otherwise unattractive partners. The collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s brought about many changes, both giving rise to the power of women and widening opportunities for men. Opening of the borders made consumer goods, including household technology and western contraceptives, widely available. Women, by gaining greater access to family planning, increase their investment in education, move to better paid skilled occupations, engage in entrepreneurship. Rapid growth of markets for household services can now substitute for male hands when it comes to keeping the household, lessening women’s dependence on men. While the 1990s brought about many new opportunities, the ups and downs of economic transition had also taken a substantial economic toll, slowing down the growth of budding gender and marriage equality. Alcohol and drug addiction became rampant. Real earnings and employment of Russian workers had dropped, and women’s declined more sharply than men’s (see Brainerd 1998). Due to a sharp decline in life expectancy of men (in 1994 an average Russian man was expected to live only 57.4 years, compared to 63.7 in 1990!), once again the marriage markets became severely imbalanced. While in 1994–1998 relative wages of Russian women grew, their share of domestic duties did not decrease. Positions of women also worsened after the financial crisis of 1998 (Lacroix & Radtchenko 2011). By the early 2000s, a positive trend towards greater family power balance was observed. Signs of emancipation emerged in 2000–2004 when shares of spouses’ domestic duties started to become more balanced (Selezneva 2010). Kalugina, Sofer, and Radtchenko (2009) also confirm that during 2000–2003 the sharing of resources in Russian families became more equitable. Challenging economic conditions, uncertainty, and women’s unhappiness with marriage have led to a significant decline in fertility in Russia in the 1990s and into 2000s. By 2000 the number of births per 1,000 people dropped to 8.7 from 15.9 in 1980.Footnote 1 In 2007, concerned with the rapidly declining population (also due to increased morbidity), Russian government introduces a new policy—the Maternal Capital Assistance Policy, or the Maternal Capital Law.Footnote 2 The Maternal capital is a non-cash subsidy attached to a mother who gives birth/adopts a second or higher-order child (in rare occasions when a mother is absent the father becomes eligible to receive the subsidy). The subsidy can be used when the child reaches the age of 3, for three major purposes: the child’s education, improvement of the family’s living conditions (purchase, construction, remodeling of an apartment/house where the child lives), or investment in the mother’s pension account. The amount of the subsidy in 2007 was set at 250,000 Russian rubles, which was equivalent to about 10,000 US dollars and close in value to Russia’s per capita GDP in 2007. To illustrate the purchasing power of the subsidy, consider that its amount could cover approximately 15% of the price of an average Russian family’s housing unit, or as much as 30–35% of the price of a ‘starter home’. The subsidy amount has been indexed annually (see Table 1), but has not quite kept up with general inflation: since 2007 prices of non-food items increased thrice while the subsidy’s nominal value doubled. However, prices of real estate, the most common use of this subsidy (as many as 90% of Russian families who receive the subsidy use it to improve their living conditions), have grown roughly at the same rate as the amount of Maternal capital. The policy is still operating at the time of writing this article.",1

Jaenicke,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Poor diet quality in the United States is related to important non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and obesity (e.g., Ley et al. 2014; Bowman et al. 2004; Nicklas et al. 2001; Chou et al. 2004), which decreases individuals’ quality of life and is economically costly (e.g., Fontaine and Barofsky 2001; Finkelstein et al. 2009; Goettler et al. 2017). These diseases are linked to poor diet quality, which in turn is linked with low socio-economic status (SES). Although the average American consistently does not come close to meeting the recommended dietary guidelines, higher SES groups have increased their diet quality over time (Kreb-Smith et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2018). Despite the increase for middle and high SES households, diet quality for low SES households has remained unchanged. Therefore, the diet quality gap between low SES households and other households is increasing (Kim and Leigh 2010; Lysy et al. 2013). Income, education, and the food environment are three factors commonly investigated to explain the diet-quality gap. Accordingly, food assistance and access policies have been implemented to address these three factors. At the national level, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides monthly benefits to help low-income households afford nutritious food and learn about nutrition through the SNAP-Ed program (FNS 2018). While SNAP is successful in alleviating poverty (Tiehen et al. 2012), it has not succeeded in improving dietary disparities of low SES groups (Zhang et al. 2018). At the state and local level, 12 states passed legislation between 2001 and 2011 to promote access to healthy food. These policies include the Pennsylvania Fresh Food Finance Initiative (FFFI) and Louisiana’s Healthy Food Retail Act (HFRA) (State Initiatives 2012). However, local studies (e.g., Cummins et al. 2014) and national studies (e.g., Kyureghian et al. 2012) both fail to find significant improvement on household fruit and vegetable consumption from supermarket entry or improved supermarket density in urban areas. Although the opportunity cost of time is a key determinant of time spent in food-at-home (FAH) activities (Möser 2010) and more time spent in FAH activities is associated with a higher diet quality (Jabs and Devine 2006), food assistance programs do not consider household time constraints. Therefore, our research asks whether the general ineffectiveness by income-assistance, education, and food-access policies to alleviate persistent diet-quality disparities of low SES groups could be linked to a limiting fourth factor, the time available for diet quality-related activities. Past research has found that an increase in the opportunity cost of time decreases FAH consumption (Nayga 1996), and therefore diet quality (Lin and Guthrie 2012). These studies traditionally focus on time spent working, with particular interest on women’s’ working hours (Davis 2014; Etilé and Plessz 2018). In contrast, our research contributes to the literature and the food assistance policy discussion by investigating the relationship between diet quality and unpaid household work, particularly time spent in childcare. Our focus on time spent in childcare is motivated by two facts. First, a large share of households participating in federal food assistance programs contain children. In 2018, approximately 41 percent of all SNAP households contained a child and 61 percent of households with children were headed by single adults (Cronquist 2019). In addition, nearly all households participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) contain children, with all children less than 5 years old (Thorn et al. 2018). Second, households with children spend a large majority of their time in childcare, with an estimated 2.15 h per day spent in primary childcare for households with children under 6 (ATUS Chart Series 2019). Including childcare as part of a food assistance program may have the ability to affect a household’s time allocated to childcare and relax their time constraint. Although a large portion of food assistance program participants are households with children and that childcare is a large time commitment each day, there is relatively little known about how childcare impacts diet quality or may be potentially limiting the effectiveness of these programs. In this paper, we focus our analysis on households’ time spent in childcare activities at three levels and specifically investigate how these activities may affect diet quality. First, we examine time spent on all types of childcare by a large sample of U.S. households. Second, we refine our investigation by splitting total childcare in to its two components defined by the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), namely time spent in primary childcare and time spent in secondary childcare. Primary childcare is time spent caring for the child as the primary activity, while secondary childcare refers to time spent providing childcare, while performing another primary activity; e.g., doing laundry or walking the dog (ATUS User’s Guide 2019). Third, we investigate data subsamples, where we split the sample by SNAP participation and eligibility to see if the association between time spent on childcare and diet quality is impacted by the federal food assistance program. While previous research on diet quality and time use has been limited by a lack of data containing both food purchases and time allocations (Davis 2014), we attempt to overcome this data issue by estimating household time allocations through a Two-Sample Instrumental Variable (Angrist and Krueger 1992) approach. This method brings estimated time allocations from the ATUS into a separate dataset that contains a complete set of food-purchase information, namely the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS). After accounting for fixed effects, we find that (i) time spent in childcare, without regard to type, is not statistically significant in predicting household diet quality, (ii) secondary childcare is negatively associated with household diet quality, while primary childcare is positively associated, and (iii) SNAP participation reduces the impact of these household time constraints.",6
18.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,22 June 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-019-09456-z,Exploring the dynamics of racial food security gaps in the United States,June 2020,Ian K. McDonough,Manan Roy,Punarjit Roychowdhury,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Food insecurity is one of the most significant public health concerns facing the United States today. As noted by Gundersen et al. (2011, p. 281), “the prevalence of food insecurity is of great concern to policy-makers and program administrators, a concern heightened by its many demonstrated negative health consequences.” This is particularly true when looking at childhood health outcomes. In particular, food insecurity has been linked with greater cognitive problems (Howard 2011), an increase in aggressive behavior (Whitaker et al. 2006), an increase in behavioral and mental issues (Alaimo et al. 2002; Huang et al. 2010), higher probabilities of being diagnosed with asthma (Kirkpatrick et al. 2010), and overall poorer health (Cook et al. 2004, 2006). Further, King (2018) has recently documented an association between housing instability and household-level food security. While true that food insecurity rates have leveled off since the Great Recession of 2009, the prevailing number of food insecure households remains startlingly high. In particular, figures from 2016 suggest that 12.3% of U.S. households (15.6 million households) were food insecure, meaning these households were classified as lacking consistent access to food required for an active, healthy life (Coleman-Jensen et al. 2017). Among these 15.6 million food insecure households, 6.1 million were classified as being very low food secure (4.9% of U.S. households). Among households with children in 2016, 8% had food insecure children with only 0.8% of those households being classified as very low food secure. These same figures were 9.4% and 1.1% in 2014 and 10% and 1.2% in 2012, respectively (see, Table 1B, Coleman-Jensen et al. 2017). In addition to the recent rates of food insecurity noted above, it is well documented that household rates of food insecurity differ along the dimension of race. In particular, Coleman-Jensen et al. (2017) report that 22.5% of households headed by blacks and 18.5% of households headed by Hispanics were food insecure in 2016 compared to the national average of 12.3%. The authors further report that only 9.3% of households headed by whites were classified as food insecure, resulting in a food insecurity gap of 13.5 percentage points and 9.2 percentage points between blacks and whites and Hispanics and whites, respectively. Additionally, these observed gaps in food insecurity have been relatively persistent. Even though the gaps in food security have slightly narrowed over recent years, the average gap in food insecurity over the time period of 2013–2015 averaged 14.2 percentage points for black households versus white households and 11.4 percentage points for Hispanic households versus white households (Coleman-Jensen et al. 2016, 2015, 2014).Footnote 1 In light of the well documented racial disparities in food security status, this study aims to explore the dynamics of the racial food security gaps by documenting how a household’s food security status evolves over time. In particular, and using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, Kindergarten Class of 1998–1999 (ECLS-K) data, we employ nonparametric measures of distributional mobility to estimate the likelihood that minority and non-Hispanic white households with children will move upward, downward, or not at all through the distribution of the food security over time. Specifically, our analyses and results pertain to the mobility dynamics of non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic households with children. The reasons for performing such an exercise are threefold. First, solely evaluating the racial gaps in food security in levels without understanding how households transition through the distribution of food security over time is incomplete. Not taking into account household-level transition dynamics may lead to inaccurate conclusions with respect to the severity of the food security gap. For example, suppose there is a measurable gap in food security status between minority households with children and non-Hispanic white households with children. At the same time, suppose that the movement through the food security distribution is the same between minorities and non-Hispanic whites. In such a situation one could imagine such movements through the food security distribution leading to all households being evenly dispersed, in a proportional sense, across food security distribution over time relative to the distribution of food security at any particular point in time. Further, it is reasonable to think that a small gap in food security between non-Hispanic whites and minorities with no distributional movement is more of a concern compared to a state where the racial gap in food security is modest yet the households are highly mobile. Although the disparity in levels is relatively small in the first case, it is persistent. Similar to what has been noted by Kopczuk et al. (2010) and Glewwe (2012) in the income inequality literature, inequality in food security by itself is not meaningful; rather, it is both the racial food security gap in levels and the underlying mobility dynamics that matter for assessing the degree of food insecurity between white and minority households. Second, understanding racial disparities in mobility patterns of food security is important for the creation of effective policy. On the one hand, if mobility in food security is low for minority households relative to non-Hispanic white households, such that the minority households find themselves persistently food insecure, then policy should perhaps target the reduction in long term economic vulnerability (e.g. through acquisition of physical assets or human capital) of minorities. On the other hand, if mobility is high across all households, and the racial food security gap is transitory—e.g. certain households do not have access to sufficient food for all members during periods of low income and volatile prices—then policy may be more effective if targeted towards sources of income/price volatility and/or credit and insurance markets. In fact, and as noted by Ribar and Hamrick (2003), transient food insecurity (as opposed to chronic food insecurity) would also support the general design of food stamp programs for low income households and, in particular, for those households that have unexpected declines in income. Third, poverty and food insecurity are often lumped together under the assumption that those who are food insecure are necessarily poor (and vice versa). As noted by Millimet et al. (2018), Gundersen (2013), and Ribar and Hamrick (2003), food insecurity and poverty are not synonymous. Meaning, households in a state of poverty are often food secure while many non-poor households are officially food insecure. For example, 61.7% of households with annual incomes below the official poverty line were food secure in 2016, while 5.6% of the households with incomes exceeding 185% of the poverty line were food insecure (Coleman-Jensen et al. 2017). Ribar and Hamrick (2003, p. 21) in this context note, “poverty and food insufficiency [a severe form of food insecurity] are related, yet distinct, processes…if a household is able to borrow and save, bouts of poverty need not result in food problems.”Footnote 2 As such, a careful analysis of the racial gaps in food security dynamics, distinct from poverty dynamics, is needed to better understand the economic hardship associated with food insecurity. Considering both the racial food security gap in levels and the underlying dynamics behind the gap helps in understanding whether or not what is observed in the data is a genuine problem, or more of an artifact of when household-levels of food security are measured. Our results are compelling. We find that relative to non-Hispanic white households with children, non-Hispanic black households with children tend to have a lower probability of transitioning out of the bottom of the food security distribution while at the same time having a higher probability of falling from a state of high food security back into a state of food insecurity. Such mobility dynamics, if allowed to persist over the long-run, would lead to 62% of non-Hispanic black households with children achieving high food security status in the steady-state compared to 88% of non-Hispanic white households with children achieving high food security status. Further, 19% of non-Hispanic black households with children would be classified as food insecure in the steady-state relative to only 7% of non-Hispanic white households with children. Taken together with the documented gap in food security status between non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black households with children, the mobility dynamics suggest that we would see very little racial convergence in food security status unless we can better understand how to lift non-Hispanic black households with children out of a state of food insecurity while at the same time keeping households in some state of food security once such status is achieved. Interestingly, our results for Hispanic households with children present a different picture. Specifically, Hispanic households with children, when averaged over all time periods, have a lower probability of being entrenched in a state of food insecurity relative to non-Hispanic white households with children. As well, and similar to non-Hispanic black households, Hispanic households with children are more likely to fall out of a state of high food security once achieving such status relative to non-Hispanic white households with children. However, this downward transition out of a state of high food security for Hispanic households relative to white households with children is less severe compared to the same gap in downward mobility between non-Hispanic black households and non-Hispanic white households with children. When comparing Hispanic households with children directly with non-Hispanic black households with children, we find mobility dynamics similar to what is found when comparing non-Hispanic white households to non-Hispanic black households. Such long run mobility dynamics would lead to the steady-state food security distribution to look similar between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white households but at odds with non-Hispanic black households. In particular, in the steady-state 84% of Hispanic households with children would be classified as high food secure (compared to 88% for non-Hispanic white and 62% for non-Hispanic black households with children) while 10% of Hispanic households with children would settle in a state of either low or very low food security (compared to 7% of non-Hispanic white and 19% of non-Hispanic black households with children). Even after conditioning on household-level socioeconomic status, we find evidence that non-Hispanic black households are the most vulnerable group when compared to non-Hispanic white and Hispanic households. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the existing literature. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents the mobility measures. Section 5 discusses the results. Section 6 concludes.",3

The theory of expressive violence states that abusers enjoy and pay for violence against their victims; this implies that an increase in the victim’s bargaining power reduces IPV. The theory of instrumental violence suggests that bargaining power may increase IPV as an abuser uses violence to reassert control over the bargaining process. Previous studies offer evidence that the dominant effect of bargaining power is to reduce IPV (Aizer 2010; Bowlus and Seitz 2006). In addition to finding more extensive evidence supporting this hypothesis, we develop a new test that bridges these theories: If both types of IPV exist, bargaining power should be especially effective at reducing expressive violence. This paper exploits local temperature variation and gender wage ratios at the county level to test three hypotheses. First, we test a hypothesis rooted in both expressive violence theory and the psychology literature which predicts that an abuser’s marginal utility of violence increases when he is agitated by hot weather (Anderson 1989). Specifically, we estimate the influence of local maximum temperature on IPV against women and find that hot weather increases IPV. Second, we test whether a woman’s outside option decreases IPV. Our findings show that an increase in a woman’s relative potential wage decreases IPV. Finally, we find evidence to support the hypothesis that bargaining power is especially effective against a type of expressive violence caused by heat. This paper makes three major contributions. First, it expands on Aizer’s (2010) work in measuring the effect of the gender wage ratio on IPV. In addition to covering more states in the U.S., we exploit data on victim and offender race to allow for different victim-offender race pairs. This is important for studying the effect of a woman’s bargaining power on IPV, since labor market conditions vary significantly by both gender and race. Second, this paper is the first to use a large-scale data set to examine how changes in weather affects patterns of IPV in the US. It contributes to an emerging literature on the effects of climate change on violent crime (Ranson 2014). Our findings offer a better understanding of how weather impacts vulnerable populations who often lack adequate access to temperature controls. Most importantly, it is the first to show that a woman’s relative wage reduces the effect of hot weather on IPV. This shows that bargaining power is most effective at reducing expressive IPV.",11

The proliferation of social media, online dating sites, and even adultery- focused applications easily drive anecdotal and sensationalized evidence to support this claim.Footnote 1 There is, however, limited academic research available on the topic, and what does exist has become dated. Existing work reveals that during the 1990s and early 2000s the internet had a positive influence on marriages of individuals under 30 years old and a negligible impact on the average divorce rate in the US (Bellou 2015; Kendall 2011). Theoretically, the internet represents a sound mechanism for enhancing matching ability. Positive evidence has been identified in the employment market, which is similar to the marriage market in a number of ways. Both markets are characterized by search frictions, imperfect information, continual reassessment, and turnover. The internet has been found to be correlated with shorter durations of unemployment (Kuhn and Skuterud 2004), to provide comparable match quality as print advertisements (Hadass 2004), and to increase the employment searches of those already employed (Stevenson 2008). However, research on the internet’s impact on the marriage market is far more limited. The internet as a search medium allows someone to potentially search both the extensive and intensive margins of the marriage market more efficiently. The internet can increase both the number of people the user can review in a fixed time frame, as well as the observable information available on each potential match. The perception of the internet as an effective tool to meet people has increased in the recent years. Those who claimed “online dating is a good way to meet people” increased from 44 to 59% from 2005 to 2013, and those that claimed “online dating allows people to find a better match” increased from 47 to 53% during the same time period (Pew 2013). These views have translated into higher usage of the internet in peoples’ search for a significant other, with approximately 38% of Americans who are single and claim to be looking for a partner having used online dating at some point in time (Pew 2013). In addition to dating-specific applications, the internet has also decreased search frictions in the traditional marriage market through peoples’ use of social media and other online gathering places. The internet has created a number of mechanisms and sites dedicated to bringing people together with shared interests. Sites such as Reddit and Digg have vast discussion platforms or “communities” where individuals can discuss topics and meet others with common interests online. Additionally, sites such as Meetup facilitate people arranging in-person events in their local communities to meet people with similar interests and hobbies. Traditional outlets of meeting people are also supported through social media sites, where individuals can be located and contacted after in-person meetings. Sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Linked-In provide individuals an ability to quickly learn more about potential matches in their social circle, work environment, or those that they expect to meet or recently have met.Footnote 2 In a 2013 Pew study, a large percent of those surveyed used the internet: to facilitate relationships and information gathering for romantic purposes, to search for information about past, present, and future dates, to introduce othersss to investigate locations and events to meet others, to flirt with others, to ask people on dates, and to maintain relationships (Pew 2013). These same aspects of the internet that facilitate match making also pose a threat to matches. Many claim that the internet can strain a relationship. Decreased communication, Facebook-inspired jealousy, and meeting of exes (or others) online appear to be on the rise (AAML 2010; Pew 2014). Additionally, the increased connectivity of the internet may provide a substitute for intimacy found in relationships. Increased access to pornography, video games, and interactive entertainment has been shown to strain both personal and work relationships (Malcolm and Naufal 2016; Doran and Price 2014; Aguiar et al. 2017; Ahlstrom et al. 2012). Further, even for those interested in matching, an increase in potential matches could decrease the desire to wed, as individuals hold out for better matches in a thicker market. The existing empirical research on how internet access is affecting marriage and divorce all use state-level variation that pre-dates 2005 (Bellou 2015; Kendall 2011). This paper analyzes the relationship between internet access and marriage and divorce across the US in the most recent decade by using data from the Federal Communications Commission and the American Community Survey. I exploit county-level variation in internet access over time, as measured by both broadband access and cell phone carriers, to identify impacts on the married and divorced population. Additionally, county-level data provides a measure of the marriage market size or denseness; thereby, allowing for testing of theoretical predictions regarding market size and match quality. Lastly, the use of recent data captures the exponential growth of social media usage and cell phone access since the last studies were completed.",5

(2014) and Thaler (2016)). However, it is not clear whether policies for increasing retirement savings increase total savings or just savings within retirement systems (Chetty et al. 2014).Footnote 3 It is expected that individuals behave differently regarding different savings choices. For example, retirement wealth is not liquid, and the rate of returns over retirement savings are different than that over other savings (Attanasio and Brugiavini 2003). The same can occur with other investments. Individuals may be willing to quit on retirement savings to focus on down or mortgage payments. Previous evidence shows that each dollar of pension wealth is associated with a 37 to 50 cent decline in nonpension wealth, although most of the effect is concentrated in the upper tail of the distribution (Blau 2016; Engelhardt and Kumar 2011). Evidence shows that crowd-out results are very sensitive to the empirical specifications (Blau 2016). One of the difficulties in studying crowding-out is that preferences are unobserved (Beshears and Choi 2012). Workers may have different unobserved preferences for savings, which might be correlated with other choices (Gelber 2011).Footnote 4 For example, an individual could select into the labor market and commit to contributing to her retirement account while holding voluntary savings because of high unobserved tastes for savings. Many papers in the literature use reduced-form approaches that do not consider the non-linearity of the individual’s maximization problem or made oversimplified assumptions (Blau 2016; Card and Ransom 2011; Engelhardt and Kumar 2007). There are other limitations that have affected the generalization of results. Many studies rely on policy reforms for identification where counterfactuals for alternative reforms are not observed (Blau 2016). Others, consider non-representative experiments (e.g., Madrian and Shea (2001), Choi et al. (2004), Thaler and Benartzi (2004) and Carroll et al. (2009)). Many articles consider only the immediate impact of the reforms. Finally, papers that use survey data typically have selection bias and measurement error (Engelhardt and Kumar 2007). Some exceptions are Chetty et al. (2014), who use a 41 million observation administrative dataset from the Danish retirement system, and Engelhardt and Kumar (2007), who use survey data merged with administrative records while controlling for selection using non-standard econometric approaches. To consider these issues, I jointly estimate a multiple equation, reduced-form dynamic model. The equations capture simultaneous decisions such as labor market participation, formality and contribution status, default adoption in investment portfolios, participation in voluntary savings within and outside the retirement system, and housing asset choices. All equations are correlated through a permanent and a time-varying individual-level unobserved heterogeneity component. Unobserved heterogeneity captures differences in preferences, risk tolerance, tastes, etc. The distribution of unobserved characteristics is jointly estimated with the coefficients of the model using semi-parametric full information likelihood methods.Footnote 5 The approach allows to address several sources of estimation bias: selection, endogeneity, and measurement error.Footnote 6 Unbiased estimates arise from many corrections. First, because non-random selection into behaviors is jointly modeled. This correction is achieved by considering several choices, all forming the estimated set of equations. Second, because unobserved heterogeneity that is correlated across decisions and with endogenous determinants of choices is flexibly modeled. Thus, estimated reduced-form parameters are not a function of biases coming from the omission of relevant variables. Third, the estimated parameters are cleaned of classical measurement error bias. This source of bias is accounted by modeling the error term of variables that might be reported with error (e.g., portfolio adoption, savings decisions). Measurement error bias is also reduced by using administrative records on accumulated wealth.Footnote 7 The estimation also allows me to incorporate the non-linearities that come from the individual’s decision-making process without making any assumptions about preferences and expectation processes. Since I model the decision-making process over time, I analyze crowding-out of simulated policies rather than depending on observed policy reforms. I use the estimates of the model to simulate contemporaneous (short-run) and life-cycle (long-run) effects of increasing participation in voluntary retirement accounts, increasing housing assets, and extending compulsory participation on retirement programs to self-employed workers. The paper is built upon Parada-Contzen (2019). Specific differences are: (1) I disaggregate savings based on their liquidity. (2) I study housing choices to incorporate other sources of wealth. (3) An important focus is put on the employment, formality, and contribution status so that policy experiments concerning them can be simulated. (4) I consider active investment decisions, meaning that I classify individuals according to their decision to be on the default or to opt-out. (5) I do not consider changes in financial risks faced by individuals, thus, I am able to estimate a simpler model. I use the first four waves (2002–2009) of the Chilean Survey of Social Protection (EPS) merged with administrative records of the Chilean Bureau of Pensions. The EPS is a validated survey used for retirement policies (Behrman et al. 2011; Joubert 2015). Using this dataset has several advantages: (1) the Chilean model has served as a prototype for the implementation of DC systems in several countries.Footnote 8 (2) In the Chilean model, there are two levels of default. On the one hand, there are no participation conditions once the individual has selected into the labor market. On the other hand, once enrolled, workers can choose their own investment portfolio or follow a default scheme provided by the system (opt-out default).

18.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,30 April 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-020-09486-y,The wealth decumulation behavior of the retired elderly in Italy: the importance of bequest motives and precautionary saving,September 2020,Luigi Ventura,Charles Yuji Horioka,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The central tenet of the life-cycle model is that people work, earn income, and save (accumulate wealth) when young and retire and dissave (decumulate wealth) when old. However, previous studies for most countries have found that the elderly continue to accumulate wealth (save) or that they decumulate their wealth (dissave) but that their rate of wealth decumulation is slower than predicted by the simple life-cycle model with no lifespan uncertainty and no bequest motives. For example, the country studies in Poterba (1994) show that median saving rates remain positive well beyond retirement in virtually all countries. At least two explanations have been proposed for this so-called “Wealth Decumulation Puzzle” (see Mirer 1979, for an early exposition of this puzzle). The first explanation is that the retired elderly are continuing to accumulate wealth or are decumulating their wealth (dissaving) more slowly than expected because they are worried about longevity risk (lifespan uncertainty) and the possibility of facing high medical and long-term care expenses in the future and that they are engaging in precautionary saving in response to these worries. The second explanation, which of course is not mutually exclusive with the first, is that the retired elderly are continuing to accumulate wealth or are decumulating their wealth (dissaving) more slowly than expected because they are saving in order to leave bequests and other intergenerational transfers to their children. In this paper, we analyze the wealth accumulation and saving behavior of the retired elderly in Italy using micro data from the 2000–2002 and 2012–2014 waves of the “Survey of Italian Households’ Income and Wealth (hereafter SHIW),” a panel survey of households conducted every two years by the Bank of Italy. We are particularly interested in shedding light on whether or not the “Wealth Decumulation Puzzle” applies in the case of Italy, and if so, whether it is due to the presence of bequest motives and/or to the presence of precautionary saving. This paper makes a number of original contributions to the existing literature. First, it is one of the first papers to examine whether the “Wealth Decumulation Puzzle” (the tendency of the retired elderly to decumulate their wealth more slowly than expected) applies in the case of Italy. Second, it is one of the first papers to shed light on the relative importance of bequest motives and precautionary saving as determinants of the wealth accumulation and saving behavior of the retired elderly in Italy. Third, it makes direct use of data on saving motives. Fourth, it is careful to construct a measure of the change in wealth that includes only out-of-pocket saving and excludes capital gains and losses on real estate and other components of wealth. Fifth, it takes account of the endogeneity of bequest intentions and the intended bequest to wealth ratio by instrumenting for these variables. Fifth, it analyzes data before as well after the Global Financial Crisis to see whether the behavior of households changed after the Global Financial Crisis. This paper is closely related to several strands in the literature. Most obviously, it is related to the many studies that have been conducted in the United States and other countries that attempt to shed light on the relative importance of bequest motives and precautionary saving as explanations for the failure of the retired elderly to decumulate their wealth as quickly as expected. For example, studies for the USA include Bernheim (1987), Hurd (1987), Weil (1994), Poterba et al. (2011), Palumbo (1999), Dynan et al. (2002), French et al. (2006), De Nardi et al. (2010), and Ameriks et al. (2020), studies for Europe include Börsch-Supan (1992), Alessie et al. (1995, 1999), and Dobrescu (2015), and studies for Japan include Horioka et al. (1996), Horioka (2010), Usuki et al. (2016), Horioka and Niimi (2017), Murata (2018), and Niimi and Horioka (2019) (see Hurd 1990, De Nardi et al. 2016, and Niimi and Horioka 2019 for more comprehensive literature surveys). Virtually all of these studies find that both bequest motives and precautionary saving are important as explanations for the failure of the retired elderly to decumulate their wealth as quickly as expected. Looking in particular at previous studies for Italy, Jappelli and Pagano (1997) find that Italian households of all ages save positive amounts even though their saving rates have declined over time for almost all age groups. Similarly, Brugiavini and Padula (2001) find that elderly households in Italy save positive amounts even after controlling for measurement error and cohort effects. Miniaci and Weber (2003) find that Italian households fail to decumulate their financial assets after retirement and that, although their housing wealth appears to decline after the age of 60, this is due largely to cohort effects. Finally, Jappelli and Modigliani (2003) do a detailed analysis of the age-saving profiles and age-wealth profiles of Italian households and find that discretionary wealth (exclusive of pension wealth) declines in old age, at least after the age of 65, but that discretionary saving remains positive throughout the life cycle (at least until age 80) if it is calculated as disposable income minus consumption. These findings, taken as a whole, strongly suggest that the “Wealth Decumulation Puzzle” applies in the case of Italy, as it does in most other countries (see Jappelli et al. 2014 for a more general survey of household saving behavior in Italy). As for why the “Wealth Decumulation Puzzle” is observed in the case of Italy, Miniaci and Weber (2003) conclude that bequest and gift motives play an important role, and the findings of Guiso and Jappelli (2002), Jappelli and Pistaferri (2005), and Cannari and D’Alessio’s (2008) that bequests and other intergenerational transfers are substantial in the case of Italy provide further corroboration for this view. Turning to evidence on whether or not precautionary saving could be why the Wealth Decumulation Puzzle applies in the case of Italy, Jappelli et al. (2008) find that precautionary saving is not very significant in the case of working-age households in Italy, but this does not necessarily preclude the possibility that longevity risk and the possibility of facing high medical and long-term care expenses in the future motivates elderly households in Italy to engage in substantial precautionary saving. Moreover, Guiso et al.’s (2009) finding that Italians facing more pension wealth risk have a greater demand for targeted retirement saving and insurance suggests that Italians are risk-averse, that they are concerned about their living expenses after retirement, and that they are engaging in precautionary saving for this purpose. Thus, although there seems to be a consensus that the Wealth Decumulation Puzzle applies in the case of Italy, there does not seem to be a consensus about whether bequest motives or precautionary saving is the more important explanation. Another strand of literature to which this paper is related is the literature that attempts to assess the relative importance of various saving motives (see, for example, Horioka and Watanabe 1997, Alessie et al. 1999, Horioka et al. 2000, and Schunk 2009). Horioka and Watanabe (1997) and Horioka et al. (2000) find that retirement and precautionary motives are of predominant importance in both Japan and the United States, while Alessie et al. (1999) find that precautionary and bequest motives are both important in the Netherlands, and Schunk (2009) finds that the precautionary, retirement, housing, and bequest motives (in roughly that order) are the most important motives for saving in Germany. These findings provide further corroboration that both bequest motives and precautionary saving are important as explanations of the Wealth Decumulation Puzzle. A final strand of literature to which this paper is related is the literature on bequest motives (see, for example, Hurd 1989, Laitner and Ohlsson 2001, Horioka et al. 2002, Nishiyama 2002, Brown 2006, Altonji and Villanueva 2007, Kopczuk and Lupton 2007, Horioka 2014, and Lockwood 2018; for comprehensive literature surveys, see Arrondel and Masson 2006, and Laferrere and Wolff 2006). This literature analyzes the various motives for which people leave bequests and what impact bequest motives have on people’s saving and other behavior. The analysis in this paper is meaningful not only because it sheds light on the wealth accumulation and saving behavior of the retired elderly (who hold a substantial share of household wealth) and on the applicability of the life-cycle model but also because it has important policy implications. For example, whether and the extent to which the retired elderly decumulate their wealth (dissave) will determine what impact the aging of the population will have on future trends in the aggregate household saving rate, and knowing more about the determinants of the wealth accumulation and saving behavior of the retired elderly will inform us about what policies would be most effective in stimulating the consumption and raising the living standards of the retired elderly. It is especially interesting to look at the case of Italy because household saving rates have traditionally been very high in Italy, because the share of the elderly in the total population in Italy is the highest in the EU, because the fertility rate is very low in Italy, and because it would be interesting to shed light on the impact of Italy’s unique cultural and institutional setting (relatively strong family ties, relatively underdeveloped financial system, high government debt to GDP ratio, well-developed public pension system, absence of a public long-term care insurance system, etc.) on the wealth accumulation and saving behavior of the retired elderly in Italy. To summarize our main findings, we find that, on average, the retired elderly in Italy are decumulating their wealth (dissaving) but that their wealth decumulation rates are much slower than expected. Moreover, we also find that more than 40% of the retired elderly in Italy are continuing to accumulate wealth and that more than 80% are doing positive amounts of saving. Thus, the Wealth Decumulation Puzzle (the tendency of the retired elderly to decumulate their wealth more slowly than expected) appears to apply in the case of Italy, as it does in most other countries, before as well as after the Global Financial Crisis. Moreover, our regression analysis of the determinants of the wealth accumulation and saving behavior of the retired elderly in Italy suggests that respondents with bequest motives and those saving for precautionary purposes show higher wealth accumulation rates and higher amounts of saving than other respondents, which suggests that the lower than expected wealth decumulation rates and dissaving of the retired elderly in Italy is due largely to intergenerational transfers (bequests and inter vivos transfers) and saving for precautionary purposes, especially the former. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In “Theoretical considerations”, we discuss theoretical considerations; in “The estimation model”, we explain the estimation model we use for our regression analysis of the determinants of the wealth accumulation and saving behavior of the retired elderly in Italy; in “Data source and sample selection”, we explain the data source and sample selection criteria we use for our analysis; in “Descriptive statistics”, we present and discuss some descriptive statistics; in “Estimation results”, we present and discuss our estimation results; and “Conclusion” is a concluding section that summarizes our findings and explores the policy implications of our findings.",11

The extended family is an important manifestation of the family as a human institution. The extended nature of the family can be of benefit to this human institution when there is cooperation between family members. An understanding of the level of inter-generational cooperation within the family is thus relevant and necessary in this context. Field experiments in Economics have studied cooperation within households, but almost exclusively in couples (Ashraf 2009; Cochard et al. 2016; Iversen et al. 2011; Kebede et al. 2013; Munro et al. 2014). Yet, the level of cooperation within households and families plays a pivotal role in explaining inter-generational relationships. Strong and positive inter-generational relations, manifested in the form of improved and quality family communication, have several benefits, including human capital and life skills exchanges; the transmission of values and culture; the preservation of inter-generational solidarity (Paltasingh and Tyagi 2017), and mutual assistance (Tsai et al. 2016). Inter-generational communication supports the learning process that contributes to the development of personal traits, social acclimation, and physical and mental health of younger generations (Tsai et al. 2016). Inter-generational communication also facilitates the flow of information about familial-risks and preventive health behaviours (Bowen et al. 2017) and is linked to personal happiness (Karadağ and Koçak 2017) and to social, emotional and behavioural well-being of family members (Liermann and Norton 2016). Communication, moreover, is a cooperation-enhancing mechanism with the potential of addressing collective action problems (Anderson et al. 1998; Andreoni and Samuelson 2006; Fehr and Schmidt 1999; Oprea et al. 2014; Smith 2010). More specifically, communication not only simplifies coordination problems with many players, but reduces the cost of monitoring and enforcement of compliance, amplifies reputation effects, coordinates collective low-cost punishment, and facilitates the assortment of decision-makers with similar conventions and norms (Smith 2010). Cooperation as a social preference may therefore suffer in the absence of functioning family communication in extended families. The aim of this paper is therefore, to contribute to the understanding of how communication within families influences cooperation in inter-generational households, using experimental data. A handful of laboratory experiments have studied communication using the Voluntary Contribution Mechanism (VCM) (Isaac and Walker 1988; Koukoumelis et al. 2012a, 2012b; Kumakawa 2013; Oprea et al. 2014), including face-to-face communication (Bochet et al. 2006; Cason and Khan 1999; Kinukawa et al. 2000) and computer-mediated communication (Bicchieri and Lev-On 2007), generally concluding that communication is good for cooperative behaviour. Evidence from the field is limited, but also confirms that communication enhances cooperation (Cardenas et al. 2000; Cardenas 2003). Zelmer (2003) and Balliet (2010) in their meta-analyses of experimental research present evidence that communication enhances cooperation. Here, a framed field experiment (Harrison and List 2004) is employed to investigate the effect of communication on cooperation within inter-generational extended families, adding to the thin experimental literature on decision-making in multi-generational households. The paper’s twofold purpose is both empirical (studying cooperation in an inter-generational context) as well as policy oriented (establishing the impact of a policy-amenable communication treatment on cooperation). The remaining part of the paper is organised as follows. Material and methods are presented in Section 2. The results and discussion of empirical findings are provided in Sections 3 and 4 respectively. Section 5 concludes the paper.",
18.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,14 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-019-09475-w,When equitable is not equal: experimental evidence on the division of marital assets in divorce,September 2020,Joni Hersch,Jennifer Bennett Shinall,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"From the late 1960s to the late 1980s, U.S. states dramatically reformed their divorce laws. As part of this so-called “divorce revolution” (Weitzman 1985), which has formed the basis of a robust prior empirical literature,Footnote 1 states transitioned from traditional fault-based divorce regimes, requiring assignment of fault to one party during the proceedings, to no-fault-based divorce regimes. In addition, states moved away from dividing marital property based on title to dividing property either equally or equitably. The vast majority of U.S. states have elected for an equitable division regime: Currently, forty-seven states and the District of Columbia require equitable division of assets at the time of divorce. Equitable division need not mean equal division; in fact, only three community property states require a 50/50 split in assets. Among the states requiring equitable division, thirteen start with a presumption of—but do not mandate—equal division; the other thirty-four state laws contain no such nudge towards equality.Footnote 2 Regardless of the existence of a presumption, legal decisionmakers in all equitable division states consider a long list of factors in dividing assets—including homemaker contributions, employability, vocational skills, and the ability of each party to acquire capital assets and earnings—when deciding what asset split is fair. Our study is based on the legal regime in the United States, but at the outset, we note that the level of discretion granted to decisionmakers in dividing marital assets varies throughout Western legal regimes (Glendon 1989). The United Kingdom, for example, allows decisionmakers wide discretion in dividing marital property, similar to the United States (Woodhouse 1990). In contrast, prospective spouses in France choose between common or separate property arrangements that will govern asset ownership in the event of divorce or death (Laferrère 2001). For a typical middle-class household, the functional difference between an equal division of assets and an equitable division of assets may be negligible. Yet for wealthy households, the stakes can be significant. As exemplified by the high-profile divorces of Jeff Bezos, David Mugrabi, Johnny Depp, and Elon Musk, not all successful individuals have prenuptial agreements to override the state default regime for dividing assets at the time of divorce. Consequently, the difference between equitable and equal division of assets could mean billions of dollars for their spouses. Far from anomalies, such high-wealth individuals merit study in an environment of well-documented and increasing income inequality. How their assets are divided at the time of divorce becomes particularly complex given two other well-documented tendencies. First, in the marriage market, highly educated individuals typically marry a similarly educated spouse (Schwartz and Mare 2005, Eika et al. 2019). Second, rates of opting out of the labor market are highest among female spouses in highly educated couples (Hersch 2013). Although these women have a particularly high opportunity cost of opting out, they also have strong opportunities to contribute to their husband’s labor market success. Determining how marital assets are typically divided—and whether economic considerations influence the division—in a representative sample of cases is quite difficult, if not impossible, regardless of the wealth of the divorcing spouses. Divorce cases are generally subject to simple, nonextensive filing requirements, particularly if they settle. The divorce cases in which more extensive filings and judicial opinions are available are highly contested, and arguably less representative, divorce cases.Footnote 3 Consequently, to examine the theories of divorce borne out under the modern regime of dividing marital assets, we conducted an experimental vignette study. Our study tests how non-expert evaluators would choose to equitably divide marital assets in the difficult, but common, case in which the monetary and home-production contributions differ between spouses. The sample of non-expert evaluators acts as a proxy for legal decisionmakers that parties would face if their contested divorce resulted in a trial. Like judges and jurors, our survey respondents are not provided with monetary incentives that depend on their decision; instead they are compensated at a flat rate for their time.Footnote 4 We presented 3017 respondents with a realistic scenario in which a wife has opted out of the labor market to stay at home and raise the couple’s children, while the husband has remained employed full-time in the labor market. We varied both the husband’s actual level of labor market success—signified by the financial assets accumulated through his market work—and the wife’s potential for success had she remained in the labor market—signified by her education and former occupation. In theory, prenuptial agreements could prevent or reduce disputes over the division of assets. Yet because they are rarely used, divorcing spouses must often negotiate a settlement, or in the failure to reach an agreement, litigate with all the attendant uncertainty over the ultimate outcome.Footnote 5 Within an economic bargaining framework, the wife’s level of education and former occupation would indicate her threat point, where the relevant threat is the expected division of assets that would be awarded by the court. Although the dominant litigation models imply that trials should be rare relative to settlements in most legal disputes, court decisions pose a genuine threat to divorce litigants. Farmer and Tiefenthaler (2001) report that 38 percent of the divorces they analyze were heard by a judge at some point before the divorce became final. Empirical evidence is lacking, but the factors that courts within equitable division regimes are supposed to consider in dividing assets suggests that they are likely to distribute assets from the wealthier to the less wealthy spouse. Indeed, this is the presumed rationale for the use of prenuptial agreements analyzed by Leeson and Pierson (2016), which documents that the median income and net assets of the husband far exceeds that of the wife among divorcing couples with prenuptial agreements. To the extent courts base their asset division on the relative income and wealth of the parties, or on the same factors that would be relevant in drafting a prenuptial agreement, wives who make greater professional sacrifices during marriage would be entitled to a greater share of assets upon divorce. Nonetheless, we find that respondents consistently favor the husband in distributing the couple’s assets, awarding on average less than 50 percent to the wife, with men favoring the husband more strongly than do women. This result holds true regardless of the wife’s education and former occupation. Male respondents do award a greater share to the wife when her education and former occupation indicate better labor market opportunities, but women do not vary their award based on the wife’s education and former occupation. Because respondents of both genders award less to the wife on average, we conclude that evaluators may not view equal division to be equitable, even when the non-breadwinning wife’s opportunity cost is high and her efforts have contributed to building the value of a couple’s assets. Indeed, our conclusion is strengthened after reviewing respondents’ stated motivations for their asset division decisions.",3
18.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,12 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-019-09469-8,The effect of children on male earnings and inequality,September 2020,Astrid Kunze,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Statistics show that unadjusted male-female earnings differentials still remain significant, between 15 and 23%, and have remained surprisingly stable in many countries over recent decades (OECD 2017). In order to understand remaining gender wage gaps, one of the important questions is whether having children affects earnings. A large body of empirical evidence exists on women showing a negative association between earnings and children, and suggesting that women are falling behind because of children (Adda et al. 2017; Bertrand et al. 2010; Ejrnæs and Kunze 2013; Anderson et al. 2002; Joshi et al. 1999; Waldfogel 1998; Datta Gupta and Smith 2002). Existing studies on men suggest that the presence of children is positively associated with men’s earnings. However, evidence on more direct explanations of this finding is still scarce. There exists no consensus on the reasons for the “fatherhood wage premium” and interpretations diverge on whether this reflects gendered household specialization, positive discrimination or something else. Alternatively, factors that positively affect the likelihood to become a father may also be positively related to earnings, suggesting that fathers may be a (positively) selected group. Evidence so far however suggests negative selection which is not consistent with a fatherhood premium (Lundberg and Rose 2000, 2002).Footnote 1 Part of the controversy regarding the fatherhood premium is that it is complicated to interpret correlations of children and earnings as a (direct) effect of children. This is because parenthood might be endogenous with respect to earnings and correlated with unobserved factors. The most common approach in the literature has been to estimate the mean effect of the arrival of children from Mincerian earnings equations exploiting cross-sectional variation, or the comparison of individual outcomes post versus pre-birth (fixed effects estimation). Instrumental variables have been used to estimate the earnings effect of the increase in number of children from two to three (Angrist and Evans 1998), teenage pregnancy (Hotz et al. 2005), and delayed motherhood (Miller 2011). A caveat of these estimates is that effects at particular parity may not be generalizable to other parities. Nor does it allow us to test for non-linearity in the effect of children. The goal of this study is to estimate the effect of children on male earnings and earnings inequality over the male life cycle. We exploit data on brothers and twins, in order to explore another channel of non-random selection on unobserved family fixed factors. Such unobserved family fixed factors may capture several characteristics that are common to brothers such as neighborhood and socioeconomic status, or parental investment into cognitive development during childhood.Footnote 2 Our data offer several advantages compared to the literature to investigate this channel. First, we use panel register data on earnings and fertility for several cohorts of men which is rarely available to researchers and facilitate a clean study of the male earnings effects of children.Footnote 3 Second, we observe individual earnings trajectories during the period 1975 to 2005, and link male siblings and twin brothers. Since we have population data this results in large samples.Footnote 4 Third, our study does not suffer from attenuation bias problems arising from measurement error in survey data (Bound and Solon 1999) on earnings and fertility. Fourth, we use data on Norway that allow us to investigate whether family background affects outcomes in a country with a high degree of equality.Footnote 5 We use these data to estimate flexible Mincerian earnings regressions that control for family fixed effects. We find that OLS estimates which use the cross-sectional comparison of men who have a child and men who remain childless is plagued by selection effects into fatherhood and overestimates the (positive) effect of having children on male earnings, which has been found in existing studies. We show that the earnings profiles of men who have a child over the lifetime and childless men differ already before the arrival of the first child. Thus, not accounting for these differences in trends makes (all) childless men not a suitable control group. Our estimation approach accounts for these differences in a flexible way, and in addition through family fixed effects. Our coefficient estimations exploit the variation in differences across siblings within the same family throughout the lifecycle, and essentially exploit the variation from sibling couples where one brother has children and the other does not. When we compare earnings profiles of twin brothers we find that they are on equal earnings growth paths and there is no significant effect of children on earnings. Robustness tests show that the general results still hold when we change the control group to childless men who will eventually get married. We also show that the post-birth effect only to a minor extent captures a marriage effect over and above the arrival of a child effect. Controls for being married explain only a relatively small part of the effect of the arrival of a child, 28%. We also show that the shift in earnings post births is entirely driven by the event of a first child. Regarding inequality in earnings among men, this result highlights that it is not the fact of having children that is driving inequality over the life cycle, but selection into the group of childless and never married men, versus fathers or fathers-to-be. These findings for Norway, a country with a high degree of income equality may suggest further interest in investigating variation across countries. Our results on men and children add to the policy debate on family-work balance, which is no longer limited to women and work. Politicians in some countries set incentives for fathers to stay home through paternity leave policies. As survey data shows, men have increased the weight they place on family values (see e.g. Goldin 2006) and family time. A new and growing academic literature sets the focus on understanding various aspects of the interaction between fathers and children such as effects on peer behavior (Dahl et al. 2014) and child outcomes (Cools et al. 2015).Footnote 6 The group of men and boys has also gained interest since it seems that more recently it is men who are falling behind (see Autor and Wasserman 2013). We also add to recent more descriptive studies on Scandinavia comparing relative earnings trajectories of fathers and mothers, and couples, around the event of childbirth (Angelov et al. 2016; Kleven et al. 2018). Our extensions are that we focus on sibling brothers that are followed over time in the labor market, and that we broaden the view to inequality over the lifecycle among men. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the economic explanations as to why having children affects male earnings. Section 3 presents the data and summary statistics. Section 4 derives the earnings equation. Section 5 presents the empirical results, followed by a number of robustness tests and the discussion. Section 6 concludes.",7

Until the mid-1970s Spain was one of highest fertility countries in Europe, with TFR close to 3. Since then the fertility rate has plummeted to the lowest levels in the EU/OECD (see Fig. 1). This change has been dramatic as the fertility rate dropped by more than 60% in less than 20 years, from 2.8 in 1978 to 1.1 in 1998.Footnote 1 After hitting the bottom, the fertility rate has fluctuated between 1.1–1.4 during the last 2 decades, which could be related to the business cycle experience in Spain. However, the sudden influx of immigrants during the first decade of this century accounts for an important part of this pro-cyclical behaviour (see Fig. 8 in the Appendix). If we limit to the Spanish Nationals, the fertility rate has been quite stable around 1.2 during the last 20 years, clearly below the average rate amongst European countries and one of the lowest-low fertility countries (together with Italy and Germany), a label coined by Kohler et al. (2002, 2006) and Billari and Kohler (2004). Total fertility rate In this paper we adopt a novel approach to study fertility behaviour in Spain. We focus on fertility patterns of different cohorts of women during the last four decades and we examine the potential socio-economic forces underlying such behaviour. We adopt a cohort approach because we think it has several advantages. The most widely used fertility measure, TFR, is a short-term, period-based contemporaneous measure of fertility and therefore sensitive to the changes in tempo (age) of childbearing (Bongaarts and Feeney 1998). It is lower than the underlying rate when the childbearing age is delayed and vice versa. It is also possible that some cohorts delay while others accelerate the childbearing pace resulting in an ambiguous result on the TFR. In contrast, cohort fertility (completed or cumulative up to certain ages) can be considered as a longer-term and life-cycle measure of fertility as it considers childbearing behaviour of all (or up to observed) fertile ages of women. These issues are discussed in Myrskylä et al. (2013) and Goldstein and Cassidy (2014) who advocate for a cohort perspective in the analysis of fertility. Their focus, however, is on improving period fertility measures by implementing cohort perspectives in tempo-quantum adjustment. On the other hand, Frejka (2017) analyzes cohort fertility to establish four distinct transition patterns across developed world while Zeman et al. (2018) study the decline in cohort fertility using parity progression rates. Their main finding indicates that the decline in cohort fertility for women born between 1955 and 1970 in Central and Eastern Europe is mainly due to the drop in the progression rate to the second parity while for women of the same cohorts in Europe and East Asia it is due to a reduction in the first-birth rate. What we propose here is to take this cohort perspective to better understand the relationship between childbearing decisions and socio-economic circumstances faced by each cohort along their fertile ages. As most covariates included are not genuinely exogenous, the results should be interpreted more as correlations rather than causal effects. An important advantage of our approach is that we can directly relate the socioeconomic conditions faced by each cohort in each single age (and cumulative conditions up to each age) to their age-specific fertility rates. Furthermore, we can control for the cumulative fertility experience up to a particular age in the estimation of age-specific fertility rate. Another advantage of our approach is that we can document how the changes in childbearing patterns (number and timing) across different cohorts of women have contributed to the observed evolution of TFR. In doing so the empirical analysis is more consistent with the life-cycle dynamic nature of childbearing decisions than the analysis that solely relates TFR with contemporaneous socio-economic variables. An obvious disadvantage of using cohort fertility is that one has to wait until the end of fertile age to know the completed fertility of a certain cohort. However, for those who have not completed their fertile age one can examine their fertility behaviour up to the ages observed and compare with other cohorts conditional on age. As far as we are aware, no studies have focused on age-specific fertility rates by cohort relating directly to the socioeconomic variables faced in each single age by each cohort. We believe our approach is more consistent with the life-cycle dynamic nature of the fertility decision. As emphasised by Esping-Andersen (2013), the analysis based on socio-economic aggregates, that do not consider differences across cohorts, may be misleading due to the remarkable differences across cohorts. We think our approach using pseudo-panel data (synthetic cohorts) which combines real cohort fertility and estimated socio-economic variables by cohort and age (year) is interesting when faced with the absence of the long panel micro data that would be the ideal data for our study. Pseudo-panel data has advantages and disadvantages. Availability of longer observation periods and avoidance of attrition and small sample size problems are the main advantages while the main inconvenience is errors in variables as the socio-economic variables are computed using sample surveys (Deaton 1985). Our main findings are what follows. We document a continuous delay of childbearing across cohorts born from 1960 to 1980, in particular first births. The effect of this delay on fertility is only partially recovered at older ages. We also observe a rapid increase in childlessness among the younger cohorts. Regarding the fertility rates and the socioeconomic variables we find that female education and insecurity in the labour market, represented by temporary contract prevalence, as the most important covariates of cohort age-specific fertility rates, but male employment does not seem to be correlated with it. The paper is organized as follows. In “Literature” we review the literature and in “Data and methods” we describe the data used for our analysis. In “Socio-economic and institutional changes in Spain” we document the main socio-economic and institutional changes over the period of analysis. “Evolution of cohort fertility in Spain” presents a detailed description of the fertility behaviour of different cohorts of women while in “Socio economic conditions on fertility: cohort approach” we discuss relationships between life-cycle profiles of several economic variables and age-specific fertility rates of different cohorts. Finally, in “Conclusions” we close with some concluding remarks.",1

Public discourse and policymakers often support parental leave and cheap childcare provision without necessarily studying the interaction of these different programs on labour or childcare markets and public finances. In this article I rely on a French 2004 policy change to highlight the aggregate and distributional consequences of a broad increase in parental leave benefits and childcare subsidies when the policymaker does not explicitly adjust the supply-side infrastructures of the childcare market. The reform offered a 6-month stay-home subsidy for first-time mothers wishing to take-up parental leave, independent of household income. At the same time, childcare subsidies were increased for all households with pre-school age children using childmindersFootnote 1 and eligibility was restricted to working parents. Previous studies (Givord and Marbot (2015); Joseph et al. (2013)) have looked at each benefit modification while ignoring the other contemporaneous change, and adopted different methodologies in their analysis. I argue that the reform should be evaluated in its entirety with a consistent framework and not in a piecemeal approach to credibly identify the impact of each program. Differentiating the short-run and long-run effects of the reform is also crucial. I take advantage of the variation in program eligibility across demographic groups to analyse the impact of each policy change and their potential interaction. To be more specific, I focus on mothers with one or two children whose youngest is of pre-school age (i.e., below 3 years old). I study the impact of the policy on the entire group and on the following subgroups: (1) first-time mothers with a child younger than 1 year old (mostly affected by the parental leave subsidy introduction), (2) first-time mothers with a child between 1 and 3 years old (affected directly by childcare subsidy changes and potentially by persistent effects of having interrupted their career during the short parental leave) and (3) mothers of a second child of pre-school age (solely affected by childcare subsidy changes). I rely on Labour Force Surveys to study the short and long-run reaction of mothers’ labour market outcomes: employment, weekly working hours, hourly wages. The reform design allows me to define the short-run as the first 3 years of implementation and the long-run as the following 3 years. I adopt a diff-in-diff methodology where the control group are mothers of elder children unaffected by the reform. In the appendix I provide robustness checks on the common trend assumptions.Footnote 2 I find that in the short run, mothers eligible to the new benefits did not react significantly along any dimension. However, in the long-run, mothers eligible to the parental leave ended up reducing their employment rate by 6.6% points to stay home with their new born child. I show that the effect was nearly twice as large for the lower educated as for the higher educated. Once eligibility to the parental leave expired, no impact of the policy package can be observed, meaning that the short parental leave had no persistent effect on these mothers’ labour market outcomes and childcare subsidies did not boost their labour supply. Furthermore, in the long-run, mothers of two children whose youngest was between 1 and 3 years old increased their employment rate by 4.2% points as a result of the more generous childminder care subsidies. In the article, I find that these effects were concentrated among middle-class, educated and married mothers in that group. The fact that the effects take time to materialise and do not appear at the aggregate level for the entire group of pre-school age mothers suggests that the policy did not induce any net increase in the supply of care places and simply led to a re-allocation of care modes among mothers. In the last section of the paper, I use household surveys and data on the supply-side of the childcare market to confirm this last prediction. I find evidence that among mothers with a child aged 1 to 3 years old, first-time mothers may have been crowded out by those with two children and childminders may have captured part of the childcare subsidy. In 2009, the total amount spent on the private carers subsidies by the government was 4.6Bn € (0.24% of GDP) while the figure stood at 2.3Bn € (0.14% of GDP) in 2003.",5
18.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,19 May 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-020-09488-w,Efficient child care subsidies: any need for cash for care?,September 2020,Gerhard Glomm,Volker Meier,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The provision and financing of child care varies substantially across countries. For example, child care facilities are often publicly provided and heavily subsidized in France and Sweden, while there is no similarly strong intervention in the child care market in the UK. These radically different approaches to child care policy in the former countries all lead to rates of formal child care of around 30–45% (in 2006) of children below age 3, which lies considerably above the European average (DICE Database 2011). Moreover, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Germany have experimented with cash for care, henceforth called no-use subsidies, where lump-sum payments are granted to parents with children at infant age who do not use public or subsidized private child care facilities. Thus, these subsidies are paid both if parents take care for their children or if unsubsidized external child care is chosen. The empirical literature from Heckman (1974) on argues repeatedly that increased access to subsidized child care raises labor supply of mothers (eg Lefebvre and Merrigan 2008; Herbst 2010; Bauernschuster and Schlotter 2015; Morissey 2017), while it remains unclear whether there is also a significant positive effect on fertility (Bick 2016; Bauernschuster et al. 2016). In advanced economies, as suggested by Havnes and Mogstad (2011), analyzing the expansion of kindergarten in Norway, it may happen that public child care supply simply crowds out private alternatives with little impact on maternal labor supply. Conversely, increasing parental care allowances has been found to reduce labor supply of mothers in Finland (Kosonen 2014) and Germany (Gathmann and Sass 2018). Two main policy questions arise from these mixed observations which we address in this paper. First, which factors determine efficient subsidies for market care, and how? Second, is there any allocative justification for introducing no-use subsidies in the presence of an optimized scheme of market subsidies? And if not, which types of policies regarding market care subsidies call for complementing them by granting cash for care, and why? We study household’s child care choices where parental care and external care can be substituted on a continuous basis. While higher wages for secondary earners generally drive up the demand for external care, higher incomes of primary earners may work in the opposite direction. When replacing lower by higher quality of external care, this will often go along with an upward jump in household labor supply. For simplicity, we fix labor supply of the primary earner at full time—which makes sense in a cooperative household framework if the primary earner exhibits both higher wage rate in the market and lower productivity in parental child care. We abstract from issues of uncoordinated labor supply and home production decisions as being addressed by Meier and Rainer (2015); there it turns out that optimal taxation of wages will typically be gender-specific being determined both by Ramsey-type labor supply elasticity considerations and Pigouvian impacts of encouraging home production. Finally, we exclude rationing of access to child care subsidies, which has been employed at least temporarily in some countries due to insufficient funding of the program (Del Boca and Vuri 2007; Guzman 2019). The main focus of our analysis lies in determining a scheme of optimal subsidies for child care. The decision between supplying labor and purchasing child care in the market on the one side and caring for the own children at home on the other side is distorted by wage taxation. As home production cannot be taxed, secondary earners with low productivities in the labor market are inclined to stay at home and care for their children themselves. We show that optimal subsidies for external care increase in the wage and the marginal tax rate of the secondary earner, and fall with a higher price of external care. This structure turns out because optimal subsidies are designed so as to perfectly offset the distortions from taxing wages of secondary earners. If subsidies for external child care are set at an excessive level, a justification of no-use subsidies arises. In that case we determine optimal levels. Finally, parents may have imperfect altruism towards their children or underestimate the impact of child care quality on their children's wellbeing and future productivity. Such a situation may be dealt with by reduced subsidies for market care or increasing no-use subsidies. If there is quality differentiation in the market for external child care, optimal subsidies are determined perfectly analogously to the basic model, undoing also distortions of choosing between types of external care, where parental care does not receive a subsidy. The rate of subsidization decreases in the price of market care. It is noticeable that for many specifications efficient market subsidies exhibit only moderate informational requirements, where preference parameters and both parental and market care quality levels can be ignored. This is due to the fact that all distortions can be undone, bringing relative prices back to laissez-faire levels. Considering finally a setting in which subsidies support only one standard quality type, households will revise their decisions at the expense of both lower and higher quality alternatives. In this situation, a new justification arises for implementing no-use subsidies to reduce welfare losses from quality choice distortions in the market. Summing up, while cash for care is never needed if efficient individualized market care subsidies are used, we identify two rationales for having them: excessive market care subsidies and selective subsidization of market care qualities. In their comprehensive survey on the literature on the economics of child care, Blau and Currie (2006) present several justifications for government intervention, stressing positive externalities not taken into account by parents and information asymmetries, resulting in poor qualities in the child care market. This message is backed by Blau and Hagy (1998), pointing to substantial substitution effects when varying the price for some type of care in combination with low propensities to pay for quality-related attributes. In line with our findings, Baker et al. (2008), considering a day care subsidization reform in Quebec, find substantial crowding out of private day care and negative impacts of child and family wellbeing. Regarding long-term outcomes, Havnes and Mogstad (2015), studying kindergarten expansion in Norway, suggest negative impacts on children from wealthy families and positive impacts on children from a disadvantaged family background. In a similar vein, Gathmann and Sass (2018), analyzing the impacts of implementing the no-use subsidy in the German state of Thuringia, find a considerable labor supply reduction and losses in cognitive outcomes of children from poorer families. Such policies may also have an impact on siblings. According to Bettinger et al. (2014) exploiting a cash for care reform in Norway, a significant positive impact on the educational outcomes of older siblings arises with mothers staying at home due to taking up that no-use subsidy. The theoretical literature on child care subsidies is still inconclusive. Apps and Rees (2004) argue that increasing the subsidy to formal child care financed by a cut in family allowances will increase labor supply and fertility. Distortions associated with wage taxes are smaller if child care facilities are funded or subsidized through these taxes (Blomquist et al. 2010). Looking at a life-cycle model with a capital income tax rate as additional policy instrument, Domeij and Klein (2013) derive a Ramsey rule, keeping the tax wedge constant over time and advocate full tax deductibility of child care expenses. Discussing family allowances, parental leave benefits and subsidies for external child care, Fenge and Stadler (2014) obtain ambiguous impacts on welfare, as any change of the composition of policy measures has asymmetric distributional implications. Kemnitz and Thum (2015) analyze changes in the balance of power of spouses, inducing inefficiently low fertility. They consider child allowances, maternal care benefits and formal child care subsidies as alternative instruments to overcome the inefficiency. Other papers investigate political economy issues. If taxes on wages are comparatively high, the childless will support substantial subsidies to day care facilities due to a higher labor supply of mothers and the resulting increase in tax revenue (Bergstrom and Blomquist 1996). However, the calibration exercise of Guner et al. (2020) also points to a substantial fraction of losers from adopting a universal childcare program. Borck and Wrohlich (2011) consider households differentiated in income voting on the size of the public childcare systems in the spirit of Epple and Romano (1996a, 1996b) where rich households opt out in favor of private childcare in tailored quality. The papers closest in spirit to ours are Apps and Rees (2018) and Bastani et al. (2017) considering fully fledged optimal tax models where external child care quality is available at different prices and government policy is to a considerable extent driven by redistributional considerations. Apps and Rees (2018) stress that individual taxation tends to be superior to joint taxation since tax avoidance by using parental care is less pronounced. Bastani et al. (2017) presuppose joint taxation and allow for a wide range of child care policies. The government has a center-based alternative at its disposal from which the households can opt out and may further use a non-linear tax schedule, tax deductions and tax credits. In their setting child care subsidies are unlikely to be used in an optimal scheme since richer households purchase more expensive higher quality alternatives. Our contribution can be seen as complementing the Mirrleesian approach, downplaying distributional considerations as far as possible so as to highlight efficiency-based aspects. Informational asymmetries are related to parental care and external care qualities. Our paper provides value added in two directions. First, keeping the analysis simpler yields transparent characterizations how efficiency-based subsidization will be differentiated across households according to observables. Second, highlighting the political debate on cash for care policies, it indicates under which circumstances such policies can be justified. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic model with some comparative static analysis. After showing how to overcome the distortion induced by wage taxation in Section 3, Section 4 deals with justifying cash for care subsidies. Having investigated the consequences of incomplete contracts between child and parents in Section 5, Section 6 is devoted to analysing the case of a differentiated external care supply. The final Section 7 concludes and indications directions for further research.",3

Assessing the roles of skills and other personal resources for work-life strains,September 2020,Niels-Hugo Blunch,David C. Ribar,Mark Western,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Many working parents struggle to balance the demands of their jobs and family roles. Intuitively, we might see these strains as symptoms of limited time, competing demands, and resource constraints, and we might expect that more resources would ease work-family pressures. However, theory and evidence regarding the role of resources are equivocal. Hamermesh and Lee (2007) offer a rational-choice conceptual model of time stress that predicts that increased resources in the form of higher market wages or even higher unearned incomes can make time constraints bind more rather than less. Empirical studies have found that higher-quality jobs (Marshall and Barnett 1993) and more education (Losoncz 2011) are also associated with greater strains. These counter-intuitive results raise many questions. Worse, they suggest that outcomes, such as fairer pay and more white-collar job opportunities for women—that are good in most contexts—might be a source of stress in families. Empirical research on work-family balance has considered three principal domains of resources: economic resources, such as incomes, wage rates, and accommodating jobs; social resources, such as partner support, kin and friend networks, and community support; and personal resources, such as educational attainments, health, personality, and abilities. An analytical challenge to testing the resource hypothesis is that many types of resources may be influenced by work-life trade-offs. A person’s wage might incorporate a compensating differential for benefits or schedules that accommodate family responsibilities (Rosen 1986). Social networks might be smaller if long work hours prevent someone from socializing. Health may be compromised by work-family strains (Allen et al. 2000; Grzywacz and Bass 2003). Some other types of resources, especially personal capacities that are determined prior to beginning a family or career and are also relatively stable across adulthood, may provide a better way to test resource hypotheses. Empirical studies have investigated some personal resources, such as parents’ education and personality traits, but have generally not considered other resources, such as skills and cognitive abilities. Our study uses the rich data from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey to investigate how standard social, economic, and personal resource measures from previous research correlate with work-family gains and strains. However, in a departure from other studies, we also examine self-assessed skills and cognitive capabilities. Skills and cognitive ability have been shown to contribute to higher wages and better social outcomes (Cawley et al. 2001; Heckman et al. 2006). However, they have not been considered in the context of work-life balance. The HILDA survey collects these measures separately for every adult in each surveyed household. This allows us to examine characteristics of both the parent and her or his partner, providing a more complete picture of the resources available in the household. Previous research has typically either ignored the partner’s characteristics or considered them in a cursory way. We conduct empirical analyses in which our outcome measure is a comprehensive work-life strain scale that includes work-family and work-parenting elements and also positive and negative outcomes. We estimate multivariate regression models jointly for working mothers and fathers, using Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) methods. These allow us to consider gender differences while accounting for shared unobservable characteristics within households. The multivariate analyses reveal that several abilities and traits are important. Fathers with higher self-reported math skills and mothers with higher self-reported computer skills experience fewer work-life strains than other parents. However, fathers who perform better on a symbol look-up test—a test of attention, visual scanning acuity, and motor speed—experience more work-life strains. The traits of extraversion, conscientiousness, and emotional stability are negatively associated with men’s and women’s strains. Agreeableness is also negatively associated and openness to experience, positively associated with women’s strains.",1

Hamermesh,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A substantial economics literature has arisen examining the determinants of human life satisfaction, arguably going back to Pollak (1976), with the early literature summarized by Easterlin (2001).Footnote 1 Throughout this immense literature, however, very few studies have related satisfaction even to reports on work time in annual or monthly household surveys. The relationship between “how” one spends non-work time and happiness has also been studied (e.g., Kahneman et al. 2004). No study, however, has examined how the nature of a person’s interactions with others—“with whom” they spend their non-work time—relates to life satisfaction; and none has simultaneously examined how uses of time and with whom it is spent affect happiness or life satisfaction. I examine these relationships here, parsing out the determinants of satisfaction in two major population groups, married couples without young children, and singles. Section II links the discussion to consumer theory. Section III describes the data and samples used to study how different relationships to the people with whom one spends time and how one uses it affect life satisfaction. Section IV presents sets of estimates based on these data, while Section V presents a confirmation using British time-use data. Since the widespread lock-downs associated with Covid-19 alter “with whom” one spends time, and probably also change “how” one spends it, Section VI reports the results of simulations of possible impacts of lock-downs on well-being using the American results.",45

Italy has experienced the worst outbreak in Europe, especially in the north. Italy was the first European country to report people infected with the novel Coronavirus and one of the countries with the highest number of cases (Figs. 1 and 2). At the beginning of March 2020, the Italian government imposed drastic measures to contain the growing epidemic: a lockdown on activities and public services, regulations prohibiting all movement by individuals unless for justified for work, health or other urgent necessities, school closures (as of February 25th), and required social distancing of at least one metre between individuals.Footnote 1 While these measures have largely stemmed the spread of the virus, they have also had a huge impact on male and female labour market participation (see Barbieri et al. 2020; Casarico and Lattanzio 2020; Centra et al. 2020) and on inequality (Galasso 2020). We expect them to have substantially affected housework and childcare, too. Evidence from past economic crises suggests that recessions often affect men’s and women’s employment differently, with a greater negative effect on men (Rubery and Rafferty 2013; Hoynes et al. 2012). As a consequence of the 2008 financial crisis, for instance, job losses were much greater in male-dominated sectors of the economy (notably construction and manufacturing), while women’s working hours actually increased. As reported in very recent studies (Hupkau and Petrongolo 2020; Alon et al. 2020), the current recession is instead likely to have a similar impact on male and female employment, since the social measures taken have affected sectors where both genders are employed (ILO 2020). A comparative study reports changes in the patterns of family life, manifesting in new work patterns and chore allocations in several European countries (Biroli et al. 2020). Using representative surveys from the USA and UK, other authors document how the pandemic affected the variation in the percentage of tasks that workers can do from home (Adams-Prassl et al. 2020). In fact, the current COVID-19 crisis is not just an economic crisis, but a health and social one, too. The labour market is just one dimension of human work. COVID-19 is also expected to have major consequences on family work, due to increased housework and childcare resulting from the closing of schools and nurseries. Many women are already struggling to make it to work at all, given the need for at least one parent to stay home and mind the children (Queisser et al. 2020). Preliminary evidence from Spain (Farré et al. 2020) and from the UK (Sevilla and Smith 2020) shows that there has been a shift towards a more equal distribution of household and childcare between men and women, but most of the extra work caused by the crisis has fallen on women. In this paper, we focus on Italy and investigate the effect of COVID-19 on work, housework and childcare arrangements of women and their male partners, both working before COVID-19. The Italian context is particularly interesting, not only because of the strict lockdown measures taken to contain the crisis, but also from a gender standpoint. Italy is characterized by both traditionally high gender gaps in the labour market and conservative gender roles, which put most of the burden of housework and childcare on women.Footnote 2 Before the pandemic, a large proportion of grandparents (about 40% according to SHARE data) provided daily childcare. The mandatory implementation of social distancing has substantially reduced the availability of grandparental care, thus increasing the burden on families already caused by school and child-care facility closures. Higher fatality rates among the elderly may also have affected a large number of families living together or close by.Footnote 3 In this context, we argue that the impact of COVID-19 on family work is related to the time that couples have to spend at home due to the emergency restrictions. Our goal is to understand how and to what extent family roles have changed since COVID-19 forced domestic partners to reorganize their time at home due to the lockdown. Is the increased time spent at home leading to a reallocation of couples’ roles in household chores and family care? To answer this question, we use data on two representative samples of Italian women, working and non-working before the emergency. The data were collected in April 2020.Footnote 4 We hypothesize different impacts on the division of labour between housework and childcare within the household depending on the working arrangements of women and their partners at the time of the outbreak of COVID-19. Our empirical analysis shows that the new working arrangements have the potential to further increase women’s housework and childcare. Since we consider women and their partners, our data allow us to consider the allocation of housework and childcare within the couple. Our results indicate that men and women have reacted differently to the changing circumstances: 68% of women are spending more time in housework and 61% in childcare; the respective percentages for men are lower and equal to 40 and 51%. This result is consistent with findings from other real time data sets collected in Italy (Mangiavacchi et al. 2020) and other countries, such as the UK (Sevilla and Smith 2020) and Spain (Farré et al. 2020) which reported a greater contribution of men to childcare. Our results raise concerns about the effect of COVID-19 on women’s labour market participation. Current work arrangements may make it even harder for women to participate than for men. More importantly, higher rates of male participation in domestic responsibilities, and particularly in housework, are associated to higher rates of female participation in the labour market (Fanelli and Profeta 2019). Thus, the consequences of COVID-19 on female labour market outcomes risk being amplified by the unequal intrahousehold allocation of extra work (housework and childcare) created by the emergency. The paper is organized as follows: the next section describes the data and report some relevant statistics, Section 3 presents our main analysis and results, Section 4 discusses relevant policy implications and Section 5 concludes.",314
18.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,22 August 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-020-09496-w,Data from the COVID-19 epidemic in Florida suggest that younger cohorts have been transmitting their infections to less socially mobile older adults,December 2020,Jeffrey E. Harris,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Recent reports suggest that the age distribution of new cases of COVID-19 in the United States has shifted toward younger adults (Malmgren et al. 2020). One possible explanation is that younger adults have tended to adhere less strictly to recommended social distancing measures, especially as many states, counties and municipalities have begun to reopen. A particular concern is that the higher prevalence of active infection among younger individuals will ultimately result in a higher rate of cross-infection in older persons. In this article, we use publicly available data on confirmed individual COVID-19 cases compiled by the state of Florida to test whether the incidence of new coronavirus infections has in fact been rising more rapidly among younger cohorts. We then explore whether the available data can be used to assess whether cross-infection of older cohorts is already occurring. To that end, we analyze the daily incidence of newly reported COVID-19 cases among adults aged 20–39 years, 40–59 years, and 60 or more years in the sixteen most populous counties of the state of Florida from March 1 through June 27, 2020. In all 16 counties, we observe an increase in reported COVID-19 case incidence in all three age groups soon after the governor-ordered Full Phase 1 reopening went into effect. Trends in social mobility, but not trends in testing, track case incidence. We then use our data on COVID-19 case incidence to estimate a parsimonious two-group heterogeneous SIR model of the epidemic in each county. Our parameter estimates support the hypothesis that younger persons, having first acquired their infections through increasing social contact with their peers, then transmitted their infections to older, less socially mobile individuals. Without such cross-infection, an isolated epidemic among older people in Florida would be unsustainable.",17

Wright,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans are being encouraged – and in many states ordered – to socially distance and stay at home.Footnote 1,Footnote 2 Yet, there are concerns that many people have failed to comply and there has been pressure to relax requirements, both of which have important efficiency implications for these policies.Footnote 3 This raises two key questions: to what extent are people not complying with orders to reduce social interaction? And what drives this non-compliance? Given the policy’s dual mandate to protect individuals from harm and reduce the transmission to others, this paper examines whether primary preferences and characteristics that align with these objectives are predictive of compliance. Specifically, whether preexisting health factors, risk aversion, and altruism predict staying at home and socially distancing. If individuals respond to the policy based on their own benefits from compliance, we should expect that those who are at greater risk of severe consequences from an infection, or more risk averse, will be more likely to comply. Likewise, those who are more altruistic should also have higher compliance because this reduces the likelihood of infecting others. Exploiting multiple surveys of California undergraduate students during a stay-at-home order,Footnote 4 we find that a quarter of our subjects violated the order for non-essential reasons. Yet neither preexisting health factors, risk aversion, nor altruism predicted compliance with social distancing guidelines. This is despite the fact that both existing health conditions and risk aversion have been shown to increase preventative health behaviors, and altruism has been shown to affect similar decisions in the context of communicable diseases (Anderson and Mellor 2008; Hurley and Mentzakis 2013; Schmitz and Wubker 2010). We did find that more risk tolerant individuals were more likely to leave their homes and not socially distance when obtaining essential services or for employment (i.e., behaviors that were permitted under the order). Yet, when these exceptions are excluded, we no longer found that risk tolerance was predictive of compliance. Current stay-at-home orders are minimally enforced, such that individuals mostly self-select into compliance. This may be efficiency enhancing when compliance is determined by underlying preferences or health conditions that individuals face. In contrast, if an individual’s decision-making is driven by misperceptions of their true benefits and costs, then self-enforcement will reduce welfare (Allcott et al. 2020; Barrios and Hochberg 2020). Our findings support the latter, as variation in compliance does not reflect differences in underlying preferences or primary conditions that affect illness severity. Our findings also inform research on the optimal public policy response to the pandemic, which has generally assumed that compliance with social distancing should increase with the severity of the health risk faced by an individual (Chudik et al. 2020; Glover et al. 2020; Rampini 2020). Our results highlight that this may not be true for policies that rely on self-selection into preventative behaviors.Footnote 5 Since hospitalization rates are higher among these vulnerable individuals, a consequence is that minimal enforcement may result in greater health care congestion than is assumed in current policy analyses. Beyond academic research, public commentary on the pandemic has made similar assumptions. Contrary to our findings, many assume that preferences and health risks drive the response to stay-at-home orders. Those who violate social distancing guidelines are accused of being less altruistic (i.e., selfish) (BBC 2020). Likewise, those who argue against the orders claim that risk aversion (i.e., cowardice) is resulting in an overreaction to the pandemic, and that those with greater health risks will naturally continue to socially distance even if restrictions were relaxed (Emerson and DeSilvia 2020; Williams 2020). Our results suggest that these inferences may be misguided, undermining productive debate on the public policy response to the pandemic. Our findings also suggest that highlighting personal risk and reduced transmission to others may be ineffective at improving compliance, at least at this stage of the pandemic. And that as social distancing requirements continue, compliance is unlikely to alter the composition of the voting electorate to be more risk-loving, less altruistic, or healthier. These findings contribute to the literature identifying how demographics and risk perceptions affect the response to health policy during a pandemic (Bish and Michie 2010; Bults et al. 2011; Ibuka et al. 2010). In the context of COVID-19, Wise et al. (2020) find that perceived personal risk is associated with preventative behaviors, but that people are poor at assessing their actual risk. In contrast to our findings, Campos-Mercade et al. (2020) find that in Sweden prosocial preferences are predictive of adopting preventative behaviors, including physical distancing.Footnote 6 The difference may be explained by the fact that their sample includes adults of all ages and educational achievement, whereas we focus on college students. In addition, the Swedish policy response differed significantly from stay-at-home orders in the United States, and more explicitly relied on individual discretion to socially distance; for example, restaurants, malls, and gyms remained open in Sweden. Finally, responsiveness to the pandemic may have been more politicized in the United States, dampening responsiveness to primary preferences and characteristics. Indeed, risk perception of COVID-19 and social distancing has been shown to be affected by partisan leanings in the United States (Allcott et al. 2020; Barrios and Hochberg 2020). Also in the context of COVID-19, our findings are generally consistent with the literature that cautions that the decision to socially distance may not reflect one’s true marginal benefit from doing so. We also contribute to the broader literature explaining individual health care decisions. Our focus on risk tolerance, altruism, and health conditions is guided by a literature that explores these factors in the adoption of preventative health behaviors (Anderson and Mellor 2008; Hurley and Mentzakis 2013; Schmitz and Wubker 2010), and the much larger literature that explores risk and altruism preferences in decision making (e.g., Kolm and Ythier 2006). We also contribute to the literature exploring altruism in decision-making when externalities are present (Fischbacher and Gachter 2010; Frey and Meier 2004; Korinek and Bethune 2020).",14

In the U.S., for instance, in 2015, federal government spending on Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP (Food Stamps), and primary and secondary education constituted 10.5% of GDP according to the United States House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Green Book. Despite their prevalence, there has long been skepticism about the value of such in-kind benefits. After all, giving recipients the cash value of the benefits would not restrict their behavior, leading to at least a weak improvement in their welfare. In response, economists have offered three broad classes of arguments made in favor of in-kind benefits. The first, which follows Loury (1981) and focuses on public provision of education,Footnote 1 argues that in-kind provision of education can be an efficient response to market incompleteness caused by borrowing constraints faced by parents in financing human capital investment for their children. Public education programs can correct inefficiently low levels of educational investment by low income parents and social moblity created by these borrowing constraints. Another, following Musgrave (1959) and many others, contends that in-kind provision is a tool of paternalism. By restricting the behavior of welfare recipients with in-kind benefits, governments are able to effectively prevent them from making choices deemed to be socially undesirable. The third, following Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) argues that, to the extent to which in-kind benefits make welfare less attractive, providing in-kind benefits allows the government to screen applicants by providing an incentive for those who do not need assistance to pay into the welfare system rather than claiming benefits. This literature shows that, when there are non-separabilities between consumption and leisure, subsidizing some goods relative to others can be an efficient way to incentivize labor supply. In-kind provision is one way to achieve such subsidies. A documented challenge for the validity of interpreting in-kind provision as a means for efficiently providing incentives is that a significant fraction of these in-kind welfare benefits are paid out to households that do not supply labor. In the U.S., for instance, the single largest in-kind program is Medicare, a health insurance program targeted specifically at retirees. Many enrolled in Medicaid, which is targeted at low-income households, are also recipients of long-term disability insurance payments and thus do not work. In 2016 22% of all households receiving SNAP benefits had a member at or near retirement age and 20% had a member on long-term disability. The majority of both groups receiving SNAP benefits (82% for the elderly and 67% for the disabled) were single heads-of-household, indicating that they were the targeted recipients of the benefits.Footnote 2 In light of these facts, Currie and Gahvari (2008) contend that it is difficult to see the goal of these programs as incentivizing labor supply. This paper addresses the question of whether there is a credible incentive argument for providing in-kind benefits to agents that supply no labor. First, it follows up on Currie and Gahvari’s conjecture first by showing that it is correct in the sense that, in a standard Mirrleesian framework, there is no efficiency reason to distort margins between goods when agents do not supply labor, even in the presence of non-separabilities. However, I then show that by adding home production to the standard Mirrleesian framework there is an efficiency reason for such distortions, even when agents are not working in the market. More specifically, I add a Beckerian home production technology that uses some consumption goods as inputs (such as groceries) but not others (such as restaurant meals). The information-constrained efficient allocation will subsidize goods used in home production for low-skill types if goods and labor are substitutes in home production. Such subsidization could be achieved by in-kind provision of goods used intensively in home production. While this argument does not apply to all in-kind benefit programs in the U.S. (for instance, healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid), it is generally consistent with: (1) the fact that many in-kind programs in the U.S. provide goods that are used in home production;Footnote 3 and (2) empirical work (e.g., Aguiar and Hurst 2007) that has found that goods and labor are indeed substitutes in home production. I conduct a numerical experiment with plausible parameters for the home production model and find that the scale of the in-kind program required to implement the constrained efficient allocation is consistent with the design and scale of U.S. programs.",

Meder,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The well-known positive correlation between divorce and financial hardship has long inspired debates over a variety of public policies. Many observers interpret that correlation as evidence that divorce causes hardship, such as if divorce eliminated opportunities to share household expenses or if divorcing spouses rushed to extract assets that were previously held jointly. Those who espouse this view often respond by proposing policies aimed either to reduce the incidence of divorce, to provide financial support to people impoverished by divorce, or perhaps to alter the financial settlements between divorcing spouses. On the other hand, some economic models suggest causality runs in the opposite direction, such as if unexpected losses of income reduced the potential gains from marriage, inflamed conflicts between spouses, or created incentives to separate in order to qualify for social welfare payments. For those mainly concerned about poverty, this view suggests there is little to be gained by promoting marriage, while those more concerned about reducing the divorce rate may seek to improve the finances of married couples or withhold financial assistance from divorced individuals. It is also quite possible the statistical relationship between hardship and divorce is spurious, such as if some personality traits (disagreeableness, irresponsibility, addiction, poor communication skills, etc.) increased the risk of both outcomes but there was no causal relationship between the two. Furthermore, it would not be surprising if the true statistical relationship between the two were confounded by some sort of anticipatory response, e.g., if some married workers increased their labor supply in order to boost their ability to support themselves in the event of divorce (as proposed by Johnson and Skinner (1986)). This paper investigates those competing hypotheses by estimating a structural model of divorce and financial hardship that nests many of the proposed channels. While many of the hypotheses have been studied separately, the model implies that estimates of the key parameters are interdependent, so estimating them jointly reduces the risk of biases. We begin with a standard theoretical model of divorce (including potential anticipatory responses to the ex-ante risk), and this flows into an empirical model with both simultaneous equations and selection on unobservables; both have been proposed by several previous researchers, but they have rarely been combined in the same model. We estimate its parameters using standard latent variables methods and data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort (NLSY79). Local unemployment rates serve as an instrument for financial hardship, and we follow several earlier studies in using an instrument for divorce based on the sex of couples’ first child. Our results reveal four primary findings. First, we find no evidence that a change in income-based hardship causes divorce. Second, in contrast, we find that the event of divorce has a substantial negative effect on women’s financial well-being as measured by an income/needs ratio. Third, when we allow the possibility of anticipatory behavior, we find that women who have an elevated risk of divorce increase their labor supply and/or work in more lucrative jobs, and this action can partially mitigate the financial effect in the event that the divorce occurs. Finally, after correcting for this effect of the propensity to divorce on future income, we find evidence of negative selection on unobservables. This contradicts some previous work that has expressed surprise at not having found such a correlation, and it suggests some unobserved factors may influence both divorce and financial hardship. After the next section briefly reviews previous work, section “Model” presents our behavioral and econometric model. Section “Data” discusses the data and presents preliminary results, including evidence on which subpopulations respond to our instruments. Section “Main results” presents the main results. Section “Conclusion” concludes with suggestions for further research.",1

Heggeness (2020). Exploiting state-level variation in the timing of stay-at-home orders and school closures in the US, Heggeness studies the impact of the COVID shock on parent’s labor supply during the initial stages of the pandemic. Using monthly panel data from the US Census Bureaus’ Current Population Survey (CPS), this article applies a difference-in-difference approach and compares several labor supply outcomes in early closure states to those in states with delayed or no closures:Footnote 2 labor market attachment; unemployment; employed but not working last week; hours worked, weekly and hourly earnings if employed. Heggeness finds that, compared to their counterparts in late closure states, mothers with jobs in early closure states were 68.8 percent more likely to not have worked in the last week before the interview. In contrast, there was no effect on working fathers or working women without school age children. More than working fathers and women without young children, working mothers were more likely to take temporary leave from formal work.Footnote 3 At the same time, relative to fathers’ hours, in early closure states, mothers who continued working increased their work hours by 1.8 percent. This effect is entirely driven by a reduction in fathers’ hours worked. For instance, fathers working full-time reduced their hours worked by about half an hour a week. Gema Zamarro and María J. Prados in “Gender Differences in Couples’ Division of Childcare, Work and Mental Health During COVID-19” analyze labor supply responses to COVID using another US data set and obtain similar results. Their analysis is based on the first 8 waves of the new “Understanding Coronavirus in America” survey administered biweekly by the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research over a four months period—from March 10 to July 22—, a nationally representative sample. They focus on working age respondents living with their partners. Zamarro and Prado find that among mothers and fathers in two-partner households who continued to work after the outbreak of COVID, the proportion of mothers who reduced their working hours (42%) is considerably larger than the proportion of fathers who did so (30%).Footnote 4 As for changes in employment status, the gender gap in parents’ loss of employment is relatively small: 4% more women lost their job, but after controlling for education the gap is not statistically significant. Low educated workers of both genders suffered larger job losses. In addition, Zamarro and Prado also document a sharp gender gap in who takes care of the kids in these two-partner households: after schools closed, 48% of mothers, but only 14% of fathers, are their children’s sole childcare providers. Many of these women had not been the only childcare provider at the beginning of the crisis. Conditioning on respondents currently working, 33% of working mothers and 11% of working fathers reported being the sole providers of childcare. The authors also examine how childcare arrangements are associated with changes in working hours and employment during the pandemic. Furthermore, they show that psychological distress increased significantly early into the pandemic.Footnote 5 The proportion of respondents with at least some symptoms of psychological distress peaked at the beginning of April, when close to half of all mothers of school-age children reported at least some symptoms of psychological distress. A gender gap is also evident here: over the entire sample period, women are always more stressed than men, and women with children are more stressed than women without children.Footnote 6Interestingly, the reverse appears to be the case for men: fathers are less stressed than men without children. Next, we compare the labor supply responses reported by Heggeness and Zamarro and Prado using two different data sets for the US to those reported by Del Boca et al. (2020) based on a relatively small Italian survey. More than 500 women and their partners were first interviewed in April and July 2019, before the pandemic, and re-interviewed in April 2020, while Italy was still under strict lockdown. Del Boca and coauthors find that 37% of women and 33% of men in their sample stopped working after the onset of the pandemic, implying a relatively small gender gap. This Italian study also reports results on the number of workers who switched to working from home and find a gender gap there: among the workers still working at the same job after the onset of the pandemic, 44% of women but only 30% of men had switched to working from home. Furthermore, the study reports on amounts of housework and childcare. They find that after the pandemic started spreading both men and women spend more time on housework and childcare, but dramatically more so in the case of women than in the case of men. For the 350 couples with children in the sample, if both partners are still working at the usual workplace, the percentages of them spending more time on childcare during the pandemic are 45% for women and 40% for men. If both partners are not working because of the emergency, the percentages become 71% for women and 59% for men. Most of the additional housework associated to COVID-19 measures fell on women while extra childcare activities were more equally shared. Other results indicate that working mothers with children younger than 5 report more difficulties achieving work-life balance, especially when their partners work outside the house during the lockdown. The switch to work-at-home is also the focus of “The Impact of Closing Schools on Working From Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence Using Panel Data From Japan” by Eiji Yamamura and Yoshiro Tsustsui. In Japan, national-wide school closures were introduced on March 2, when the country still had only a very few COVID-19 cases.Footnote 7 In contrast to the US and Italy, the Japanese government did not mandate that workers stay home: workers could choose whether to go to their workplace or to work from home. The authors designed their own bi-weekly internet panel survey and collected three waves of data between mid-March (March 10), and mid-April (April 10). Their multivariate analysis indicates that during the period in which schools were closed having primary school aged children (younger than 12) is likely to have induced women to work from home, while inducing men to go to their usual workplace. During the sample period, about 30% of women and 15% of men in the sample reported working only from home, while about 45% of women and 55% of men did not work at home at all. This effect is limited to parents of primary school children. It does not apply to older children. Having primary school children does not seem to have affected the decision to work-at-home for parents in three-generation households. Presumably, this is because grandparents took care of children affected by school closures.",25

Is there a gender difference in the effects of COVID-19 on work–life balance? These questions are critical as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads worldwide in 2020. Unexpected shocks, such as a great recession, affect modern life and thus, time allocation (e.g., Aguiar et al. 2013; Gorsuch 2016; Pabilonia 2017). The government has required people to work from home to contain the spread of COVID-19, which inevitably leads to recession. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed working styles and time use in various countries. A lockdown to cope with COVID-19 has increased the percentage of people who stay at home by 8% across US counties (Brzezinski et al. 2020). However, people with lower-paying jobs are less able to work from home in the United Kingdom (Costa-Dias et al. 2020). In contrast to other types of recessions, the recession caused by COVID-19 has a greater impact on sectors with high female employment shares (Alon et al. 2020). COVID-19 has led to the closure of schools in various countries (Baldwin and Mauro 2020). Above all, the closure of primary schools has necessitated childcare at home, which inevitably has increased parents’ burden of childcare.Footnote 1 Particularly, in a two-income household, a problem arises regarding who should care for the child at home. Married mother whose child delayed school entry increases labor supply for married women (Barua 2014). In Italy, most of the additional housework and childcare associated to COVID-19 falls on women while childcare activities are more equally shared within the couple than housework activities under COVID-19 pandemic (Del Boca et al. 2020).Footnote 2 Does this hold in different cultural and social condition? Primary and junior high schools were closed throughout Japan after Mach 2. However, there is a difference between Japan and other countries that implemented the policy of school closure. Under the lockdown adopted in various countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Italy, neither the firm’s manager nor the employees themselves can decide whether to go to the workplace. Meanwhile, the Japanese government has declared a state of emergency, but did not mandate workers to go to work. Those who choose to go their workplace are not penalized. Japanese workers can decide whether to go to the workplace or work from home to care for their child. Based on individual-level data collected directly after the closure of school in Japan, this study examines whether in a household with a child in primary school, the husband and/or wife work from home. Existing research has evaluated the effect of school closure to cope with outbreaks of a number of viral diseases (e.g., Cauchemez et al. 2008, 2014; Adda 2016). Recent studies have considered the differences in COVID-19’s effects between genders (Adams 2020; Alon et al. 2020). Other works have analyzed home-stay behavior (Doganoglu and Ozdenoren 2020; Engle et al. 2020; Yamamura and Tsutsui 2020) and remote work (Hatayama et al. 2020) under COVID-19. However, other than Sevilla and Smith (2020), not many studies have investigated how school closure affects parents’ work from home and causes gender differences in work styles during the pandemic. This study contributes by analyzing the said topic in Japan, where workers can choose their working style even in an emergency situation. The main findings are that in a household, males with children aged under 12 are less likely to work from home than other males, whereas females with children aged < 12 years are more likely to work from home than other females. However, having children in primary school does not significantly influence the work styles of parents in three-generation households. That is, grandparents informally provide childcare, which has reduced gender differences in parents’ work styles during the COVID-19 pandemic.Footnote 3 The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the situation in Japan and explains the surveys’ design. Section 3 describes the empirical method. Section 4 presents and interprets the estimated results. The final section provides some reflections and conclusions.",44

In the U.S., most primary and secondary (K-12) schools sent children home in mid-March 2020, with uncertain plans for when classes would resume.Footnote 1 By mid-April most states had terminated in-person classes for the rest of the academic year (Education Week 2020a). Many school districts pivoted to some form of remote learning to help students try to stay on track for their grade level. The method and intensity of continued education varied widely by state and school district, reflecting state-level directives and local school system decisions and resources. Some school systems offered options for online, print materials, both or neither, with some having teachers hold classes online. Some schools provided extra resources needed to support distance learning such as access to laptops, tablets, and the internet (Schwartz 2020). These disruptions in education supply are expected to result in significant setbacks for students. A Brown University study projected that students in grades 3 through 8 would start the 2020–21 academic year behind by almost half a year relative to grade-level expectations, having achieved only 63–68% of the expected learning gains in reading and only 37–50% of the expected gains in math (Kuhfeld et al. 2020). This parallels evidence from an online program, Zearn, used by many schools to teach and reinforce math skills, which shows that relative to pre-pandemic learning levels, students’ learning plummeted after children were sent home in mid-March; although learning progress recovered somewhat in April, it then plunged through the end of June (Chetty et al. 2020; Yglesias 2020). There are substantial concerns that, especially for children in younger grades, educational disruptions could have long-run effects on cognitive development and life opportunities. For example, one study found that educational disruptions in World War II significantly affected the earnings of people who were young at that time some 40 years later (Ichino and Winter‐Ebmer 2004). It has been an important concern that households differ in the time and resources they can bring to the switch to distance learning.Footnote 2 Previous research has shown that college-educated parents tend to spend more time helping children with homework than less educated counterparts, and that black and Hispanic parents spend less time than white non-Hispanic parents.Footnote 3 Various reasons for these gradients have been explored, including parents’ “preferences” for children’s educational achievements, different returns to parental time providing schoolwork help, prevalence of single-parent households in which parental time is especially scarce, and/or social norms in school systems.Footnote 4 Children in higher-income households are also more likely to have access to electronic devices (computer, laptop, or tablet) and high-speed internet (Garcia et al. 2020), and/or to attend schools that are relatively “wired”—factors that would facilitate a sudden shift to distance learning in higher-income communities and complicate them elsewhere. Thus, the Zearn data mentioned above show that children in higher-income zip codes sustained some math learning through May 2020, whereas math learning almost stopped for students in middle- and lower-income zip codes after getting sent home in March (Chetty et al. 2020; Yglesias 2020). Thus, households’ unequal access to resources to support distance learning may work to exacerbate inequities in children’s human capital accumulation that existed before the pandemic. At the same time, the Covid-19 pandemic has involved some substantial shocks to parents’ time and income that intersect with new demands on their time to help children with schoolwork (Bacher-Hicks et al. 2020). Labor-market data show the extraordinary increases in unemployment associated with pandemic-related business closures in spring 2020 fell disproportionately on women and on workers without four-year college degrees (Fairlie et al. 2020). As low- and moderate-income U.S. households commonly do not have savings set aside for a rainy day (Beshears et al. 2020), job loss in the pandemic economy can lead relatively quickly to financial distress and food and housing insecurity. But also, for some, unexpected increases in parent time at home coincided with new expectations that parents help maintain children’s learning in a distance format. Here the parent-education gradient with respect to time helping children may invert or at least flatten: as better educated parents have much lower rates of job loss and much better ability to work from home, they are much less likely to have had a “positive” shock to time availability and rather have confronted new issues of “parenting while working”. This paper examines how U.S. households dealt with the Spring 2020 educational disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, investigating time spent by parents helping children sustain learning despite substantial reductions in school-provided inputs. We use newly available data on 200,000 families with K-12 children from the Household Pulse Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Launched in late April 2020, the Pulse Survey has collected weekly data from large, nationally representative samples of U.S. households, asking questions about effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, including questions about job loss, food and housing security, education disruptions, health and mental health, receipt of income support, and household financial distress. We first examine predictors of parent hours spent in teaching activities with their children, including household characteristics, features of the alternative delivery systems their schools put in place, and other COVID-related shocks experienced by the household, notably job loss. Next, we examine whether predictors of parent hours have differed by parental education, with a specific interest in understanding how more and less advantaged households may have differed in their abilities to navigate given types of distance learning arrangements. Finally, we analyze how time spent by children in learning activities on their own was affected by parental time inputs and school-system arrangements, as arrangements that facilitate independent learning valuably conserve scarce parental time. Our results show that school and parental resources to support distance learning were unequally distributed across U.S. households, with online learning options widespread in some parts of the country and patchy elsewhere. As expected, problems with access to computers and the internet for educational purposes have been far more common among less-advantaged households and in parts of the U.S. with lower per capita income. However, we also find that increases in school-system inputs increased parents’ time helping children in ways that did not differ substantially by the parent’s level of educational attainment. In particular, adding live teacher hours to online learning platforms increased parent hours at least as much among households without high school degrees as they did among households with 4-year college degrees. This suggests, when parents had access to similar resources, they contributed to sustaining their children’s learning to similar degree—although less educated parents were more often in situations where school-provided inputs were low and the productivity of their time helping their children was held down by lack of technology. We find that parents of K-12 children generally spent considerable amounts of time helping children learn in the Covid-19 pandemic: 72% of households with K-12 children said they spent time in teaching activities with children in the previous week, with an average total time of 2.6 h per school day. We also find that, other things being equal, parents spent more time helping children when the school provided more resources such as online teaching and paper resources. Most children also spent time working by themselves in learning activities, and they spent more time working independently when their parents and teachers had spent time working with them too. In other words, both parent time and live teacher hours significantly increased independent study hours by children, although having one or the other still had a significant positive effect on children’s study time. Altogether, our results suggest that, in the Covid-19 pandemic in spring 2020, U.S. households broadly aimed to provide time inputs into their children’s learning that would complement those provided by schools, although it is too soon to say how effective these new levels and combinations of inputs have been in sustaining children’s human capital accumulation in this extraordinary time.",49
19.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,14 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-020-09529-4,Parental well-being in times of Covid-19 in Germany,March 2021,Mathias Huebener,Sevrin Waights,Gert G. Wagner,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Life has changed dramatically for individuals in many countries as a result of the spread of Covid-19 and the implementation of measures to control the pandemic. Such far-reaching crisis-induced policy regulation has rarely been seen in democratic nations since the end of World War II. Some of the restrictions, such as nationwide closures of schools and day care centers, have had particularly strong impacts on parents of dependent children. While closures of schools and day care centers have led many parents to spend more time with their children, the measures have also resulted in a fairly sudden breakdown of established routines for combining work life, family life, and other activities. Many parents have cut their working hours (and, hence, family income) or have attempted the difficult task of combining working from home (if at all possible) with looking after children (e.g., Andrew et al. 2020; Del Boca et al. 2020) or find alternative childcare. Other factors have also had a particular impact on families, including bans on social contact, shutdowns of economic activity, and fear of the pandemic. In general, how the crisis and its unique, manifold, impact on family settings have affected parents is subject to broad public and growing academic debate. In this study we ask the question: what is the differential effect of the Covid-19 crisis on parents of dependent children over other individuals? Put another way, we aim to estimate the effects on parental well-being of the particular aspects of the Covid-19 crisis that affect parents only, such as day care and school closures. Other studies focus on general declines in well-being as a result of the fear of the virus and negative economic impacts (Lu et al. 2020; Béland et al. 2020b; Cheng et al. 2020; Fetzer et al. 2020a; Fetzer et al. 2020b) or loneliness as a consequence of physical distance during lockdown regimes (Armbruster and Klotzbücher 2020; Brodeur et al. 2020; Brülhart and Lalive 2020; Hamermesh 2020; Knipe et al. 2020; Tubadji et al. 2020). However, very few studies look at the specific impact on parents or investigate the role of additional childcare responsibilities (two exceptions, discussed below, are Adams-Prassl et al. 2020b and Etheridge and Spantig 2020). Parental well-being is an important outcome, both in itself and as a predictor of negative child outcomes (e.g., Berger and Spiess 2011; Camehl et al. 2020; Smith 2004; Mensah and Kiernan 2010; Spinelli et al. 2020, Griffith 2020; UKE Hamburg 2020), relationship dissolution or divorce (Frank and Gertler 1991), costs to the economy (e.g., Oswald et al. 2015; Naylor et al. 2012; McDaid 2011), and even compliance with measures introduced to stop the spread of Covid-19 (Krekel et al. 2020). As such, policymakers may wish to know the magnitude of impacts on parental well-being in order to decide on optimal lockdown policies and to direct remedial policy, such as mental health interventions during the pandemic and in its aftermath. Our first contribution is an up-to-date analysis of a unique collection of data on parental well-being. We use a new data set to document the evolution of well-being during the Covid-19 pandemic for individuals with and without dependent children in households in Germany. The COMPASS study conducted by “infratest dimap” is based on a representative sample of the German population eligible to vote in Germany and with an online access.Footnote 1 As such, it is one of the few representative surveys of well-being that exists for Germany, and the largest well-being survey taken during the Covid-19 crisis.Footnote 2 Our main analysis is based on 14,781 observations of 8977 individuals reporting on their well-being in May and June 2020. The data includes satisfaction in three areas that are important for the well-being of families, namely general life satisfaction, satisfaction with family life, and satisfaction with childcare. The data also includes detailed questions on whether individuals with dependent children in the household are affected by day care and school closures, on the degree to which they feel restricted by public measures taken to contain Covid-19, and on the extent to which they work from home. Our second contribution is a descriptive analysis of how well-being under Covid-19 compares with well-being in a pre-Covid-19 period for various subgroups. We make use of the COMPASS survey to describe well-being during Covid-19 and the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) to describe well-being in the pre-Covid-19 period (2018). The SOEP is a representative survey of households that includes the same questions on well-being that are asked in the COMPASS study. Motivated by a literature that predicts heterogeneous impacts of the crisis and differential reliance on publicly-funded childcare by gender and socioeconomic status (e.g., Alon et al. 2020; Conti 2020; Jessen et al. 2020), we examine how the change in well-being between the two surveys varies by age of the youngest child, by parental gender, and by parental education. We make these comparisons for our sample period when schools and day care centers were largely closed but when many other restrictions had already eased and new infection rates were pervasively low. As such, we assume the schools and day care center closures, or at least the restricted access to permanent schooling and day care, are a major factor in the differences of well-being, especially for families with young children. Our third contribution is to supplement the descriptive analysis with estimates of the effect of the crisis on individuals with children relative to individuals without children using a difference-in-differences (DiD) design. Goodman-Bacon and Marcus (2020) argue that DiD designs are well fitted for evaluating the effects of Covid-19. The comparison with an unaffected group accounts for changes in well-being that might be unrelated to the crisis, e.g., due to overall time trends or to the use of different survey methods, as well as the general shift in well-being due to the crisis (i.e., for reasons not particular to parents). The resulting DiD estimate captures changes in well-being resulting from factors that affect parents only, principally the closures of schools and day care centers. The validity of the DiD relies on a parallel trends assumption: that the well-being of individuals with children would have followed a similar path to the well-being of individuals without children in the absence of the crisis. We provide evidence on parallel trends in the pre-period. Our DiD estimates find significant declines in satisfaction for individuals with children relative to individuals without dependent children. The negative effects are larger for parents of younger children, for women, and for those with lower educational attainment and are larger for parents that report being affected by closures of day care centers and schools. The results are robust to several sensitivity checks that significantly adjust our samples and definition of the outcome variables. Our findings are consistent with Etheridge and Spantig (2020), who find reduced well-being during the pandemic that is greater for parents with childcare responsibilities in the UK. However, our results contrast with Adams-Prassl et al. (2020b) who find that declines in well-being are not related to additional childcare responsibilities. This difference perhaps arises because they focus on a period characterized by a general stay-at-home order in the US whereas we look at a period when the lockdown is eased but schools and day care centers are still mostly closed. Another reason could be the different childcare systems in each context. Ours is the only study we are aware of to examine impacts on several important dimensions of well-being by age of the children in the household. Our findings contribute to a literature that documents the uneven impacts of the Covid-19 crisis by gender and socioeconomic groups across many dimensions. Studies from several countries find that women have larger declines in well-being than men during the crisis (Adams-Prassl et al. 2020b; Davillas and Jones 2020; De Pedraza et al. 2020; Etheridge and Spantig 2020). Looking at other outcomes, Del Boca et al. (2020) and Andrew et al. (2020) find that women bore the majority of the additional workload (childcare and housework) in Italy and the UK, Adams-Prassl et al. (2020a) find women are more likely to lose a job, and Béland et al. (2020a, 2020b) highlight increased domestic violence as an outcome of family stress. Furthermore, research suggests that children of lower educational backgrounds have worse learning conditions at home (Huebener and Schmitz 2020) and will lose the most from school closures in terms of educational achievement (Eyles et al. (2020). Thus, our findings on parental well-being are consistent with the literature that finds the crisis affects women and those from lower educational backgrounds disproportionately. Our standardized estimates indicate that life satisfaction declines by between 0.13 and 0.28 standard deviations (depending on age of the youngest child) relative to individuals without children. Impacts on satisfaction with family life and on satisfaction with childcare are larger still. In comparison, Etheridge and Spantig (2020) find declines in well-being in the UK for individuals who have not lost their job to be 0.26 standard deviations for women and 0.13 for men, implying an average overall decline that falls within our range of estimates. Adams-Prassl et al. (2020b) find that stay-at-home orders result in declines in mental health of around 0.09 standard deviations in the US. Thus, our differential effect for parents (i.e., the decline for parents over non-parents) in Germany is similar in size or larger to the total effect for all individuals in the US and the UK. This large estimated effect may reflect the major reliance on publicly-funded, universal day care by almost all families in Germany. Our effects also compare to estimates on the impact of provision of publicly-funded day care on maternal well-being. For example, Schmitz (2020) finds that the general life satisfaction of mothers increases by 0.30 standard deviations if their child attends day care due to increased provision.",95

One example of social distancing is staying at home except for essential activities. While there are obvious health benefits to staying at home, it may force victims of domestic violence to spend more time with their abusers, heightening tensions and creating more opportunities for violence. We use the natural experiment of the pandemic to analyze the effect of staying at home on domestic violence incidents in the U.S. Using daily mobile device tracking data and dispatch and crime data from 36 police departments in 22 states, we first examine the strong co-movement between police reports of domestic violence and staying at home from March to May. We then estimate that the increase in staying at home due to COVID-19 increased domestic violence by over 5% from March 13 to May 24, 2020. If victims are less inclined to report while staying at home, this is an under-estimate of the true effect of staying at home on domestic violence. Our work builds upon a new strand of research on COVID-19, social distancing, and police incidents. Leslie and Wilson (2020) use open police report data from 15 police and sheriff’s departments in the U.S. They employ a difference-in-difference method, identifying the estimated start of social distancing as the start of the treatment. They find that the “social distancing” event increased domestic violence calls for service by 10% from March 9 to March 31. Henke and Hsu (2020a) find similar results using shelter-in-place orders, social distancing data, and open police data, finding that sheltering in place increased domestic violence by 6% in March and April. Silverio-Murillo and de la Miyar (2020) use data on a women’s call center service in Mexico and find increased requests for psychological services and decreased requests for legal aid after lockdowns. This article complements and supports the literature on staying at home and domestic violence by improving the robustness and scope of the initial findings. We improve the data by expanding the number of cities and by including the month of May, a key month when staying at home began to decline. In addition, we control for temperature, which has a potentially strong confounding effect as it both causes domestic violence (Henke and Hsu 2020b) and is related to COVID-19 and social distancing efforts (Zhu and Xie 2020). Furthermore, we estimate staying at home directly using mobile device tracking data instead of a binary treatment variable. This way, we utilize the fact that different cities had different behaviors at different times. We also control for confounding variables, such as the concurrent increase in unemployment in the sample period. Controlling for unemployment helps us to isolate the effect of staying at home from the effect of economic stress on domestic violence. This result is consistent with an exposure reduction theory of domestic violence, where domestic violence is modeled as a crime of opportunity and being near an abuser for longer periods creates more opportunities for violence. For instance, an employed woman experiences less domestic violence because she spends less time at home in a vulnerable position (Chin 2012). This effect is unrelated to both the feelings of an abuser and the economic bargaining power of the potential victim. Staying at home due to the pandemic increases the amount of time abuser and victim are in the same dwelling. Therefore, exposure reduction theory predicts that staying at home increases cases of domestic violence. Our results are also consistent with a classic household bargaining theory of domestic violence, which predicts that increases in women’s bargaining power over men reduces violence against women.Footnote 1 In the context of cooperative bargaining with male-on-female violence, violence benefits the abusive man while being costly to the woman, and the couple negotiates over the “optimal” degree of violence in the relationship. The man effectively pays for violence with transfers, and the cost of violence depends on options outside of the relationship. A key implication of this theory is that a woman’s bargaining power, determined by economic opportunities outside the relationship and the cost of separation, reduces violence against women. Brassiolo (2016) finds that a reduction of the cost of divorce reduces domestic violence in Spain. Fajardo-Gonzalez (2020) finds that women hold jobs to maintain a better exit option in abusive relationships. Aizer (2010) finds that increasing women’s relative wage in a local labor market decreases violence against women. Thus, if a pandemic increases the cost of leaving a relationship by making it harder and more dangerous to relocate to a new neighborhood or find a new job, domestic violence should increase.",55
19.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,20 October 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-020-09511-0,"Is the selfish life-cycle model more applicable in Japan and, if so, why? A literature survey",March 2021,Charles Yuji Horioka,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The selfish life-cycle model or hypothesis is, together with the dynasty or altruism model of Barro (1974) that assumes the presence of intergenerational altruism, the most widely used theoretical model of household behavior in economics. Many researchers have investigated whether or not this model applies in North America, Europe, and elsewhere (see, for example, Modigliani (1975), Deaton (1992, 2005), Browning and Lusardi (1996), Hayashi (1997b), Attanasio (1999), Browning and Crossley (2001), Baranzini (2005), Attanasio and Weber (2010), and Jappelli and Pistaferri (2017) for useful surveys). However, whether or not the selfish life-cycle model applies in the case of a country like Japan, which is said to have closer family ties than other countries, is another question. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief exposition of the simplest version of the selfish life-cycle model and to then survey the literature on household saving and bequest behavior in Japan to shed light on whether or not the selfish life-cycle model applies in the case of Japan. There have been many comprehensive surveys of the literature on household saving, consumption, and bequest behavior in Japan (for example, Hayashi (1986, 1992, 1997a), Horioka (1984, 1990, 1993, 2008a), and Ogawa and Horioka (1996)), but this paper is unique in focusing on the question of whether or not the selfish life-cycle model applies and in surveying the literature on a wide variety of approaches including not only studies of saving behavior (e.g., studies of the impact of the age structure of the population on the saving rate, the saving behavior of the retired elderly, saving motives, and the importance of borrowing (liquidity) constraints) but also studies of bequest behavior (e.g., studies of the prevalence of bequests, bequest motives, and tests of altruism). I emphasize my own research because, over the years, I have tried a variety of approaches to test the validity of the selfish life-cycle model. One view that has its adherents even today is that the laws of Western economics (including the selfish life-cycle model) do not apply in the case of Japan, that the Japanese are not rational utility maximizers, and that the economic behavior of the Japanese is largely determined by the country’s unique culture and social norms, especially its Confucian heritage (see Morishima 1982, and Katzner 1999, 2008).Footnote 1 For example, a common view is that Japan’s high household saving rate is attributable to national character, culture, or Confucian teachings concerning frugality (see, for example, Horioka 1990, 2019; Garon 1997, pp. 164–165). Thus, it is of great interest to examine whether or not the selfish life-cycle model applies in the case of a non-Western country such as Japan despite enormous differences in culture and social norms. To preview the main findings of this paper, it finds that almost all of the available evidence suggests that the selfish life-cycle model applies at least to some extent in all countries but that there is more consistent support for this model in Japan than in the United Sates and other countries. Thus, the answer to the question posed in the title of this paper is an unqualified “yes.” The paper then explores possible explanations for why the selfish life-cycle model is more consistently supported in Japan than in other countries, attributing this finding to government policies, institutional factors, economic factors, demographic factors, and cultural factors. Finally, it shows that the findings of the paper have many important implications for economic modeling and for government tax and expenditure policies. This paper is organized as follows: we provide a brief exposition of the simplest version of the selfish life-cycle model in Section 2; we survey the literature on the impact of the age structure of the population on the saving rate in Section 3, that on the saving behavior of the retired elderly in Section 4, that on saving motives in Section 5, that on the prevalence of bequests in Section 6, that on bequest motives in Section 7, that on tests of altruism in Section 8, and that on the importance of borrowing constraints in Section 9; we explore possible explanations for why there is more consistent support for the selfish life-cycle model in Japan than there is in other countries in Sections 10–16; and we summarize our findings and discuss the implications thereof for economic modelling and for government tax and expenditure policies in Section 17.",6

Violence against women is a serious concern for both developing and developed countries, but the prevalence is higher in developing countries. A growing number of individuals across the world have advocated for the economic empowerment of women. Understanding how women’s empowerment policies influence domestic violence is important for identifying interventions that may increase violence as well as those that may reduce it. If an intervention reduces domestic abuse, then it can be integrated into the measures used to fight violence against women. However, if an intervention aggravates violence, then complementary actions to prevent this unintended consequence are desired. A large body of literature has examined how empowering women economically impacts domestic violence. Relative resource theory, which is prominent in the sociological literature, attributes the advent of domestic violence to a husband having fewer resources than his wife. When the wife’s economic status increases relative to that of the husband, the latter resorts to violence to regain power (Atkinson et al., 2005). Thus, an increase in women’s financial resources can increase the likelihood that violence will be used against them (Macmillan & Gartner, 1999). Traditional economic models of the family focus on the intra-household allocation of resources and see domestic violence as an attempt by men to extract resources, control family resources, and influence the behavior of their household members (e.g., Bloch & Rao, 2002; Farmer & Tiefenthaler, 1997; Tauchen et al., 1991). Depending on the assumptions made and the way that violence is modeled, these economic models predict either a positive (Bloch & Rao, 2002; Bobonis et al., 2013), negative (Aizer 2010; Farmer & Tiefenthaler, 1996, 1997), or ambiguous (Tauchen et al., 1991) relationship between the improved economic status of a woman and domestic violence enacted against her. The empirical results are also mixed and suggest that the relationship between economic opportunities for women and domestic violence is subtle, and that it can be either positive, negative, or ambiguous.Footnote 1 An example of an ambiguous result would be Hidrobo & Fernald’s (2013) finding that the effect of an increase in a woman’s income on psychological violence depends on both her absolute and relative education. The authors found that a cash transfer to a woman with above-primary-school education in Ecuador reduced the amount of emotional violence enacted against her. For a woman with a lower level of education, cash transfer increased the level of psychological violence if her schooling was similar to or greater than that of her husband. Recently, the “Work-In-Household” (WIHO) modeling approach (Grossbard 1976, 2015; Grossbard-Shechtman 1984) has been applied to explore the association between intimate partner violence and women’s relative income opportunities (Grossbard 2020). We contribute to this literature by examining how an important factor that facilitates women’s economic opportunities, type of property ownership, is expected to be associated with domestic violence. In particular, we examine the role of the distinction between women’s single property ownership and a couple’s joint property ownership of assets such as homes. Following the WIHO framework, we postulate that compared to alternative legal regimes regarding marital property women’s single property ownership may not be associated with less domestic abuse. Specifically, sole ownership of property by a woman is expected to reduce women’s supply of WIHO, thus raising its price. Consequently, men may resort to greater domestic violence to avoid paying a higher WIHO compensation and to extract more supply of WIHO from women. In contrast, joint property ownership may serve as a form of compensation and be associated with more hours of WIHO supplied voluntarily by women, without men using violence to obtain the amount of WIHO they aspire to. Thus, the insights from the WIHO model of household economic activity can be applied to formulate testable hypotheses for future empirical work on abuses against women. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly explains the WIHO framework and presents a WIHO-based theoretical model to examine the relationship between property ownership by women and domestic violence perpetrated against women. Section 3 concludes.",3
19.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,29 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-020-09491-1,"Domestic violence, decision-making power, and female employment in Colombia",March 2021,Johanna Fajardo-Gonzalez,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The World Health Organization reports striking findings on the prevalence and effects of violence against women. Almost one-third of all women worldwide who have been in a marital relationship have experienced physical or sexual violence perpetrated by their male partners (World Health Organization 2013). Most of these women report serious physical and mental health consequences, which include permanent injuries, pregnancy-related complications, and impaired social functioning. In Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the World Health Organization estimates, between 23.7 and 40.6% of ever-partnered women report some experience of physical domestic violence. Colombia is one of the countries in the region where violence against women is highly prevalent; in 2010, 37% of Colombian women reported physical or sexual spousal abuse over their lifetime, as well as several physical and psychological consequences associated with it (Profamilia 2011). Domestic violence also affects labor market outcomes: victims reported that spousal violence affected their performance in daily activities and their labor productivity. In this context, it is crucial to understand the effects of domestic violence against women,Footnote 1 given its large economic and social costs (Carrillo 1992; Heise et al. 1994; Morrison and Orlando 1999; UNICEF 2001). There is still, in particular, little rigorous evidence on the employment effects of domestic violence in the context of a developing country. This paper, therefore, aims to fill this gap in the household economics literature. Using cross-sectional data, I use instrumental variables to estimate the relationship between reporting having experienced domestic violence (DV) and women’s employment. To gauge a better understanding of this relationship, I explore the role of women’s decision-making power using a causal mediation analysis. The limited account of rigorous empirical analysis of the relationship between domestic violence and labor market outcomes responds to the potential complexity of the interconnection between both outcomes. The causality can go either way, with mixed descriptive evidence supporting both directions. A large group of empirical studies focuses on the determinants of spousal violence, including female employment. For instance, Aizer (2010) exploits variation in industry-specific labor demand and finds that decreases in the male–female wage gap reduce violence perpetrated by domestic partners. In that line, Bhattacharyya et al. (2011) suggest that boosting a wife’s economic status generates struggle within the household and leads to more violence. In another study, Heath (2014) focuses on access to factory jobs and finds that women with low bargaining power face increased risk of domestic violence upon entering the labor force. More recently, Henke and Hsu (2020) expand on Aizer’s study and find that women’s labor market opportunities shield them from DV by increasing their bargaining power. Few studies investigate the consequences of DV. Research has documented a variety of abusive tactics that a husband may use to interfere with his wife’s employment. The available empirical evidence suggests that violence against women is related to higher rates of female unemployment (Lloyd 1997; Lloyd and Taluc 1999) or women working fewer hours (Meisel et al. 2003; Swanberg and Logan 2005; Tolman and Wang 2005). Other studies, on the contrary, find that spousal violence appears to lead to increased labor market participation (Farmer and Tiefenthaler 2004) or more hours of work (Staggs and Riger 2005). Studies in Latin America and the Caribbean are similarly inconclusive; some find that abused wives are more likely to work (Agüero 2013; Morrison and Orlando 1999), while others find that they are more likely to exit the labor force (Rios-Avila and Canavire-Bacarreza 2017). The main contributions of this study are twofold. First, I show that the association between DV and woman’s employment is positive and that this result persists after using the plausibly exogenous variation in the husband’s own childhood experience of domestic violence as an instrumental variable for DV. Women victims of domestic violence may decide to stay away from home and seek employment more actively to reduce their vulnerability by improving their economic situation. My findings support this hypothesis, as reported spousal violence does not prevent women from being active in the labor force: women who experience DV are 22.7 percentage points (or 35%) more likely to work than women who do not. I acknowledge that the husband’s childhood experience of violence is not a perfect instrument because of some remaining concerns about its excludability or monotonicity. To check for the robustness of my results to potential violations of the exclusion restriction, I employ the test proposed by Nevo and Rosen (2012). This test allows me to relax the exclusion restriction assumption and bound the estimates for the parameter on DV. I find that my IV estimate may be a lower bound for the actual association between DV and women’s employment. I also relax the monotonicity assumption, following De Chaisemartin (2017), and find that even if this assumption were to be violated, I would be estimating a local average treatment effect for a sub-group of compliers. This paper also contributes to the literature on the economics of the family and on women’s empowerment by exploring the role of women’s decision-making power. Domestic violence could become a push for those victims who seek greater levels of economic autonomy to be able to leave an abusive relationship. That is, wives may need to increase their power within the relationship and gain control of their decisions to increase their ability to escape domestic violence or, at least, lessen its intensity. To provide an exploratory assessment of the role of decision-making power, I conduct a mediation analysis accounting for a mediator that is potentially endogenous, following Dippel et al. (2017). With this method, I am able to calculate the direct effect and indirect effects of DV on employment. I specifically explore the mediating effect of three measures of decision-making power (final say on large household purchases, daily household purchases, and healthcare decisions) and of a measure of willingness to separate, since this also comes from increases in a wife’s outside options. I find suggestive evidence that the association of DV with employment consists of a large effect that runs through a woman’s say in household decisions or through her desire to leave an abusive relationship. The result for willingness to separate suggests that abused women who have considered divorcing their husbands may work more, and is also in line with Johnson and Skinner (1986) who find that women seem to increase hours of work before the separation in response to higher probabilities of divorce. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section “Data” describes the 2010 Colombian Demographic and Health Survey data. Section “Empirical framework” explains the empirical methods and discusses the identification strategy. I present results in Section “Results,” and conduct robustness checks in Section “Results under weaker IV assumptions.” I explore the role of women’s decision-making power and willingness to divorce in Section “The role of women’s decision-making power.” Section “Concluding remarks” provides concluding remarks.",7

However, across large parts of the developing world, violence against women is endemic, and has strong adverse consequences on a range of health and pregnancy-related outcomes, maternal morbidity, mental health and suicide (Beleche 2019; Campbell 2002; Krantz and Garcia-Moreno 2005). According to a World Health Organization (WHO) multi-country study, an estimated one in three females have experienced some form of physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner (WHO 2017). Intimate partner violence (IPV) is common in South Asia, and recent regional estimates from the WHO suggest that South Asia has the highest regional rate of IPV in the world, at 43 per cent (García-Moreno et al. 2013). According to a study by Fulu et al. (2013), 46 per cent of married men in northern India, and more than one in three men from a study in Bangladesh reported perpetration of physical violence, sexual violence, or both against their wives in the past 12 months. A recent Lancet series has further highlighted the extent of the problem (Ellsberg et al. 2015; Michau et al. 2015), but these studies have pointed out that the bulk of the studies come from high-income settings. Michau et al. (2015) have identified patriarchal social norms, as being a key driver for gender based violence, and Ellsberg et al. (2015) emphasise the need for greater research on domestic violence. The aim of this paper is to advance the knowledge on the factors influencing IPV particularly focusing on the role of female autonomy.Footnote 1 Previous empirical research has established links between female autonomy and IPV through several channels. They include the effects of female paid employment (Eswaran and Malhotra 2011; Heath 2014), intra-household gender wage gaps (Aizer 2010; Henke and Hsu 2020), cash transfers targeted to women (Bobonis et al. 2013; Hidrobo and Fernald 2013; Hidrobo et al. 2016), marital transfers (Menon 2020) and changes in formal and informal institutions on female autonomy (Amaral 2017; Jayachandran 2015). The idea is that in societies where gender inequalities are pervasive, women are more vulnerable to IPV. Therefore, an improvement in female economic empowerment is expected to improve a woman’s intra-household bargaining power, thereby reducing her risk of IPV. However, the link between female autonomy and an experience of IPV is not clear-cut in developing countries. In some studies such as those from Turkey (Yilmaz 2018), Bangladesh (Fakir et al. 2016; Schuler and Nazneen 2018) and India (Jejeebhoy and Cook 1997; Sethuraman et al. 2006) there is indeed evidence that greater female autonomy is associated with a decrease in IPV. However, others, such as Eswaran and Malhotra (2011) and Heath (2014), for example, find that greater female access to economic resources has the perverse effect of increasing IPV, as men seek to assert their authority in traditional patriarchal societies, such as India and Bangladesh, respectively. Thus, the link between female autonomy and IPV is highly context-specific. We study how female autonomy is related to IPV in Pakistan using data from the nationally representative Pakistan Demographic Health Survey (PDHS) conducted in 2012–13 and 2017–18. Pakistan is a particularly relevant context to study these issues because it is a traditional, patriarchal society (Hamid et al. 2010; Niaz 2004), and almost one in three married females report having experienced some form of physical violence. By providing evidence from an under-explored context and focusing on a particular form of female autonomy, this paper makes progress towards understanding the role of female autonomy in IPV. To better understand the link between female autonomy and the risk of IPV, it is critical that we agree on a definition of autonomy. The term ‘female autonomy’ is a multi-faceted concept that is difficult to conceptualise as it encompasses several dimensions. It is further complicated by the fact that the terms ‘female autonomy’ and ‘female agency’ are used interchangeably. Female autonomy has typically been measured using variables such as access to economic resources, autonomy in decision-making, physical mobility and schooling. However, there is variability in exactly which aspects of female autonomy may affect the risk of violence in different contexts. This ambiguity in the literature underscores the need to study the links between female autonomy and exposure to IPV, and more importantly identify precisely which aspects of female autonomy are likely to reduce the risk of IPV in a particular context. Given that our focus is on Pakistan, a country with low levels of female labour force participation, we define female autonomy as the ability of married females to influence decisions about themselves or close household members, their ability to control economic resources and information, and their ability to move freely (Basu 1992; Bloom et al. 2001; Dyson and Moore 1983; Jejeebhoy 2002; Mason 1984). Econometrically, in identifying the links between female autonomy and experience of IPV, there is potential for endogeneity of female autonomy – an issue that has often put constraints on making causal inferences in existing studies. Such endogeneity concerns can arise since females with different degrees of autonomy may differ from each other in unobserved ways; and these unobserved differences may in turn be related to their experience of IPV. A conventional approach to deal with such endogeneity concerns is to exploit an instrumental variable or a natural experiment for identification. However, we do not have a persuasive instrumental variable in our dataset. Instead, we take the approach of mitigating the concerns around endogeneity by using two alternative approaches. First, we employ a matching approach to account for differences in females’ observable characteristics and the likelihood of possessing autonomy in household decision-making. Second, we use a partial identification approach proposed by Oster (2019) to quantify how large would the amount of selection on unobservables need to be relative to the amount of selection on observables, to explain away the entire causal effect of female autonomy in household decision-making on IPV. Our analysis establishes a negative link between female autonomy in household-decision making and IPV in Pakistan. Estimation results from a baseline model employing a matching approach suggest that relative to a female with no autonomy, having full autonomy in household decision-making is associated with a 4.7 percentage point decrease in the probability of a female experiencing IPV. Using a partial identification approach, we further demonstrate that the influence of unobserved heterogeneity would need to be exceedingly large for the entire causal effect of female autonomy to disappear. Not only is female autonomy in household decision-making associated with lower probability of experiencing IPV, it also appears to have implications for the degree of tolerance for IPV. In the next section, we discuss previous research on the nexus between female autonomy and IPV.",5

Markets were decimated, unemployment soared, incomes evaporated, relationships strained, political differences exacerbated, and stress and uncertainty levels across the globe all increased. Most importantly, as of April 5, 2021 worldwide 2.85 million people had died from the pandemic (Johns Hopkins, Coronavirus Resource Center). While the impact of the pandemic and ensuing responses have been uneven across the globe, a common element exists: the pandemic and all its direct and indirect effects are mediated mainly through individuals making decisions within households. This implies that studies of the effects of the pandemic can often be considered economics of the household as broadly defined by this journal. Consequently, the Review of Economics of the Household called for papers to be submitted for a special issue on COVID-19. After the submissions, the decision was made to have the articles span several issues. A total of 17 articles were published, with five in December 2020, six in March 2021, and six in this June 2021 issue. This essay serves as an introduction and overview of four from the December issue and all from this issue. The household economics framework is very appropriate for analyzing how exogenous factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing policy responses, will affect household-related decision-making, activities, input choices, and outcomes, ranging from consumption patterns to time allocation to health outcomes. Importantly, because of its focus on intrahousehold resource allocations, household economics is also a natural framework for exploring inequalities, especially by gender. The seven articles discussed in Section 2 below focus on consumption, time allocations, and labor market responses to some aspect of COVID-19. The three articles in Section 3 focus on the effectiveness of lockdown measures implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus.",4

For example, according to Richter (2020) “the trend of daily new COVID cases has taken completely different trajectories for the U.S. and the European Union.” COVID fatalities are also routinely compared across the two sides of the Atlantic. For example, Drum (2020) charted 7-day averages of daily deaths in the two unions, letting the US lag the EU by 12 days (reproduced in Fig. 1). It shows weekly mortality in the US in June 2020 lying substantially above that of the EU. Reproduced from K. Drum (2020). The graph represents average mortality rates (deaths per million inhabitants) over 7 consecutive days. For comparability, US data is lagged by 12 days There are at least three problems with such comparisons. First, they ignore the enormous variation in COVID outcomes within Europe and within the US (see Table 1, showing cumulative deaths per million for 35 European countries and all 50 US states). To address this problem we analyze cumulative deaths from COVID in these 85 nations/states. In average population and a number of other characteristics, such as percent of the population aged 65 and older, US States tend to be similar to European countries (see Table 2). Second, a lag of 12 days between the average onset of COVID in the entire EU and its average onset in the entire US masks the great variation in onset dates among the 85 nations/states also reported in Table 1. France was first to experience a death from COVID, on February 15, 2020 (we define time of onset as the day a first death was recorded). Wyoming was the last to experience its first COVID death on April 13, almost two months later. To address this second problem we use statistics on reported COVID deaths 50 or 100 days after the onset of COVID in that nation/state.Footnote 1 Looking at means we find a US/EUROPE gap of 207 more COVID-related deaths per million inhabitants 100 days after a nation/state’s first death: the mean number of deaths per million is 407 in a US state and 200 in a European country (see Table 2). These averages include New York (the nation/state with most deaths per million inhabitants) and Belgium ranking 7th in the list of all nations/states. A number of other European countries rank among the 20 most affected, but most top 20 nations/states are part of the US.Footnote 2 The 5 nations/states with the best 100-days performance are all European countries (Malta, Greece, Latvia and Slovakia) except for Hawaii (see Table 1). A third problem with many previous comparisons of fatalities in the US and Europe is that they tend to be quick at assigning credit or blame to politicians, while overlooking other factors that may contribute to gaps in COVID deaths. We address this problem by taking account of differences in demographic, political, economic, and health-system characteristics. Demographic characteristics include proportion of the population aged 65 or older and proportion of young adults aged 18 to 34 who live with their parents. We also consider variation in the time that elapsed between onset of pandemic in France and its onset in each of the nations/states. After taking account of such factors, we find that US/Europe differences in cumulative deaths from COVID are considerably smaller than the gap in mean deaths per population shown in Table 2 and that the US/Europe gap is not related to whether a nation/state’s government is affiliated with the left or the right. Our main finding is that the large US/Europe gap in cumulative deaths becomes statistically insignificant in our models including various social distance measures and the timing of their implementation. Relative to US states, European countries were more likely to implement them and did so at a faster pace, and this appears to have saved lives.",2
19.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,29 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-020-09541-8,Intra-household exposure to labor market risk in the time of Covid-19: lessons from Mexico,June 2021,Cecilia Peluffo,Mariana Viollaz,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Due to limited access to credit and formal insurance products, informal arrangements are important consumption-smoothing mechanisms for vulnerable populations in developing countries (Rosenzweig, 1988; Rosenzweig and Stark, 1989; Dercon, 2002; Angelucci and De Giorgi, 2009). A possible way in which families can mitigate the effects of individuals’ negative earnings shocks on consumption are adjustments in spouses’ labor supply. However, the Covid-19 crisis is likely to affect the scope for access to this intra-household mechanism. It has been shown that a pandemic recession imposes constraints on the use of intra-family adjustments in labor supply due to the increased childcare needs and because of the sectoral distribution of the shock and its differential impact on men and women (Alon et al., 2020b). Yet, little is known about intra-household correlation in exposure to labor market risk associated with pandemics like the Covid-19 pandemic. If the pandemic is characterized by labor market shocks that are positively correlated within a couple, spouses will face further restrictions in achieving consumption smoothing by adjusting their labor supply.Footnote 1 We study this issue by examining within-household correlation in the possibility of working from home in Mexico. Household members can make occupational choices with the objective of reducing the overall labor market risk the family faces (Doepke and Tertilt, 2016). We argue that even if spouses have made occupational choices in the past to minimize the household labor income volatility associated with regular recessions, the unique and unexpected features of the Covid-19 crisis are likely to affect the efficacy of such arrangements. One reason for this is that the types of tasks carried out on the job are gaining unprecedented relevance in determining exposure to the labor market shock during the pandemic. Occupations that involve tasks that cannot be performed remotely are being exposed to an increased labor market risk relative to occupations that can be performed from home. Intuitively, while in regular recessions the impacts on labor earnings tend to be linked to the sectors most affected by the downturn, in this recession the impacts are also mediated by the tasks performed at work. The overall effect of the pandemic on consumption will also be shaped by the distribution of the negative shocks across households with heterogeneous access to alternative sources of funds, such as savings, assets that can be liquidated, and other informal or formal insurance mechanisms or credit. Mexico provides an interesting case to analyze due to the relevance of informal sources of insurance in the present crisis. Most countries in the Latin American region have introduced or extended social protection programs to provide income support to poor families and informal workers. Mexico is one of the countries providing less support in terms of GDP (World Bank, 2020). At the same time, more than half of the employed population are informal workers, so they do not benefit from labor protection mechanisms such as severance payment or unemployment insurance. With scarce support from public policies, households may rely heavily on intra-household arrangements or other informal risk sharing options. To shed light on this issue, we calculate a measure of the pre-pandemic amenability of working from home (WFH index hereafter) by combining data on tasks performed at work from the 2017 Mexican Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) and information from the 2018 National Survey of Household Income and Expenditure (ENIGH). The index is based on the characteristics of tasks performed on the job and on the availability of an internet connection at home and represents a measure of potential exposure to the Covid-19 shock in employment. It is built on influential work by Dingel and Neiman (2020) and follows a standardization procedure proposed by Acemoglu and Autor (2011). Our empirical approach has four main components, in which we (i) calculate the WFH index and show how it varies across households and individuals according to different demographic and employment characteristics, (ii) combine the WFH index with official registers of formal employment from the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) to provide evidence on the connection between aggregate changes in formal employment and the job amenability to working from home, (iii) calculate intra-household correlations of the WFH indexes of the spouses, and (iv) present evidence on the correlations between the WFH index and access to formal credit and informal consumption smoothing mechanisms at the household level. Our analysis especially pertains to workers in nonessential sectors. Government-mandated lockdowns around the globe have established which jobs or sectors are considered essential. Workers in these sectors are thus more likely than workers in nonessential sectors to continue to be employed, regardless of the types of tasks performed on their jobs. Because of this, we focus our analysis on cohabiting couples (regardless of their marital status) in which both partners are employed in nonessential occupations.Footnote 2 This implies that the intra-household mechanism we study is based on ex ante occupational choices at the household level and ex post potential adjustments in the (intensive margin) labor supply of the partners. We derive four primary findings. First, workers in the lower tail of the income distribution, informal workers, workers employed in small-size firms, and workers who do not own their homes tend to be employed in occupations with low WFH indexes. Second, employment in sectors in which workers have lower average WFH indexes is more likely to decline when social distancing policies are in place. Third, there is a high positive correlation between spouses’ WFH indexes, which limits the scope for intra-household adjustments in labor supply to work as consumption smoothing mechanism during the pandemic. Fourth, households with low WFH indexes are less likely to have access to formal credit and more likely to rely on informal arrangements. Moreover, we document a positive correlation between spouses’ average WFH index and the average WFH index of the municipality where each family lives, which we consider a proxy of their social network and potential source of informal insurance. Taken together, our findings imply that the pandemic is likely to exacerbate existing income inequalities. This paper contributes to the general literature on intra-household risk sharing and assortative mating, which Doepke and Tertilt (2016) summarize. The paper also contributes to the growing literature on the pandemic and its intra-household effects (e.g. Alon et al. (2020a), Alon et al. (2020b), and Heggeness (2020) for the U.S., Del Boca et al. (2020) for Italy, and Sevilla and Smith (2020) for the U.K.); the connection between telecommuting possibilities and employment changes during the pandemic (e.g., Beland et al. (2020) and Mongey et al. (2020) for the U.S., and Adams-Prassl et al. (2020) for Germany and the U.S.); and the association between WFH and economic vulnerability (e.g., Mongey et al. (2020) for the U.S., and Saltiel (2020) for a group of 10 developing countries). To our knowledge, only three papers analyze couples’ occupational sorting and its relationship to the possibility of working remotely. Lekfuangfu et al. (2020) identify a positive spousal correlation in job characteristics in Thailand. Malkov (2020) provides evidence of positive occupational sorting within couples in the U.S. We differ from these papers in that we rely on a WFH measure that incorporates the availability of an internet connection at home as a determinant. This factor has not been included by recent literature on WFH indexes for developed countries (e.g., Dingel and Neiman (2020); Mongey et al. (2020); Boeri et al. (2020)), but has been shown to be an important determinant of the feasibility of working remotely, especially in developing countries.Footnote 3 In addition, we provide direct evidence on the relationship between the WFH index and employment and on the relationship between the WFH index and access to other sources of consumption smoothing. Finally, Alon et al. (2020b) construct a quantitative macroeconomic model for the U.S. to analyze how a pandemic recession impacts female and male employment, and how these effects are transmitted to aggregate demand, gender wage gaps, and social norms. Even though the authors do not present an analysis of within-household correlations of occupational characteristics, their model is calibrated considering the occupation types of spouses (can telecommute or not) to capture households’ exposure to risk, highlighting the importance of the mechanism we examine. The analysis proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents background information for Mexico. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 describes household arrangements and employment indicators for individuals included in our analysis. Section 5.1 presents the WFH index and the pre-pandemic distribution of employment, and Section 5.2 presents estimates for the changes in formal employment based on the potential of telecommuting. Section 5.3 discusses the link between intra-household labor market risk and the Covid-19 pandemic, and Section 5.4 presents evidence on other formal and informal consumption-smoothing mechanisms. Section 6 concludes.",6
19.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,13 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-020-09539-2,Consumption and geographic mobility in pandemic times. Evidence from Mexico,June 2021,Raymundo M. Campos-Vazquez,Gerardo Esquivel,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The economic consequences of COVID-19 are significant. Lockdown and health measures have substantially decreased geographic mobility, causing a reduction in economic activity. The traditional economic indicators that measure these effects, like gross domestic product (GDP) and the industrial production index (IPI), are published by national statistical agencies with a lag: in Mexico, approximately two months after the fact. Researchers and policy-makers across the world are trying to overcome this delay by analyzing high-frequency data to quantify the magnitude of the shock and make prescriptions to avoid a more severe economic contraction (see, for example, the weekly economic index of Lewis et al. 2020; the index of expenditures of Baker et al. 2020; and the labor market index of Kahn et al. 2020). Given the possibility of future waves of COVID-19, it is extremely important to measure the relationship of mobility and economic activity. In this paper, we use aggregated daily point-of-sale (POS) transaction data and cellphone location data in Mexico to quantify the magnitude of the shock and to estimate the effect of mobility patterns on POS expenditures. It is now well known that a supply shock may cause a demand shock in the economy, thus amplifying the initial economic impact (Guerrieri et al. 2020). Sectors related to services, such as restaurants and tourism, are directly affected by a pandemic. One could then expect that the total shock should be proportional to the income losses of these sectors. However, income generated in other sectors may be affected as well, depending on the value of current versus future consumption and the value of goods and services not provided during the pandemic. If we have a high intertemporal elasticity of substitution (e.g., people can modify their consumption patterns relatively easily to spend more later rather than now) and a low intra-temporal elasticity of substitution (e.g., people prefer to buy the same goods and services, and there are no good substitutes for their consumption patterns), then a demand shock exacerbates the original shock, which can present an even greater problem in the presence of uncertainty and incomplete markets. It is thus important to estimate how total expenditure is changing over time and which sectors are most affected, an estimate that requires high frequency data. POS expenditure data may meet the requirements for such analysis. Indeed, there are recent articles that make use of such information. In the United States, Baker et al. (2020) use de-identified non-random data from a Fintech company at the transaction and individual level. They find a spike in total spending when cases begin to increase (late February and early March) but a subsequent decrease of close to 50 percent with respect to January and early February. In Spain, Carvalho et al. (2020a, 2020b) use all POS transactions of customers of a commercial bank and transactions of others using the POS terminals of that bank. As in the U.S. study, they find a spike before the mid-March lockdown and then a sharp decline in total expenditure: 60 percent with respect to the same period in 2019. In Denmark, Andersen et al. (2020a) use data from the country’s largest retail bank. They find a decrease in total spending of around 25 percent after lockdown starts. Similar results have been found in other countries: the United Kingdom shows a decline of 46 percent from April 2019 to April 2020 (Hacioglu et al. 2020), France a decline of 60 percent (Bounie et al. 2020), Portugal a reduction of 55 percent in total purchases in April (Carvalho et al. 2020a, 2020b), and China a decline of 42 percent (Chen et al. 2020). POS data is useful for shedding light on causes and potential solutions for the current crisis. Using U.S. data, Chetty et al. (2020) argue that the drop in POS expenditures is driven mainly by rich households due to health concerns. Expenditures in poor households generally returned to 2019 levels after their stimulus payments arrived. Employment losses are greater in higher-income zip codes, especially in personal services like restaurants and barber shops. They conclude that economic recovery goes hand in hand with safety concerns. In this paper we follow Chetty et al. (2020) to study how the COVID-19 pandemic affects point-of-sale (POS) consumption patterns. We analyze the evolution of consumption by type of expenditure and estimate how mobility patterns are related to consumption. The main hypothesis we test is whether there is a close relationship between consumption and mobility (as proxied by cell phone location data). We hypothesize that in less developed countries the relationship between mobility and consumption is stronger than in developed countries. The underlying argument is that mobility restrictions in poorer economies are associated with lesser income-generating capacity, which in turn leads to lower consumption levels. The economic factors behind this relationship are a smaller share of jobs that can be performed remotely, the lack of a safety net that can compensate for income lost due to mobility restrictions, and a greater share of hand-to-mouth consumers in less developed economies. According to our hypothesis, the combination of these elements should lead to a stronger relationship between mobility and consumption in less developed economies. The relationship between consumption and mobility is key to a better understanding of the speed and characteristics of the recovery in different economies as lockdowns end. It could also be important for the post-pandemic world, since we cannot rule out significant and more permanent changes in mobility patterns or future waves of the pandemic. Our paper makes important contributions to this literature. First, we show that the response in developing countries may be different than in developed countries. Although Mexico is an upper middle-income country, its financial sector is not as developed as in other countries. According to the World Bank (2020), domestic bank credit to the private sector accounts for only 27 percent of GDP, while in countries with similar consumption patterns, like China, Denmark, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom, it is close to or above 100 percent. Only in the United States is it less than that, and even there it is 52 percent of GDP. Also, the number of POS terminals in Mexico per 100,000 population is the lowest among similar countries (approximately 1000 in Mexico versus 2000 in China and 3000 in the other countries). Finally, internet penetration in Mexico (around 64 percent) is less than in the United States (76 percent) or similar European countries (all above 80 percent). Although this may mean that POS data are not as comprehensive for Mexico, our results indicate large negative effects of the pandemic, although not as large as those in other countries. Second, the data we analyze for Mexico includes all POS transactions in the country, in contrast to the data in previous studies, which is limited to selected banks or companies. The comprehensive nature of our data allows us to benchmark the effect of COVID-19 on POS expenditures to traditional measures like total consumption and GDP. Third, although we follow previous literature in calculating expenditure losses with respect to 2019, we also propose a simple model to calculate a counterfactual of what expenditure would have looked like in the absence of the pandemic. Finally, we estimate the elasticity of POS expenditures with respect to measures of geographic mobility using variation over time within states in Mexico. We use mobility measured through cell phone activity by Google and Apple. This elasticity is important, as it could be used in theoretical models and simulation exercises to calculate expenditure losses for future waves of the pandemic. It is also an important consideration in the debate about the impact of lockdown measures on the level of expenditures. We use the universe of point-of-sale (POS) transactions from January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020, which is public data from the Banco de México (the Mexican central bank), consisting of aggregated daily information on total expenditures and certain other categories. This POS expenditure data provides important information about general consumption patterns. In 2019, there were 157 million debit and credit cards in Mexico, and the National Financial Inclusion Survey (INEGI 2018) shows that more than two-thirds of the Mexican population (68 percent) aged 18–70 have at least one such financial product. In 2019, the average POS expenditure per transaction was $630 MXN (approximately $31 USD). Approximately 10 million transactions take place through POS terminals every day, 73 percent of which are with debit cards and the remaining 27 percent with credit cards. The average monthly total debit and credit card expenditure was almost $187 billion MXN during 2019 (approximately $9.2 billion USD). Annual total POS expenditure thus represents about 8 percent of GDP and 14 percent of consumption. We are able to provide the first direct estimates of the elasticity of POS expenditures with respect to geographic mobility. Previous studies have provided only indirect or implicit estimates for this elasticity. For example, using the results in Andersen et al. (2020b), we can estimate an elasticity of 0.2 by exploiting the between-country variation in spending and mobility for Sweden and Denmark: consumption declined 29 percent in Denmark and by 25 percent in Sweden (Fig. 3 in that study). Using mobility measures based on cellphone location data available from the Apple Corporation (2020) for early April, we find that mobility decreased by only 12 percent in Sweden while it declined by 32 percent in Denmark. The implicit elasticity of POS expenditures with respect to mobility is thus around 0.2. In the current study, since we have daily data for expenditures in Mexico at the subnational level, we are able to estimate the elasticity of consumption with respect to mobility indicators by exploiting both the time and geographic variation in the data. We find three key results. First, the percent loss in POS expenditures with respect to the estimate without the pandemic is 23 percent for April-June. This estimate is much lower than for other countries. The estimate for Spain and France (for the last two weeks of March) is close to 50 percent (Bounie et al. 2020; Carvalho et al. 2020a, 2020b), for Portugal it is 55 percent (Carvalho et al. 2020a, 2020b), and for Denmark it is 30 percent (Andersen et al. 2020a). Although estimates for the U.S. vary, our result is similar to the live results from POS data in Chetty et al. (2020). In terms of GDP and consumption, for the April-June quarter it implies a loss of 2.6 percent of quarterly GDP and 3.9 percent of quarterly private consumption. Second, losses vary significantly across sectors and regions. While some sectors were severely hit, like tourism, food services, and transportation, others, like insurance and telecommunications, were barely affected. This result is similar to that found in other studies. Mexican states that are highly dependent on tourism (beach resorts and other tourist destinations) are among the most affected. Third, we estimate the elasticity of POS expenditures with respect to geographic mobility in Mexico, as measured using cellphone location data from Apple (2020) and Google LLC (2020). Our estimates show that this elasticity is in most cases non-significantly different from one (0.93 using Apple’s measure of mobility in one specification, and 0.91 for both Google’s and Apple’s measures of mobility in another). These estimates are much larger and more precisely estimated than the estimate of 0.2 derived by comparing the effect of mobility on spending in Sweden and Denmark, as described above. This result suggests that POS expenditures in developing countries could be more responsive to mobility patterns than in developed countries, an interesting possibility that calls for further research. It may be possible, for example, that internet penetration and the strength of e-commerce affect the magnitude of this elasticity. This result is also important because it suggests that in economies like Mexico’s, mobility indicators, which can be observed almost in real time, could serve as a good proxy for the behavior of expenditures.",23

In this rapidly changing environment, real-time impact assessment of the pandemic is of high importance to identify sectors most hit by the crisis and recommend policies regarding the possible next phase of the outbreak. This paper uses monthly data from the universe of electronic payments via point-of-sale (POS) and online terminals in Iran to study the impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent reopening the economy on consumption patterns and online-offline substitution. Using the same monthly data of the previous year, we use a difference-in-difference methodology to identify the causal impact of the pandemic shock. We find that during the strictest lockdown months (March–April), the year-over-year growth rate in the value of transactions dropped by 41% compared to the months before the pandemic started. Following the reopening of the economy in Iran in May–June, the year-over-year growth rate rose by 12% above the benchmark months, suggesting an accumulated demand discharge after the reopening. We also find that the COVID-19 pandemic led to a spike in online transactions of activities with online terminals, and the impact continued to exist after the reopening of the economy. This can imply a persistent effect of COVID-19 on consumer preference for online shopping. The very recent economic literature on the impact of COVID-19 is growing in different directions. This paper follows a strand of this literature that uses transaction data for the impact assessment of COVID-19. This type of studies is done for several countries, including France (Bounie et al., 2020), Portugal (Carvalho et al., 2020a), Mexico (Campos-Vazquez and Esquivel, 2021), Denmark (Andersen et al., 2020), Spain (Carvalho et al., 2020b), China (Chen et al., 2020), Japan (Watanabe and Omori, 2020), U.K. (Hacioglu et al. 2020), and the U.S. (Baker et al., 2020). Apart from the country of study, these papers are different in some other aspects, such as using nationwide data or data from a specific bank or institution, decomposing online vs. offline shopping, etc. Three of the above papers use the universe of all transactions of their country of study. For France, Bounie et al. (2020) investigate consumer behavior in response to COVID-19 lockdown using the universe of French card transactions. They find that the substitution of POS shopping with online shopping alleviated the negative impact of the pandemic shock on consumption expenditure. For Portugal, Carvalho et al. (2020a) use aggregate nationwide data of POS and online shopping to study the impact of lockdown on electronic purchases. They find a 45% decrease in the year-over-year monthly growth rate after the pandemic. Across different sectors, while the purchase of groceries somewhat increased, sectors more affected by the lockdowns like tourism and restaurants experienced a severe drop in consumer spending. For Mexico, Campos-Vazquez and Esquivel (2021) use the universe of POS transactions before and after the COVID-19 lockdown and a 23% consumption reduction in the second quarter of 2020. Similar to studies of other countries, they find that sectors related to tourism are the most affected by the pandemic lockdown. Among the papers that use data of a bank or institution, Chen et al. (2020) study the impact of COVID-19 on consumption patterns in China, using daily transaction data of a service provider covering around 30% of POS terminals. They find that in three months following the spread of COVID-19, transactions via POS terminals decreased by 70% in severely affected cities and estimate a 1.2% reduction in GDP of China in 2019. For Spain, Carvalho et al. (2020b) use transaction data of a large bank and find that COVID-19 reduced aggregate expenditure by about 49% in comparison to the same period in 2019, with a heavily disproportionate impact on POS transactions compared to online transactions. For Denmark, which had fewer restrictions than Spain and China, Andersen et al. (2020) use transaction data of the largest Danish bank and find that aggregate transactions dropped by around 25% after the pandemic lockdown. They also find that spending on goods and services more affected by restrictions and by people more vulnerable to COVID-19 fell more than others. In two similar studies, Hacioglu et al. (2020) find a decline of 46% in transactions from April 2019 to April 2020 in the U.K., and Baker et al. (2020), using data of a Fintech company, find that after an initial spike in total spending when cases begin to increase, there was a sharp decrease in overall spending. In contrast to the above studies, which focus on high-income countries, our paper contributes to this literature by providing evidence for Iran, and to the best of our knowledge, no study is done yet for impact assessment of COVID-19 on consumption in the MENA region. Our data is universal, and it aggregates all individual transactions into monthly observations for 280 activities and 31 provinces of Iran. The data is decomposed based on POS and online terminals enabling us to look into online vs. offline shopping.",6

One of the major goals of expansion of Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was passed into the law in 2010, was to improve their ability to pay their medical expenses. The ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility to all individuals earning less than 138% of the federal poverty level—prior to passage of the ACA, Medicaid eligibility was limited to minor children and single parents in most states, subject to federal mandatory minimum coverage levels. The ACA’s most major provisions came into force in 2014. As shown in Fig. 1, the share of people covered by private and/or public health insurance, regardless of their income levels, started to increase gradually in 2010 but drastically in 2014, due to the ACA’s (1) individual mandate provision, which requires most citizens and legal residents of the United States to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty,Footnote 1 and (2) health exchanges (i.e., the Health Insurance Marketplace), which are regulated marketplaces administered by either federal or state governments and provide health plan shopping and enrollment services to people and small businesses. However, the impact of the ACA was greater for people with income below 138% of the federal poverty level, due to the Medicaid expansion provision of the ACA. Growth in population share with health insurance: 2009–2017. Source: Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (U.S. Census Bureau) At the same time, the number of personal bankruptcies in the United States started to decline in 2011 (see Fig. 2), after increasing during the period 2007–2010, presumably because of the Great Recession that resulted in financial distress among many Americans.Footnote 2 As the literature suggests that medical expenditures are one of the major causes of bankruptcies, and financial protection provided by health insurance largely eliminates medical expenses, this paper examines if this decline in personal bankruptcies in the 2010s can be explained by the increase in health insurance coverage among low-income people. National trend in personal bankruptcy filings: 2010–2018. Source: U.S. Bankruptcy Courts. Table F-2 for the 12-month periods ending September 30, 2006 through 2018 To have the greatest possible confidence in the causal relationship that this study seeks to establish, I use an instrumental variables strategy. I use the Medicaid expansion under the ACA as a source of exogeneous variation to instrument the share of low-income people with health insurance. Though intended to apply nationwide, the Supreme Court ruled that the states had to be allowed to decide for themselves whether they would adopt the expanded Medicaid eligibility rules. As a result, the expansion of Medicaid in states provides a plausible source of exogenous variation. Evidence suggests that states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 experienced an increase in their rates of health insurance coverage compared to non-expansion states. Frean et al. (2017), using the 2012–2015 American Community Survey, find that insurance coverage increased among those who were newly eligible for Medicaid. Courtemanche et al. (2017) find that coverage increased by 5.9% points in expansion states compared to 2.8% points in states that did not expand Medicaid by the end of 2014 (see also Kaestner et al. (2017); Miller and Wherry (2017); Wherry and Miller (2016)). This study uses the bankruptcy filing rate as a proxy for financial distress and adds to a growing literature studying the link between financial health and health insurance. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, this study uses aggregate (county and state) data. Previous studies that examined the relationship between health insurance and financial health use individual data. The only exception seems to be Gross and Notowidigdo (2011), who used state-level data, but they examined the period 1992–2004, during which personal bankruptcies were rising. While individual-level data provide researchers with more flexibility in their analyses, using aggregate data is important and relevant in studies that examine policy changes, given that many policy interventions often take place at an aggregate level (see Abadie et al. (2010) for a review). Furthermore, one issue with individual level data in natural experimental studies is that the treatment variable does not vary within groups, but the groups may have a shared error structure. Moulton (1990) shows that standard errors are biased more downward, which leads to greater statistical significance, when group sizes are larger and intraclass correlations of the regression errors and the regressors included in the model are higher, thereby increasing the likelihood of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. One approach to alleviate this concern is to aggregate data to the same level as the treatment variable (see Bertrand et al. (2004)).Footnote 3 Second, studies that use individual-level data do not contain information on all personal bankruptcies, which are relatively rare on a per capita basis, and their data rely on the accuracy and timeliness of the credit bureau in collecting public record, not the direct collection of filings. This study uses data from the US Court that contain all bankruptcy filings from fifty states and the District of Columbia in the United States. The results found in this study show differences in the effect of health insurance coverage on personal bankruptcies. Specifically, an increase in health insurance coverage among low-income people reduces Chapter 7, but not Chapter 13, bankruptcy rates. My conservative estimate indicates that a ten-percentage points increase (~1 standard deviation) in the share of the population covered by health insurance contributes to approximately a reduction of 0.4 per 1000 adults for the Chapter 7 bankruptcy rates at the county level and the state level. The implied magnitudes of my estimated impacts are quantitatively important. A back-of-envelope calculation suggests that, among states that expanded Medicaid in January 2014, more than half of the decline in their Chapter 7 bankruptcy rates that occurred during the period 2014–2018 is attributable to the increase in health insurance coverage among low-income people who were presumably mostly new Medicaid beneficiaries.",2

A 2017 survey reported that, among American twelfth-graders, 33.2% had consumed alcohol in the past thirty days (Johnston et al. 2018). Even though underage drinking had been on the decline since 2002, adolescents between age twelve and age twenty still consumed 11% of all alcohol sold in the United States (U.S.), with more than 90% of that consumed in binge drinking (DHHS 2019). Alcohol consumption has high social and economic costs from accidents, premature mortality, productivity loss, and health and behavioral issues (Williams et al. 2003; Sabia 2004; Bouchery et al. 2011; Waddell 2012; DHHS 2013, 2019). More than 4300 alcohol-related deaths occur in youths under age twenty-one in the U.S. annually (DHHS 2019). Alcohol-related auto accidents are the leading cause of death among adolescents between the ages of seventeen and twenty, as excessive alcohol consumption increases the risk of fatal injuries. Academic failure, violence and other crime, unsafe and reckless sexual behavior, sexual victimization, use of other drugs, driving under the influence (DUI), fighting, and physical injuries are also attributed to alcohol use among teens (Grossman et al. 2004; Champion et al. 2008; Buu et al. 2009; LaBrie et al. 2010; Song 2012). More than 400,000 students aged eighteen to twenty-four have unprotected sex after drinking, and about a quarter of those students reported being too intoxicated to know whether they had consented to having sex (DHHS 2013). Drinking also imposes external costs on other students and neighbors through physical and verbal abuse, sexual assault, vandalism, and sleep disturbances (Wechsler et al. 2002; Hingson et al. 2005). Because many people initiate drinking as teens (D’Amico and McCarthy 2006; Jensen and Lleras-Muney 2012; DHHS 2013), which puts them at greater risk of developing alcohol dependence and abuse compared to those who initiate drinking later (Strashny 2014), alcohol consumption should be addressed at an early age. Heavy drinking and alcohol-related issues like fatal motor vehicle accidents reach their peak between the late teens and early twenties (Fuchs 2011; Johnston et al. 2018), and even sporadic drinking, combined with lapses of judgment, can result in tragic outcomes (Schulenberg and Maggs 2002). While many public policies target substance use among adolescents, reducing adolescents’ drinking remains a challenge (Clark and Loheac 2007; Johnston et al. 2018). A range of individual, family, and neighborhood characteristics have been identified as important factors in teen drinking (Windle et al. 2005; Fletcher 2012; Fletcher and Sindelar 2012; Song et al. 2012). Among them, the household context has a significant effect on adolescents’ drinking, including factors like access to alcohol at home, alcoholic parents, parental absence from the home (Fletcher 2012, Fletcher and Sindelar 2012), and perceived parental disapproval of drinking (Song et al. 2012). In addition, the influence of peers has been found to be an important driver of adolescents’ alcohol consumption (Lundborg 2006; Clark and Loheac 2007; Nakajima 2007; Rees and Wallace 2014; Ajilore et al. 2016). It is also well-documented that alcohol use is driven by something even more proximal: teens’ (mis)perceptions about their peers’ behavior (Prentice and Miller 1993; Borsari and Carey 2003; Perkins 2014). As long as group norms influence behavior, one can expect at least some normative influences to occur via individual perception, regardless of the perception’s accuracy (Perkins 2014). Therefore, perceptions “must be taken as important in their own right since people act on their perceptions in addition to acting within an objective normative world” (Perkins 2014). Although substance use rises sharply during the teen years and reaches its peak in late adolescence, little research on normative perceptions has used data on school-aged adolescents (rare exceptions include D’Amico and McCarthy 2006; Juvonen et al. 2007; Song et al. 2012; Pedersen et al. 2017; Amialchuk et al. 2019), focusing instead almost exclusively on college students (Borsari and Carey 2003; Perkins 2014). To the best of our knowledge, no study to date has evaluated the effect of normative misperceptions on the alcohol-related problems of school-age adolescents. In the case of drinking, after observing that a few close friends are drinking heavily, students may incorrectly conclude that excessive drinking is the norm (Borsari and Carey 2001). This study uses data on adolescents enrolled in grades seven through twelve to estimate the effect of biased perceptions (i.e., misperceptions) of friends’ alcohol consumption on a wide range of alcohol-related problems. Unlike previous studies that have relied on convenience samples (Song et al. 2012, Pedersen et al. 2017), this study uses a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. middle school and high school adolescents and includes information on their peers’—in the form of friends they nominate—direct responses about their alcohol consumption. In addition, most previous research has used the “typical/average student” as a reference group (e.g., Pedersen et al. 2017), but this group lacks psychological reality because close friends, rather than “average” students, are the most proximal and influential peer group (Prentice and Miller 1993; Halliday and Kwak 2012; Perkins 2014). To overcome this problem, we measure misperceptions by comparing the samples perceptions of their nominated friends’ drinking with those nominated friends’ own responses about their alcohol consumption. The longitudinal design and the richness of the data allow us to address endogeneity concerns and to account for confounding factors by using lagged and fixed effects estimation and controlling for the school and neighborhood environment, family background, peer selection, and actual peer norms. Previous empirical studies have used only cross-sectional correlational analysis and have not accounted for these factors. Identification of peer effects requires additional structural conditions that can be achieved using longitudinal data (Manski 2000; Clark and Loheac 2007). In addition, while the previous literature has usually relied on discrete measures of perceived norms (e.g., using an indicator for the belief that most friends drink), our empirical analysis employs a continuous misperception measure that allows the effects of the full range of biases to be precisely estimated. Finally, we stratify our analysis by gender because previous studies have consistently found that young women drink less than young men do, regardless of their peers’ drinking rate, and that young men see alcohol-consumption norms as being more permissive than young women do (Borsari and Carey 2001). In this study, we estimate the effect of misperceptions about friends’ drinking (divergence between the perceived level and the actual level) on alcohol-related problems and find that overestimation of friend’s alcohol use significantly increases adolescents’ alcohol-related problems approximately one year later, independent of the effect of peers’ actual drinking level. Misperceptions about friends’ drinking have a consistent and significant impact on all alcohol-related problems that are used in this study. After stratifying the estimates by gender, the effect of misperception is significantly higher for males than it is for females in cases of heavy drinking, vomiting, and drunk driving.",4

Evidence from administrative data,June 2021,Jaanika Meriküll,Merike Kukk,Tairi Rõõm,Female,Female,Female,Female,"The gender gaps in various forms of income, such as wages or pensions, have been extensively studied in the academic literature, but there have been substantially fewer studies that have focused on the gender differences in wealth. The aim of this paper is to help filling this research gap. Wealth is an important indicator of welfare and measuring wealth inequalities is relevant both at the level of the population as a whole and within households. While income gaps show current inequality, wealth gaps depict inequality that has accumulated over a longer time span. The main reason why only a few existing papers have studied gender wealth gaps is that individual-level wealth data are rarely available. Wealth surveys usually collect data at the household level, with only a few exceptions. Consequently, many studies on this topic are based on household-level data, which means that they either analyse the gender wealth gap only among households with one member (e.g. Schmidt and Sevak 2006; Schneebaum et al. 2018, and Ravazzini and Chesters 2018) or impute the allocation of wealth within larger households using data from single-member households (for an overview of the methods for this see Bonthieux and Meurs 2015). Both of these approaches have disadvantages because the unconditional gender wealth gaps vary over different household types. They are larger for couple-headed households and smaller and often statistically insignificant for single-member households (Sierminska et al. 2010; Bonnet et al. 2013). This means that the gender gaps that are estimated on the basis of single-member households are not generalisable to the whole population. Relatively few papers on the gender wealth gap use individual-level wealth data and cover all types of households.Footnote 1 All of these studies use survey data collected by household interviews. The present paper differs from the earlier studies by employing a different data source. We use a novel dataset from Estonia that derives individual-level wealth data from various administrative sources and links them with the Estonian Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) from 2013. The main advantage of this combined dataset is that it covers register-based wealth items at the individual level together with other household characteristics from the survey. The administrative data are superior in quality to the survey data, but administrative datafiles often give no information on household structure. The combined dataset used in this article overcomes this problem. This paper aims to contribute to the literature in several ways. First, we decompose the gender wealth gaps into explained and unexplained parts and explore the distribution of unconditional and conditional gender wealth gaps for different components of net wealth. This lets us evaluate which of the different types of assets and liabilities contribute more to the gender gap in net wealth. Differences in the wealth composition of men and women have not been explored at such a detailed level as we can do with the current dataset. None of the earlier studies estimated conditional gender wealth gaps for various wealth items, i.e. there is no information on whether the differences in the structure of assets for men and for women can be explained by observable characteristics such as differences in income. Second, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of gender gaps in net wealth over different household types. We compare the distributions of unconditional and conditional wealth gaps between men and women in single-member households, couple-headed households and other types of household. Earlier studies using individual-level wealth data have assessed the raw gaps for single people and couple-headed households but have not conducted the decomposition and estimated the unconditional and conditional gaps separately for different household types (Sierminska et al. 2010; Bonnet et al. 2013). Third, we base our analysis on data from a different source. While earlier studies have been based on survey data, we use data from administrative files. It can be expected that administrative data are much less prone to measurement error than survey data are. Various sources of measurement error in survey data have been discussed e.g. by Riphahn and Serfling (2005). When measurement errors are caused by systemic under- or overreporting of different components of net wealth they may lead to biased estimates of gender wealth gap. There is evidence that women tend to underestimate the value of the assets they own and men to overestimate it (Zagorsky 2003). This implies that the survey-based assessments of the gender gaps in net wealth may be overestimated. Using administrative data lets us avoid the possible gender biases that are embedded in the wealth surveys. In addition, there is evidence that wealth surveys typically do not cover the very top of the wealth distribution (Vermeulen 2016; Meriküll and Rõõm 2019). As we will show in the current study, the gender wealth gap mostly originates from this part of the distribution. If the richest individuals are not covered by a survey then the disparities in wealth between men and women are undermeasured. The existing evidence therefore implies that using survey data may result in either over or underestimation of the gender wealth gap. Either way, the use of administrative data is free of these biases and so results in a more exact measurement of the gap. Finally, the current paper provides novel information on the gender wealth gap in Estonia, which is the country that has the largest gender wage gap in the EU (see e.g. Eurostat series sdg_05_020). If the wealth accumulation functions of men and women are similar, then disparities in income are transferred to disparities in wealth. This also provides a good background for exploring how much married couples pool their assets. Many potential sources of the gender gap in wealth have been identified in the literature. The reasons why wealth accumulation may be different for men and women are discussed more thoroughly in the next section and we mention them here only briefly. First and foremost, the gender gap in wealth may arise because of income differences between the genders. It is well established that men earn more and have higher labour market participation rates than women do (e.g. Blau and Kahn 2000). This lets men accumulate more wealth. Besides income differences, the gender gap can be caused by differences in consumption and saving patterns (e.g. Fisher 2010; Sunden and Surrette 1998) or because women and men invest differently (e.g. Hinz et al. 1997; Grable 2000). Finally, men and women could inherit differently and this could contribute to wealth inequality, but studies mostly do not find that inheritances differ by gender (e.g. Edlund and Kopczuk 2009). The various assets that a household owns are often used by all the members of the household and provide utility for the members who are not the owners of the particular items. Even so, the distribution of wealth within a household is relevant for two main reasons. First, it affects the bargaining power of individual household members over the allocation of resources within the household. Second, the joint use of wealth is not guaranteed for the full life of both partners but only until the end of their relationship. This makes it important for both men and women to accumulate savings for possible separations. Both men and women receive wealth premiums from marriage (Lersch 2017), while divorcees create wealth losses for both former partners (Ulker 2009; Grabka et al. 2015). Wealth inequality is typically much greater than income inequality (e.g. HFCN 2013). This implies that wealth differences between the genders may also be more substantial than income differences. Equally though, assets acquired during a marriage are usually split evenly, unless a couple has a prenuptial agreement that stipulates otherwise, and this reduces gender wealth inequality within households with married couples. The key findings on the magnitude of the gender wealth gap are summarised by Bonthieux and Meurs 2015. Men’s mean level of wealth is 45% higher than that of women in Germany (Sierminska et al. 2010), 15% higher in France (Bonnet et al. 2013) and 18% higher in Italy (D’Allessio 2018). Findings for some developing countries indicate that the gender gap in wealth is more substantial there. Men have two to four times more gross assets than women do in Ghana and India (Doss et al. 2014). This paper uses the unconditional quantile regressions suggested by Firpo et al. (2009) to estimate the size of the gender gap over the distribution of net wealth. We decompose the raw gap into explained and unexplained components using an Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition. The gender wealth gaps are estimated for various assets and liabilities and for different household types. We find that the mean unconditional gender wealth gap is as large as 45% in Estonia. However, the gap in means originates mostly from the top tail of the wealth distribution, where men have much more wealth than women, while the gaps are statistically insignificant in lower parts of the wealth distribution. Men have more business wealth than women do, and the gender wealth gap is the largest for this asset class, which is the main source of the large gender wealth gap in means. It is also found that the raw gender wealth gap is largest among partner-headed households, while it is negative (i.e. in favour of women) or statistically insignificant in single-member households. This highlights how important it is to use individual-level data that cover all household types for analysing the gender wealth gap, since assessments based purely on single-member households can provide results that are not valid for other household types. Conditioning on observed characteristics renders the gaps for different household types mostly statistically insignificant. Men have more vehicles, business assets and private pension assets and women have more deposits even after controlling for observable characteristics. Surprisingly, these differences do not disappear when the gender differences in risk aversion are accounted forFootnote 2. The estimated results point to large heterogeneity in the gender wealth gap over various net wealth components and household types, confirming the need to go beyond the means and aggregates. The paper is structured as follows. The next section discusses the wealth accumulation function and possible reasons for the gender wealth gap. Section 3 provides an overview of the institutional settings for family finances in Estonia. Section 4 covers the data and methods. Section 5 presents the results of the empirical estimations. Section 6 discusses the results in the context of the wealth accumulation function. Finally, the last section summarises.",9

Both forces depend on decisions made primarily within households: population growth is partially determined by households’ fertility choices (e.g., Becker & Barro 1988), while human capital accumulation is partially dependent on parental investments in child education and health (e.g., Lucas 1988). In an earlier survey of the literature linking family decisions to economic growth, Grimm (2003) laments that “[m]ost models ignore the two-sex issue. Parents are modeled as a fictive asexual human being” (p. 154).Footnote 1 Since then, however, economists are increasingly recognizing that gender plays a fundamental role in how households reproduce and care for their children. As a result, many models of economic growth are now populated with men and women. The “fictive asexual human being” is a dying species. In this article, we survey this rich new landscape in theoretical macroeconomics, reviewing, in particular, micro-founded theories where gender inequality affects economic development. For the purpose of this survey, gender inequality is defined as any exogenously imposed difference between male and female economic agents that, by shaping their behavior, has implications for aggregate economic growth. In practice, gender inequality is typically modeled as differences between men and women in endowments, constraints, or preferences. Many articles review the literature on gender inequality and economic growth.Footnote 2 Typically, both the theoretical and empirical literature are discussed, but, in almost all cases, the vast empirical literature receives most of the attention. In addition, some of the surveys examine both sides of the two-way relationship between gender inequality and economic growth: gender equality as a cause of economic growth and economic growth as a cause of gender equality. As a result, most surveys end up only scratching the surface of each of these distinct strands of literature. There is, by now, a large and insightful body of micro-founded theories exploring how gender equality affects economic growth. In our view, these theories merit a separate review. Moreover, they have not received sufficient attention in empirical work, which has largely developed independently (see also Cuberes & Teignier 2014). By reviewing the theoretical literature, we hope to motivate empirical researchers in finding new ways of putting these theories to test. In doing so, our work complements several existing surveys. Doepke & Tertilt (2016) review the theoretical literature that incorporates families in macroeconomic models, without focusing exclusively on models that include gender inequality, as we do. Greenwood, Guner and Vandenbroucke (2017), in turn, review the theoretical literature from the opposite direction; they study how macroeconomic models can explain changes in family outcomes. Doepke, Tertilt and Voena (2012) survey the political economy of women’s rights, but without focusing explicitly on their impact on economic development. To be precise, the scope of this survey consists of micro-founded macroeconomic models where gender inequality (in endowments, constraints, preferences) affects economic growth—either by influencing the economy’s growth rate or shaping the transition paths between multiple income equilibria. As a result, this survey does not cover several upstream fields of partial-equilibrium micro models, where gender inequality affects several intermediate growth-related outcomes, such as labor supply, education, health. Additionally, by focusing on micro-founded macro models, we do not review studies in heterodox macroeconomics, including the feminist economics tradition using structuralist, demand-driven models. For recent overviews of this literature, see Kabeer (2016) and Seguino (2013, 2020). Overall, we find very little dialogue between the neoclassical and feminist heterodox literatures. In this review, we will show that actually these two traditions have several points of contact and reach similar conclusions in many areas, albeit following distinct intellectual routes. Although the incorporation of gender in macroeconomic models of economic growth is a recent development, the main gendered ingredients of those models are not new. They were developed in at least two strands of literature. First, since the 1960s, “new home economics” has applied the analytical toolbox of rational choice theory to decisions being made within the boundaries of the family (see, e.g., Becker 1960, 1981).Footnote 3 A second literature strand, mostly based on empirical work at the micro level in developing countries, described clear patterns of gender-specific behavior within households that differed across regions of the developing world (see, e.g., Boserup 1970).Footnote 4 As we shall see, most of the (micro-founded) macroeconomic models reviewed in this article use several analytical mechanisms from ""new home economics”; these mechanisms can typically rationalize several of the gender-specific regularities observed in early studies of developing countries. The growth theorist is then left to explore the aggregate implications for economic development. The first models we present focus on gender discrimination in (or on access to) the labor market as a distortionary tax on talent. If talent is randomly distributed in the population, men and women are imperfect substitutes in aggregate production, and, as a consequence, gender inequality (as long as determined by non-market processes) will misallocate talent and lower incentives for female human capital formation. These theories do not rely on typical household functions such as reproduction and childrearing. Therefore, in these models, individuals are not organized into households. We review this literature in section 2. From there, we proceed to theories where the household is the unit of analysis. In sections 3 and 4, we cover models that take the household as given and avoid marriage markets or other household formation institutions. This is a world where marriage (or cohabitation) is universal, consensual, and monogamous; families are nuclear, and spouses are matched randomly. The first articles in this tradition model the household as a unitary entity with joint preferences and interests, and with an efficient and centralized decision making process.Footnote 5 These theories posit how men and women specialize into different activities and how parents interact with their children. Section 3 reviews these theories. Over time, the literature has incorporated intra-household dynamics. Now, family members are allowed to have different preferences and interests; they bargain, either cooperatively or not, over family decisions. Now, the theorist recognizes power asymmetries between family members and analyzes how spouses bargain over decisions.Footnote 6 These articles are surveyed in section 4. The final set of articles we survey take into account how households are formed. These theories show how gender inequality can influence economic growth and long-run development through marriage market institutions and family formation patterns. Among other topics, this literature has studied ages at first marriage, relative supply of potential partners, monogamy and polygyny, arranged and consensual marriages, and divorce risk. Upon marriage, these models assume different bargaining processes between the spouses, or even unitary households, but they all recognize, in one way or another, that marriage, labor supply, consumption, and investment decisions are interdependent. We review these theories in section 5. Table 1 offers a schematic overview of the literature. To improve readability, the table only includes studies that we review in detail, with articles listed in order of appearance in the text. The table also abstracts from models’ extensions and sensitivity checks, and focuses exclusively on the causal pathways leading from gender inequality to economic growth. The vast majority of theories reviewed argue that gender inequality is a barrier to economic development, particularly over the long run. The focus on long-run supply-side models reflects a recent effort by growth theorists to incorporate two stylized facts of economic development in the last two centuries: (i) a strong positive association between gender equality and income per capita (Fig. 1), and (ii) a strong association between the timing of the fertility transition and income per capita (Fig. 2).Footnote 7 Models that endogenize a fertility transition are able to generate a transition from a Malthusian regime of stagnation to a modern regime of sustained economic growth, thus replicating the development experience of human societies in the very long run (e.g., Galor 2005a, b; Guinnane 2011). In contrast, demand-driven models in the heterodox and feminist traditions have often argued that gender wage discrimination and gendered sectoral and occupational segregation can be conducive to economic growth in semi-industrialized export-oriented economies.Footnote 8 In these settings—that fit well the experience of East and Southeast Asian economies—gender wage discrimination in female-intensive export industries reduces production costs and boosts exports, profits, and investment (Blecker & Seguino 2002; Seguino 2010). Income level and gender equality. Income is the natural log of per capita GDP (PPP-adjusted). The Gender Development Index is the ratio of gender-specific Human Development Indexes: female HDI/male HDI. Data are for the year 2000. Sources: UNDP Income level and timing of the fertility transition. Income is the natural log of per capita GDP (PPP-adjusted) in 2000. Years since fertility transition are the number of years between 2000 and the onset year of the fertility decline. See Reher (2004) for details. Sources: UNDP and Reher (2004) In most long-run, supply-side models reviewed here, irrespectively of the underlying source of gender differences (e.g., biology, socialization, discrimination), the opportunity cost of women’s time in foregone labor market earnings is lower than that of men. This gender gap in the value of time affects economic growth through two main mechanisms. First, when the labor market value of women’s time is relatively low, women will be in charge of childrearing and domestic work in the family. A low value of female time means that children are cheap. Fertility will be high, and economic growth will be low, both because population growth has a direct negative impact on long-run economic performance and because human capital accumulates at a slower pace (through the quantity-quality trade-off). Second, if parents expect relatively low returns to female education, due to women specializing in domestic activities, they will invest relatively less in the education of girls. In the words of Harriet Martineau, one of the first to describe this mechanism, “as women have none of the objects in life for which an enlarged education is considered requisite, the education is not given” (Martineau 1837, p. 107). In the long run, lower human capital investments (on girls) lead to slower economic development. Overall, gender inequality can be conceptualized as a source of inefficiency, to the extent that it results in the misallocation of productive factors, such as talent or labor, and as a source of negative externalities, when it leads to higher fertility, skewed sex ratios, or lower human capital accumulation. We conclude, in section 6, by examining the limitations of the current literature and pointing ways forward. Among them, we suggest deeper investigations of the role of (endogenous) technological change on gender inequality, as well as greater attention to the role and interests of men in affecting gender inequality and its impact on growth.",16

Starting with California in 2004, four states have so far introduced PFL, while nine states have enacted PFL programs. Nonetheless, only 17 percent of working people in the U.S. have access to paid family leave through their employer, with this proportion being even lower for low-income workers (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2018). Research on California’s PFL shows that, in addition to affecting poverty rates (Stanczyk 2019) and maternal labor market outcomes (Byker 2016; Das and Polachek 2015), the program also provides health benefits for both children (Lichtman-Sadot and Pillay Bell 2017; Pihl and Basso 2019) and mothers (Bullinger 2019). Less is known how PFL impacts other outcomes of well-being, which could potentially be mechanisms related to improvements in labor market and health outcomes. This study adds to our understanding of the effects of PFL laws by examining whether California’s PFL improved household food security rates. While other developed countries have national PFL policies in place, no previous study has examined the relationship between these laws and food insecurity. PFL provisions could reduce food insecurity among families following the birth of a child by providing financial protection, avoiding unemployment, allowing parents to smooth their consumption and increasing parental engagement for a longer period. This study evaluates the effects of PFL laws on food and nutritional security following childbirth. In 2014, more than 20.9 percent of U.S. households with children were defined as food-insecure by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), whereas 1.2% of households had very low food security. Using data from the Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement for the years 1999–2007, I estimate difference-in-differences (DD) models to measure whether California’s PFL law improved food security of families after the birth of a child. In line with previous work on California’s PFL program (Bullinger 2019; Rossin-Slater et al. 2013), I use three different control groups to obtain a series of DD estimators. Additionally, I estimate triple difference (DDD) models that take into account potential within-state differences in food insecurity among families with older children, a group that should have not been largely affected by the PFL implementation. My analysis provides evidence that California’s PFL program significantly reduced food insecurity among households following childbirth. Using all other states as the control group, I find that the policy implementation reduced the incidence of household experience very low food security by 2.29 and 1.98 percentage points in the DD and DDD analysis, respectively. These effects are robust to the choice of control group and several measures of food security. I find that the effects are driven by improved food security among children. When evaluating whether the policy change had heterogeneous impacts, I find that the effects are stronger for low-income households, a group that has been shown to highly value PFL benefits (Winston et al. 2017), as well as families with more than one child and those with parents under the age of 30. A placebo test and an alternative DD specification provide further evidence that the observed effects are driven by the PFL law. In line with previous research on the implementation of California’s PFL law, the findings of this study also make the case that PFL programs have unintended positive effects on food security levels of families with infants.",4
19.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,19 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-020-09530-x,Combining parenthood and work: transmission channels and heterogeneous returns to early public childcare,September 2021,Eric Schuss,Mohammed Azaouagh,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The provision of high-quality public childcare is seen as a central instrument to equalize children’s initial conditions for life and to complement the acquisition of human capital (see Cornelissen et al. 2018; Felfe and Lalive 2018). The German government formulates the promotion of childcare for children under the age of three as an equalizer from a second perspective (German Federal Parliament 2008)—one that involves mothers who wish to combine motherhood and work—a combination which is challenging due to restrictions in the supply of public childcare. In the underlying standard microeconomic model, a policy reform that increases the supply of childcare and that holds fees constant is expected to increase the labor market supply of mothers. This policy reform may also shorten the time being out of the labor force so that depreciation of human capital is reduced during time-out and re-entry wages are higher. Increased hourly wages can enable the achievement of a given monthly income with less working hours, so there could also be a negative relationship between childcare and labor supply at the intensive margin of employment (see Carta and Rizzica 2018). While eligibility to childcare slots in the United States and Canada is often targeted at some explicitly defined groups of particular need (Blau 2000; Cascio 2009; Fitzpatrick 2010, 2012; Kline and Walters 2016), public childcare is very often of universal shape in Europe. Two strands of identification strategies appear to be dominant when quasi-experimental data is available (see Table 1):Footnote 1 The first strategy examines the effect of differences in spatial childcare coverage at the level of municipalities on individual labor supply by estimating an intend-to-treat (ITT) effect. The second strategy applies regression discontinuity designs (RDD) using age-related cut-off rules to capture eligibility to a public childcare slot and exploits the fact that the eligibility depends on the month of birth.Footnote 2 First, the overview on European studies underline that estimates are hard to compare because the institutional setting varies much by countries (e.g., the age group of children under focus, the initial level of childcare supply, general female employment, economic conditions, and the system of other instruments of family policy differ). Second, the effects on maternal employment are smallFootnote 3 and only Goux and Mourin (2010) and Bauernschuster and Schlotter (2015) provide information regarding actual childcare utilization that enables the identification of an ATE, not solely an ITT. The lack of knowledge on actual childcare utilization also leads to small estimates because individual preferences in favor of or against early childcare remain unrevealed. Third, papers do not agree regarding the question whether childcare mainly affects the intensive or the extensive margin of employment, e.g., compare Carta and Rizzica (2018) to Bauernschuster and Schlotter (2015), Bick (2016), and Felfe et al. (2016). Fourth, previous studies show some transmission channels that drive or attenuate labor supply effects. If the expansion of public childcare supply crowds out private childcare, effects on labor supply can be limited (Felfe and Lalive 2012; Nollenberger and Rodriguez-Planas 2015). Furthermore, heterogeneities regarding mother’s age, the number of children, and household composition reveal the broad range of estimates with respect to socioeconomic characteristics (Carta and Rizzica 2018; Nollenberger and Rodriguez-Planas 2015). Those findings are confirmed by papers using structural models and simulations, where the introduction of legal claim to a childcare slot or the increase of childcare coverage are simulated within a theoretical framework that models decisions of individuals or households (see Panel C of Table 1).Footnote 4 Yamaguchi et al. (2018) contributes to our collection of quasi-experimental studies from Europe. The authors apply the MTE framework to a institutional childcare setting similar to our context. In Japan, parents unable to mind their children (single and disabled parents, parents working full time) are prioritized regarding the assignment of public childcare slots, which produces selection into treatment based on observable characteristics. Following this mechanism, their estimates show that mothers who increase their labor supply the most are those with the lowest probability of using public childcare. In this paper, we provide new evidence on the effects of the supply of early public childcare on the labor market participation of mothers. To tackle the endogeneity of labor market decisions and the selectivity of demanding external childcare, we exploit quasi-experimental expansion of early public childcare in Germany since 2005. So far, we have merely gained knowledge on the labor market effect on the average. In accordance with prior research, we identify a small and weak local average treatment effect (LATE) within the typical IV framework and then proceed to estimate marginal treatment effects (MTE) along the distribution of observables and unobservables that drive individual treatment decisions. Applying the design of MTE reveals transmission channels of this small ATE and uncovers substantial heterogeneity in marginal returns to the German childcare reforms. The application of MTE in the context of childcare and parental employment is justified by several reasons. The application of MTE is suitable when the effect of a treatment is highly heterogeneous and varies due to correlation with unobserved characteristics (Brave and Walstrum 2014). Moreover, the relationship between unobservable characteristics and the outcome should follow economic theory. Both conditions apply to our research question. First, the assignment of childcare slots is selective and depends on relationship status and pre-birth employment status as defined by German law (see Section 2), which produces heterogeneous effects regarding observables. However, the access to information regarding juridical claims to a slot and unobservable characteristics such as the attitude toward external childcare and labor market attachment of women make the treatment effect to vary due to correlation between treatment status and unobservables. Due to this selection pattern, accounting for the difference between the ATE, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), and the average treatment effect on the untreated (ATU) is important, which is feasible by applying MTE. Second, the theoretical trade-off discussed by Ermisch (1989) and Apps and Rees (2004) can be modeled suitably in the MTE setting. At the point of indifferences between sending the child to a public slot, the costs of external childcare (e.g., less time spent with children) and the benefits (forgone earnings and reduced depreciation of human capital during shorter time-out from the labor market) equal. We provide three major contributions: First, to our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to analyze labor market effects with a focus on childcare for children under the age of three (to the best of our knowledge Brilli et al. 2016; Yamaguchi et al. 2018; are the two exceptions). Although the effects for children’s development from early childcare are well studied by Felfe and Lalive (2012, 2018), the effects on parental labor supply are left to be examined for Germany. By focusing on this age group, we take advantage of an institutional setting where slots are indeed scarce, so that the selection into treatment is limited and can be governed by market designers concerning observable characteristics. Although Yamaguchi et al. (2018) also consider care for children under the age of three and the Japanese setting shares some common features in the institutional setting, our setting is characterized by important differences. The childcare expansion exploited by Yamaguchi et al. (2018) amounts to twelve percent during a period of 10 years with an initial childcare coverage of about 27 percent. On the contrary, we focus on policy reforms that increased childcare coverage from almost zero to about 24 percent during ten years. In contrast to Brilli et al. (2016), this makes it possible to exploit both spatial and temporal variation in childcare coverage. The second difference is the German population, which is more heterogeneous than the Japanese regarding ethnic origin, attitudes toward external childcare, and further socioeconomic characteristics. Second, we closely examine selection into different childcare arrangements and demonstrate that the expansion of early public childcare indeed raises the utilization of public childcare. Simultaneously, the expansion of public childcare, however, partially crowds out the demand for private childcare. Next to pure descriptive statistics on this topic by Havnes and Mogstad (2011), Givord and Marbot (2015), and Carta and Rizzica (2018), only Nollenberger and Rodriguez-Planas (2015) and Felfe and Lalive (2012) examined the effect of crowding-out in a more detailed way. However, Nollenberger and Rodriguez-Planas (2015) do not find any evidence of this effect and Felfe and Lalive (2012) only consider it in the context of childrens’ development.Footnote 5 Third, to examine which groups draw benefits from the reform, we estimate marginal returns along the distribution of observables and unobservables that determine the selection into treatment. This approach is particularly informative for policy conclusions. In contrast to only estimating the LATE, as would be the case in the standard IV setting, the MTE approach enables us to elaborate effect heterogeneity across the entire population under study, allowing a complete cost-benefit analysis. For instance, MTE helps to uncover whether certain groups without financial resources for private childcare gain from policy reforms. This approach aims to indicate whether the small average of employment effects is the result of a large range of estimates or whether the effect is homogeneously small for the entire distribution of the population. We find that the utilization of early public childcare significantly increases the probability to work full time by 13.2 pp. Migrant mothers from another country of the European Union (EU) increase their employment probability at the extensive margin above average, while non-Union migrants do not increase labor supply. Regarding the selection process, we detect reverse selection on gains at the intensive margin. Effects on full-time employment are highly heterogeneous, whereas the utilization of public childcare increases the full-time employment probability of mothers with medium desire to early public childcare by at least 50 pp. Further examinations highlight that the employment effects from childcare are mainly driven by mothers who shift from part-time jobs to working full time. Thus, effects are mainly driven along the intensive margin which reasons that the effects on general employment are barely found. There are only a small fraction of mothers with low distaste for public childcare who shift from non-employment to (part-time) employment. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the institutional setting and formulates econometric challenges that have to be taken into account in the research design. After Section 3 presents the empirical strategy, justification of applying the MTE framework and data, Sections 4 and 5 provide the results. In Section 6, we draw policy implications from our estimated results.",1

It was not until the last two decades however, that the Mexican gold mining industry took off. Prior to the 2000s, Mexico predominantly focused on silver production, as the country had traditionally been the number one producer of the world’s silver. Due to market speculation of the impending 2007–2008 financial crisis, global gold prices started increasing in 2003 and spiked sharply between 2006 and 2011, with Mexican gold production following the same trend. This event, together with the influx of foreign direct investments (FDI) for mining explorations, inevitably generated a shift in focus from silver to gold mining in Mexico during this time period (Secretaría de Economía, 2013).Footnote 1 According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography (INEGI), the production of gold in Mexico increased three-fold at an average rate of about 5.3% each year between 2000 and 2011. Relative to the world however, Mexico’s global share in gold production during the mining boom only increased from about 0.3% in 2000 to 2.8% in 2011 (The Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC)). Notwithstanding, Mexico’s rich endowment in precious metals like gold in addition to the gold mining boom due to the 2007–2008 global financial crisis, provides an ideal setting for studies that aim to understand how male employment stimulated by mineral-led activities, impact female intra-household welfare outcomes like decision-making and intimate partner violence (IPV). For many centuries, superstition has kept Latin American women away from mining as it was believed that if a woman went near a mine, it would become jealous, hide its wealth and cause catastrophes (Arcos et al. 2018). Lutz-Ley and Beuchler (2020) additionally note that because mining takes place in remote areas, miners are subject to long journeys, uncomfortable settings, and risky conditions. For these reasons, the mining industry has typically been male-dominated. In Mexico, despite efforts to increase female participation in the mining sector, the proportion of women in mining only increased from about 6% in 2004 to 13% in 2009, and subsequently decreased to 11% in 2014 (National Institute for Statistics and Geography (INEGI), 2020).Footnote 2 Figure 4 of the appendix also plots the absolute number of employees in gold mining by gender, between 1994 and 2014. The graph shows that while male employment in gold mining increased sharply especially between 2009 and 2014, female employment in gold mining only rose marginally during the same time period. Subsequently, in a mining report by the African Union (2009), it was suggested that booms in such male-dominated sectors would result in a decrease in women’s intra-household decision-making power. The underlying logic is that as the mining sector flourishes and more men than women gain employment, women become increasingly reliant on their partners’ incomes. Alternatively, busts in the mining industry could also decrease women’s decision-making power through poorer employment prospects related to industrial crowding out effects. In a study on the U.K. by Aragon et al. (2018), coal mine closures were found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in male (female) employment due to the crowding out of female-dominated sectors like manufacturing. In the context of oil extraction in the U.S. however, Maurer and Potlogea (2020) did not observe any gender-biased crowding out effects, contrary to Aragon et al. (2018) findings. Ultimately, the impact of changes in extractive industries (EI) on female employment and in turn, intra-household decision-making outcomes remains inconclusive and renders further investigation. To date, only one paper by Tolonen (2018), has explicitly explored the relationship between mining and spousal decision-making dynamics. In a cross-country study on Sub-Saharan Africa, the author found no effect of local gold mine openings on women’s intra-household bargaining outcomes. This in turn raises the question of whether the commonly assumed negative relationship between gold mining and intra-household female decision-making power is consistent with real world data. This paper therefore endeavors to further test the hypothesized negative relationship between booms in male-dominated industries like mining, and female decision-making power in a Latin American country like Mexico. From a cultural and socio-economic perspective, the Sub-Sahara African region and Latin America are highly distinct. The impact on female decision-making outcomes generated by a mining boom could therefore be different across geographic regions.Footnote 3 Tolonen’s (2018) findings from her cross-country study on Sub-Saharan Africa may thus not be generalizable to countries like Mexico in the Latin American region. In addition, since more indigenous women in Mexico have been documented to live in mining communities and are simultaneously poorer and subject to traditional gender stereotypes, understanding the impact of economic booms in male-dominated sectors like mining is important for enhancing and facilitating gender equality efforts among these particular demographic groups (Lutz-Ley and Buechler 2020). This paper contributes to existing literature in additional ways. First, no previous studies to my knowledge have used exogenous movements in global commodity prices to evaluate the effect of a mining boom on female intra-household decision-making power and intimate partner violence (IPV). In particular, this study exploits the sharp rise in world gold prices between 2003 and 2011, as well as the differences in gold endowment across municipalities and states in Mexico as sources of variation. The paper also utilizes two different data sources, one at the municipality level (MxFLS) and the other at the state level (ENDIREH), to identify changes in not only female bargaining power, but also IPV outcomes during the gold mining boom respectively. To date, only two studies on Sub-Saharan Africa have analysed the impact of mining on IPV. In a cross-country analysis on Sub-Saharan Africa, Kotsadam et al. (2016) found no significant relationship between both factors, whereas in a more location-specific study on Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rustad et al. (2016) discovered that women who lived closer to artisanal and small-scale mining were more likely to experience sexual violence. In this study on Mexico, due to the detailed information on IPV provided by a state-level (ENDIREH) data set, I am able to segregate IPV into four different forms (physical, sexual and emotional abuse and threats of violence), unlike previous studies by Kotsadam et al. (2016) and Rustad et al. (2016) that have only examined harder types of IPV like physical and sexual violence. The results from the analyses show that women living in gold endowed states were more likely to suffer from various forms of IPV, though the types of IPV experienced by women were different for those who were poorer and wealthier. Given the spike in domestic violence during COVID-19, this study is therefore particularly relevant as it helps to shed some light on how changes in male employment as a result of economic booms or busts (in the context of COVID-19) affect women’s risk of IPV, especially in low-middle income countries like Mexico. The findings also reveal that women residing in gold endowed municipalities experienced an increase in their decision-making power at home, which was likely to be driven by a rise in male employment probabilities. Contrary to non-unitary household bargaining models (see McElroy and Horney 1981, Lundberg and Pollak 1994 and Lommerud, 2003) that predict a decline in a woman’s household bargaining power along with a concurrent increase in male employment opportunities generated by a mining boom for instance, the results from this study suggest that an increase in a husband’s outside option through better employment prospects relative to his wife’s, may not necessarily hamper her intra-household decision-making power ability. This finding can be juxtaposed against unitary household bargaining models that predict the pooling of household income (Samuelson 1956). From a policy standpoint, it subsequently elucidates how income resources are distributed within the household, which carries important implications for the effectiveness of cash-transfer programs in reducing IPV for example. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section II provides a background on gold mining in Mexico and discusses relevant theories relating income-generating opportunities to intra-household female decision-making; section III describes the data and empirical method used in this study; section IV presents the main results of the paper, discusses possible channels and additional outcomes like IPV, and reports a set of robustness checks; section V finally concludes.",2

Niaz Asadullah,Uma Kambhampati,Unknown,Unknown,Female,Female,"In this paper, we focus on the impact of women’s empowerment on food security in rural agricultural households of Bangladesh, a country where the prevalence of under-nutrition is very high.Footnote 1 Like other South Asian societies, Bangladesh too has a strongly patriarchal culture in which female mobility is restricted and most women have no independent sources of income or assets. Traditionally, agriculture in South Asia was male-dominated, with women’s roles being largely post-harvest (FAO, 2011; Akter et al., 2017), but there have been significant changes in recent years, with the share of the economically active women involved in agriculture rising from 42.4 in 1980 to 44.5 in 1995 and 63% in 2015 as per Labor Force Survey data (BBS, 2015, 2017). During the same period, Bangladesh has made significant improvements on a range of food security indicators, recording one of the fastest decreases in child underweight and stunting prevalence in history–1.1 to 1.3% points per annum (Headey et al., 2015). Mortality rates for children below 5 years in Bangladesh have also decreased from 221 deaths per 1000 live births in 1970 to 46 in 2014 (Nisbett et al., 2017). Whether these two trends - changes in women’s position in agriculture and improvements in food security indicators–are related, has become a growing area of research in recent years. There is a large literature on various factors influencing the food security of households (for existing reviews, see Poulsen et al. (2015); Charlton et al. (2016); Béné et al. (2016)) but a more limited, though growing literature, on the impact of women’s empowerment more specifically within marriageFootnote 2. This increasing interest is not surprising given that women constitute about 43 percent of the world’s farmers and grow much of the world’s food (FAO, 2011). They influence both food production and consumptionFootnote 3 by providing paid and unpaid labor in agricultural operations and being intimately involved in food preparation within most households in South Asia. Given this centrality of women in food security, it is not surprising that many agricultural interventions target women’s empowerment (Ruel & Alderman, 2013; Pandey et al., 2016; Bird et al., 2019). Analyzing the impact of agriculture on food security, Ruel et al. (2018) identify 6 pathways through which agricultural interventions can impact nutrition, of which three relate to the role of women. These are improving food access through own production, increased incomes, changes in food prices, women’s social status and empowerment through access to resources, increased participation of women in agricultureFootnote 4 and finally, women’s health and nutrition through exposure to toxic agents on farm and also energy intake expenditure. Kadiyala et al. (2014) analyzing a similar set of 6 pathways in India, conclude that they found very little recent research looking at the links between gender, agriculture and nutrition, particularly in relation to women’s time use. Malapit & Quisumbing (2015) also argue that while ‘the biological processes underlying optimal nutrition are relatively well understood, knowledge regarding which dimensions of women’s empowerment matter for good nutrition is limited, both because empowerment is culture- and context-specific and because of the difficulty of measuring empowerment’ (p. 54). As we will see in the conceptual framework in Section 2, women provide a strong link between agriculture and household food security because they are the primary carers within households in developing countries. Child nutrition and health indicators are affected by women’s role in child feeding, health seeking and/or hygiene practices within the household. Since women are generally considered to make pro-nutrition choices (Gillespie et al., 2019), their limited bargaining power is likely to undermine the household’s nutritional status considerably. There is a growing body of evidence documenting whether, and how, empowered mothers matter for the food security of household members in developing countries. Using South African data, Sharaunga et al. (2016) have shown that if the primary female member of a household is empowered then the household is more likely to be food secure because empowerment increases women’s access to and control over productive resources, increases household livelihood diversity and decreases the barriers women face to access markets. Smith et al. (2003) found that women with higher status relative to men had more control over household resources, better access to information and more self-confidence and esteem. They therefore have better nutritional status and provide higher quality care to their children. Similar conclusions have been reached by Harris-Fry et al. (2015) in their study on Bangladesh. In addition, Sraboni et al. (2014) analyzing the impact of women’s empowerment in agriculture on household food security in Bangladesh found that average per capita calorie availability and household dietary diversity increased with the primary female’s empowerment. Shroff et al. (2009) found that mothers with the ability to set money aside in Andhra Pradesh, India had lower odds of their child being stunted than mothers without financial autonomy. Bhagowalia et al. (2012) found a positive association between household dietary diversity and mother’s decision making power and Malapit et al. (2015) found that women’s empowerment in Nepal especially group membership, control over income and decreased workload were positively associated with greater dietary diversity for mothers. They also found that control over income and a lower gender parity gap was associated with higher child height. There is a growing literature of the impact of women’s empowerment on household food security. However, few of these studies consider the intra-household gendered impact of women’s empowerment or the various domains of empowerment.Footnote 5 Our analysis in this paper aims to fill this gap in the literature. In this context, we are interested in three specific questions: do empowered women influence food security within their households? To what extent do women have a gender-differentiated impact i.e. do they have a different effect on the consumption of boys relative to girls? Which aspects of empowerment are important–production, leisure, income or community activities? To answer these questions, we use data from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey for our analysis. This data provides a Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), which is a multi-dimensional index capturing women’s empowerment across a range of activities and dimensions.Footnote 6 Our analytical strategy involves regressing the food security indicators on empowerment while controlling for a range of demographic, socioeconomic, household, and regional factors in a multivariate framework. Our study goes on to consider the impact of 10 sub-components of the WEAI and makes two scholarly contributions. First, we add to the literature on gender bias in intra-household allocation. While there are numerous studies on the impact of maternal education, income and autonomy (e.g. Malapit et al., 2015; Bhagowalia et al., 2012; Shroff et al., 2009; Novella, 2019), to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to formally link women’s empowerment to gender bias within the household in the context of the food security of children. Capturing the ability of women to contribute to decision-making in production is especially important in the context of agricultural households which are both productive and consumptive units. Second, we contribute to the growing body of evidence on the importance of women’s empowerment in agricultural development in South Asia (e.g. Sraboni et al., 2014; Kadiyala et al., 2014) as well as the literature on the gender differentiated treatment of children by parents (e.g. Novella, 2019; Malapit & Quisumbing, 2015; Slade et al., 2017; Karbownik & Myck, 2017). This study departs from existing studies of food security by simultaneously accounting for multidimensionality in the domains both of food security as well as women’s empowerment. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses a conceptual framework along with review of literature. This section is followed by a discussion of the sample, empirical techniques, and measurement of the key variables. Empirical results and their robustness checks are presented in Section 4; while their discussion is provided in Section 5. Finally, the paper concludes with few remarks in Section 6.",6

Several studies have shown that married individuals have better mental health and subjective rated health (Horwitz et al. 1996; Simon and Marcussen 1999; Barrett 2000; Simon 2002; Guner et al. 2014), lower mortality (Gove et al. 1983; Rahman 1993; Hu and Goldman 1995; Johnson et al. 2000; Manor et al. 2000; Gardner and Oswald 2004; Mete 2005), and greater happiness (Blanchflower and Oswald 2004; Clark et al. 2008). Additionally, some research has found that marriage is likely to result in positive changes not only in life style behaviors such as drinking, smoking, and diet (Ben-Shlomo et al. 1993; Wickrama et al. 1995; Horwitz et al. 1996; Power et al. 1999; Burke et al. 2004), but also in expenditure for maintaining health over the life-span (Guner et al. 2014). In contrast to the above health indicators, body mass index (BMI) has been demonstrated to be adversely impacted by marriage. Marriage is associated with higher BMI (Sobal 1991; Sobal et al. 1992, 2003; Shafer 2010; Averett et al. 2008, 2013; Teachman 2016), as well as a greater incidence of overweight or obesity (Averett et al. 2008, 2013). Some studies have indicated gender differences in the impact of marriage on BMI, such as that women experience greater increases than men (Averett et al. 2008, 2013; Shafer 2010). However, most of the research yielding such results has used data from populations in the United States, which has the highest obesity rate among developed countries, and it remains unclear whether the same results would be obtained in other countries with different obesity conditions. In other words, there is a question of whether marriage engenders weight gain in countries characterized by low obesity rates. By examining the relationship between marriage and BMI in Japan, this study extends research concerning the links between marriage and weight gain in three ways. It is the first investigation to assess the impact of marriage on BMI by using panel data collected in Japan, where the obesity rate is lowest among the developed countries. As indicated by data collected by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2019), at 25.4%, the percentage of overweight and obese people above 15 years in Japan is significantly less than those in the United States (71%), Mexico (72.5%), and Chile (74.2%), where the measured prevalence of these conditions is the highest among OECD countries. As with previous studies conducted in the United States, this study examines whether marriage increases BMI and the incidence of overweight or obesity in Japan. The data used in this study was taken from the Japan Household Panel Survey (JHPS). JHPS surveyed self-reported weight of the respondents every year, making it possible to calculate the BMI. Second, this study employs unconditional quantile regression (UQR) with person fixed effects to explore which parts of the BMI distribution are affected by marriage (Firpo et al. 2009; Borgen 2016). As most previous studies on this issue have used ordinary least square (OLS) and fixed effects OLS, the results have mainly been limited to illustrating the effect of marriage on the mean of BMI distribution. Hence, the effects of marriage on the upper and lower areas of BMI distribution have not been directly examined, and studies may not have properly captured variations in the effects of marriage at different points of BMI distribution. It is important to examine the varying effects of marriage on BMI distribution to more fully discern the implications of the impacts of marriage on health. A strong effect of marriage at the bottom of the BMI distribution might not threaten health. However, observing such effects at the top of the BMI distribution could indicate harmful health, and it will be necessary to consider measures to address that issue. This study attempts to clarify the varying effects of marriage across BMI distribution by using quantile regression. Third, this research focuses on measuring BMI both before and after changes in marital status. Numerous studies have examined the effects of marital status on BMI (Sobal 1991; Sobal et al. 1992; Averett et al. 2008; Averett et al. 2013); some have assessed the impacts of changes in such status (Umberson 1992; Shafer 2010; Averett et al. 2008), but limited research has been conducted on detailed investigations that compare BMI before and after marriage (Averett et al. 2008; Wilson 2012; Teachman 2016)Footnote 1. To further accumulate knowledge on this issue, this study analyzes changes in BMI over the period covering several years before and after the change of marital status. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews prevalent theories and previous studies on marriage and BMI, and Section “Current status of BMI and its change so far in Japan” demonstrates the current status of BMI and its change so far in Japan. Section “Data” describes the data used in this study. Section “Estimation methods” explains the study’s empirical strategy, Section “Results” elucidates the estimation results, and Section “Conclusion” provides concluding remarks.",3

Martinez,Ernesto Aguayo-Téllez,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Leaving the parental home is a fundamental transition related to important demographic decisions, including partnering and parenting, and labor force participation. In recent decades, co-residence with parents and the age of leaving home have changed significantly in developed countries. In many cases, due to weaker labor market conditions, increasing housing costs, and higher educational requirements, children are leaving their parents’ home later in life (Cobb-Clark, 2008; Di Stefano, 2019). In the case of developing countries, there is general consensus that intergenerational co-residence is declining in most countries as a result of economic development (Ruggles & Heggeness, 2008, p. 254), but in less developed economies, parents and their children tend to live together more often (see, e.g., Lindert, 1980; Cameron & Cobb-Clark, 2008). Living with parents may serve as a mechanism through which children, depending on their parents’ budget, might be able to obtain financial help from them to invest in their human capital (Parish & Willis, 1993) or to start their own families (Cobb-Clark, 2008).Footnote 1 On the other hand, Buck and Scott (1993) show that young adults increasingly leave the nest to get independence rather than to start a family. Becker et al. (2010) and Chiuri and Del Boca (2010) argue that staying at a parental home helps young adults to reduce income uncertainty and job insecurity. More recent literature indicates that when young adults face income risk, they are more likely to postpone long-lasting decisions, such as household formation and permanent labor market participation (Aassve et al., 2007; Gillespie, 2019). As a developing country with a large young adult population that deals with strong cultural and economic forces, Mexico represents a good case to study co-residence conditions. Although there has been no comprehensive research in Mexico about the co-residence situation of young adults and their parents, the 2010 Mexican Census shows that 67% of young adults born between 1980 and 1990 (aged 20 to 29 years) were still living with their parents. In addition, the most recent data available (2015 Mexican Inter-Census Survey) indicate that young adults born between 1980 and 1995 are the largest population group in Mexico, representing ~28 million or nearly one fourth of total population. This generation also has higher educational attainment rates when compared to other previous generations at comparable ages. In summary, and from the children’s perspective, the decision to leave or stay at the parental home relates to issues of independence, marriage, parenting, and income insurance. Consequently, the decision to remain at the parental home might depend on individual and parental characteristics, like parents’ and children’s education, income, and socioeconomic status. In addition, this decision might be related to contextual characteristics, like labor market opportunities, housing costs, cultural perceptions, and needs for independence. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to examine the determinants of adult children’s propensity to stay with their parents during their early adulthood, focusing on the young adult population in Mexico. A common limitation in the study of intergenerational decisions and transfers within the household is that most surveys provide information only at a single point in time. The use of longitudinal surveys have been helpful in some developed countries. However, in Mexico, as in most developing countries, there is no longitudinal survey large enough to provide such information. As an alternative, this paper uses the 2011 EMOVI, Social Mobility Survey, which collects socio-economic information of individuals aged 25 to 64 years and includes a series of questions regarding the socio-economic situation of their family and the characteristics of their parents when the survey respondents were 14 years old.Footnote 2 This analysis focuses on young adults 25 to 35 years old for the following two reasons. First, to exclude younger children who tend to live with their parents because they have not yet completed their formal education, and second, as noticed by Reher (1998), to exclude older children who usually live with their parents to provide care for them. As a preview of our main results, we find important differences between female and male adult children and the probability of co-residence. For young adult females, we do not find evidence of an impact of schooling or been employed on the probability of co-residence with parents. However, for young adult males, we find that age and school attendance are negatively correlated with co-residence status, while age squared, years of schooling square, and been employed are positively correlated with co-residence status. Married males are more likely to co-reside than married females, but having children reduces the likelihood of co-residence for men, although not for women. With respect to parents’ characteristics, higher levels of father’s schooling are negatively correlated with the probability of co-residence, while higher levels of mother’s schooling are positively correlated, although this is true only for young adult males. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 describes a model of living arrangements between adult children and their parents. Section 4 describes the data to be used. Section 5 outlines the econometric methodology. Section 6 presents the results, and Section 7 concludes.",3

The case of urban Zimbabwe,December 2021,Gift Dafuleya,Fiona Tregenna,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"In response to funeral expenses, which can drastically affect household consumption, many families in developing countries enter into formal and informal funeral insurance arrangements. On the one hand, theoretical work has been devoted to understanding how informal insurance arrangements are made (for instance, Bold 2009), and how households share risk under conditions of imperfect information and weak enforceability (for instance, Ligon et al. 2002). On the other hand, several studies have provided empirical assessments of the functions of informal insurance arrangements and how they operate, especially at the group level; examples include Hall (1987), Roth (2001), Thomson and Posel (2002), Dercon et al. (2006), Case et al. (2013) and LeMay-Boucher (2009). Earlier empirical work by Cochrane (1991) piloted the analysis of the effectiveness of insuring consumption against general idiosyncratic shocks under complete markets. Gertler and Gruber (2002) assess the extent to which families are able to insure consumption against illness. In a related study, De Weerdt and Fafchamps (2011) examine the extent to which insurance in the form of gifts and transfers is effective in insuring against transitory and persistent health shocks. Bold and Dercon (2004) use funeral insurance data from rural Ethiopia to model the emergence of formal mutual insurance companies under limited contract enforceability. Most of the literature on informal funeral arrangements is limited to rural areas; Fafchamps and Ferrara (2012) were among the first to analyse informal insurance in an urban milieu, in Kenya. Berg (2015) adds to the scant literature on informal insurance in urban areas by comparing funeral insurance and life insurance in South Africa. In this study, we analyse the extent to which households in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe are able to insure food consumption and household non-financial assets such as cell phones, laptops and televisions against funeral expenses immediately after the funeral and before the next income injection. Funerals represent a significant expense and major financial shock for households in our survey sample, costing on average half of annual household salary. Having financed the high funeral expenses through various sources, households typically find themselves unable to meet their daily consumption needs post-burial and before the next income injection (Foster 2007). The self-insurance literature pioneered by Deaton (1991) takes the view that assets are not something to be insured, but rather are a means by which the smoothing of consumption is achieved. This view is partly used in this paper to address how households use or dispose of assets in order to smooth consumption post-burial and before the next income injection. We also assess if funeral insurance can mitigate the sale of household non-financial assets.Footnote 1 Here, the perspective is that funeral expenses must be covered by funeral insurance and should not spill over to affect either household food consumption and/or assets. The possibility that shocks could lead to the post-burial depletion of household assets suggests a potentially large and non-temporary loss in household welfare, compared to a loss limited to the temporary disruption of food consumption. Firstly, we assess the ability of households to insure their food consumption against funeral shocks. We analyse how different types of insurance affect changes in food consumption, relative to uninsured households. We then compare how funeral expenses affect changes in food consumption for insured and non-insured households, and thus how insurance mitigates the adverse effects of funerals on food consumption post-burial and before the next income injection. Secondly, we analyse how household assets are protected against the financial shock of funerals, and also how these assets can be used to protect food consumption, especially where households own multiple of the same asset items. There is an evolving debate in the literature concerning the relevance of informal systems in social protection, from which three main arguments have emerged: Firstly, that informal mechanisms are rapidly disappearing under processes of commercialisation (Sen 1980; Moser 1998); secondly, that informal mechanisms are functioning well and that public transfers will displace them (Cox and Jimenez 1995); and thirdly, that informal mechanisms are part of preventive social protection from non-state actors (Devereux and Sabates-Wheeler 2004). This paper also connects with these debates and provides evidence mainly in support of the third argument. Extant work on risk and insurance theories typically examines the Pareto-efficient allocation of risk among households in communities (Bardhan and Udry 1999). These theories predict that, even in the absence of complete markets, poor households are able to insure perfectly against idiosyncratic shocks. However, empirical evidence from the existing literature is mixed (Cochrane 1991; Mace 1991; Hayashi et al. 1996; Kurosaki and Fafchamps 2002). Three key reasons have been advanced to explain why insurance at the community level deviates from Pareto optimality: Limited commitment (Kocherlakota 1996), asymmetric information (Thomas and Worrall 1988) and imperfect enforceability (Bold 2009). The risk-sharing literature is also related to income and consumption smoothing (see Morduch 1995). The former is most often achieved by diversifying economic activities and making conservative production or employment choices. The latter is typically associated with saving and borrowing, insuring shocks using formal and informal insurance arrangements, and depleting and accumulating non-financial assets. Most literature on informal funeral insurance is set in rural areas, and as such little is known about the insurance strategies of the urban poor in coping with idiosyncratic shocks (Fafchamps and Ferrara 2012). Yet there is a growing population of people in Africa living in the urban milieu, due to rapid urbanisation. This suggests that some of the norms and practices that used to be prevalent in rural areas are being imported to urban areas, albeit in different forms. Indeed, studies that assess the differences between rural and urban areas on social cohesion, community groups and assistance find that norms that were previously associated with rural areas are now increasingly practiced in urban areas. For instance, Mato (1993) finds that the association between receiving and giving assistance among the elderly is now higher in urban than in rural areas. Nonetheless, some studies still cite huge differences between urban and rural residents, particularly regarding social capital, which is an attribute that is associated with community groups and social cohesion (Adjaye-Gbewonyo et al. 2019). Urban populations tend to be more fluid and mobile, with a multiplicity of social and economic relationships, and typically without the same intergenerational social ties between households as in rural areas. Studying funeral insurance in an urban milieu could then add to the emerging body of empirical evidence and to these debates. The key contribution of this paper lies in our analysis of how households protect their food consumption against the effects of shocks by comparing the effectiveness of informal insurance with a combination of formal and informal insurance. Our analysis of informal insurance also contributes to the debates in the literature around non-state mechanisms of social protection. Secondly, we provide evidence on how households cope with shocks when insurance is inadequate after a burial and before the next income injection, and how preferred coping mechanisms are conditional on whether or not a household owns multiple of the same types of assets. These results imply that households that are either uninsured or not adequately insured use a hierarchy of strategies to cope with shocks. Thirdly, this paper adds to the small but growing literature on informal insurance arrangements in urban areas. This is especially germane, as a growing proportion of people in Africa live in urban settings, yet there is uncertainty about whether the same sort of community ties and social solidarity in rural areas also hold in urban areas, with implications for the effectiveness of informal insurance arrangements. Section 2 presents the data and descriptive statistics (with further details on the data collection provided in Appendix 1), as well as background on the setting of the study. Section 3 discusses the effectiveness of funeral insurance in two parts, first in smoothing consumption and second in mitigating the sale of household assets. In each assessment, the methodology is provided first, followed by the results. Section 4 concludes.",1

This achievement is partly driven by the success stories of many developing countries that have implemented universal basic education policies in recent times. In 2018, for example, gross primary school enrolment rate globally stood at 104% compared to 97% in the late nineties. Available data on sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) show that between 1996 and 2009, gross primary school enrolment rate grew by 21.4%. Despite the tremendous increase in school enrolments and attainments, the quality of education presents a new education threat, something UNESCO calls “a learning crisis”. Children should be able to read and perform basic calculations by the time they reach primary school completion age (Abadzi 2020), however, 617 million children (56%) and adolescents (44%) do not achieve the minimum proficiency levels in reading and in mathematics. This implies that one in every two children won’t be able to read or do mathematics by the time they complete primary school. The situation is more worrying in SSA, as nearly nine out of ten children aged 6-14 are unable to read or write (UNESCO 2017). Although many SSA countries have instituted Free Universal Basic Education (FCUBE), such initiatives do not guarantee the quality of education children receive. In theory, free education should reduce the private cost of schooling, create a greater freedom of school choice and increase school enrolments (Gaddah et al. 2016). However, the private cost of schooling in many parts of SSA remains substantial even after introducing free education. This is because children continue to travel long distance for classes and mostly on foot. Such long travel time presents a supply constraint and lead to poor schooling outcomes across all levels of education (Lavy 1996). Most importantly, travel time to and from school can have significant influence on children’s learning outcomes. This study tests the hypothesis that long school travel time impedes children’s learning outcomes using household data from Ghana. Specifically, we estimate the impact of school travel time on children’s ability to read and write in English, French, any of their native language as well as their ability to do written calculation. Previous studies on distance to school and children’s education have primarily focused on only enrolment and school attainments and have neglected intermediate outcomes (Lavy 1996; Tansel 1997; Grootaert and Partinos 1999; Handa 2002). While school attainment reveals long-term schooling outcomes, it masks vital information on the child’s performance in school, which is critical for the smooth progression of the child in school. Also, in a context where primary education is free, enrolment and attainment may not reveal the impact of travel time on children’s education. Apart from focusing on school enrolment and attainments, previous studies have also measured distance using community variables. As noted by Filmer (2007), estimating the average effect of school availability on outcomes would mask the heterogeneity in the relationship between distance and enrolment. This is because households within the same community vary significantly in terms of proximity, wealth and time use, which ultimately predicts children’s commuting time to school. In a study by Burke and Beegle (2004) in Northwestern Tanzania, the authors estimated the predictors of school attendance after controlling for child, household and community characteristics. Their finding was that education policies that seek to increase school attendance should focus on the drivers within the household. This suggests the heterogenous nature of households which has an implication on children’s schooling decisions and outcomes. We contribute to this important literature by using nationally representative household data from the Ghana Living Standards Survey to examine the impact of school travel time on children’s learning outcomes. More specifically, we look at how travel time affects children’s ability to read and write in English/French, their ability to read/write in the native languages as well as their ability to do written calculations. By doing so, we make a number of contributions to the literature. First, unlike previous works, we use novel household data with better learning outcome measures and more fine-grained measure of school travel distance (which are often rare in developing countries) to estimate the effect of school travel time on learning outcomes. Second, we examine outcomes which have significant impact on children’s human capital formation but have largely been ignored in the literature. In doing so, we use a better identification approach to resolve the endogeneity between school travel time and learning outcomes. Finally, we interrogate the potential channels through which school travel time affects children’s learning outcomes. The rest of the study is organised as follows: Section 2 presents a contextual background of education in Ghana, which is followed by the empirical identification approach utilised in the study in Section 3. Section 4 describes the data used for the analysis while Section 5 discusses the results. Section 6 presents more nuanced analysis and some robustness checks which is followed by the conclusion in Section 7.",8
19.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,16 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-020-09531-w,Transfer program enforcement and children’s time allocation,December 2021,Rodrigo Ceni,Gonzalo Salas,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Research in public economics has traditionally examined the effect of social welfare programs on labor supply, school attendance and home production, with emphasis on financial constraints that affect individual behavior and the role of conditionalities in the decision process. Over the last decade, there has been an increasing number of papers that analyze how enforcement impacts these decisions. This paper aims to estimate the level of enforcement related to middle and high school attendance for two Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programs and examines how this variable affects time allocation among teenagers in treated families. We develop a structural discrete choice model, in which teenagers and their parents jointly make decisions about teenagers’ time use. To estimate the model’s parameters, and in particular the enforcement levels, we use data from two programs that were designed and carried out in Uruguay over about ten years (the second program replaced the first). The existing literature on the subject recognizes the critical role that government enforcement as plays in public economies. Traditionally, decisions regarding degrees of enforcement have been made using a cost-benefit approach, as shown in the seminal contribution, Becker (1968) and the extension of Allingham and Sandmo (1972) for the particular case of tax evasion. Since Alm et al. (2009) introduced enforcement of tax compliance in a lab experiment, a significant body of research has explored which enforcement strategies work best and how these strategies generate spillovers into the whole economy, with a focus on taxes (Almeida and Carneiro 2009, 2012, Drago et al. 2015, Rincke and Traxler 2011, Slemrod 2018, Ulyssea and Ponczek 2018) and on social programs (Brollo et al. 2017). Following this literature, and also in line with the literature on social norms, enforcement levels involve not only the resources that the government invests to carry out programs, but also individual perceptions about program quality and efficiency; the related estimation has become a subject in economics literature (Acemoglu and Jackson 2017, Benabou 2011, Besley et al. 2019, Posner 1997). This paper offers a contribution to the estimation of enforcement levels by using a structural model that allows us to explore a series of counterfactual situations. We estimate enforcement parameters by fitting statistical moments related to time-use in home production as a part of the household optimization problem, and its interactions with education, work in the market, and leisure. Two consecutive Uruguayan programs allow us to examine transfer schemes with similar conditionalities, formal income, and school attendance. However, differences in the designs of the transfers—one is flat, and the other depends on the household’s composition and both focus on diverse target populations—means we can expect divergence at the level of enforcement and more heterogeneity in the households in our model. As a result, we can compare the policies. We use a unique database drawn from administrative records and surveys that enables us to access participants’ entire educational history, time in work in the market, and time in home production, at no less than two points in time over the seven years of the two CCT programs. This data set allows us to model how families make decisions about teenagers’ school attendance, their participation in the labor market, and their time spent in home production. In this case, we do not consider parents’ time, because evidence suggests that parental investments in their children drop during adolescence (Boca et al. 2019, 2013, Heckman and Carneiro 2003) as child self-investment increases (Cooper et al. 2006). We expect low levels of enforcement parameters: there is no administrative data that records households being expelled from the programs if they do not meet its conditions, there was also a publicly-advertised new control mechanism put in place in 2013. We also expect different levels of enforcement between programs because the payment design in the second program introduces intermediate bureaucratic steps once the teenager continues their education, which can enforce school conditionalities. In this paper, we also contribute theoretically and empirically to the literature in two other respects. First, the inclusion of time-use in utility formation introduces the decision made by parents and teenagers into the model; second, it includes positive utility for those who neither study nor work, especially from leisure. Time allocation among teenagers considers all possible alternative activities and parents’ participation in the decision process (Pörtner 2016). We propose a dynamic model of sequential decisions under uncertainty, based on the seminal paper of Eckstein and Wolpin (1999). In that paper, the authors develop and estimate a structural model of decisions regarding work and high school attendance, identifying who drops out and when. They find that those who work while also attending high school have lower school performance. In our paper, we theoretically consider parents and teens as making joint decisions about how teenagers will allocate their time, and we examine a group of teenagers who are at the bottom of the income distribution, a significant share of whom neither study nor work. Focusing on this group of teens, as well as on their joint decision-making process, introduces particular features into our model.Footnote 1 We also introduce skills development into the model, defined as the satisfaction that schooling gives to the child and their parents. As in Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2014), we estimate the Grade Point Average (GPA) dynamic, using it as one of the channels to understand and quantify the decision between work and schooling. Poor educational performance, i.e., low GPA, has in the past increased dropout probability (Christle et al. 2002, Alexanderand et al. 2001, Griffin 2002). In this specific process there are two types of incentives which play a determinant role: (i) individual incentives, because poor performances can generate frustration in the individual (Finn 1989) and can reduce how enjoyable it is to be in school (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner 2014) and (ii) household incentives connected to parents’ aspirations, i.e., the child’s educational performance builds parents’ incentives. Because parents perceive negative signals in relation to their offspring’s academic achievements, they reduce or stop investment in education (Mumford and Li 2012). This investment in education can operate either through the time that parents spend with their children in educational activities such as reading or homework, or in encouraging such activities (Boca et al. 2017). As in Bursztyn and Coffman (2012), we consider time use decisions to be a negotiation between generations through a weighted utility function, and this weight is increasing with the age (Lundberg et al. 2009). The decision to participate in the education system depends on both parents’ and teenagers’ utilities. When the parents’ utility is low because of poor educational performance, they can be compensated with more income if their offspring participate in the labor market. This trade-off is consistent with child labor literature, where education performance has a relevant role in parental demand for child labor (Katav-Herz 2003). In the case of teenagers, their utility depends on leisure time and the time spent in alternative activities (school attendance, work, or both). We assume that the utility from attending school depends not only on the GPA but also on completing their grade level, the number of hours in market work, and in home production. Finally, we contribute to an analysis of CCT program design; in particular, by examining the mechanisms behind levels of enforcement, the dynamics of program entry and exit, and the relevance of who in the household is the direct beneficiary of the cash transfer. Empirically, we work with a deprived group of teenagers whose families applied to receive a CCT–either the National Social Assistance Plan for Social Emergency (Plan de Asistencia Nacional a la Emergencia, hereafter PANES) or Family Allowance (Asignaciones Familiares, hereafter AFAM). Both plans include the objective of encouraging school participation, but the enforcement levels of these conditionalities are weak. Beyond the normative discussion in relation to CCTs (Pérez-Muñoz 2017), the effects of CCT programs on school enrollment and attendance have been studied over the last decade in many developing countries. Through meta-analysis, (Fiszbein and Schady 2009, Garcia and Saavedra 2017) find that the CCT programs have an overall sizeable effect on attendance, but that effect is highly heterogeneous, depending on whether children attend primary or secondary school, the amount of the transfer, the frequency of the transfer and the benchmark for receiving it. In Uruguay, Amarante et al. (2013) do not identify any effect of PANES on attendance, and the effect of AFAM on middle and high school attendance has been shown to be only minor, approximately 2% (Bergolo et al. 2016). Baird et al. (2013) study the effect of transfer programs on school enrollment, comparing CCT programs with unconditional cash transfer (UCT) programs, and within the former group of programs, they consider programs that are both enforced and unenforced by the relevant governmental agency.Footnote 2 They find that both CCTs and UCTs affect enrollment, but there are no statistically significant differences between them. Moreover, across the three groups there is a clear statistical difference between those CCT programs with explicit monitoring, and the UCTs and the CCTs with weak controls. The rationale for CCT programs operates on the basis of the decision to attend school and/or work in the market; here, we propose expanding the set of decisions to include home production and leisure time. These decisions have gained relevance in recent years because the percentage of teenagers who have dropped out of school and not entered the labor market has increased (Attanasio et al. 2010). According to the ILO (2013), in Uruguay, which in this regard is at an intermediate level in Latin America, one in five individuals ages 14 to 19 neither study nor work; half of that segment declare they do not do any specific activity during the day. This proportion is even higher among individuals in households in the first quintile of income (see Table 1). The conditionalities of CCT programs affect time use via two mechanisms. First, directly, because one of the conditions to participate in these programs is related to school attendance. Second, the programs indirectly generate behavioral changes based on a change in incentives, decreasing the household investment required to study or the opportunity cost of studying vis-à-vis labor activities, as in Katav-Herz (2003). Todd and Wolpin (2006) analyze the effect of a Mexican transfer program, PROGRESA, on child schooling and fertility. They develop a dynamic behavioral model in which first the parents, and then the teenagers, decide either to work or attend school; they also model fertility behavior in the context of a transfer program. Additionally, they perform some counterfactual policy scenarios and propose a different scheme which leads to better school performance. Attanasio et al. (2010) also use a structural model to evaluate PROGRESA in Mexico. They use a randomized experiment to assess whether the program is effective and in which respects it could be improved. Our paper goes one step further: we work with two transfer programs, and we analyze how enforcement plays a role in school participation. Finally, we also include a GPA dynamic in the model. We do expect to see changes in the decision to attend school as a consequence of greater enforcement of the conditionalities as the main findings of Baird et al. (2013). However, we do not expect the effect to be large as the amount of transfers is relatively low, and therefore insufficient to compensate a wage or the utility from home production and leisure. Specifically, in order to generate a reassignment of hours allocated to work or home production to school attendance we must focus on who receives the transfer income. In other words, we expect that, if we modify the transfer recipient, as the weight of the transfer in the utility decreases over time and, thus, in relevance, the appropriate incentives will be generated to promote the change in the behavior of the teenager. Our main results are a structural model that fits the data and illustrates the low levels of enforcement in both programs. In the policy experiments, alteration in the strength of the parameters leads to changes in teenagers’ time use toward attending middle or high school, especially among those who neither study nor work. Also, if the teenager directly receives the transfer, they significantly increase time devoted to school. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background. In section 3 we describe the databases and the main descriptive statistics. In section 4 the model is developed. In section 5 we present the main results, in section 6 we perform some policy experiments and in section 7 we discuss the results and the counterfactual experiments. Section 8 concludes.",

The marriage market effects of changing student sex ratios,December 2021,Nico Pestel,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"How does the gender composition in university affect students’ marriage market outcomes? Over the past decades, most Western societies have experienced a secular rise in the share of women attending university education (Goldin et al., 2006).Footnote 1 In some fields of study, for example medicine or law, this has substantially changed the student sex ratio. While until the 1970s, men were a majority among students in these fields, they became a minority in the 2000s. Given that students frequently meet classmates of similar age and ability right before marrying age, it is possible that this shift in student sex ratios has affected the marriage market (Blossfeld and Timm, 2003).Footnote 2 A higher share of women in university means that more women are competing for fewer men, which may change the search behavior of both genders. Imbalanced sex ratios typically favor the scarcer gender because of reduced partner search costs and increased bargaining power. Marriage market conditions, in turn, may affect labor force participation and working hours of women (Grossbard-Shechtman and Neideffer, 1997, Grossbard and Granger, 1998). In this paper, I investigate how secular changes in the student sex ratio within fields of study affect the couple formation and marriage prospects of male and female university graduates using data from Germany. Different from the U.S., university teaching as well as students’ social environment in Germany are traditionally strongly segmented by fields of study. Almost 90% of German university students do not reside on campus, making it more unlikely to closely interact with students from other fields of study.Footnote 3 In addition, German universities are typically scattered across university cities instead of being concentrated at a single campus. Hence, departments of different disciplines, including teaching facilities, are usually located in different places within a city. Therefore, in this setting the field-specific gender composition of students should capture the frequency of meeting a potential spouse during education. In the empirical analysis, I use aggregate information on the student sex ratio for (West) Germany broken down by 41 detailed fields of study over the period from 1977 to 2011. The field-by-year data is matched with data from the German Microcensus waves from 2003 to 2011. Over this period, the Microcensus contains individual information on the year of graduation as well as the exact field of study for more than 30 cohorts of university graduates. This allows me to exploit variation in the field-specific student sex ratio at the time of graduation to estimate its effect on individual marriage market outcomes such as the marital status, spouses’ educational attainment and field of study as well as occupation and industry. The main identification strategy employs field of study fixed effects capturing any unobserved field-specific and time-invariant characteristics of students enrolled in a given field. Thus, variation in the gender composition comes from within fields over time. The comparison underlying the regression analysis can be illustrated as follows. A female university student enrolled in a field with a generally high share of men (e.g., a field in Engineering) in the 1970s, when the female share of students was particularly low, encounters male students very frequently during her education. Obviously, the opposite is true for male students enrolled in Engineering fields who will have to direct marital search outside their field of study or even outside the university environment in order to find a spouse. While the female student share in Engineering is still rather low in the 2000s, a relative increase since the 1970s implies that for female Engineering students the frequency of meeting male students is nowadays relatively lower compared to older cohorts holding any specific characteristics of women choosing Engineering constant. However, the identification of causal effects of the student gender composition by field of study on marriage market outcomes may still raise concerns of endogenous self-selection into fields driven by marriage market considerations. Students who are mainly interested in finding a university-educated spouse may deliberately choose fields where the own gender is relatively scarce. In that case, the resulting sex ratio would result from preferences for specific marriage market outcomes and reverse causality would be an issue.Footnote 4 To address this concern, I restrict the sample to admission-restricted fields in a robustness analysis. Enrolling in such a field is costly for students due to “waiting semesters” before actual admission, making it much more likely that the motivation for choosing a restricted field is primarily driven by labor market considerations. In addition, the student sex ratio within a field may be correlated with characteristics of its graduates which are expected to affect marriage market outcomes. For example, one may be worried about omitted variable bias resulting from the fact that graduates from a field with a high male share tend to earn higher salaries relative to graduates from female-dominated fields. These concerns are addressed by the field fixed effects strategy, as long as unobserved characteristics are time-invariant, as well as by the inclusion of time-varying controls for a field’s graduates’ average income and occupational prestige. The results of this paper show that the student sex ratio by field of study at graduation significantly affects marriage market outcomes for students with distinct gender differences. First, a higher share of female students reduces marriage market opportunities for women. Female graduates are more likely to remain single and are less often married when women outnumber men in their field. For men, I find the exact opposite result. Surprisingly, a higher male share in the field increases the probability of being married for male students. Second, the student sex ratio significantly affects the composition of couples. Women who graduate from a predominately female field are less likely to have a partner from the same field than having a lower educated spouse. At the same time, when men are more numerous in their field of study, male students are more likely to “marry down” with respect to educational status. These results indicate that men’s partner search is more likely to be outside the peer group at university when the student male share is high while women tend to search primarily within the field or at least within the university environment more generally. This interpretation is supported by additional results showing that for female graduates the spouse’s graduation year is more likely to be very close when the student female share is lower. For men, a higher field-specific share of males increases the probability of having a partner working in the same industry but reduces the probability of the spouse working in the same occupation. This means that the student sex ratio is of great importance for marriage market opportunities for university-educated women while the work environment after graduation appears to be of additional relevance for men performing “partner search on the job” (McKinnish, 2007). Previous studies on the effects of imbalanced sex ratios on marriage and labor market outcomes (see, e.g., Grossbard-Shechtman and Neideffer, 1997, Grossbard and Granger, 1998) have used segmentations of marriage markets by region, ethnicity or socio-economic status, especially the level of education.Footnote 5 Defining separate marriage markets for high- and low-educated individuals requires the implicit assumption that both men and women prefer spouses from the same educational class. This neglects potential heterogeneity in the preferences for same-education spouses. Indeed, in a closely related paper using occupation-specific sex ratios, Mansour and McKinnish (2018) show that disproportionate rates of within-occupation matching of couples are rather due to lower search costs within the workplace environment than preferences for a same-occupation spouse. This paper contributes to the literature by showing that the marriage market effects stemming from variation in the student sex ratio by detailed fields of study are gender-specific. The results indicate that marriage market opportunities of female graduates are more sensitive to the gender composition of students during education since they are more likely to search within the university environment. At the same time, men’s potential partner search pool additionally expands to spouses with a lower level of education. Additionally, these results are consistent with findings from the literature on social norms regarding relative income within couple households, typically stipulating that the husband should be the main earner in the household. The finding that university-educated women are more likely to be married to a same-education spouse while men are more likely to “marry down” when the own gender is relatively scarce within the field is in line with these gender identity norms.Footnote 6 In the context of this study, an increase in the female share of students reduces women’s frequency of meeting men with the same level of education. Consequently, the chances of finding a spouse with the same or even higher earnings potential are more limited, making couple formation in line with gender identity norms more difficult and, hence, less likely.Footnote 7 In addition, gender compositions in educational settings more generally may have other impacts beyond direct effects on marriage market prospects, in particular students’ job choices and labor market outcomes. For example, gender composition in high school or during university education may affect major choice and labor market outcomes, such as earnings growth later on (Anelli and Peri, 2017, Zölitz and Feld, 2020). Also, the gender composition between elementary and high school education affects cognitive outcomes (Lavy and Schlosser, 2011). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data. The empirical strategy and the results are presented in section 3. Section 4 concludes.",3
19.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,13 April 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-021-09558-7,Do women face a glass ceiling at home? The division of household labor among dual-earner couples,December 2021,Tomáš Lichard,Filip Pertold,Samuel Škoda,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Over many decades, numerous Western countries, including the US, have progressed towards substantial convergence in labor market outcomes for men and women, including educational attainment and labor market attachment. This has translated into a higher share of dual-earner couples and couples where women earn more than their partners. In the US, the share of couples where the wife is the higher earner increased from 20 to 30 percent from 1990 to 2015, and, it increased from 16 to 24 percent from 2005 to 2015 in Europe.Footnote 1 Despite the increasing share of mixed-gender dual-earner couples, aggregate time use statistics show only very small changes in the division of unpaid work. According to the American Time Use Survey, US women spent about 40 percent more time on household work than men in 2015 (about the same as in 2003), even though the raw gender pay gap has decreased (Blau & Kahn, 2017). Time use statistics in Europe show that high-income married and cohabiting women undertake twice as much household work as single women, at least in southern countries (Borra et al., 2017). Moreover, according to the 2008–2009 European Values Study, approximately 51% of respondents in Western Europe agreed strongly that men should take equal responsibility with women for the home and children, compared to 32% in Southern Europe.Footnote 2 These statistics point to the potentially important role of gender norms and their long-term connection to the division of household work within households. The origins of as well as the decrease in gender gaps have traditionally been attributed to technology (see Alesina, Giuliano & Nunn, 2011, 2013 on the origins of gender roles, and Greenwood, Seshadri & Yorukoglu, 2005; de V. Cavalcanti & Tavares, 2008 on how new home production technologies allowed women to increase their labor force participation). They have also been attributed to a decreasing prevalence of statistical discrimination (Kleven, Landais & Søgaard, 2019), and decreasing costs of services to households (Cortés & Pan, 2019). The inability of these factors to fully account for the persistence of the gender pay gap has led to an increased focus on the role of social norms in explaining economic outcomes. Values and beliefs have been shown to change very slowly and to have significant long-term effects on societies.Footnote 3 Recent works (Bertrand, Kamenica & Pan, 2015, Ichino et al., 2019) analyze gender norms in relation to the distribution of income, labor supply and sickness absence, respectively. Sevilla-Sanz, Gimenez-Nadal and Fernández (2010), Garcia Roman & Cortina (2016), and Álvarez & Miles-Touya (2019) employ Spanish time use surveys to show that the hours women spend on household work stop decreasing with their wages when they start earning more than their husbands. In this paper, we estimate the elasticity of substitution between male and female labor in home production with respect to within-couple relative hourly wages, focusing in particular on the differences between Western and Southern Europe and inter-household heterogeneity. Although many previous studies have estimated gender elasticities in market production, estimates of elasticity in home production between male and female labor are much less common. Most estimates of the elasticity of gender substitution in market work are rather high, exceeding two (Acemoglu, Autor & Lyle, 2004; Hamermesh, 1996; Johnson & Keane, 2013; Weinberg, 2000). However, Ichino et al. (2019) estimate microeconomic elasticity of labor between men and women in home production at 0.8. In one example of a macroeconomic study, Knowles (2012) considers this elasticity to be approximately three for the US. Our contribution to the literature is as follows: First, we estimate elasticities in home production between male and female labor and compare them across different European regions with different social norms. In order to remove the endogeneity caused by assortative mating, we construct distributions of relative within-couple wages based on a Bartik-style instrument that isolates the exogenous variation in the within-couple relative hourly wages.Footnote 4 This variation is plausibly unrelated to the factors that directly affect the marriage market in a given country.Footnote 5 More precisely, we predict wages within a gender-specific cell defined by age, education, and country using hourly wages in the same cell in other countries weighted by the lagged industrial structure of employment. wages predicted in this way are then used to construct within-couple relative wages for a given couple. By predicting wages separately for both genders, we decrease the endogenous variation caused by assortative mating in a given marriage market.Footnote 6 Further, to directly test whether social norms are the main driving force of our results we use several questions from the 2008–2009 European Values Study (EVS, 2016) to classify households into two groups, based on their view of gender roles (either more traditional or more progressive), and compare the elasticity of substitution. Lastly, we observe how many hours per week children spend in a childcare facility, which allows us to compare households with children who receive care outside the household across different regions, and examine their elasticities. We show that the elasticity of substitution of male and female labor in household work with respect to their relative within-couple wages is much lower (essentially zero) in Southern Europe than in Western Europe (approximately 0.1, but statistically different from zero). Furthermore, we show that available childcare services most likely do not drive the results. In particular, women in the South also spend more hours per week working in the home compared to women in the West, conditional on the hours per week children spend in formal care. On the other hand, when we compare progressive and traditional couples, we obtain results that are qualitatively similar to those of our regional comparison of Southern and Western Europe. It should, however, be stressed that our estimates are small, even for Western Europe. We argue that the limited opportunity for women to adjust hours spent on household work may effectively be a “glass ceiling”, hindering high-skilled women’s progress in occupations that disproportionally reward long working hours. Our evidence fits the existing theories that women and men have a traditional division in spheres of responsibility (Lundberg & Pollak, 1996). In a British study, Pahl (1983) documented that husbands were often in charge of moving, finances, and the car, while wives made decisions regarding interior decoration, food, and children’s clothing. These tasks may differ in how easy it is to outsource them. Couples, and the individual partners themselves as well, may also derive different utility from doing household tasks. Secondly, multiple authors, including economists, point to other types of norms that stem from the perception that women should do more household work than their male partners. According to the “doing gender” hypothesis, women who are successful in their careers and spend long hours on the labor market, thus deviating from the “male bread-winner” norm, may react by overplaying their feminine role by increasing the number of household work hours (West & Zimmerman, 1987; Lippmann & Georgieff, 2020). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the descriptive statistics. Section 3 explains the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the main results, while alternative explanations are discussed in Section 5. We conclude in Section 6.",1

Unlike shifting cultivation, which is very labour intensive but requires no special physical characteristics, plough cultivation is in fact less labour intensive but requires “upper body strength, grip strength, and bursts of power” which are more likely to be found in men than in women. That gives the former a comparative advantage over the latter in agricultural production. The first of the two articles cited reports that European and US residents descending from populations who used the plough in their countries of origin display still today, in their country of destination, less equal gender attitudes than the descendants of populations who did not have that experience. That is amazing. Why is the legacy of the plough still felt after countless other innovations have drastically reduced the importance of physical characteristics in the determination of individual productivity, and the share of the population employed in the agricultural sector? And why was this legacy not lost when migration offered the descendants of ancient plough users the opportunity to marry outside their ethnic group? The often heard argument that women are genetically programmed to enjoy raising children more than men do is irrelevant in the present context, because it should apply to everybody, not just to the descendants of ancient plough users. Another often heard argument is that men took advantage of the power achieved when physical strength mattered to indulge their taste for discriminating against women. The problem with this argument is that discrimination has an efficiency cost (Becker (1957)), and that the cost of discriminating against women rises as technological progress increases the importance of education vis-a-vis physical characteristics. In the present paper we use a simple economic model of marriage and household decisions where men and women are matched by their potential incomes as singles, and then Nash-bargain the allocation of their joint time and money endowments. Parents have no gender preferences. We show that, so long as utility depends only on the agent’s consumption of a private good, and on a domestically produced public good reflecting the quality (of life) of the couple’s children, then, in equilibrium, the higher-wage spouse will specialize in income production, the lower-wage one will specialize in domestic activities, and the two will consume the same amount of the private good. There is a potential hold-up problem however. The lower paid spouse will not agree to give up paid work unless the equilibrium is enshrined in an enforceable pre-marital contract or, failing that, the better paid spouse compensates her or him at front (before the children are born, and resources expended on them). The latter may not be possible because the more productive spouse’s initial endowment of the private good may not be large enough. The former may be prohibitively expensive if the enforcement can only be done by legal means. The problem does not arise in a primitive agrarian economy where the plough is not available, because efficiency does not require specialization. It may arise in one where the plough gives men a comparative advantage over women in agricultural production. In the traditional societies that we usually associate with primitive agrarian economies, however, a pre-marital contract is costlessly implemented, if it is in everybody’s interest that it should, by the threat of extra-legal sanctions at the hands or with approval of the local community. So long as education does not yield direct utility, children will not get one in a primitive economy where productivity is independent of education, but this may change with emigration to a modern industrial economy where education raises the probability of getting a high wage rate. We show that, in the destination country, the descendants of ancient farmers who never experienced the plough will give their daughters as much education as their sons. By contrast, under certain conditions, the descendants of ancient plough users have an interest in marrying among themselves (practicing homogamy) and investing in their sons, but not in their daughters’ education. The story changes somewhat if individuals derive direct utility also from a luxury good like time spent with children, because an NB equilibrium may then involve little or no specialization, and there may thus be no need for advance compensation. As more and more individuals become rich enough to want these goods, fewer and fewer of them will then practice homogamy and specialize on gender lines.",2

20.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,30 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-021-09589-0,"Perspectives article: income inequality, health, and household welfare",March 2022,Alan C. Monheit,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the late 1970s, the United States has experienced a profound growth in income inequality. The growing disparity in incomes between those in the top percentiles of the household income distribution and those below began in the late 1970s, and now rivals the unequal distribution of income during the Gilded Age of the late nineteenth century and the decade prior to the Great Depression. As of 2018, the top 1% of households accounted for 22% of income, more than double their 9% share in 1979 (Saez, 2020). Income inequality in the United States also stands apart from that of many high-income developed nations (Peterson Institute 2020). For example, income inequality in 2018 as measured by the Gini coefficient (values between zero and one with larger values indicating greater inequality) is 0.390 for the United States, compared to 0.366 for the United Kingdom, 0.334 for Japan, and only 0.303 for Canada, 0.301 for France, 0.289 for Germany, and 0.280 for Sweden (OECD 2021). Moreover, the U.S. income distribution now resembles that of countries in the developing world (Horowitz et al., 2020). Add to this the growth in wealth inequality, where the top 0.1 percent of wealth holders now control 20% of the nation’s wealth compared to only 10% 40 years ago. All told, households in the upper percentiles of the income distribution hold a distinct economic advantage over other households. In seeking to identify factors responsible for the dramatic shift in the US income distribution, analysts have focused on a number of macroeconomic trends: the stark departure of wages from worker productivity since the mid-1970s; the decline in labor union membership and political influence; the stagnation of real wages and the limited growth in the federal minimum wage; and the effort by rent-seeking employers to maximize shareholder value. The latter behavior has arguably contributed to the growing gap between the earnings of CEOs and wage earners. It also has yielded tenuous employment relationships, as reflected in the growth of the temporary and contingent workforce, and compromised the private safety net of pensions and health insurance. Additional factors contributing to the growth in inequality include skill-based technical change that has made many lower-educated workers redundant, and globalization which has resulted in outsourcing of production and competition from low-wage foreign workers. From a political economy perspective, concern also has been raised that the increased concentration of household income at the top percentiles of the income distribution has resulted in their growing political power and influence (Case & Deaton, 2020; Stiglitz, 2012). As noted by Truesdale and Jencks (2016) and other authors, the policy preferences of those in the top deciles may restrict investment and access to public goods that provide health benefits and may also result in an erosion of social capital. Additionally, the increasing concentration of productive activity within industries has compromised competition in product and labor markets with important implications for product prices, wages, and employment (Philippon, 2019). Finally, these macroeconomic factors have also challenged economists’ focus on economic growth as an antidote for economic disadvantage and have directed attention to policies to address the issue of income inequality. While the macroeconomic trends noted above have dominated discussions of the underlying causes of growing income inequality and the search for policy solutions, attention also has been directed to the microeconomic implications of income inequality for household wellbeing. In this regard, one important question that has emerged is whether growing income inequality per se has implications for the health of household members. As I discuss below, this has become a controversial issue with some researchers citing evidence of a strong causal relationship between inequality and health, and others questioning whether such a relationship can impart any information regarding causality. Underlying this issue is the question of whether one can identify the precise mechanism through which income inequality leads to disparities in health. Finally, the relationship between income inequality and health has become particularly salient in light of the COVID19 pandemic that has left those in the lower percentiles of the income distribution particularly vulnerable to the disease. As Querishi (2020) notes, the costs of COVID have been borne disproportionately by the poor who are more likely to be exposed to the health risks of COVID, and are more likely to experience employment losses and overall declines in well-being. In this way, the pandemic is also contributing to greater inequality. Thus, the relationship between income inequality and health has raised important issues of equity and social justice. In this paper, I focus on some main currents regarding the relationship between income inequality and health that have emerged from the literature and draw implications for household welfare. In doing so, I draw upon work in the area conducted by economists, epidemiologists, and sociologists. Rather than provide a comprehensive review of the voluminous literature that already exists on this issue (see for example the reviews by Wagstaff & van Doorslaer, 2000; Deaton, 2003; Lynch et al., 2004; O’Donnell et al., 2015; Truesdale & Jencks, 2016), I highlight some of the assertions and evidence in support of this relationship and the reaction by other researchers who have questioned its validity. In doing so, I note the difference in support for the income inequality – health relationship, with health economists questioning the causality underlying the relationship, while epidemiologists and sociologists lending support for this relationship. Finally, I also note that much of the research regarding income inequality and health has focused on life expectancy and mortality as measures of health outcomes, with comparatively fewer analyses considering other less aggregated measures of health status. The plan of this review is as follows. I begin by outlining a simple graphical representation of the relationship between income and health and use this to motivate several key questions regarding the validity of this relationship, including the important question about causality. Next, I review work that has examined how income inequality can affect health, identifying the social and biological pathways through which this relationship may operate. I then turn to the criticism of the income inequality – health relationship, empirical approaches that have sought to identify this relationship, and then to the implications of this relationship for public policy and household welfare.",

For how many of the past 30 days was your physical health not good? …your mental health not good? Q2. On how many of the past seven days did you engage in vigorous exercise? …moderate exercise? Q3. On how many of the past 30 days did you smoke cigarettes? …use electronic vapor products? …use smokeless tobacco? Q4: Over the last two weeks how often have you been bothered by problems of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? …little interest or pleasure in doing things? Responses to questions like these reveal the distribution of those particular health indicators but do not reveal the distribution of related and possibly welfare-relevant outcomes like: O1. the number of days on which neither physical nor mental health was good O2. the number of days on which some exercise was undertaken O3. the number of days on which some tobacco-related substance was used O4. the number of days on which symptoms of depression were not experienced That is, the outcome data are only partially observed in the sense that the specific day-by-day joint distribution of the vector of outcomes is not revealed by responses to questions like Q1-Q4. Yet it is possible to bound informatively features of distributions of outcomes like O1-O4 as well as partial effects of covariates thereon. The paper demonstrates how such bounds can be derived from responses to questions like Q1-Q4 when the responses to Q1-Q4 are themselves either fully (Sections 2–4) or partially (Section 5) observed. The paper is motivated by questions where multiple health outcomes may occur over multiple time units but its approach is generally applicable. Generically each of N ≥ 2 units may experience any of M ≥ 2 binary events. The data do not reveal whether a particular event m occurs for any particular unit n, but the total number of each of the M events across the N units is known. The outcome of interest is whether a typical unit experiences any event; the goal is to learn features of the distribution of the number of units experiencing any event. While they cannot be learned from the data, these probabilities can in general be bounded informatively. Among the reasons such information may be useful is that it permits one to understand what shares of fixed time budgets are devoted to various health-producing activities or—in the context of Grossman’s healthy-time framework (Grossman, 1972)—how much of individuals’ time endowments are spent in a healthy or unhealthy state. When available data are not directly informative about such questions—often owing to the manner in which survey questions are structured—the data may still be used to provide bounds on such quantities of interest. It should be emphasized that Q1-Q4 are examples from a much broader field of empirical time-use inquiry wherein information on particular forms of time use may be observed but where information on the overlap or simultaneity of such uses—“multitasking,” in some contexts—is absent. For example, contrast the survey-based time-use information available in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth with the diary-based time-use information available in the American Time Use Surveys. (See Hamermesh, 2016, for a concise survey.) In what follows Section 2 provides the formal structure and main results, Section 3 illustrates these with two microdata samples, Section 4 derives bounds on corresponding partial effects, Section 5 considers “set-measured” cases with categorical responses, and Section 6 summarizes.",

Jolly,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper analyzes the effect job displacement has on the health of a worker’s spouse. Studying this topic provides insight into the total costs associated with worker displacement, which is of importance when designing efficient policies aimed at helping displaced workers and their families. The effects of worker displacement spill over to other family members, through an increase in spousal labor supply (Stephens 2002), reduced school performance of children (Rege et al. 2011), and less access to employer-sponsored health insurance (Jolly and Phelan 2015). Therefore, the costs of displacement extend well beyond the lost earnings associated with any resulting unemployment or the elimination of firm- or industry-specific human capital. The findings presented here will provide evidence on another familial cost of worker displacement, the physical and mental health of the affected worker’s spouse. Most of the research on job displacement focuses on the labor market effects associated with this type of involuntary job loss. Research shows that displaced workers experience large, sustained earnings losses (e.g., Jacobson et al. 1993; Couch and Placzek 2010) and short-run increases in employment instability (Ruhm 1991; Sullivan and von Wachter 2007). Displacement is also associated with an increased probability of involuntarily holding a part-time or temporary job (Farber 1999, 2013). Workers who suffer from this type of job loss also experience a decrease in the likelihood of receiving employer-provided fringe benefits, such as life insurance, dental insurance, retirement benefits, paid sick leave, and employer-sponsored training (Jolly and Phelan 2015), which supports the notion that displaced individuals find re-employment with lower quality jobs/employers (Farber and Levy 2000). Given the stress involved with adjusting to earnings and employment instability, it is unsurprising that earlier literature finds that displacement negatively effects health behavior and health outcomes. Job loss is associated with moderate increases in alcohol and cigarette consumption (Gallo et al. 2001; Falba et al. 2005; Black et al. 2015) and an increased risk of hospitalization due to alcohol-related conditions (Eliason and Storrie 2009a). Displacement increases the likelihood of individuals reporting their physical and mental health status as fair or poor (Schaller and Stevens 2015), and workers experiencing job loss are more likely to develop new health conditions such as hypertension and heart disease (Strully 2009). For older workers, displacement is associated with an increased probability of heart attack and stroke (Gallo et al. 2006). Results from the literature suggest that job loss leads to increases in mortality (Sullivan and von Wachter 2009; Couch et al. 2013), particularly mortality caused by alcohol-related illnesses and suicide (Eliason and Storrie 2009b; Browing and Heinesen 2012). It is reasonable to expect that the financial strain brought on by the involuntary loss of employment would increase stress levels among all members of the family. These increased stress levels might reduce the overall mental well-being of the displaced worker’s spouse. In fact, Bunnings et al. (2017) show that the fear of one spouse becoming unemployed reduces the mental well-being of both partners due to the potential increases in financial instability associated with job loss. Furthermore, to deal with income losses, displaced workers’ spouses increase their labor supply, and this increase is, on average, not large enough to offset the lost earnings of the displaced partner (Stephens 2002). The potential disutility associated with increased labor supply may further reduce mental well-being. Beyond financial instability, job loss results in the erosion of non-pecuniary benefits associated with employment, such as social status, identity, etc., and loss of social status could also lead to reductions in the mental well-being of the affected worker’s partner (Marcus 2013). Spouses must also cope with, and adjust to, the lower physical and mental health of their displaced partners, and research suggests mental-health spillovers across spouses exist (Siegel et al. 2003; Bubonya et al. 2017). Finally, reductions in mental well-being may alter behavior, such as smoking, consuming alcohol, and eating less-nutritious food, that negatively affects physical health. Therefore, involuntary job loss of one partner may reduce not only the mental health, but also the physical health of both individuals. Using the 1999 through 2015 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the analysis follows a sample of married couples and compares various health measures of the spouses of displaced workers to those of the spouses of non-displaced individuals. Results show that wives of the displaced experience a significant increase in the probability of reporting their overall physical health status as fair or poor relative to the wives of non-displaced husbands. In terms of specific health conditions, wives of the displaced are more likely to experience high blood pressure that is severe enough to limit them in their normal daily activities. Earlier studies have not found an effect of spousal job loss on physical health measures. Wives of the displaced also experience reduced mental well-being and are more likely to have a doctor diagnosis them with emotional/psychiatric issues. The evidence suggests that wives who are in poor health, low financial standing, not working, and have children living at home prior to the husbands’ job loss drive the results. For husbands, however, there is little evidence suggesting that spousal job loss leads to an increased likelihood of reporting fair or poor physical health, high blood pressure, heart disease, or emotional/psychiatric issues. The rest of the paper proceeds by discussing the related literature in Section II and the data and empirical methodology in Section III. The paper presents results in Section IV and offers concluding remarks in Section V.",1

Since care- and housework in one’s own home is largely unpaid, it is unclear how to measure the economic value of this work. To understand the economics of the household, though, it is important to understand better the economic value of the work produced within it. The literature quantifying the worth of house- and care workFootnote 1 assigns a value to the number of hours spent in this work (most commonly calculated using time-use surveys) in one of three main ways. On the one hand, there are two “input” methods: the opportunity cost approach and the market replacement cost approach. On the other hand, there is an “output” method. The first of these three – the opportunity cost approach – assumes that time spent on unpaid work is at the expense of earning a market wage. Many calculations of opportunity costs simply use an average wage rate of all employed people (Ahmad & Koh, 2011); others estimate a potential wage rate even for people outside the paid labor force (Gammage, 2010; Schmid et al., 1999). The second approach – the market replacement approach – imputes wages that reflect the market price of the respective tasks, using either the average wage rate of a general housekeeper (Ahmad & Koh, 2011; Varjonen et al., 2014) or including multiple wage rates of specialists in matched occupations (Hamdad, 2003; Landefeld et al., 2005). Sometimes, calculations with minimum wages for these tasks are included to provide lower-bound estimates (Landefeld et al., 2005). Some studies using the market replacement approach also account for the intensity of care (e.g. physical and development care) and incorporate supervisory care (Suh & Folbre, 2016; Mullan, 2010). Finally, the output approach quantifies the value of the output of unpaid work, measuring the service price of, for example, a kilogram of washing or ironing (Holloway et al., 2002), or a child taken care of (Mullan, 2010; Yoon, 2014). In practice, many studies in the literature calculate a value of unpaid work using more than just one of these methods, providing instead a battery of potential wage rates in order to give a range of estimates for the value of domestic and care work. The fact that many studies report values calculated with several different approaches speaks to the lack of any “best” practice in this literature. In considering how to better and consistently quantify the value of unpaid house- and care work, we propose a new approach to introduce more precision into wage estimates in the specialist replacement cost method. In particular, we use the wages demanded for housework and childcare on actual online platforms to get the market price of the work performed, disaggregated by region at the NUTS-2 level. We then apply these values to region-specific time-use statistics to compute the aggregate value of the work. The use of online platforms to organize work has become increasingly prevalent (see, for example, Katz and Krueger (2019) and Kässi and Lehdonvirta (2018)), not least to match households with babysitters and cleaners. Our approach thus allows the literature to keep up with the changing nature of the organization and payment for this work. National accounting offices, who are already working to supplement GDP measures with satellite accounts (European Communities, 2003), can find our approach particularly useful. In relation to other literature on this topic, we consider our approach to fit into the specialist framework, in that we assume that it is specialists who offer childcare and cleaning services on online platforms. Table 1 shows that there are varying degrees of “specialization” among the workers on the platforms we use; those with more years of experience also demand higher wages. The benefits of the calculation method described here are five-fold. First, our approach does not rely on hypothetical considerations about the value of the worker’s time to measure an opportunity cost of doing the work, estimates of which differ widely based on education, professional experience, and socioeconomic background (Schmid et al., 1999). Instead, our approach takes the value of the work to be the market value that the worker herself demands. Second, our approach uses relatively local wage rates (NUTS-2 level), meaning that the application of our method would produce more accurate local estimates of the value of household and care work. Third, the approach avoids applying a minimum wage to a job that may actually receive higher remuneration, making it more accurate. Fourth, the wage data are reported per hour, unlike in labor force surveys, where hourly wage data are often imprecisely computed because they are calculated using other variables such as yearly income, hours worked per week, and weeks worked per year. Finally, our approach uses free and real-time data on wages paid, instead of relying on this information from labor force surveys. The latter are costly in terms of time as well as money and their publication typically has a long delay after data collection. Researchers can use our method in any country that collects time-use data and in which there are platforms organizing these services. In the next section, we show an application of our method with the wage data collected from online platforms. We estimate the aggregated value of typically unpaid work by applying wage rates to time-use data from the same region.",3
20.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,08 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-020-09527-6,On the measurement of non-random mating and of its change over time,March 2022,Jacques Silber,Sasiwimon Warunsiri Paweenawat,Lusi Liao,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The study of assortative mating is in a way quite similar to that of inter- or intra-generational mobility or rather immobility. In the case of inter-generational educational mobility, for example, one often analyzes the features of a matrix whose lines correspond to the educational attainment of the parents and the columns to those of the children. There are then two possibilities to measure the extent of inter-generational mobility (see, Fields and Ok 1999; Fields 2008). Either one adopts a “movement approach” so that if all the observations are on the diagonal (we assume, for simplicity that the educational categories are the same for the parents and the children), mobility will be nil. Or one takes a “time independence” approach and assumes that a perfectly mobile society is a society in which the probability of having a specific educational level is independent of that of one’s parents, so that the rows of this matrix, which reflect conditional probabilities, would be identical. The same two approaches may be taken to analyze the extent of assortative mating. We can first say that there is perfect assortative mating when each man is matched with a woman with the same socio-economic characteristics, like the same educational level. Assuming the educational categories are the same for husbands and wives, we will conclude in such a case that the further away the observations are from the diagonal of the matrix of the spouses educational levels, the less assortative mating there is. One can then use various measures to measure the extent of such “movement”, like the mobility indices proposed by Prais (1955) and Bibby (1975, 1980). But, as indicated previously, there is another possible approach to measuring non assortative mating, one where one compares the actual probability for a man with characteristic i to get married a woman with characteristic j, with what this probability would have been, had there been complete independence between the characteristics of the men and those of the women. If, for instance, the characteristics are the educational levels, the latter probability would be equal to the product of the share among males of those with educational level i times the share among females of those with education level j. It is this product that should be compared with the actual share (nij/∑i∑jnij) in the total number of couples nij where the husband has educational level i and the wife educational level j. To draw general conclusions for the population concerning the extent of assortative mating, one evidently has to take into account all the levels of education i and j. But a second issue has to be taken into account. It concerns the impact of changes over time in the educational composition of the male and female populations. An increase or decrease in the percentage of spouses having the same level of education does not necessary imply that there was an increase or decrease in what we could call “pure assortative mating”, because such changes may be mainly the consequence of variations in the educational composition of the male and female populations. It should be clear, for example, that if there was over time a significant increase in the share of women with a high level of education, such a change is likely to increase the probability that males with a high level of education will get married to females with a high level of education. We therefore argue that a “pure measure of assortative mating” should neutralize such a variation over time in the educational composition of the male and female populations and we propose a technique allowing such a neutralization. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shortly summarizes the literature on assortative mating. Section 3 explains our approach to the measurement of assortative mating, stressing the need to make a distinction between actual and expected assortative mating. Section 4 then describes the database and the marriage market in Thailand, the country for which we give an empirical illustration. Section 5 presents empirical results for Thailand for the period 1985–2019. Section 6 describes the methodology allowing us to decompose the change over time in assortative mating into a component related to variations over time in the educational composition of the male and female populations and a component assumed to represent the impact of a “pure change” in assortative mating. An illustration of this methodology is then given, based again on data for Thailand and comparing the degree of assortative mating in 1985 and in 2019. Concluding comments are given in Section 7.",

20.0,1.0,Review of Economics of the Household,17 September 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-020-09506-x,"Unlucky at work, unlucky in love: job loss and marital stability",March 2022,Carina Keldenich,Christine Luecke,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"This paper analyses the relationship between the job loss of the husband and marital stability, focusing on the potential for heterogeneous results depending on whether a new job is found. Both job loss and marital dissolution are major life events, which can have profound impacts on many aspects of an individual’s life such as social contacts, expected lifetime earnings and self-image (Hill 1958; McGrath 1976). In addition to being of general interest due to the significance of these events for the individual and their family, studying the causes of divorce in economics and improving our understanding of the processes leading to separation is important for several reasons. Firstly, divorce may have a direct negative impact on welfare. Since divorce is voluntary, this proposition may appear surprising. After all, Becker et al. (1977) argue in their seminal paper that a couple “would separate if, and only if, their combined wealth from remaining married were expected to be less than their combined wealth when separated” (p. 1144). However, this result hinges on some crucial assumptions such as transferrable utility. It has been shown that inefficient divorces may occur under certain circumstances (Browning et al. 2014, chapter 6.5, and the literature mentioned therein), such as in the presence of household public goods under no-fault divorce laws (see e.g. Zelder 1993). Divorce may also be inefficient due to the presence of negative spillover effects, e.g. on children, who are not an active part in the decision-making process (see e.g. the meta-analysis by Amato 2001). Furthermore, individuals may also suffer from biases in their affective forecasting such as impact or projection bias (see e.g. Wilson and Gilbert 2003, for a review article on affective forecasting) or fail to anticipate long-term negative consequences more generally. Secondly, many empirical studies investigate the influence of a variety of shocks on outcomes of couples. However, frequently the sample is restricted to those couples remaining together, thereby neglecting the possibility that couples may have separated due to the impetus to be investigated. As Charles and Stephens (2004) have argued before, this may lead to biased estimates if the impact on those who separated differs from the impact on those who remained together. Thirdly, in addition to being a potential negative consequence in itself, an increase in the divorce probability might serve as an indicator for a variety of struggles within the family brought about by job loss. In this sense, divorce would be a symptom of otherwise hidden costs of job loss. Our study adds to the existing literature on the impact of employment termination on marital stability by allowing for heterogeneity depending on whether a new job was found. This extension is particularly interesting when considering labor market policies. If job loss only matters for the divorce rate due to the resulting unemployment, pushing for a more mobile labor market with higher rates of hiring and firing would not have a cost in terms of higher divorce rates. In contrast, if the divorce risk is still elevated, even if new employment is found quickly, stronger employment protection could be beneficial for marital stability. We apply a complementary log–log model suitable for discrete survival analysis to data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). The estimated equation is specified at the couple level and takes information on both partners into account explicitly. Our results show that a husband’s involuntary job loss is associated with a roughly 54% increase in the dissolution probability in the case of plant closings and 74% in the case of dismissals. We interpret this to be a result of information updating regarding the quality of the match, including lifetime earnings and negative characteristics brought to light by the adverse conditions, as well as short term stress. Plant closings, which are frequently used to identify exogenous job losses, show a smaller relationship with marital dissolution than dismissals. This could be for a variety of reasons, including dismissals inducing a larger negative information update, causing more psychological stress and potentially capturing unobserved heterogeneity. Reasoning along the same lines could also explain why other types of job losses, including potentially voluntary employment terminations, are associated with a comparatively small increase in the dissolution risk of 35%. When distinguishing by how long ago a job loss occurred, we find that the increase in the dissolution risk tends to be highest in the first period following the job loss and usually becomes insignificant in later periods. When analysing heterogeneity depending on whether new employment was taken up, we find the relative risk of divorce in the first year after taking up a new job to be roughly as high as in the year after the initial job loss if no new employment was found. We argue that the overall information update associated with the job loss could remain negative, which, coupled with the stress associated with starting a new job and potentially adverse characteristics of the new job, results in a largely unchanged dissolution risk, even though finding a new job is presumably a positive signal in itself. Our mediation analysis is consistent with a working hours as well as a wage channel. Lastly, we also investigate the role of the wife’s labor market status, both as a moderator for the relationship between the husband’s job loss and marital stability and by considering the direct influence of a wife’s job loss on marital stability. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides some theoretical background and reviews the previous literature related to job loss and divorce. The data and the estimation technique are introduced in Section 3. Section 4 reports our key results. Robustness checks and extensions are presented in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Section 7 outlines some limitations and Section 8 concludes.",3

Family income dynamics and children’s post-secondary enrollment and persistence,March 2022,Bradley L. Hardy,Dave E. Marcotte,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Children from low-income families are not only less likely to enroll in college, those who do are the least likely to persist and earn a degree. Recent estimates show that fewer than a third of children from families in the lowest income quintile who start college persist to earn a degree, compared to more than two-thirds of their peers in the highest quintile (Bailey and Dynarski 2012; Haskins et al. 2009). One potential mechanism for these differences in college enrollment and persistence rates is the economic volatility experienced by low-income families, which can affect investments in children (Hardy et al. 2019). In this paper, we study the impact of time spent in poverty and family income volatility during adolescence on limiting children’s access to post-secondary education. To the extent that such income dynamics occur throughout middle and high school, they could operate as important mechanisms in limiting upward mobility for those who need it most. Our work is related to a broader literature on college enrollment and persistence. This includes research on the rapidly rising cost of college and its effects on enrollment decisions, college retention, and dropout rates (e.g. Hemelt and Marcotte 2011, 2016). While federal financial aid is the primary buffer against these costs for price-sensitive students, the provision of aid is complex and often difficult for families to negotiate (Dynarski and Scott-Clayton 2008, 2013). This may be an especially complex problem for children of families in poverty. The economic and family instability that is inherent in poverty spells may be an important barrier to college matriculation and completion—and upward economic mobility—for students from low-income families. Combined with other challenges facing children at the family, neighborhood, and school level, this further raises the possibility that education is potentially reinforcing rather than ameliorating inequality across generations, a point that has received a fair amount of attention (e.g. Andrews and Stange 2019; Duncan and Murnane 2014; Fischer 2016). Our study provides insight into the factors that shape college attendance decisions among students who have experienced spells in poverty during adolescence. To do so, we study the role of family income dynamics during secondary school on high school graduation, college enrollment, and college persistence (2-year dropout). Specifically, we examine the relationship between these outcomes and exposure to (1) poverty over multiple years during adolescence, (2) low average or “permanent” income over these same years, and (3) volatility in family income. We believe our paper contributes to a broader understanding of the capacity and limits of higher education as a means to disrupt the inter-generational transmission of poverty, by including poverty spells and family income volatility during adolescence as a potential factor shaping of post-secondary decisions and success. As opposed to income level at a point in time, these income dynamics are an under-appreciated determinant of social opportunity. We know that families with low incomes also have the least predictable incomes (Hardy and Ziliak 2014; Hardy 2017), and the decision to invest in college can be substantially complicated by low income and income volatility. As a result, children from low-income families could face a double burden: family support that is low on average, and less reliable. This could have a range of negative impacts during middle school and high school, including reduced engagement in academic activities (Gennetian et al. 2015), degrading the capacity to graduate high school and the decision to both enroll and persist in college. Concurrent with issues of student engagement and aptitude, the incidence of poverty, low income, and income volatility could make it more difficult for a family to plan for college (e.g. Mullainathan and Shafir 2013). Among students enrolled in college, family income dynamics can affect persistence. For example, students may feel pressured to supplement family income during transitory declines in income. On the other hand, transitory windfalls can simultaneously increase potential financial support, but also negatively affect financial aid eligibility and awards. In this paper, we make use of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the PSID Transition to Adulthood supplement (PSID-TA) supplement to study the experiences of young adults as they finish high school and transition into the labor force and/or post-secondary education. We find that poverty, low-income, and intertemporal volatility in family income during adolescence is followed by poorer post-secondary access and persistence, even conditioning on high school achievement, race, gender and other factors. Notably, students who matriculate to community colleges are less likely to graduate than comparable peers with similar academic profiles who enroll in four-year schools. This may reflect family commitment or social barriers that directed them to community college in the first place. Wealth positively predicts attendance and matriculation, though less so than other factors like lower income, poverty, and both family and residential stability (e.g. Addo et al. 2016). This study provides the first evidence of the role of income instability and spells in poverty on post-secondary outcomes for young persons finishing high school in the past two decades. These results are relevant to a number of policy debates and audiences. First, understanding the importance of economic deprivation and instability within the family during a child’s “launch” into adulthood can help in developing a fuller picture of the potential mechanisms of the transmission of intergenerational advantage and disadvantage. Second, our results suggest that repeated and recent exposure to poverty and low income, as well as family income volatility, may play a role in the disappointing and persistent gap in college matriculation and completion rates between high and low-income students. Moving forward, the experience of young adults starting college provides a good opportunity to consider and evaluate the extent to which Pell Grants, federally subsidized student loans, and related subsidies serve to ensure access to higher education among students from vulnerable financial backgrounds, or whether such interventions occur too late. This is especially true for the timing of our analysis, given that students are facing this decision point roughly around the time of the Great Recession. Pell grants are the most important federal need-based financial aid program. So, understanding the ability or limits of Pell and related programs to provide affordable access to college is a policy evaluation question of real importance. Relatedly, future work can provide additional evidence on the role of a college’s institutional features, including measures of academic selectivity and affordability.",6

Rebollo-Sanz,Sara De la Rica,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Over the last twenty years, there has been a narrowing of gender gaps in different labor market outcomes such as employment rates, hours worked, and wage rates, among others, in all advanced economies, mainly driven by a large expansion in women’s education. However, these gender gaps still continue even after proxies for human capital endowments of workers—such as education, age or experience—are taken into account (Blau et al. 2008; England et al. 2012; Blau and Kahn 2017). This is referred to as the “unexplained” or “adjusted” gender gap and, as some empirical papers show (see Blau and Kahn 2017; Boll et al. 2016), unexplained factors still accounted for a substantial share of the observed wage gender gap.Footnote 1 In this paper we propose to test whether the use of more direct measures of human capital endowment help understanding this unexplained component of the gender gap in labor market outcomes. To this end, we take advantage of the appearance of new datasets that offer direct measures of cognitive competences. In particular, the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competences (PIAAC) offers individual measures of cognitive skills for the adult population across a significant number of countries. Our paper deals precisely with the association between the adjusted gender gaps in labor market outcomes and gender gaps in cognitive skills. To measure such association, we believe that cross-country variation provides clearer evidence than within-country analysis because of the better picture of broad differences in the social and economic environment. Our precise contribution with respect to previous studies is threefold: first, this paper uses precise measures of cognitive skills provided by PIAAC to assess whether gender gaps exist in cognitive skills for different ages, educational levels, fields of specialization, occupation and across countries and assess their magnitude. Second, we focus on the relationship between gender gaps in math skills and labor force participation, which to our knowledge, has not previously been addressed. Precisely, we seek to explore the link between math skills and self-selection into the labor market, particularly for women. Third, we investigate the link between gender gaps in math skills and gender gaps in wages. If there is a link between cognitive skills and labor market outcomes, gender inequalities in the acquisition of these skills emerge as an important policy issue, both from equity and efficiency grounds. We are particularly interested in comparing findings at entry age (24–29) and at the next age group (30–39), where motherhood mostly takes place. Cognitive skills at ages 24–29 are mainly determined by the acquisition of these skills during the process of formal education whereas for the other age-groups, current cognitive levels might depend on educational attainment levels as well as on particular labor market paths. This perspective provides a more holistic view of how the link between gender gaps in cognitive skills and labor market outcomes evolve through life. Gender gaps in areas such as wages and hours worked change substantially at different stages of the life cycle as a result of motherhood. Moreover, educational attainment may still play a role in explaining gender differences for older workers but not so much for younger workers. In related literature, cognitive skills have been found to be positively associated with the success of individuals in the labor market, participation in society, and economic growth (Hanushek and Woessmann 2015; Oreopoulos and Salvanes 2011; Quintini 2014; Hanushek and Woessmann 2015; Hanushek et al. 2015; Hampf et al. 2017). For instance, Hanushek et al. (2015) find that one-standard-deviation increase in numeracy skills is associated with an 18% wage increase among prime age workers. However, there is hardly any evidence on the association between properly measured skills in the labor market and gender gaps observed in different labor market outcomes. So far, only Hanuseck et al. (2015) and Fortin (2008) provide some insights on the link between cognitive abilities and gender wage gaps, although their empirical analysis does not seek to measure the role of gender gaps in cognitive skills with a view to explaining gender gaps in labor market performance. The assessment of gender differences in cognitive skills, particularly in numeracy skills in adulthood, is appealing since results from PISA persistently find that females at age 15 perform consistently around 5% more poorly in numeracy skills than their male counterparts (see Arora and Pawlowski 2017). Such gender disparities may lead, at least partly, to the documented lower presence of women in the fields of study of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Joensen and Nielsen (2014) shows that encouraging more students to opt for advanced mathematics has a sizeable positive earnings effects for girls, but no effect for boys at the margin. Early mathematical knowledge predicts later success in school, and even in high school, and it correlates with a variety of higher cognitive skills (Clements and Sarama 2011). Moreover, the gender segregation by occupation observed in the labor market—young women tend to study fields such as education, health, and social sciences whereas technical studies are primarily male fields—may also be a consequence of the poorer performance of girls in numeracy skills. Hence, it is necessary to document empirically the size of gender gaps in cognitive skills, particularly in numeracy skills, and then assess the extent to which such gender disparities are associated with labor market performance in order to deep into the drivers of gender gaps in the labor market. Gender gaps in labor market outcomes are likely to be heterogeneous depending on family composition, basically, whether or not there are children in the household. In most developed countries, women must combine employment with home responsibilities to a greater extent than their male partners. This affects their decisions with respect to their labor supply (i.e., time employed, type of job and so on) and hence their human capital accumulation in general and in particular the accumulation of skills along the life cycle.Footnote 2 To account for this, in our empirical analysis we test whether the association of gender gaps in cognitive skills and labor market outcomes differs for parents and non-parents. Data shows that on average gender gaps in literacy skills are negligible even on entry into the labor market and remain so at different ages. However, in numeracy skills, men score around 4.2% higher than females (a difference of around 11–12 points on a 500-point scale). This gap increases from 3.6% at the age of entry into the labor market (24–29 age group) to 4.6% for the 40–49 age group. Additionally, we show that gaps in numeracy skills are heterogeneous by level and field of study and by occupational groups. Concerning labor market outcomes, we find sizable gender gaps in labor force participation and wages (around 18 percentage points and 20%, respectively), even when comparing men and women with similar general human capital endowments (i.e., age, educational level and field of study). Moreover, gender differences in math skills are associated with gender gaps in labor force participation, particularly for workers less than 40 years old and for non-parents. For instance, adjusted gender gap in labor participation drops from 17.7 percentage points to 16.8 percentage points (a drop of one percentage point or 5.1% in relative terms) when maths skills are factored in the model, even when comparing individuals with the same level and field of studies. Lastly, turning to gender wage gaps, they rise substantially and steadily with age—from 9% at age entry, rise to 19% at the “maternity age” and rise again to 23% for 40–49 years. For parents, adjusted gender wage gaps are around twice as large as those for non-parents (12% for non-parents versus 24% for parents). The contribution of gender gaps in math skills to explain gender wage gaps vary between 1.0–2.9 percentage points or between 11–15% in relative terms. Nevertheless, adjusted gender gaps in wages and in labor market participation are still significant even when factoring in math skills in the corresponding equation. This indicates that there are still unobserved factors which underly gender gaps in labor market outcomes other than difference in math cognitive skills. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the main characteristics of the dataset used. Section 3 presents firstly main sample statistics for gender gaps in literacy and numeracy skills by different individual characteristics. Secondly, Section 3 also display adjusted gender gaps in literacy and numeracy skills. Section 4 focuses on the relationship between math skills and gender gaps in labor market outcomes. This Section 4, firstly present main sample statistics for gender gaps in labor market outcomes and secondly adjusted gender gaps for these labor market outcomes with and without math skills, once main sample covariates are considered. Section 5 concludes.",1
20.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,20 July 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-021-09574-7,Does signaling childcare support on job applications reduce the motherhood penalty?,June 2022,Arjun Bedi,Tanmoy Majilla,Matthias Rieger,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"While gender differences in labor market indicators are tapering off in many parts of the world (Goldin, 2014), the presence of women and even more so of mothers in labor markets remains low in many developing countries.Footnote 1 One much discussed case is India (Klasen & Pieters, 2015; Das & Zumbyte, 2017; Verick, 2018), where less than 30% of women participate in the labor force notwithstanding improvements in socio-economic and demographic conditions in recent years. The country’s overall female labor force participation rate has even dropped from 22 percent in 1987 to 17 percent in 2011 (Klasen & Pieters, 2015), with the labor force participation of women typically falling around first motherhood (see Bedi et al., 2018).Footnote 2 There are several supply and demand side reasons for the decline in labor force participation after becoming a mother. One potential reason why a non-prejudiced employer may be less likely to hire mothers is the belief that due to childcare and other family obligations, mothers are inflexible and are less dedicated to their jobs. This is likely to place mothers, especially in the case of jobs with traditional “9 to 5” work arrangements, at a severe disadvantage. Several studies suggest that mothers experience grave difficulties in balancing job and family demands and require supportive work arrangements (Goldin, 2014; Anderson et al., 2003).Footnote 3 Theoretically, such behavior may be related to statistical discrimination against mothers. If statistical discrimination, motivated primarily by the perceived (by employers) inflexibility of mothers and their lack of commitment is a primary factor holding back mothers from participating in the labor market, one way of improving their labor market prospects would be to signal their flexibility to employers. If mothers can signal flexibility, for example, by indicating childcare support at home, then the motherhood penalty should be smaller. Using an experimental approach, where one may credibly control for observable confounding characteristics and abstract from self-selection of applicants into certain jobs, the aim of this article is to identify the potentially mitigating impact of childcare support on the motherhood penalty. While access to childcare may be expected to mitigate the motherhood penalty, it is possible that if employers are prejudiced against mothers/women (Becker, 1971) or do not believe that access to childcare is strong enough to undo traditional gender norms and patriarchal expectations, then, childcare availability may not have a substantial effect. In a similar vein, Benard and Correll (2010) argue that if mothers show a very strong commitment to paid work, and display traditionally masculine qualities, they may experience ‘normative discrimination’, that is, they may be “viewed as less warm and more interpersonally hostile (e.g., more selfish, cold, and devious) than other types of workers” (p. 617), which implies that mothers who violate traditional norms and display stronger labor market commitment may continue to experience discrimination as compared to other employees. Their argument is that “evidence of workplace competence and commitment will not eliminate discrimination but merely alter its mechanism” (p. 622), that is, from statistical or status-based discrimination to “normative discrimination”. In terms of empirical evidence on the motherhood penalty, a growing literature, mostly from sociology but increasingly in economics, finds that mothers experience disadvantages in terms of wages, promotions and job opportunities in the Global North (Anderson et al., 2002; Benard & Correll, 2010; Budig et al., 2012; England et al., 2016; Goldin et al., 2017; Gallen, 2018; Kleven et al., 2019a). For instance, in Germany each child reduces a woman’s wages by 16–18% (Gangl & Ziefle, 2009). In Denmark, having children creates a gender gap in earnings by as much as 20% in the long run (Kleven et al., 2019b).Footnote 4 A related experimental literature has explored the motherhood penalty using fictitious CVs sent to actual job advertisements. In a CV experiment, Correll et al. (2007) found that by randomly adding at least one child to otherwise similar CVs, callback rates fell by 50%. Few such experiments have been implemented in the Global South. In closely related work, Bedi et al. (2018) examined the labor market implications of motherhood and the effect of cultural norms (mothers from patrilineal versus matrilineal backgrounds) in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai).Footnote 5 Based on callback rates to fictitious job applications in the service sector, they found that the average callback rate was 14% for mothers as opposed to 28% for non-mothers. They also found that the motherhood penalty was restricted to mothers from patrilineal backgrounds while mothers from matrilineal backgrounds (Khasis from Northeast India) did not experience a penalty. In this paper, we experimentally test for the mitigating impact of childcare support on the motherhood penalty. We employ a CV audit approach with random variation in CV characteristics and evaluate the impact of these characteristics on the likelihood of a callback for an interview.Footnote 6 Specifically, we sent three applications to each job opening – one non-mother applicant and two mother applicants. In one of the mother CVs, we explicitly reported the availability of strong childcare support at home.Footnote 7 Building on previous studies, we searched for entry-level jobs in two relatively new and flourishing sectors in the Indian economy – that is, call centers/business process outsourcing (BPO) and financial sector firms in Delhi.Footnote 8 We selected Delhi because it offers the most patriarchal context with the strongest motherhood penalty amongst the three cities in previous studies (Bedi et al., 2018), while at the same time it has a vibrant job-market in the two selected sectors.Footnote 9 All our fictitious applicants had a Bachelor’s degree and had two years of relevant work experience. In total, we sent 450 CVs to 150 job openings. This study is related to two strands of the literature. First, it is related to the literature on the labor market impact of motherhood (Angelov et al., 2016; Bedi et al., 2018; Kleven et al., 2019a; Kuziemko et al., 2018). By investigating the effect of childcare support on mothers’ labor market success we address a potential channel through which the motherhood penalty arises and may be weakened. This study is the first to experimentally quantify the effect of childcare support on callback rates in the Global South.Footnote 10Second, our research links to the wider literature on women’s participation in labor markets in emerging countries, in particular when it comes to demand side aspects. While there is a sizeable literature which examines the impact of education and fertility on female labor supply (Guo et al., 2018; Heath, 2017; Agüero & Marks, 2011; Bloom et al., 2009; Angrist & Evans, 1998), the influence of demand side factors on women’s labor market outcomes have been relatively less investigated. To preview our results, first, we find a large motherhood penalty, and second, we find that the childcare support signal reduces the motherhood penalty. On average, mothers’ callback rates were 20 percentage points lower as compared to non-mothers. This translates to a 57% decrease in the callback rate. The childcare support signal significantly dampens the motherhood penalty by 4 percentage points or by 20%. Taken together, the evidence presented here suggests that childcare support has a modest, albeit a discernible moderating impact on the motherhood penalty. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the research design. Section 3 presents results, and Section 4 discusses the findings, acknowledges limitations as well as alternative interpretations of the findings and concludes the paper.",2

A key aim of these reforms is to encourage older workers to remain in the labor force, making it vital to understand how these policies affect retirement decisions. While several studies find large effects of these reforms on retirement decisions (e.g., Börsch-Supan & Schnabel, 1998; Cribb et al., 2016; Geyer & Welteke, 2021; Hanel & Riphahn, 2012; Lalive et al., 2017; Snyder & Evans, 2006; Staubli & Zweimüller, 2013; Vestad, 2013), it has been difficult to disentangle the key mechanisms as these reforms may affect retirement behavior through several channels. For example, these reforms may encourage people to delay retirement due to (i) a decrease in individuals’ lifetime pension wealth, known as the wealth effect, (ii) the opportunity to work for a longer period and thus accrue a larger pension, known as the accrual effect, (iii) a change in social norms, (iv) the presence of liquidity constraints, or (v) by delaying any income/earnings tests that only apply when receiving a pension, which make it unattractive for people to continue working after they become eligible for retirement benefits. An important paper in this literature is Atalay and Barrett (2015). Atalay and Barrett (2015) study an Australian reform in 1994 that gradually raised women’s eligibility age for the means-tested public retirement pension from 60 to 65 based on their birthdates (see Fig. 1). Atalay and Barrett (2015) argue that this reform is useful for understanding mechanisms because Australia’s retirement pension is non-contributory. This means that there is no accrual effect — an effect which has been emphasized in the literature (Gruber & Wise, 2004; Samwick, 1998) — and any impact on retirement decisions must result from other mechanisms. Atalay and Barrett (2015) estimate the impact of the reform on female labor force participation at ages 60 to 64 using repeated household surveys ranging from 1994 to 2010 and a differences-in-differences design in which male cohorts form the comparison group. Their headline estimate is large, reflecting the stronger increase in female participation rates over this period (see Fig. 2). They estimate that each one-year increase in women’s eligibility age increased female labor force participation by 12 percentage points, an effect they interpret as evidence of strong wealth effects.Footnote 1 Age pension age (APA) by date of birth and gender. Notes: This figure shows the eligibility age of Australian men and women for the Age Pension based on their date of birth.

I also include a dashed line denoting the counterfactual change in female labor force participation (LFP) over Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) sample period (1994–2010); this line shows how female LFP would have changed if it followed the same trend as male LFP over the sample period. Evidently, female LFP increased considerably more than male LFP over this period. In this paper, I start by replicating Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) labor force participation estimates. Using the same source data, I apply the sample restrictions and methods described in Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) paper and find that their estimates can be successfully replicated. Namely, due to the clarity of Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) paper, I am able to closely match the sample and regression estimates without needing to use original program files. Then, I extend the analysis with earlier data, building on a literature that is increasingly scrutinizing difference-in-difference methods (e.g., Bertrand et al., 2004; Borjas, 2017; Cameron et al., 2008; Donald & Lang, 2007; Goodman-Bacon, 2018; Wolfers, 2006). In the Australian context, one concern with using men as the comparison group is that, as in many countries, the participation rate for women has risen considerably over recent decades, while the rate for men has been relatively stable. With these gender-specific time trends in mind, later cohorts of women may have higher participation rates for reasons other than their higher pension age. If this is the case, Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) estimates may be biased upwards. As Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) sample period started after the reform was announced, they were unable to use their data to examine whether the parallel-trends assumption held before the reform for the cohorts in their sample. I extend the analysis using two sources of data from before the reform was announced. First, I use aggregate data on participation rates by age and gender to examine whether the parallel-trends assumption held before the reform for the cohorts in Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) sample. This builds on Fig. 1 in Atalay and Barrett (2015), which showed similar pre-reform trends in male and female participation rates near the retirement age among earlier cohorts. For the relevant cohorts, I find opposing trends in male and female participation rates before the reform (at younger ages), with a strong upward trend in female participation rates and a weak downward trend in male participation rates (see Fig. 3). For example, at ages 45 to 49, women’s participation rate increased by 18.6 percentage points in the fifteen years before Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) sample period (from 52.5% to 71.1%), while men’s participation rate decreased by 2.4 percentage points (from 93.5% to 91.1%). Moreover, I find similar gender-specific trends among these cohorts at both older and younger ages, suggesting that women would have reduced the gender gap in participation rates at ages 60 to 64 over Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) sample period even if the reform had not occurred. This indicates that Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) estimates, which attribute the convergence in male and female participation rates to the reform, may be biased upwards. Labor force participation rates of the relevant cohorts at younger ages. Notes: These figures plot labor force participation (LFP) rates from the Labor Force Survey (in black) and the Income Distribution Surveys (in gray). Between the vertical dashed lines, the cohorts in Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) sample were aged 45–49 in (a) and 50–54 in (b). During these periods, male and female LFP rates follow opposing trends. Thus, the parallel-trends assumption did not hold for the relevant cohorts before the reform. Second, I use repeated household surveys from 1982 to 1990 to examine whether the different trends of men and women can be explained by the control variables in Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) regressions. Specifically, I estimate placebo regressions using Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) differences-in-differences approach to test for an impact on the participation rates of female cohorts before the reform was announced. In these regressions, positive estimates of the (placebo) treatment effect would indicate that Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) estimates are likely to be biased upwards. I find that the estimates are positive, highly statistically significant, and broadly consistent with the size of Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) estimates in percentage terms. Thus, Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) estimates are likely to confound women’s responses to the reform with a persistent cohort trend in female participation rates. In the final part of the paper, I use the replication sample to re-estimate the effects of the reform on female labor force participation. I follow the empirical strategy of several recent studies examining phased increases in pension-eligibility ages (Cribb et al., 2016; Oguzoglu et al., 2020; Staubli & Zweimüller, 2013). This approach differs from Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) approach by directly controlling for the trend in female participation rates across cohorts. These controls may partially or even fully absorb any wealth effects from the reform but not effects from other mechanisms, such as a change in social norms, liquidity constraints or the pension’s income test. I find that the estimated increase in female labor force participation falls by two-thirds to 4.1 percentage points and becomes statistically indistinguishable from zero at the 10% level (with a p value of 0.109). This estimate provides only weak evidence that the reform had any effect on female labor force participation. This modest impact is consistent with the raw data, which shows little evidence of a drop in female participation rates at the eligibility age (and only a small decrease in male participation rates at their constant eligibility age of 65). Moreover, the estimated effect is similar in magnitude to (unpublished) estimates of the reform by Morris (2019) based on more detailed survey data.Footnote 2 These impacts are not only smaller than Atalay and Barrett’s (2015) estimates but also, as discussed below, smaller than estimates of similar reforms in other countries.Footnote 3 More generally, the results in this paper have implications for studies estimating the impact of retirement reforms. Over recent decades, female labor force participation rates have increased considerably across the developed world; from 1970 to 2016, the participation rate of women aged 25 to 64 in OECD countries increased from 46.3% to 68.1% (OECD, 2018). In the context of Australia, my results show that these trends can result in meaningful differences across cohorts in female participation rates near the retirement age. Even when these differences appear to reflect logical responses to a decrease in the generosity of retirement benefits for later cohorts — and even when differences across earlier cohorts are minimal near the retirement age — it is important, where possible, to examine trends across the relevant cohorts in earlier time periods. This recommendation applies generally and is not specific to studies focused on the effects on female labor supply; studies focused on other potentially correlated outcomes like welfare receipt or health should also be careful in attributing cohort differences in outcomes to the effects of pension reforms.",4
20.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,19 August 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-021-09579-2,Gender role perspectives and job burnout,June 2022,Benjamin Artz,Ilker Kaya,Ozgur Kaya,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Family and work are quite possibly the two primary facets of life. Yet, the role expectations and responsibilities of each may often be intertwined and complicated. The resulting potential conflict between family and work can reduce job and life satisfaction for employees (Ford et al., 2007; Michel & Hargis, 2008; Carlson et al., 2009). Moreover, competing demands for attention by both paid work and family can correlate with anxiety, depression and physical and emotional exhaustion (Allen et al., 2000). It is thus not surprising that a rich literature has formed around measuring and analyzing the resulting consequences of these work and family conflicts, often termed job burnout. The term burnout first emerged in the 1970s as a social problem recognized in the psychological literature (Schaufeli et al., 2009). Burnout can be described as failure, exhaustion or fatigue resulting from excessive demand on one’s personal energy, strength, or resources. Accordingly, burnout pertaining to jobs can be regarded as the depletion of workers’ resources over time that has been found to be related to certain physical and mental health problems including anxiety, depression and musculoskeletal disorders. Moreover, job burnout corresponds with several undesirable labor outcomes and behaviors such as reduced job satisfaction, productivity, and organizational commitment as well as higher turnover and absenteeism (Nahrgang et al., 2011; Hakanen & Schaufeli, 2012). One might presume that job burnout has likely been borne more by women; their labor force participation grew from 32% in 1948 to 60% in 2000Footnote 1 but their role as the primary worker in unpaid caregiving and domestic work largely remained unchangedFootnote 2. This implies that women may disproportionately suffer from job-related burnout as their resources have likely been strained over time more so than menFootnote 3. In an expansive meta-analysis of over 180 studies, Purvanova and Muros (2010) find that women are more likely to report work-related emotional and physical exhaustion, one aspect of job burnout. However, the literature is not clear whether women report more exhaustion because their experienced conflict between family and work is mainly due to intuitive causal factors like greater workload, or if the reported exhaustion is a result of unrealized expectations or preferences. Indeed, at times the literature identifies the perceived or expected social roles of men and women as a major source of the conflict between work and family (Gutek et al., 1991; Eagle et al., 1997). Analyzing the incidence and severity of job burnout therefore requires investigating workload at job and home as well as other job related aspects in addition to preferences or expectations about gender roles. In this study, we first contribute to the literature by using unique and somewhat uncommon data. While most studies rely on small survey samples of particular occupations or subsets of the population, our dataset is nationally representative of the US, is rich in demographic, job and personality characteristics, and includes nearly 4200 observations spread across most occupations and industries. Our second contribution is to test for a gender difference in job-related burnout and assess whether the difference exists due to observable heterogeneity in men’s and women’s lives. Finally, we suggest a novel, and admittedly provocative, explanation for the difference in burnout between men and women. Specifically, we analyze the gendered differences in burnout by focusing on women’s own subjective preferences and expectations about gender roles. Indeed, since most measures of burnout rely on self-reported assessments, the preference alignment of women conditional on women’s role in society may affect their self-reported job burnout. As such, we uniquely identify workers’ preference alignments as “traditional” or “progressive” by using measures in the National Study of the Changing Workforce (NSCW) survey that specifically record workers’ social role preferences for women. We find that women are more likely to report job-related burnout than men, and that observable individual, job and family characteristics do not explain the gender gap. Furthermore, women we identify as “progressive” share an equivalent likelihood with men of experiencing burnout. By contrast, “traditional” women are far more likely to experience burnout. We examine the robustness of our results by using alternative specifications, but these fail to contradict our main results. While earlier studies propose that improved organizational support may be effective in lowering burnout among women (e.g. Senécal et al., 2001; Tamres et al., 2002; Beauregard, 2011), our study’s results suggest that organizational support may be insufficient. If female workers’ burnout depends upon their own self-evaluation and perception of women’s social role, then other interventions aimed at addressing perceptions of women’s role in society may be necessary to reduce the rate of job burnout among women. Consequently, our results may inform new policy designs meant to improve the productivity and wellbeing of, specifically, female workers.",6

However, empirical evidence about the effectiveness of childcare policies to support maternal employment varies according to the examined countries and time (Morrissey, 2017). Addressing this issue is of crucial importance for countries that have expanded childcare policy by increasing the amount of subsidies, the number of free hours of care, or the group of eligible children. For example, between 2000 and 2013, most states in Germany adopted a free childcare policy (Felfe & Lalive, 2018). In 2017, the UK government doubled the number of free hours of childcare for children of three to four years of age, from 15 to 30 h per week for working parents (Brewer et al., 2020). In 2019, Japan introduced a free daycare policy for children under the age of five (OECD, 2019). More recently, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, specific policy interventions have been set up to support working parents. These include the introduction of new childcare subsidies or special family leave, or the expansion of existing support in terms of either leave coverage or the amount of paid subsidies (Gromada et al., 2020). The extent to which public support for childcare is needed depends on the response of maternal labor supply to childcare incentives. The current paper investigates the impact of a recent policy designed to increase the availability of affordable childcare in Luxembourg. Prior to the policy change, public childcare was universal and heavily subsidized, but offered limited places. In 2009, the government expanded the public funding of formal childcare by introducing childcare vouchers, which can be used to purchase care in both public and for-profit centers. The childcare voucher scheme aimed to increase the use of formal childcare (including before and after-school care for children attending school), helping parents to find a work–life balance and reducing socio-economic inequalities between children. Following the introduction of the revised policy, new childcare providers entered the market, increasing the overall provision of services—the number of places doubled between 2009 and 2014 (source: Ministry of Family, Ministry of Education, Luxembourg). Employing a difference-in-differences (DiD) strategy, I estimate the effects of the policy change on maternal employment using longitudinal data from the European Union—Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey for the period 2004–2014. The treatment group comprises women aged 20 to 50, with a youngest child up to 13 years old. As a control group, I use women in the same age group who are either childless or with a youngest child aged between 13 to 18 years old, as the trends in outcomes are very similar before the reform. I perform event-type studies and tests on pre-reform differences in slopes to ensure that eligible and non-eligible mothers can be compared. In a second step, I also exploit the differences in the intensity of the policy change between children’s age over time, as the increase in the number of places at childcare facilities was more pronounced for younger than for older children. This setting has many interesting features. First, it allows me to provide evidence concerning the effects of expanding existing childcare subsidies, whereas a great deal of previous literature focuses on the role of the introduction of childcare subsidies or preschool programs for children up to three years of age. The previously published results may not be transferable to a case where existing childcare subsidies are expanded for different reasons. On the one hand, the contexts of maternal employment and childcare attendance are different. It is likely that the group of women who may be sensitive to the incentives given by childcare policies differs from the group of women who may respond to the introduction of such a policy. On the other hand, the effects found for parents of preschool children may be different to those found for parents of younger children, mainly because preferences for childcare arrangements vary with the age of the child (Leibowitz et al., 1988). Second, the childcare voucher scheme introduced in Luxembourg benefits all children, regardless of the family’s income and the parents’ employment status. While most of the existing evidence relies on programs under which childcare subsidies are conditional on income or employment and/or focusing on mothers of preschool children, I have been able to analyze the effects of the policy on the overall population. This could be of great interest to policymakers. The results indicate that the likelihood of employment for women with at least one child under 13 increased by 3 percentage points (baseline 0.60) and the hours of work (including for those who were not working before the reform) increased by around 1 h per week (baseline 17.65 h). The effect of the reform hides the difference between children’s ages, as mothers of the youngest children are found to be more responsive to the reform than mothers of children in primary education. There is also evidence of heterogeneous responses by prior employment status. The results confirm that in a context where the employment of mothers and daycare attendance are low, making affordable childcare more widely available is a way to increase maternal employment. Nevertheless, a rough calculation suggests a 0.17 percentage point increase in the employment rate of mothers of a child aged 0–12, for a 1 percent increase in the daycare attendance rate. This actually suggests a relatively modest effect of the reform. The paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the related literature. In Section 3, I then describe the institutional context and the 2009 childcare reform. Section 4 and Section 5 respectively present the data and identification strategy. The results, including robustness checks, are presented and discussed in Section 6. Lastly, I conclude in Section 7.",1

Short- and long-term consequences of fathers’ job loss on time investment in the household,June 2022,Juliane Hennecke,Astrid Pape,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In most developed countries men, on average, contribute less to domestic unpaid work than women (OECD 2020). Although this so-called “gender care gap” can explain phenomena like the motherhood penalty and gender inequality in the labor market in general (Bertrand et al. 2010; Bütikofer et al. 2018), there is no clear evidence on why fathers still contribute less to child care and housework despite gender convergence in education and labor market outcomes prior to child birth (Bianchi 2000; Coltrane 2000; Hook 2010; Petrongolo and Ronchi 2020; Samtleben 2019; Sanchez and Thomson 1997). In the past, the public debate and social science literature on labor force participation of mothers concentrated on external child care and left fathers as the more obvious in-house alternative aside. This has changed in recent years, as the benefits of paternal child care for both child development and gender equality became more established (Averett et al. 2005; Cardoso et al. 2010; Del Boca et al. 2017; Elkins and Schurer 2020; Ruhm 2004; Schober and Zoch 2019).Footnote 1 In this paper we ask whether a forced temporary inactivity in market work is able to change existing gender patterns in affected families in order to draw conclusions about the potential of extended periods of paternal availability for domestic production. Although unemployment itself is selective with respect to paternal socio-economic characteristics, we argue that the involuntary nature of the change in paternal availability and the involvement of fathers of older children has external validity for the explanation of paternal decision making in general. This research is especially relevant in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, during which daycares and schools closed and which expanded working from home dramatically, shifting the daily lives of many families. The change in paternal routines “forcing” fathers to increase their domestic time investments was regularly brought up as a potential silver lining of the economic crisis (Alon et al. 2020; Del Boca et al. 2020; Hupkau and Petrongolo 2020; Mangiavacchi et al. 2020). However, first evidence on the change in housework and child care investments is mixed. Zamarro and Prados (2021) find that mothers in the United States have taken on the heavier load of child care responsibilities, which is also associated with a reduction in working hours and a higher level of psychological distress. For Germany, Kreyenfeld and Zinn (2021) find evidence for a short-run increase housework taken on by fathers, though Boll et al. (2021) show that this fades out in subsequent months. So far, it is unclear what the long-run effects on gender equality will be. The goal of this paper is to analyze the effect of exogenous employment shocks through dismissals and firm closures on paternal involvement in child care and housework in the household. Based on the existing literature, we expect a positive effect and theoretically discuss four possible reasons: time availability and financial constraints, bargaining powers, gender role attitudes, and emotional bonding between fathers and children.Footnote 2 All these mechanisms have distinctly different implications for the empirical analysis of short- and long-term effects as well as for the empirical analysis of the differences between working days and work-free days and between child care and housework involvement. Our empirical analysis is based on extensive information available in the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP 2019), a large representative longitudinal household panel from Germany. The SOEP not only includes detailed socio-economic information but also surveys individuals’ self-reported time use in multiple domains separately for working days (annually) and work-free days (biennially) over a time period of 26 years. We embed our analysis in an event study approach with individual and year fixed effects. Our results reveal that fathers who experience an involuntary job loss immediately increase their time allocated to child care by 1.2 h (58% relative to baseline) and to housework by 1.7 h (79% relative to baseline) on weekdays. We do not find significant or robust changes in time allocation on weekends. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that the persistence of increases in domestic work is concentrated on fathers who remain unemployed and have a spouse who is active in the labor market. In contrast, we observe that the re-employment of fathers results in, on average, lower involvement in child care and housework on weekdays and weekends as compared to pre-job loss periods, especially if the partner is not working. Employed female partners respond to the change in paternal time allocation by persistently decreasing domestic time investments, while not employed female partners even increase the time allocated to child care and housework alongside their husbands. This results in an overall increase in cumulative household time investment in couples where both partners are at home due to the employment shock, while it causes a decrease in cumulative household time investment in couples where both partners work after a re-employment of the husband. These findings correspond with a decrease in external care use and expenses, indicating a decrease in the outsourcing of domestic tasks. Most closely related to our study, Foster and Stratton (2018) analyze the effect of unemployment and promotions on the intra-household division of housework using Australian panel data. They find that terminations and promotions of both partners affect the own time spent on housework and in case of a woman’s promotion also adversely affect the partner’s time spent on housework. In addition, they find that, in the case of promotions, the effects also hold when controlling for the paid work time of both partners, which is an indication of a change in the intra-household bargaining powers as opposed to time availability. Similarly, Fauser (2019) and Voßemer and Heyne (2019) both use German survey data and find significant short-run effects of individual unemployment on gender-specific tasks. While women are more likely to perform routine housework such as washing, cooking and cleaning after becoming unemployed, men are more likely to increase their activity in repairs and garden work following a job loss. Our study makes three major contributions to the existing literature. Firstly, we consider child care as a major part of the domestic duties in households with children, while, to the best of our knowledge, all earlier studies neglect it. Secondly, we are the first to identify long-run effects of involuntary job losses on time investments as the studies mentioned above all concentrate on short-term effects. Last but not least, we are able to analyze exogenous variation in paternal availability across the entire child upbringing, while the existing parental leave literature can only provide evidence on a selective group of fathers of young children.",1

Evidence from Mexico,June 2022,Simona Fiore,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Research in economics has extensively emphasized the critical role of the family in shaping children’s cognitive and noncognitive abilities (McLanahan and Sandefur 2009; Heckman 2006, e.g.). Early family environment can influence children’s outcomes, including educational patterns, especially during primary education, when parents take most of the decisions concerning investments in children’s human capital. The worldwide increase in the number of children growing up in non-intact families raises new concerns on the impact of families’ structure on investment in children’s education. In a context with low divorce and non-marital fertility rate, migration is among the most important determinants of family’s dissolution, with children living separated from one parent, even in cases of an unbroken wife–husband relationship. Indeed, migration during the era of the Great EmigrationFootnote 1 had been a significant factor contributing to the changes in the structure of Mexican families (Nobles 2013). The effects of family’s dissolution due to migration crucially depends on the gender of the migrant parent: gender is a significant determinant of many decisions on investments in children’s wellbeing, including inputs into education acquisition. Studies on the determinants of children’s education suggest that a mother’s human capital is more closely related to children’s educational attainment than the father’s and that maternal childcare time significantly increases a child’s schooling, especially if mothers are highly educated (Behrman et al. 1999; Datcher-Loury 1988). There is also evidence showing that income and assets managed by women have a higher impact on children’s health and education compared to being managed by men (Duflo 2003; Thomas 1990, 1994). Moreover, women today are more likely to migrate alone becoming the principal wage earners to pursue better economic conditions. As a consequence, the number of children growing up with at least one parent living abroad is increasing, especially in developing countries (Le Goff 2016; UNICEF 2007). It calls for more research on the effect of adults’ absence on children’s educational attainment, with a specific focus on the gender of the absent parent. This paper investigates the role of parents’ absence due to migration on education and labor market outcomes of children left behind in Mexico. I focus on the effect on children in families where one of the parents migrates alone to the USA. The primary outcome of interest is the years of completed education; furthermore, I also look at the effect of parental absence on the probability of doing household work and of being employed outside the household. The main contribution of the paper is to estimate the impact of parental migration based on the gender of the parent away from home. Moreover, I look at the effect of absence at different moments of a child’s educational career, specifically when children and parents have to make decisions on schooling investment, and the parent’s role and counseling are fundamental. It allows me to estimate the effect of the timing of a parent’s migration and to understand how mother’s and father’s inputs affect children’s outcomes at different ages. I use data from the 1992 and 1997 cross-sections of the National Survey of Demographic Dynamics (ENADID) and focus on movements from Mexico to the USA. The ratio of women moving from Mexico to the USA has increased over time, even if women are still less likely than men to migrate to work in the USA. Cerrutti and Massey (2001) find that the determinants of female migration has changed through the generations, suggesting common labor force motivations for the international migration of both younger men and women. Any study aiming at estimating the causal effect of a change in the family’s structure has to deal with the problem of selection. In this paper, I adopt a family fixed-effects strategy and compare siblings experiencing mother’s or father’s absence due to migration at different stages of their educational career. Siblings experience a parents’ migration at the same point in time but at different schooling stages, yielding the opportunity to define treatment and control groups within the same family. Family fixed-effects strategy has been primarily used in economics to study the effect of family’s shocks on children’s outcomes, given its advantage to capture any omitted variable related to background characteristics shared by all siblings and to deal with unobserved heterogeneity between families. In this specific context, using a family fixed-effects model allows to get rid of the problem of selection into mother’s or father’s migration, since the estimation of the impact of migration comes from the comparison between siblings who experience the same type of migration at different ages.Footnote 2 The fixed-effects model also accounts for the time-invariant unobservable endowments shared by siblings from the same family. However, with family fixed-effects models, it is not possible to control for potential time-varying shocks affecting both parental migration and children’s education. In an attempt to overcome this limitation, I run a robustness check by adding, among the control variables, an interaction term accounting for the presence of shocks at the municipal level, affecting children differently according to their ages. I also perform a placebo experiment by adding lags to the explanatory variables of interest. In both cases, results reassure the validity of the proposed identification strategy (see section “Robusteness checks”). Although the number and proportion of working children have decreased in recent years, in 2015, almost one-third of the Mexican youth who were supposed to attend the last level of compulsory education spent a large part of their time working at home or abroad. As from 1993, compulsory education in Mexico includes attendance of primary and secondary education, which means children are supposed to reach nine years of schooling.Footnote 3 However, INEE data report that during the 1990s, in Mexico, the attendance rate of children aged 6–11 (primary school) was 89.4%, and 78.6% for children aged 12–14 (secondary school). In the same period, the average years of completed schooling for the population aged 15 or older was shortly above six years (i.e., slightly more than completed primary education).Footnote 4 Even if the attendance of primary and secondary school is compulsory in Mexico, there is noncompliance with this obligation, and families have a certain degree of discretion in making decisions on children’s basic education investment. It is in line with the idea that the parents’ presence at the moment of establishing schooling choices matters for the children’s future educational outcomes. This analysis contributes to the debate about the role of mothers and fathers on children’s outcomes.Footnote 5 Children growing up in single-parent households (not only as a result of migration) suffer disadvantages, including poor school performance. However, it is still far from clear whether the mother’s absence differs from the father’s and how to disentangle the two effects. Moreover, I measure the impact of a mother’s or father’s migration on long-run children’s outcomes. The data allow me to recover episodes of parents’ migration happened at any time of their life, and I can estimate the effect on children’s outcomes as measured at the time of the survey, i.e. (even many) years after the experience of a parent’s migration. The paper also contributes to the vast literature studying the effect of parental migration on children’s education by accurately estimating the impact of the timing of a parent’s migration rather than the impact of migration per se. By exploiting variation in the time of migration within the same family, I overcome the problem of comparing migrant families with non-migrant families, and identify treated and control groups of children as those experiencing the same episode of migration but at different ages. It allows this study to contribute to the understanding of the effect of parental inputs and economic resources on children’s outcomes at different development stages. Cunha and Heckman (2008) shows that the formation of (cognitive and noncognitive) skills may be differently affected by parental inputs at different stages of life. The departure of a parent from home might have an impact not only on early ages of a child but as well as later on in life, during adolescence, when cognitive skills might not be entirely determined yet. The findings of this analysis can have important policy implications. Knowledge of the stage in the child’s educational career when the absence of a parent has a detrimental effect would allow policy-makers to design interventions that benefit individuals exposed to the most adverse conditions. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: section “Literature review” reviews the related literature; section “Data” presents data and descriptive statistics; section “Institutional setting and empirical strategy” describes the details of the institutional setting and the empirical strategy; in section “Results” results and robustness checks are discussed; section “Concluding remarks” concludes.",1

20.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,25 February 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-022-09601-1,"Telework, Wages, and Time Use in the United States",September 2022,Sabrina Wulff Pabilonia,Victoria Vernon,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Over the two decades preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of U.S. workers working from home rose steadily, propelled by advances in communications technology and an expansion of high-speed internet services (Pabilonia & Vernon, 2021). In 2017–2018, according to the American Time Use Survey Leave and Job Flexibilities (ATUS-LV) Module, 25 percent of wage and salary workers did some of their work at home, while 13 percent of workers worked exclusively from home at least once every two weeks (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). Following the declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak was a pandemic, many workers were pushed into home offices, at least temporarily, in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.Footnote 1 By early May 2020, 35 percent of employed persons reported that they had worked from home at some point in the past four weeks because of the pandemic and, according to the 2020 ATUS, 42 percent of employed persons did some work from home on days worked between May and December 2020 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021a; 2021b).Footnote 2 Many experts believe that this dramatic relocation of work from office to home because of the pandemic will have a lasting impact on the location of work. Dingel and Neiman (2020) estimate that up to 37 percent of all U.S. jobs held at the beginning of 2020 could feasibly be done entirely from home, while Barrero et al. (2020) predict that 22 percent of all full workdays will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends. This shift in the share of the labor force teleworking is likely to be permanent, because of better-than-expected experiences working from home (WFH) during the pandemic, investments in physical and human capital to support WFH, and diminished stigma associated with WFH. Thus, the post-COVID-19 era will likely be an era of telework, with many more workers working most of their workdays from home. Telework (also referred to as telecommuting or remote work) is a formal or informal arrangement that allows workers to work from home or at another location other than a traditional worksite. The flexibility allowed by telework may improve worker and family well-being if the time that would have been spent commuting can be devoted to more useful or enjoyable activities, such as social interactions, household production, or child care. Parents who work from home report that their number one reason for doing so is to coordinate their work schedule with their personal or family needs (Woods, 2020). If WFH makes workers happier and allows them to better balance their work and home responsibilities, it may lead to higher productivity and higher wages. WFH can also lead to higher productivity if workers are better able to concentrate on their job tasks in a home setting, because they are not interrupted as often by coworkers or they have eliminated their taxing commutes and/or reallocated some of their time to sleeping or other relaxing leisure activities. On the other hand, employees who choose to work from home may be different in both observable and unobservable ways from those who work at a traditional workplace, and some may be willing to accept lower wages in exchange for work location flexibility. In this paper, we use pre-COVID-19 data to answer the following two questions: (1) Do teleworkers earn higher or lower wages than office workers? and (2) Do the time-use patterns of teleworkers and office workers vary in a way that could explain observed differences in wages by teleworker status? Our paper is novel because we investigate the relationships between telework, wages, and time use by teleworking intensity while prior researchers have focused on the relationship between remote work and wages only for home-based workers (for example, Oettinger, 2011; White, 2019) or the relationship between remote work and time allocation without regard to the number of days worked at home per week (for example, Giménez-Nadal et al. 2019; Song & Gao 2020). We also examine heterogeneity in the relationship between telework and wages by gender and parental status and explore one mechanism that potentially links wages to WFH, namely the allocation of time. For our analyses, we examine these relationships using a sample of full-time wage and salary workers in white-collar occupations from the 2017–2018 ATUS-LV Module. This module allows us to determine whether a worker can work some or all their workdays exclusively from home on their main job, and how often. In our analyses, we divide regular teleworkers into two types: home-based teleworkers, who work three or more days a week exclusively from home, and occasional teleworkers, who work exclusively at home at least once every two weeks but fewer than three days a week. When we refer to office workers, we mean workers whose location of work is at a traditional worksite for their occupation and industry, which is not necessarily an office setting. By definition, office workers seldom work exclusively from home on their workday, but they may do some work at home in addition to the work they do at their worksite. To investigate whether home-based and occasional teleworkers earn a wage premium or pay a wage penalty, we first estimate log hourly wage regressions by ordinary least squares (OLS) and then test whether our estimates are robust to bias due to unobservables using an econometric technique that relates selection on observables to selection on unobservables to place bounds on the coefficient estimates on the teleworker status variables. To examine how teleworkers choose to reallocate their time savings when WFH, we compare conditional mean time use and the timing of daily activities on weekday workdays for teleworkers on home days versus office days, and also compare the time allocation of teleworkers and office workers. We then examine time use on all days to compare how time-use patterns vary by type of worker in order to investigate whether teleworkers differ from office workers in how much time they spend on various activities over the week. We find that some teleworkers earn a wage premium, but it varies by gender, parental status, and teleworking intensity. Fathers who telework earn more than fathers in office-based jobs, regardless of their teleworking intensity. Women without children who telework occasionally also earn more than their office counterparts. Finally, in industries and occupations where telework is more prevalent, mothers who are home-based teleworkers pay a wage penalty compared to mothers in office-based jobs. Using time diaries, we find differences in work patterns and hours by gender and parental status that could drive these teleworker wage differentials. Although teleworkers work less on home days, fathers work more on home and office days than men without children. On weekday workdays, women without young children who telework work even more hours than fathers who telework. When teleworking, mothers experience more interruptions in their workdays than the other worker groups, which could have negative effects on their productivity. Mothers also spend more time working in the presence of children than do fathers and less time working overall on home days. When WFH, teleworkers gain a sizeable time windfall because of a reduction in time spent on commuting and grooming activities. They spend some of this time watching TV and using the computer for leisure. However, there are also gender differences in time allocation by WFH status. Men spend more time eating meals and socializing. Women spend more time sleeping and on household production activities. When WFH, fathers spend more time on child care and more overall time with their children, and married men spend more time with their partners. Mothers also spend more time with their children, but not with their partners, nor do they increase their primary child care time. We also find evidence that teleworkers shift some of their activities across the days of the week, because on the average day, teleworkers and office workers spend similar amounts of time working for pay, watching TV, and sleeping. While most white-collar workers are working between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., teleworkers have greater flexibility in scheduling their hours on their WFH days. Fathers spend more time with their children in the hours before and after school, and women spend more time on household production and care activities during core working hours. Finally, there are some differences in sleep schedules between WFH days and office days, with teleworkers rising later in the morning on their WFH days. Overall, our findings on time use and the timing of activities suggest that teleworking enables families to better balance work and family responsibilities but may have negative effects on mothers’ productivity at work.",12

Perez-Vincent,Enrique Carreras,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Crime and violence constitute a severe development challenge for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), a region where the per-capita homicide rate is four times higher than the global average (UNODC, 2019). Violence in domestic settings, including violence against partners, family members, and close individuals, is one of the most frequent manifestations of violence. According to recent estimates, in LAC, one in four women aged 15–49 years has experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner in her lifetime (WHO, 2021). Domestic violence has several adverse effects on victims and their families: it impacts the health of newborns (Aizer, 2011); it alters victims’ economic decisions and opportunities (Borker, 2017; Siddique, 2018); and it increases the likelihood that children in the household will be abused or neglected, and that these children will reproduce violent behaviors in adulthood, extending the cycle of violence (Gage & Silvestre, 2010; Kimber et al., 2018). This wide range of effects carries high social and economic costs (Fearon & Hoeffler, 2014; Garcia-Moreno & Watts, 2011). The high prevalence of domestic violence and the magnitude of its negative consequences make its reduction a key development challenge for the region. Designing policies to reduce domestic violence effectively requires a thorough understanding of its causes. The literature has identified several factors associated with the incidence of domestic violence, mainly distinguishing between fundamental and situational factors. Fundamental (or structural) factors refer to deeply rooted economic, social, or cultural drivers of violence, such as social norms about violence tolerance, economic gender inequality, and poverty (Gibbs et al., 2020; Jewkes, 2002). Situational factors refer to circumstances that can trigger violence, such as negative economic shocks (Aizer, 2010, 2011; Anderberg et al., 2016; Bhalotra et al., 2021; Bobonis et al., 2013; Buller et al., 2018; Munyo & Rossi, 2015; Pronyk et al., 2006); stress, anxiety, frustration, and depression (Brooks et al., 2020; Card & Dahl, 2011; Munyo & Rossi, 2013); exposure to perpetrators (Dugan et al., 1999; Peterman et al., 2020); substance abuse (Abramsky et al., 2011; Angelucci, 2008; Devries et al., 2014); pollution (Herrnstadt & Muehlegger, 2015); and other environmental factors (Henke & Hsu, 2020; Sanz-Barbero et al., 2018). The mobility restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, together with the fear of contagion and voluntary social distancing, led to a drastic reduction in people’s mobility and disrupted global economic activity. These abrupt changes in social dynamics generated situational factors associated with domestic violence, leading to concern among authorities and civil society (U.N. Women 2020) and prompting several studies aimed at identifying the pandemic’s impact on domestic violence. Measuring this impact is challenging for various reasons. First, domestic violence is a complex and heterogeneous issue, and the pandemic has evolved differently in diverse countries and settings. The relationship between these two complex phenomena (domestic violence and the pandemic) has nuances and subtleties. Second, measuring this impact requires reliable data, which is challenging given the high underreporting rates of domestic violence incidents. This issue is particularly relevant in the context of the pandemic, which may have altered the incentives and opportunities for victims to report incidents and the ability of response services to record them. This complexity might explain the current ambiguous evidence on the evolution of domestic violence reporting during the pandemic: some studies showed no significant changes or found decreases (Ashby, 2020; Bullinger et al., 2021, for U.S. cities; Campedelli et al., 2020; Payne & Morgan, 2020, for Australia; Silverio-Murillo et al., 2020, for Mexico), while others found increases (Agüero, 2021, for Peru; Leslie and Wilson, 2020; Mohler et al., 2020, in the U.S.; Perez-Vincent et al., 2020, for Buenos Aires; Sanga & McCrary, 2020; Silverio-Murillo et al., 2020, for Mexico). This study estimates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the evolution of domestic violence reports using daily data for six Latin American countries: Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Uruguay. We use three types of data: calls to domestic violence hotlines (for the City of Buenos Aires in Argentina, Colombia, and Peru); calls to emergency lines (for Ecuador, Lima in Peru, and Costa Rica); and police/legal complaints (for Colombia, Ecuador, and Uruguay). To assess how the pandemic affected domestic violence reporting, we compare the daily number of reports before and after mid-March (i.e., the time of the year when the pandemic and mobility restrictions started) across multiple years.Footnote 1 Formally, we use a linear regression model with week-of-the-year dummy variables to account for seasonal movements in the number of reports and year dummy variables to account for secular trends. Using this strategy, we obtain the pandemic’s impact on domestic violence reports under the assumption that, if the pandemic had not occurred, reports would have shown a seasonal evolution as in previous years. We complement this strategy with an event study model, which allows us to assess the validity of the previous assumption and observe how the pandemic’s impact evolved. Using data through June 2020, we find that the pandemic’s impact on domestic violence reports varied significantly across countries, periods, types of violence, and reporting channels. We find an increase in calls to domestic violence hotlines (84 percent in Buenos Aires, Argentina; 127 percent in Colombia; and 16 percent in Peru) and a drop in calls to emergency lines (−16 percent in Ecuador; −10 percent in Costa Rica; and −53 percent in Lima, Peru) and police reports (−40 percent in Colombia, −41 percent in Ecuador, and −8 percent in Uruguay) from the imposition of mobility restrictions in March 2020 until June 2020. The pandemic also affected the characteristics of domestic violence reporting. First, where information on the type of violence reported was available, we find that reports of psychological violence amplified (and led) the changes observed in total reports. Second, using data on the relationship between victim and perpetrator in Buenos Aires and Uruguay, we find that the change in domestic violence reports differed depending on whether victims and perpetrators lived together or not. Finally, relying on information from the City of Buenos Aires, we identify a change in the type of institutional response provided by the domestic violence hotline. Calls that resulted in providing information accounted for most of the overall increase in calls; however, police interventions following calls also went up significantly. It is important to emphasize that the magnitude and mixed directions of these results are related to the impact that the pandemic had on the reporting (and recording) of domestic violence, not necessarily on the incidence of domestic violence events. Various factors could have affected reporting and not domestic violence itself (and vice versa). One possible explanation for the observed results is that the pandemic affected the relative incidence of different types of violence and the perceived costs and benefits of reporting them through alternative channels. These changes may have led to variations in the rate of reporting and the choice of reporting channels. Fear of contracting COVID-19 on entering a judicial process, mobility restrictions, or increased household economic insecurity may have reduced the likelihood that a person would decide to report a domestic violence incident to law enforcement authorities. The pandemic’s impact on the decision to report or not (and the choice of the channel) may also have depended on the perceived severity or type of incident. The relatively greater shifts observed in reports of psychological violence align with victims considering these types of incidents less urgent and preferring to avoid initiating legal processes in turbulent and uncertain times such as those brought on by the pandemic. Increases in calls to domestic violence hotlines suggest that this channel was best suited to respond to the demand from domestic violence victims during the pandemic. In turn, the drop in calls to comprehensive emergency lines and in legal complaints is consistent with an increase in the perceived (relative) cost of using these channels during this period. This study adds to the understanding of the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and domestic violence in various ways and delivers important policy implications. First, it provides evidence for several Latin American countries, broadening the geographic scope of this literature, which has focused primarily on the United States. Second, drawing on a rich database of domestic violence reports for several countries and reporting channels, it provides new insights into how the pandemic affected domestic violence reporting. We found that the impact of the pandemic on domestic violence reporting varied significantly depending on the type of violence reported, the relationship between victim and perpetrator, and the reporting channel used. These heterogeneous effects may help make sense of some of the ambiguous results found in the literature. The wide range of results also cautions against overstating the external validity of existing studies. It highlights the importance of examining further contexts and data sources to better understand domestic violence’s evolution during the pandemic (and obtain better insights into the drivers of domestic violence and its reporting). Finally, the findings highlight the relevance of domestic violence hotlines as an accessible and valuable service for providing institutional help to victims. During the first months of the pandemic, hotlines managed to respond to victim demand for institutional help and bring this help closer to them. This dynamic emphasizes the importance of having and strengthening domestic violence hotlines. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II summarizes the available evidence on the impact of the pandemic on domestic violence and highlights the challenges faced by such studies. Section III describes the databases used. Section IV comments briefly on the mobility restrictions imposed in each of the countries included in the analysis. Section V explains the empirical method used to estimate the impact of the pandemic on domestic violence reporting. Section VI describes the impact on reporting frequency, and Section VII describes the changes in reporting characteristics. The final section presents the main conclusions of the study.",4

Gay men encounter unique challenges such as exclusion, bullying, and poverty (Badgett 2020; Drydakis and Zimmermann 2020; OECD 2019; Drydakis 2019; Hammarstedt et al. 2015; Oreffice 2011; Zavodny 2008). A 2021 meta-analysis found that, between 1991–2018, gay and bisexual men, earned less than heterosexual men (Drydakis 2021). There are scarce data sets capturing socioeconomic patterns for LGBTIQ+ people, and Greece is no exception (Drydakis 2019). For instance, the first European field experiment on gay men’s labor market prospects took place in Greece between 2006 and 2007 (Drydakis 2009). Since then, no further field research was conducted in the country, making it impossible to assess whether a change in gay men’s societal approval and labor market outcomes occurred. Assessing whether discrimination drives inferior labor market outcomes for minority population groups has drawn the attention of economists for decades (Badgett 2020; Neumark 2018). Based on the taste for discrimination theory (Becker 1957; 1993), employers might want to maintain a physical distance from certain minority groups because they dislike transacting with them. The theory indicates that discrimination coefficients incorporate the influence of characteristics unrelated to productivity, such as homophobic attitudes against gay men (Drydakis 2014). Moreover, the theory indicates that if employers are homophobic, they might pay minorities lower wages for similar productivity to compensate for the psychological loss they experience in associating with members of such groups. If the distastes for the gay men is high enough, employers might decide not to employ them in their firms. The statistical discrimination theory (Phelps 1972; Arrow 1973; 1998) proposes that the usage of average group characteristics to predict individual productivity and set corresponding wages can incorrectly evaluate the productivity of workers who are atypical of their minority demographic characteristic. If employers’ uncertainty regarding gay men’s productivity and work commitment is strong, they might decide not to employ gay men to their works. These acts are not based specifically on distastes toward a class of individuals but rather are grounded in what the employers believe to be valid inferences about productivity. For instance, if gay men do not conform to traditional gender norms related to masculinity and leadership, such a situation might result in unfavorable evaluations (Drydakis 2015a). This study aims to offer updated Greek patterns by replicating Drydakis (2009). Utilizing the same protocol as the original study in 2006–2007, two follow-up field experiments took place in 2013–2014 and 2018–2019. The present study contributes to the literature. This is the first paper to replicate the protocol of a previously conducted correspondence test to assess whether a minority population group performs better or worse six years and eleven years respectively after the original study. Hence, the present study proposes an assessment of potential changes in labor market experiences by replicating the research protocol of previously conducted evaluations. Moreover, by approaching the recruiters in each of the three experiments, this study captures their attitudes toward gay men. Such a feature enables an empirical assessment of whether recruiters’ attitudes bear a relationship with gay men’s access to occupations and wage sorting. This is the first field experiment on sexual orientation to collect related information with a view to capturing critical insights, such as by quantifying the association between different predictions of discrimination (taste- and statistical-discrimination) on gay men’s access to occupations. Identifying potential driven factors of workplace bias against gay men should be of interest to policy-makers. The findings of the present study indicate that in 2013–2014 and 2018–2019 gay men experience occupational access constraints and wage sorting in vacancies offering lower remuneration. The outcomes posit that, in 2013–2014 and 2018–2019, gay men experienced increasing biased treatments compared to these in 2006–2007. Moreover, the outcomes indicate that monthly unemployment is associated with occupational access constraints and wage sorting in vacancies offering lower remuneration for gay men. Furthermore, the study provides insights indicating an increase in recruiters’ taste- and statistical- discrimination attitudes against gay men which might be correlated with decreased labor market prospects for gay men. The study indicates that a gay rights backlash due to LGBTIQ+ group’s attempt to advance its agenda, a rising level of far-right rhetoric and increasing prejudice associated with the Greek economic crisis might bear a relationship with increasing biased treatments against gay men. Changes in legislation are likely to impact social attitudes (Drabble et al. 2021). Possible effects could range from actions to rescind rights to the potential expansion of rights (Drabble et al. 2021). In Greece, the legalization of same-sex partnerships in 2015 might have caused a negative reaction that adversely affected gay men. Moreover, due to economic struggles and anxiety over the Greek economic recession, a far-right political party gained ground in the 2012 (7%) and 2015 (9.4%) parliamentary elections. This party embraced the following components: militant nationalism, the exaltation of virility, and racism (Psarras 2015; Papadimitriou 2014). Homosexuality was perceived as shameful and socially deviant, and LGBTIQ+ people became the ‘shame’ of the nation (Racist Violence Recording Network 2018; Papanikolaou 2018; Eleftheriadis 2017; 2015; Sroiter 2014; Carastathis 2015). The rising far-right rhetoric might have contributed to homophobic attitudes. Additionally, economic struggles can trigger uncertainty and kindle animosity (Baker et al. 2016; Bianchi 2016). International studies evaluated that prejudices against minorities are counter-cyclical and rise during periods of higher unemployment for majorities (Vargas et al. 2018; Bianci et al., 2018; Jayadev and Johnson 2017; Mayda 2006). In Greece, rising economic pressures and unemployment might bear an association with biases toward gay men. In the present context, the gay rights backlash and far-right rhetoric are empirically indistinguishable from prejudices related to economic conditions. Fluctuations in homophobia and gay men’s labor market prospects should interest policy-makers attempting to address the circumstances of groups that suffer workplace disadvantages. The remainder of the study is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review on Greek patterns on the subject matter domain, and experimental techniques to capture labor market discrimination. Section 3 presents the study’s experimental design and the data gathering process. Section 4 presents descriptive statistics. Section 5 presents the estimates. The final section provides a discussion and concludes the study.",9
20.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,02 December 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-021-09591-6,Non cognitive skills and childcare attendance,December 2022,Daniela Del Boca,Enrica Maria Martino,Chiara Pronzato,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Empirical evidence from the literature in economics and psychology has shown that early investments in education have a positive and significant impact on child development and contribute to beneficial outcomes later in life. One of the most important inputs in the production function of child development is maternal time (see, e.g., Bernal (2008)). In recent decades, women’s participation in the labor market has risen in most countries, meaning that mothers are spending less time with their children and that families are relying more on external sources of childcare. Consequently, a growing number of studies have focused on how well early-childcare services serve as a substitute for parental time and what impact they have on later child outcomes. The majority of such studies have considered the impact of childcare on child cognitive outcomes. Children’s ability in areas such as literacy and numeracy are usually measured by test scores, grades, drop-out rates, and average years of schooling completed. In addition to cognitive skills, there are also other outcomes that have been examined, which include sets of attitudes and behaviors, often referred to as socio-emotional abilities. Non cognitive or “soft skills” have been broadly defined as representing the “patterns of thought, feelings and behavior” (Borghans et al., 2008) of individuals that may continue to develop throughout their lives. They cover a range of abilities such as conscientiousness, perseverance, and patience, contributing to the development of cognitive skills throughout early childhood and directly impacting labor market outcomes (Heckman et al., 2006; Attanasio et al., 2020; Agostinelli et al., 2019; Cunha & Heckman, 2008). In fact, non-cognitive skills are found to be as important for school enrollment decisions as cognitive skills. Heckman and Cunha (2007) find that non-cognitive skills promote the formation of cognitive skills but not vice versa. Since non cognitive skills matter greatly and can be nurtured in schools, developing them should be an explicit goal of public education. In Heckman’s human capital models, non cognitive skills play important roles (Heckman, 2000). Compared to cognitive skills, socio-emotional skills are considered to be more malleable for longer periods of time and may help in explaining the beneficial effects found on later educational attainment, earnings, and propensity to engage in crime (Duncan & Magnuson, 2013; Heckman & Kautz, 2012). A recent line of research has increasingly acknowledged the importance of these skills and included them in numerous surveys and empirical analyses (Almond & Currie, 2011; Kautz et al., 2014). In the following section we discuss some important studies from Anglo-Saxon and European countries that have specifically analyzed the impact of childcare on children’s socio-emotional outcomes.",

Both families and school play a vital role in this process by bolstering or harming children’s skills, which are predictors of later outcomes in several domains (Lundberg, 1993; Hill et al., 2001; Case et al., 2005; Leschied et al., 2008; Francesconi et al., 2010). The effects of attending formal childcare on younger children have been thoroughly investigated, as have the effects of school quality on older children.Footnote 1 However, children are also exposed to other development opportunities. The hours between the end of school and bedtime are often filled with various activities that can promote different skills. These activities may be more or less structured (e.g. participating in team sports versus playing freely in the park), geared towards educational enrichment or social activities, and they can be performed alone, with other children (friends, siblings, cousins) or adults (parents, grandparents, instructors). Understanding the effects of such activities is important because they contribute to children’s development and may be possible sources of inequality among children from different socio-economic backgrounds. Notably, it has been shown that inequality in socio-emotional skills has increased in the UK over the past 30 years, with the socio-economic status of mothers being a significant contributing factor (Attanasio et al., 2020). As part of the broader discussion of the importance of childhood conditions for an individual’s development, the key question central to our analysis is how time allocation influences children’s non-cognitive development. Particularly, we study the effects of time use on emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems and prosocial behaviour at ages 7 and 11, using data from the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) (UK). We consider time spent outside regular school time: with parents, in extra-curricular activities (music, sports, extra classes) as well as less structured activities, such as going to the library, attending religious services, reading, watching TV, playing electronic games and performing small chores around the house, such as tidying up or caring for pets. To study the effects of time allocation on children’s non-cognitive outcomes at ages 7 and 11, we apply a cumulative value-added model. Subsequently, we test the sensitivity of our results to possible endogeneity issues resulting from unobserved variables, reverse causality and measurement error due to the inclusion of past behavioural indicators in the model. To handle the omitted variable bias, we apply a method developed by Oster (2019) to produce bias-adjusted estimates and bind the coefficients of interest in the presence of such omitted variable bias. To address reverse causality, we leverage the panel dimension of the data, including only lagged activities. The bias due to the inclusion of lag outcomes is handled through an instrumental variable approach. Finally, we complement our analysis with a fixed-effects approach, which allows us to consider unobservable time-invariant characteristics but does not permit estimation of age-specific effects. The results show that time spent on sports, studying, reading, doing small chores around the house and time spent actively with parents are beneficial for the development of children’s socio-emotional skills, while video-screen time and extra hours spent at school are detrimental. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that the allocation of children’s time is important not only for cognitive but also for non-cognitive development, in line with some of the results on parental inputs (Moroni et al., 2019) and with studies on the impact of individual activities (Hille & Schupp, 2015). Although we explored possible heterogeneities in the effects of some child characteristics (socio-economic status, gender, nationality and family composition), we found no significant differences. This study contributes to the literature in three specific ways: focusing on non-cognitive outcomes (rather than cognitive ones); studying the effects of several activities (rather than a single activity); and considering activities conducted not only with parents but also independently and with other children. Focusing on non-cognitive development is crucial and forms the basis of this study. The literature documents that these skills are at least as important as cognitive ones not only for future educational and labour market outcomes but also risky adolescent behaviour and health-related outcomes (Heckman & Rubinstein, 2001; Cunha & Heckman, 2008; Prevoo & ter Weel, 2015; Attanasio et al., 2020). Non-cognitive skills also influence learning abilities and cognitive development (Almlund et al., 2011). The seminal work by Heckman & Rubinstein (2001) led empirical studies to investigate the impact of childhood conditions on non-cognitive development. Particularly, it has been shown that non-cognitive skills are improved by good parental investments such as income and material resources, cognitive stimulation, parental interpersonal skills, parenting style and breastfeeding (Cunha & Heckman, 2008; Borra et al., 2012; Cunha et al., 2013; Heckman & Kautz, 2013; Fletcher & Wolfe, 2016; Doyle et al., 2017; Moroni et al., 2019). Studying the relationship between time allocation and non-cognitive development is important because non-cognitive skills can be highly sensitive to the impact of extra-curricular activities. Qualitative studies have suggested that since the emphasis at school is on academic attainment, out-of-school activities provide children who perform poorly at school with opportunities to feel capable, thus increasing their self-esteem and wellbeing (Callanan et al., 2016). It also allows children to make and interact with new friends, and this may have possible consequences on social outcomes. Therefore, understanding if there is a link between time allocation and non-cognitive development is highly relevant, as it could shape the way policy-makers and educational institutions intervene in designing the supply of such activities. Moreover, the increasing importance of extra-curricular activities may have different impacts according to socio-economic background, and thus can be a source of increased socio-emotional inequalities that call for intervention by policy-makers. The second focus of this study is on the effects of several activities, whereas it is more common in the literature to find studies considering a single activity (e.g. reading, sport, music or computer and TV use).Footnote 2 A few studies used data from children’s time diaries to explore the full range of activities, such as the one by Hofferth & Sandberg (2001), Fiorini & Keane (2014) and Caetano et al. (2019). Hofferth & Sandberg (2001) used data from the 1997 US Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) (around 2000 children aged 0–12) and found that time devoted to learning activities such as reading is positively correlated with high school achievement, as is structured time spent playing sports or on social activities. Additionally, time spent eating meals with the family is associated with fewer behavioural problems. Fiorini & Keane (2014) used time use diaries from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (around 1300 children aged 4–9) to consider the overall impact of time use and to study the trade-off between the benefits of alternative activities. The result of their study is a ranking of activities from the most to the least beneficial: time spent on educational activities, particularly with parents, was the most productive for cognitive skill development. However, they found that non-cognitive skills are insensitive to alternative time allocations. Caetano et al. (2019) also used the time diaries from the Child Development Supplement of the 2002 and 2007 PSID to estimate the effect of family time inputs on cognitive skills, applying an exogeneity test developed by Caetano (2015).Footnote 3 Their study provided a different classification of activities from those in previous studies (and our own), aggregating them into active and passive time with different individuals. They reported that active time with an adult family member (parents or grandparents) induces an increase in cognitive skills.Footnote 4 Hofferth & Sandberg (2001), Fiorini & Keane (2014) and Caetano et al. (2019) represented the ideal benchmark for our study, but unluckily we do not have time use diaries at our disposal. This means that—despite considering a large set of different activities—we lack the data to evaluate the trade-off between them. The differences between our results and previous findings in the literature are discussed in the Results section. The third contribution of this study is to consider the effects of time allocation beyond parental time on child development. Todd & Wolpin (2007) used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to estimate the effect of parental and school inputs on child cognitive abilities. Parental input was represented by an index that considers parental stimulation and involvement and the toys and learning materials available. The results show that parental inputs have positive effects on children’s cognitive development. The effect of parental time is also the focus of three studies using data from the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (US). Carneiro & Rodriguez (2009) found that children (especially ages 3–6) who spend more time with their mothers perform better on cognitive tests. Hsin & Felfe (2014) found that working mothers spend less time with their children, but only on unstructured activities, and what counts instead for child cognitive development and positive behaviour is the time spent engaging in educational activities together. Finally, Del Boca et al. (2017) considered the combined effect of spending time doing beneficial activities independently or together with their parents on children of different ages. They found that time spent independently on these activities in adolescence has a positive effect on cognitive outcomes, whereas time spent with the mother is more important for younger children. Among the studies of parental time inputs, the most similar to this study regarding data and analysis techniques is Del Bono et al. (2016). Their study aimed to identify the effect of time spent with the mother (divided into recreational time and educational time) at the ages of 3, 5 and 7 on children’s cognitive skills and behavioural difficulties. The goal of our study is to investigate the effect of different uses of time, grouped into seven categories (among which is time spent with parents) on the non-cognitive development of older children aged 7 and 11, ages at which time with parents is reduced and time increases in other activities. Furthermore, non-cognitive skills are treated separately and prosocial behaviour is also considered. This study is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the MCS, the selection of the sample and the variables used throughout the analyses. Section 3 presents the methods employed for the empirical analysis. Section 4 contains the results and the robustness checks. Section 5 presents the conclusions.",2
20.0,4.0,Review of Economics of the Household,27 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-022-09627-5,Parental involvement and neighborhood quality: evidence from public housing demolitions in Chicago,December 2022,Joel Kaiyuan Han,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Differences in parenting behavior have been linked to gaps in child achievement and later-life outcomes (Cunha et al., 2010; Pavan, 2016; Waldfogel & Washbrook, 2011), and it is well established that “inequality begins at home” (Kalil, 2015). Differences in parenting may either reinforce or offset existing disparities between children, depending on the exact nature of these disparities (Porter & Fan, 2019). Furthermore, parenting behavior is likely to respond to changes in the socioeconomic environment or the introduction of policies affecting child development. A number of studies have found parenting behavior responses to changes to the school or preschool environment (Gelber & Isen, 2013; Avvisati et al., 2014; Fryer et al., 2015; Bergman, 2016; Fredriksson et al., 2016). In contrast, less is known about the context of residential neighborhoods. In this paper, I determine how parental involvement responds to changes in neighborhood quality. Parental involvement refers to the time and effort a parent expends on the care, discipline and supervision of the child. Neighborhood quality is a catch-all term that refers to the overall influence of the neighborhood environment on child development. This includes peer influences of other children and adults within the neighborhood, as well as the quality of neighborhood amenities and institutions (e.g., schools). This paper attempts to answer the following questions: Do parents respond significantly to changing neighborhood quality through parental involvement? If so, what direction does this response take? A priori, it is unclear whether parents will reinforce or offset the impact of neighborhood environment: there are plausible arguments for either direction. Finally, do parental responses vary across parents, especially across lines of relative advantage/disadvantage? If so, this might imply an unequal impact of neighborhood change on children experiencing the same change to neighborhood quality. In answering these questions, the main empirical difficulty arises from selection of residential neighborhoods. Parents choose neighborhoods of residence based on many unobserved factors that could potentially change over time. The same unobserved factors may also directly influence parenting behavior, leading to omitted variables bias. To address this issue, this paper makes use of a prominent housing policy change that altered neighborhoods around Chicago: the large-scale administrative closure and subsequent demolition of high-rise public housing projects by the public housing authority. Specifically, this paper studies the spillover effects of these closures on other neighborhoods in Chicago, most of which did not contain any public housing projects. A likely (though not exclusive) channel for these effects was physical relocations: residents from closed housing projects were displaced into other neighborhoods, leading to measurable short-run increases in crime rate for those neighborhoods (Aliprantis & Hartley, 2015). In this paper, I first quantify the spillover effects of the public housing demolitions on parents in neighborhood receiving relocations, in terms of parental involvement and the likelihood of remaining in the neighborhood. I use a sample of families from the Project for Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN): a longitudinal study of households living in Chicago, conducted between the years 1994 and 2001. None of these households lived in public housing at the time of the survey, and most lived a considerable distance away from closure sites. Therefore, any local impacts of public housing closures (e.g., the disruption of building demolition activity) on the sample is likely to have been minimal. Precise data on the relocation movements of displaced residents is not available. Instead, I approximate the number of relocations into a neighborhood by combining two different sources of information. The first source is a survey of the current residential neighborhoods of ex-public housing residents, and the second is a list of closure volumes and dates for all mandated demolitions. I generate an approximated number of incoming relocations using a standard shift-share approach. Using this approximated measure, I find evidence that incoming relocations lead to increased parental involvement one year later. However, there is little evidence that these impacts persist beyond that. I also estimate the effect of relocations on the likelihood that a family remains in the receiving neighborhood. The pattern of coefficients is reversed for this outcome, suggesting that parents respond to relocations by increasing the intensity of parenting behavior in the short run, and by moving out of the neighborhood in the long run. In the remainder of the paper, I use this setting to study the causal effect of unexpected neighborhood quality declines on parental involvement. Guided by the descriptive results, attention is restricted to the short run: when moving out of the neighborhood appears to be infeasible. The measure of relocations described above is prone to concerns of reverse causation. For example, displaced public housing residents might have selected relocation destinations based on trends in average parental involvement or other changes in destination neighborhood characteristics. To address this issue, I formulate an instrumental variable describing the likely impact of closures on receiving neighborhoods, based on historical racial composition. This variable is defined as the product of last year’s total closures in all other Chicago neighborhoods and the historical Black share of the receiving neighborhood. Variation in this instrument comes from effectively two sources. The first source of variation is the overall volume of closures in a given year. I argue that fluctuations in closure volume were difficult to anticipate by households in receiving neighborhoods. The second source of variation in the instrument is spatial: the impact of any given set of closures was unevenly distributed across receiving neighborhoods with different racial composition. For example, in terms of physical relocations, displaced households faced many difficulties when attempting to move into predominantly white neighborhoods, resulting in high-minority neighborhoods receiving a disproportionate share of relocations (Oakley & Burchfield, 2009). Thus, neighborhoods with historically high Black shares are likely to have been more sensitive to closures. The validity of this instrument requires the following exclusion restriction: across neighborhoods of different historical Black shares, any differences in the evolution of unobserved parenting incentives must be uncorrelated with fluctuations in yearly closure levels. I evaluate this assumption by examining changes in observable parental characteristics across different baseline neighborhoods. While initial values of parental characteristics are strongly correlated with neighborhood Black share, conditional on initial values, subsequent changes in these characteristics appear to be uncorrelated. The latter finding suggests that the exclusion restriction is plausible: as long as unobserved parent characteristics behave similarly, the exclusion restriction will be satisfied. I also supplement the baseline estimates with robustness specifications including additional control variables and perform falsification tests using non-parenting outcomes. In both cases, I find no evidence of exclusion restriction violations. For the empirical analysis, neighborhood crime rates are used as the measure of neighborhood quality. The main motivation for this variable choice is data quality: as one of the only measures that are updated at an annual frequency, neighborhood crime rate quickly reflects short-term fluctuations in neighborhood quality. Effectively, the regression analysis in this paper amounts to estimating the effect of neighborhood crime on parental involvement. However, because the empirical strategy only accounts for residential selection and not correlated neighborhood attributes, the results should not be interpreted as the effect of altering neighborhood crime while holding all other neighborhood variables constant. Instead, neighborhood crime rate is used as a proxy for the overall influence of the neighborhood on the child, which is difficult to define and measure. Even with this complication, the results are informative under some reasonable assumptions. Under a relatively weak assumption—that neighborhood crime changes in the opposite direction as overall neighborhood quality—the sign of the estimated coefficient will describe whether parents compensate or reinforce changes in neighborhood quality. Under a stronger assumption—that a one standard deviation increase in neighborhood crime reflects a one standard deviation decrease in neighborhood quality—the estimated effect size also accurately reflects the size of the overall neighborhood quality effect. The main findings are summarized below: first, parental involvement increases on average when neighborhood quality (measured using log neighborhood crime) falls. A standard deviation decrease in neighborhood quality results in parental involvement that is roughly 1 standard deviation higher, relative to parents with a child of similar age. This is a substantial effect size: framed another way, the increase in parental involvement resulting from a 0.2 standard deviation decrease in neighborhood quality is roughly equal to the gap between a high school dropout parent and a parent with at least a high school degree. By analyzing subsets of parenting behavior, I find that these effects are largely driven by an increase in positive parent-child interactions, such as regular conversations. Applying the same method, I estimate the overall effect of neighborhood quality on child behavior. These estimates do not distinguish between the direct impact of neighborhood environment and the mediating effect of parenting behavior. The results show mixed effects of neighborhood quality: neighborhood decline improves child achievement test scores and has no significant impact on problematic child behavior. This counter-intuitive result highlights the importance of accounting for parental mediation. The second finding is that parental involvement responses are heterogenous: not all parents respond in the same manner to changing neighborhood quality. Most notably, the direction of the parental involvement response depends on the initial level of involvement. Parents with high initial involvement raise parental involvement in response to declines in neighborhood quality. In contrast, parents with the lowest initial involvement reduce involvement even more. This suggests that neighborhood decline may magnify within-neighborhood inequality in child outcomes. There is a large literature (reviewed by Chyn & Katz (2021)) estimating the effects of residential neighborhoods on adults and children. This literature predominantly finds the existence of neighborhood effects on long-run adulthood outcomes of affected children, using both experimental (Chetty et al., 2016) and quasi-experimental methods (Chyn, 2018; Wodtke et al., 2011). Despite this, other research finds that policy interventions to improve neighborhood conditions for disadvantaged groups have surprisingly small effects on short-run outcomes. For example, in the Moving to Opportunity experiment, Kling et al. (2007) use randomly assigned housing vouchers to estimate the causal effects of moving to a better neighborhood. They find improvements to the mental health of female but not male children, and virtually no improvement to educational achievement. Clampet-Lundquist et al. (2011) find multiple channels that could contribute to the gender difference, including neighborhood norms, interactions with peers, daily routines, and interactions with father figures. This paper suggests that, among other reasons, neighborhood-based interventions may have small effects due to mediating reductions in parenting behavior. Assuming that more parental involvement is beneficial to child development, the short-run direct impact of neighborhood quality on child outcomes—holding parental involvement constant—could be more positive than previous studies have found. Another prominent strand of literature, summarized by Doepke et al. (2019), studies the choice of parenting style and its interaction with neighborhood and other environmental factors. This literature distinguishes between authoritarian, authoritative and permissive parenting styles (Doepke & Zilibotti, 2017). Of these, the parental involvement measure in this paper most closely corresponds to the authoritative parenting style, which is characterized by high engagement and time investment. Within this strand, Agostinelli et al. (2020) study parental choices related to influencing a child’s peer group as well as over direct investment in skill formation, in the context of disparities in neighborhood income and peer effects. Relative to this paper, while they study outcomes in equilibrium, I study the immediate response to a negative environmental shock. I also study a group of children that is younger on average (0–14 years), while they study children at middle school age and above. At younger ages, parental engagement is likely to be of critical importance relative to other dimensions of parenting style. Finally, I explicitly document parental adjustments in terms of residential location. These findings of this paper also address the consequences of public housing closures, a prominent part of public housing policy in 1990s and 2000s. Multiple studies have examined the impact of administrative closures and other interventions that relocated tenants out of public housing projects. Most of these limit attention to the impacts on the displaced public housing residents themselves (Jacob, 2004; Chyn, 2018; Andersson et al., 2016; Jacob et al., 2015). Given the large scale of public housing demolitions, which resulted in 250,000 units demolished nationwide since the 1990s (Austen, 2018), and given the federal government’s support for demolitions through initiatives such as the Plan for Transformation, such spillover effects are likely to exist in many U.S. cities. While spillover effects on receiving neighborhood crime rate have been documented previously (Aliprantis & Hartley, 2015; Sandler, 2017), this study shows how these neighborhood impacts were transmitted into families. Even if children in receiving neighborhoods did not show adverse impacts to their outcomes, this may have come at a significant cost to their parents (a potentially vulnerable population themselves) in terms of time investment and stress. In a closely related study, Patacchini and Zenou (2011) use initial assignment to public housing in the United Kingdom to study neighborhood effects on parenting behavior. Their overall findings are very different from mine: where I find that parental involvement increases in response to a neighborhood quality decline, they find the opposite effect. Aside from geographical differences, the major difference between the two samples is the selection into public housing. To my knowledge, this is the first study of the research question using a sample that has not selected into public housing. Finally, while this paper does not aim to separately identify causal channels linking neighborhoods and parenting behavior, there is a body of research that suggests what these channels might be. First, the neighborhood environment directly impacts child behaviors, including substance use (Nakajima, 2007), dropping out of school (Gaviria & Raphael, 2001), absenteeism, disciplinary problems (Imberman et al., 2012), and crime (Case & Katz, 1991). This may in turn change the parent’s marginal utility of improving child behavior, as would be the case if parents have anchored expectations about the child’s eventual educational attainment (Fan & Chen, 2001). Alternatively, the marginal utility of parenting behavior could be affected by the behavior of other parents through the process of norm setting (Green et al., 2007). Another potential channel is the effect of neighborhood quality on the productivity of parental involvement. The direction of this effect depends on whether parents and neighborhoods are technical complements or substitutes. This question remains largely unresolved, although associational patterns in the context of schools suggest that school resources and parental involvement are substitutes (Hoffmann & Dufur, 2008). Finally, neighborhood quality is likely to affect the marginal cost of parenting effort through its impact on adult stress and well-being (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2003; Kling et al., 2007). In the 1990s, public housing run by the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) was described as the “most troubled in the nation” (Terry, 1995). Public housing projects were areas of highly concentrated economic disadvantage and crime (Chicago Tribune, 2002). In response to the deteriorating situation, the federal government took over the management of Chicago public housing in 1995 (Terry, 1995). During this takeover, around 18,000 units of public housing were found to be unsustainable and were marked for demolition (The Economist, 1998). Since then, at least 20,000 public housing units have been demolished, which represents over half of the 1995 stock of public housing (Bennett et al., 2015). Early closures were unplanned and occurred in response to building-specific breakdowns that severely affected habitability (Jacob, 2004). One example of such events is when a building entirely lost heating in the middle of winter (Garza, 1999). In subsequent years, the federally-funded Plan for Transformation was developed to reduce the building stock of high-rise low-income public housing and transition toward mixed-income developments (Popkin et al., 2000). The Plan for Transformation was well known and the need for public housing reform had long been recognized (Popkin et al., 2000). This raises concerns that the closures were anticipated by PHDCN households and hence do not constitute a valid natural experiment. However, two details about the situation are relevant in mitigating this concern. First, the study period of the PHDCN (1994–2001) barely overlaps with the launch of the plan in 2000. Hence, all PHDCN subjects were initially observed well in advance of the plan’s launch, and the closures affecting them mostly fell outside the plan’s scope. While a minority of these closures occurred after 2000, they occurred at the very start of its implementation. Second, even for closures that were part of the plan, public opposition led to substantial deviation from the publicized timeline. Various legal and administrative challenges from affected residents have been documented (Bennett et al., 2015; Hunt, 2009): these resulted in frequent and often lengthy delays between proposed and actual dates of closure. For example, the Lathrop Homes were ordered demolished as early as 2006, but some housing units were still occupied by residents as late as 2012 (Moser, 2012). When these closures occurred, displaced residents were relocated in two ways. The majority of displaced residents were offered Section 8 housing vouchers to assist with finding housing on the private market. Others were relocated into alternative public housing projects (Bennett et al., 2015). Consequently, the destination neighborhoods of displaced households should be thought of as a deliberate choice, made either by the displaced household or the public housing authority. At the same time, these choices are likely to have been constrained. Displaced households faced constraints like the spatial concentration of affordable housing (Oakley & Burchfield, 2009), discrimination from potential landlords, rushed relocations and insufficient information about destination neighborhoods (Thompson, 2006).Footnote 1 The major constraint faced by the public housing authority was the long waitlist for housing at other developments.",1

Zimmer,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper seeks to investigate the relationship between poverty and marital separation. In addition to the usual problems of unobserved heterogeneity in non-experimental data, the observed link between poverty and marital separation might be contaminated if marital troubles (or poverty), once present, feed back to probabilities of future poverty (or marital separation). The econometric approach adopts a dynamic random intercept panel model developed by Wooldridge (2000) that accommodates both unobserved heterogeneity and feedback effects. The main finding is that a substantial portion of the link between poverty and separation appears to derive spuriously from unobserved factors that affect both outcomes. However, even after accounting for dynamics and unobserved heterogeneity, there remains a strong association between the arrival of poverty and marital separation. A large swath of research, scattered across many academic disciplines, has attempted to estimate whether poverty relates to various socioeconomic measures, including subjective wellbeing (Clark et al., 2015), social relations (Mood & Jonsson, 2016), childhood development (Guo & Harris, 2000), and teenage pregnancy (Harding, 2003). The links between poverty and marital separation have received somewhat less attention. A handful of studies appear to establish a link between economic hardship and marital separation (Becker et al., 1977; Charles & Stephens, 2004; Chiappori et al., 2018; González-Val & Marcén, 2017). By contrast, Dew et al. (2012), using a causal mediation analysis, argue that those effects largely owe to omitted variable bias. The relationship between poverty and marital disruption is potentially muddled by several confounding phenomena. First, unobserved factors might simultaneously push a person into poverty while at the same time destabilizing his or her marriage. For example, a health problem could simultaneously deplete a person of his or her financial resources, while also causing marital stress. In this example, it is the health problem, rather than financial troubles per se, that drives marital separation. A second econometric challenge is that one outcome might “feed back” to future states of the other outcome. As an example, in considering the effect of poverty on marital separation, separation, once present, might influence future poverty states. A reason for suspecting such feedback is that, not only does marital separation often require hiring attorneys, but the separation process itself also might require significant time, possibly reducing a person’s number of available work hours. Furthermore, marital separation might cut a person off from spousal income sources and subject the person to the vagaries of the legal process involving spousal support. Add these reasons to the possible psychological toll of divorce, and there are reasons to suspect that marital troubles might lead to financial stress. Indeed, a sizable literature documents the extent to which marital disruption leads to financial troubles (Amato, 2000; Andreß & Bröckel, 2007; Bane & Ellwood, 1986; Bedard & Deschênes, 2005; Colletta, 1979; Depew & Price, 2018; Leopold, 2018; Smock et al., 1999; Stevens, 1994). Wooldridge (2000) shows that, in dynamic panel models, feedback effects, if present in the data but ignored during estimation, tend to impart bias on estimates of key model parameters of interest. This paper adopts his proposed solution, which involves specifying the joint distribution of poverty and separation, and then using that joint distribution as the basis for likelihood-based estimation. The method, despite being fairly intuitive statistically, has not seen widespread use, though it has appeared in studies of poverty (Biewen, 2009), health insurance (Zimmer, 2010), and education (Welsch & Zimmer, 2015). Initially, the main focus of this paper will center on the influence of poverty on marital separation. Results suggest that, after accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and dynamics, the observed effect of poverty on separation shrinks by about one-half among females, and the effect completely vanishes among males. However, a similar dynamic feedback setup that flips the order of causation—that is, allowing marital separation to directly affect poverty—produces a similar set of conclusions. Taken together, these findings suggest that a sizable part of the link between poverty and marital instability owes to certain person-specific traits that are difficult or impossible to measure in household survey data. Moreover, these results offer evidence that poverty and marital separation often arrive concurrently, even after accounting for observed confounders, unobserved heterogeneity, and dynamic intricacies. Consequently, it is not clear, either a priori or ex post, which one causes the other. The concluding section of this paper argues that this puzzle might be partially solved if government surveys recorded socioeconomic measures at frequencies higher that the commonly employed annual and biennial.",

Given the traditionally lower participation rates among women, encouraging female labor force participation while maintaining or increasing fertility is central to achieving these objectives. However, besides significant increases in female labor supply in the last century, women still supply fewer hours on average than men. Furthermore, they are often the ones reducing working hours or leaving the labor market, at least temporarily, to care for children (Angrist & Evans, 1998; Bloom et al., 2009). In couple households, women also tend to do most of the household work, irrespective of how much they contribute to household income (Bittman et al., 2003). For this and other reasons, the impact of increases in female labor supply on women’s quality of life is not clear. On the one hand, employment has many benefits, including an improvement in the families’ financial situation and female empowerment (Darity & Goldsmith, 1996; Lundberg & Pollak, 1996). On the other hand, women, particularly those with children, could experience a reduction in subjective well-being due to the stresses of having to reconcile (full-time) employment with family responsibilities (Williams et al., 1991; Guendouzi, 2006). In this case, policies designed to increase female labor market participation would have a hidden cost in addition to or instead of the aforementioned potential benefits. In the economic literature, the determinants of subjective well-being are usually studied using data based on life satisfaction questions in large-scale household surveys. Responding to these questions requires a cognitive process, such as constructing a relevant reference point and comparing the own situation to it. Thus, these questions provide a (global) measure of the cognitive component of subjective well-being (Diener et al., 1985). The life satisfaction literature has largely come to the consensus that unemployment is detrimental to cognitive well-being, particularly for men (Winkelmann & Winkelmann, 1998; Haller & Hadler, 2006; Kassenboehmer & Haisken‐DeNew, 2009; Knabe & Rätzel, 2011; Baetschmann et al., 2015). While it has been suggested that women are affected less by unemployment (Gerlach & Stephan, 1996; Clark et al., 2008a; Van der Meer, 2014), not all findings point in this direction (Kassenboehmer & Haisken‐DeNew, 2009). Furthermore, the evidence on a variety of other labor market statuses, such as homemaking and part-time employment, is mixed (Stutzer & Frey, 2006; Haller & Hadler, 2006; Clark et al., 2008a; Booth & van Ours, 2008/2009; Treas et al., 2011; Berger, 2013; Álvarez & Miles-Touya, 2016; Hamplová, 2019). Similarly, there is no consensus on the relationship between parenthood and subjective well-being (Stanca, 2012; Umberson et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2013; Myrskylä & Margolis, 2014; Nelson et al., 2014; Baetschmann et al., 2016; Negraia & Augustine, 2020). In addition, when considering measures of the affective component of subjective well-being, i.e., measures based on emotions experienced throughout the day, results may differ substantially (Kahneman et al., 2004a, b; Luhmann et al., 2012). For example, Knabe et al. (2010) show that unemployment is not associated with a reduction in affective well-being because working is typically among the lowest ranked activities in terms of emotional experience (see also Kahneman et al., 2004a; Bryson & MacKerron, 2016). The frequently diverging results warrant a further investigation into how motherhood and labor market status relate to women’s subjective well-being. This is particularly true for the affective component, where previous evidence in the economic literature is scarce in general. Furthermore, since fertility and labor market outcomes are correlated, there is a potential for these two aspects to interact in interesting ways in their relationship to affective well-being. The data necessary to analyze affective well-being can be collected using various methods, including questions aimed at affective well-being in large-scale household surveys. However, other approaches, such as the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) used in this study, provide a more detailed and immediate reading of affective well-being throughout the day. In the DRM, respondents complete a diary in which they record all activities they have been engaged in and the emotions experienced during these activities (Kahneman et al., 2004a). Even though the data is not necessarily recorded in the moment the emotions are experienced in, as Experience Sampling Method (ESM)Footnote 1 studies aim to do, it is collected shortly after, e.g., at the end of the day, to minimize recall bias. Furthermore, unlike ESM, the DRM can provide a full reconstruction of the entire day. Kahneman et al. (2004a) discuss the reliability of DRM data and provide a comparison to ESM and other measures of well-being. This study investigates how motherhood and labor market status relate to women’s affective well-being using data from the United Kingdom Time Use Survey 2014–15 (UKTUS), which includes DRM diaries. Affective well-being throughout the day is approximated by constructing the duration weighted mean enjoyment based on the enjoyment reported in each activity. The main contribution of the paper is to allow for both motherhood and labor market status to influence affective well-being jointly and to explicitly investigate how these two important aspects of individuals’ lives interact in their relationship with affective well-being. Results suggest that mothers’ affective well-being is higher compared to women without children. However, this positive relationship is reduced and even becomes statistically insignificant in some cases after controlling for the labor market status. This could indicate that the positive relationship between motherhood and affective well-being is (at least partially) mediated by mothers changing their employment pattern towards labor market statuses that are more conducive to affective well-being. This is perhaps the most interesting finding to emerge from the analysis and much of the discussion is written through the lens of this outcome, though the direct relationship between labor market status and affective well-being is also outlined. Contrary to most studies based on life satisfaction data, the present results suggest that unemployed women are just as happy as those working full-time, confirming previous results based on DRM data by Knabe et al. (2010). Women working part-time, self-employed women, homemakers and those on maternity leave have higher affective well-being than women working full-time, particularly when considering weekdays only. Furthermore, the time spent on and enjoyment experienced during working time seem to drive most of the results in this study, rather than episodes outside of market work. Finally, even though the point estimates are quite large, the coefficients on the interaction terms between the motherhood dummy and the labor market status dummies are never statistically significant. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to consider the association between a summary measure of women’s affective well-being using DRM data and motherhood as well as a variety of labor market statuses, explicitly addressing their interrelationship. The few studies approaching similar topics using DRM data focus on only one of these aspectsFootnote 2. In addition, they apply different methodologies, ignore relevant labor market statuses and/or use different data sets, such as the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). In a recent study using the ATUS, Negraia and Augustine (2020) consider the affective well-being of parents compared to non-parents, finding both an increase in positive and negative affect. While they did control for labor market status, they did not analyze the interaction between parenthood and labor market status. Furthermore, previous affective well-being based studies considering the influence of labor market status have focused on unemployment (Knabe et al., 2010; Krueger & Mueller, 2012; Knabe et al., 2016). This is perhaps unsurprising given the high political and social relevance of unemployment. However, other labor market statuses, such as part-time employment and homemaking, which are particularly relevant for women (and especially mothers) should not be ignored. The study contributes to the happiness literature in two ways. Firstly, it provides new affective well-being based evidence whereas most previous studies use cognitive well-being. As subjective well-being is multifaceted and results can differ depending on the measure used, it is necessary to consider various measures in the literature to avoid precipitate conclusions. In this context it should, however, also be noted that the measure used is primarily aimed at positive affect and that results for negative affect, which is not available in the UKTUS, would likely differ, as has already been shown by Negraia and Augustine (2020). Secondly, by focusing specifically on the well-being of women and its relationship to motherhood and a variety of labor market statuses it considers an area of research where even cognitive well-being based evidence is comparatively scarce and conflicting. Considering the increasing movement towards using subjective well-being data to inform policy (see, e.g., Diener & Seligman, 2004), gaining new insights is important in both regards. In this context, it should also be noted that an individual’s (affective) well-being is not only of interest because it is relevant for that person’s quality of life, but also for the quality of life of others. For example, it has been shown that children of mothers who have an affective illness face worse outcomes later in life (see Beardslee et al., 1998, for a review). The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides some theoretic background and reviews the existing literature on the influence of parenthood and labor market status on well-being. The data set and methodology are outlined in Section 3, which also provides some descriptive statistics. The baseline estimation results are presented in Section 4. Section 5 covers extensions and robustness checks. Section 6 concludes.",

This question has recently regained attention due to the large changes in asset prices during the last business cycle and the use of unconventional monetary policies from Central Banks targeting specific assets. A growing body of literature (Bover, 2005; Dynan & Maki, 2001, Disney et al., 2010; Paiella, 2007; Paiella & Pistaferri, 2017) estimates the wealth effect out of different assets using household-level data.Footnote 1 Results vary depending on the sample and the type of asset under analysis. The MPC out of wealth is usually estimated between 1 and 10 cents, but the relevance of different assets (e.g., housing vs. financial) differs by country and period. Recent studies shed more light on the wealth-consumption relationship by studying heterogeneities across the distribution of wealth (Arrondel et al., 2019; Garbinti et al., 2020) and the presence of asymmetric responses depending on the type of shock (Andersen & Leth-Petersen, 2019; Christelis, et al., 2020; Guren et al., 2020, de Roiste et al., 2021). While the former group focuses on the decreasing MPC pattern across the wealth distribution, the latter tries to disentangle the different mechanisms behind the housing wealth effect.Footnote 2 This paper builds on this literature using a panel of Spanish households for the period 2002–2011 to estimate the MPC out of wealth and explore the potential channels at play. For the aim of this paper, Spain represents an ideal case study, as several factors contributed to exacerbate asset price variations during this period: (i) in the early 2000s, a liberalization of the housing market in a context of very low real interest rates pushed the economy towards the construction and real estate sectors causing a housing bubble; (ii) immigration and demographics increased the demand for housing supported by a banking system capable of satisfying the huge increase in credit demand using external funding; (iii) an extraordinary low unemployment rate, boosted by the development of the construction sector, excessively increased growth expectations pushing up the price of other financial assets; and (v) the financial crisis that, together with an abnormally high-leveraged private sector, caused the collapse of asset prices and the economic activity (Jimeno & Santos, 2014). Figure 1 provides an overview of the variation in asset prices during this period, displaying the evolution of the Spanish reference stock index (IBEX 35, Fig. 1a) and house prices in euros per squared meter (Fig. 1b).Footnote 3 Both indicators show parallel trajectories with large jumps during the expansion period and significant drops during the crisis. During the expansion period (2002–2007), the IBEX 35 and house prices grew, respectively, 112% and 85%. After the crisis, stock prices adjusted faster, decreasing 35% from 2007 to 2011 compared to a decrease of only 16% in house prices.Footnote 4 Stock and house prices during the last business cycle in Spain. a IBEX 35. b House prices. Source: Instituto Nacional de Estadística We rely on the Spanish Survey of Households Finances (Encuesta Financiera de las Familias, henceforth EFF) to carry out our analysis. This database presents a number of nice features. First of all, the survey presents a panel dimension that allows us to control for time-invariant heterogeneity and follow the same household for a relatively long period of time (2002–2011). Second, the EFF includes not only detailed questions on households’ consumption, income, assets, and liabilities but also provides information on topics such as households’ risk profile and income expectations. Finally, the survey covers the years around the 2008 financial crisis, characterized, as we mentioned, by uncommonly high fluctuations in asset prices and, consequently, in families’ wealth. By using this unique dataset, in this paper we: (i) estimate the MPC out of net wealth and its different components; (ii) present evidence on the concavity of the consumption function; (iii) explore the existence of asymmetric responses to passive changes on self-reported housing wealth; and (iv) explicitly study the role played by income expectations on the MPC out of net housing wealth. Our findings are diverse. First, we observe that out of 1 additional euro of wealth, households increase their consumption by 1 cent, a relatively small response compared to the average findings of previous studies using household-level data. However, results are heterogeneous across assets. Households’ consumption mostly responds to changes in the value of the primary residence, with a MPC of 3 cents, while we do not find evidence of any relevant effect of financial or other real assets. These results are very similar to the ones obtained by Bover (2005) using the EFF 2002, where she found a larger consumption reaction to changes in real assets prices (2 cents) than to changes in the value of financial wealth. Second, we study the specific response to changes in households’ wealth across the distribution of wealth. Similar to Arrondel et al. (2019) and Garbinti et al. (2020), we find a decreasing relationship between the MPC out of wealth and the level of net worth. Households in the bottom 20% of the distribution increase their consumption by 5.5 cents out of 1 additional euro of wealth as opposed to only 1.7 cents of the median quintile and 0.6 cents of the richest 20%. Again, these results are mostly driven by consumption responses to changes in the value of the primary residence, though we also find evidence of households in the bottom quintile reacting to changes in the value of financial assets. Unfortunately, for financial and other real assets, we are not able to disentangle exogenous from endogenous changes in value, and their results must be considered a lower bound estimate. Third, using changes in self-reported housing wealth, we confirm the existence of an asymmetric response by sign and magnitude. More specifically, we find a larger consumption response to negative than to positive shocks in housing wealth. The larger the negative shock, the larger the decrease in consumption, while the opposite happens with positive shocks. These results are compatible with precautionary savings or a different degree of persistence between positive and negative shocks. We do not find evidence supporting the collateral borrowing channel. Finally, we use information on income expectations to analyze their role in the wealth-consumption channel. The inclusion of expectations in our analysis does not affect the estimates of the MPC out of wealth. However, allowing the MPC to depend on future income expectations, we find that more optimistic households consume more out of changes in housing wealth. We also observe that future expectations play an important role in the asymmetric response to positive and negative shocks, suggesting that the transmission channel is related to precautionary saving motives. We further show that our results do not depend on the sample, the methodology or the use of sample survey weights in the regression. The rest of the paper is structured in the following way. Section 2 describes the data and presents some stylized facts. Section 3 describes our empirical strategy, while Section 4 shows the results. Section 5 concludes.",1

Even in countries which experienced relatively few cases of Covid-19, the disruption from stringent lockdowns on markets and livelihoods has had significant economic costs for the poorest, in both rural and urban areas (Aggarwal et al., 2020; Davis, 2021; Egger et al., 2021; Kansiime et al., 2021; Mahmud & Riley, 2021; Miguel & Mushfiq, 2021). In the immediate aftermath of an aggregate shock, households have different possible coping strategies: They could liquidate assets to compensate for the shortfall in income and smooth consumption, compromise on consumption to keep expenditures low and protect assets, or borrow money (Dercon, 2002; Fallon & Lucas, 2002; Zimmerman & Carter, 2003). With time, they can also adapt by shifting toward income generating activities that are not as adversely affected by the shock. We use the case of the Covid-19 pandemic to understand the coping strategies employed over the short and medium term by different types of rural households to a severe aggregate shock. All households were badly hit at the start of the pandemic, but household ability to cope and adapt will depend on their source of income pre-pandemic and how badly these are affected. To examine the impact of the pandemic on households, we use unique data from a panel of 558 households in rural Uganda surveyed in person in March 2020, just before the lockdown began, monthly by phone from May - September 2020 and again by a phone survey in March 2021, one year after the start of the pandemic.Footnote 1 This data provides us with high frequency measures of the impact of the lockdown during its peak stringency and as it started to be relaxed, as well as 6 months after the end of most lockdown restrictions in Uganda, allowing us to look at the short-term and medium-term impacts of this shock. Uganda experienced one of the strictest lockdowns in the world from the end of March 2020, with police enforced closures of all businesses and curfews, and only relaxed fully the economic restrictions in late July 2020, despite low cases of Covid-19, allowing us to focus on the impact of the lockdown separately from direct health effects or death from Covid-19.Footnote 2 The Covid-19 lockdown in Uganda prohibited most non-farm business activities for four months, an enormous shock to business owners’ livelihoods, while farming activities were never prohibited.Footnote 3 We therefore focus on non-farm business ownership pre-pandemic as an important expected dimension of heterogeneity in the impact of the pandemic. In our setting, business owners, who comprised 19% of our sample pre-pandemic, were the relatively better-off households: Before the pandemic they had three times higher income and twice as large non-land assets as non-business households.Footnote 4 The most common types of non-farm businesses were retail (40%) or meal, snack or drink production (30%). As well as operating businesses, they also generally carried out farming activities. Note though that despite being relatively better-off than non-business owning households, they are still extremely poor in absolute terms, with 42% of business owning households below the World Bank Poverty line. Households who owned a business before the pandemic were hit significantly more badly by the Covid-19 lockdown than non-business owners, and are still experiencing severe financial repercussions one year later. After being forced to close for months, owners have struggled to restart their businesses. Even though businesses had been allowed to reopen for over 6 months, 50% of the businesses operating in March 2020 continued to be closed in March 2021. The continued closure of these businesses is consistent with household’s deteriorated financial position preventing re-purchase of inventory or assets which had been sold off.Footnote 5 In March ’21, one year into the Covid-19 pandemic, the monthly household income of business owners is significantly lower by US$ 80 PPP, a drop of 40% on their pre-pandemic income of US$ 200. The income of non-business owners is not significantly different in March ’21 as compared to March’20. During the lockdown from May to August 2020, both households with a business and those without a business saw sizeable decline in incomes, of 75% and 58% respectively. Both types of households saw declining crop incomes, and a sharp and persistent drop in casual wage income. While the income of households without a business subsequently recovered completely by March ’21, that of households with a business did not. How did non-business owning households recover? Both business and non-business owning households significantly increase labour supplied toward farm activities which, when combined with favourable climate conditions (FEWS-NET, 2021b), resulted in households having higher crop yields in March 2021 and being 20 percentage points more likely to sell crops to the market, raising farm income. For non-business owning households, this increase in farm income compensates for the loss in casual labour income. For business-owning households, higher incomes from farming are unable to fully compensate for the large loss in business income. Business owners have experienced enormous declines in their wealth since the start of the pandemic: a decline of 30% on the March ’20 total non-land wealth. Their assets are 44% lower, their savings are 45% lower and their net borrowing has risen an astonishing 15 times (from $11 to $175) over the one year period since the start of lockdowns in Uganda. The sale of assets, use of savings and borrowing have been needed by households to cover persistent income losses during the period of enforced business closure during the lockdown. Non-business owners have not been so badly affected: non-business household’s wealth is not significantly different in March 2021 as compared to March 2020, though their assets are 18% lower and their net borrowing has doubled (from $44 to $99). This raises concerns about the ability of business-owning household to recover from the pandemic and cope with future shocks. The draw-down of their wealth could also explain why they are not able to move into other income generating opportunities or re-start their businesses, and points to the potential for poverty traps limiting households’ ability to recover. We likewise see significantly larger declines in expenditure for business owning households as compared to those households that didn’t own a business before the pandemic, driven by declines in food expenditure, as well as a general shift in the composition of food expenditure towards cheaper, staple foods.Footnote 6 Consistent with the financial deterioration, households that owned a business before the pandemic report a significantly larger drop in satisfaction with their quality of life (0.83 points lower on a pre-pandemic mean of 5.3) one year into the pandemic, while that of non-business-owning households is not significantly different. We consider two potential confounders to our findings: not knowing the usual intra-year fluctuations in our outcome measures and selective attrition. We use a combination of data from the Ugandan National Panel 2015 survey and our own survey questions on the cause of changes in outcomes to argue that our findings are not consistent with usual intra-year fluctuations. Additionally, we focus on the impact of the pandemic one-year later, allowing us to examine key economic and welfare metrics at the same point in the agricultural cycle. We also confirm that our results are robust to re-weighting to account for the potential for selective attrition, and note importantly that business ownership does not predict attrition. Our paper contributes to the literature on how households recover from an unprecedented aggregate shock, linking to a broader literature on post shock recovery (Del Ninno et al., 2003; Fallon & Lucas, 2002; McKenzie, 2003; Thomas & Frankenberg, 2007). We are able to trace the effect on the households through the Covid-19 lockdown and a year after the first lockdown, allowing us to understand in detail how households respond in both the short and medium term. While a number of papers document severe impacts of the pandemic on households in developing countries from April-October 2020 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; Bau et al., 2021; Egger et al., 2021; Furbush et al., 2020; Josephson et al., 2020; Kansiime et al., 2021; Mahmud & Riley, 2021), we also look at how things have changed exactly one year after the pandemic started, 6 months after the lockdown ended in Uganda. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to examine how households adapt to the pandemic over a one year period. Our data from just before the pandemic allows us to examine in detail subgroups who are still experiencing severe impacts of the lockdown. This speaks to the literature on who experiences the worst negative effects from an aggregate shock (Glewwe & Hall, 1998). We highlight the vulnerability of entrepreneurs in particular to lockdown related restrictions (BRAC, 2020; Brooks et al., 2020), and show that entrepreneurs are still struggling even six months after restrictions have been relaxed. This limits their investment potential and ability to respond to subsequent shocks (Carter & Lybbert, 2012). The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the setting and background and section 3 the data. The estimation strategy is outlined in Section 4. Section 5 reports results on the adjustment of different types of households to the pandemic after one year. Section 7 concludes.",1

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these individuals are currently experiencing a slump in sales. Two in three self-employed individuals lost more than half of their sales - and around one in three self-employed individuals no longer generated any income at all (cf. Metzger, 2020). These numbers are basically corroborated by Block et al. (2020), who furthermore point to substantial revenue losses among the self-employed. Bertschek and Erdsiek (2020) report that for almost three in five solo self-employed (i.e., self-employed without any employees), monthly sales have plummeted by more than 75%. So far, most research about crises and income hardships of the self-employed refers to the self-employed themselves, which, however, allows only limited conclusions about the significance of income losses for their households. Since individual self-employment as well as the household environment are interwoven (see the excellent literature surveys provided by Bettinelli et al. (2014) and Carter et al. (2017)), it can be expected that the pandemic-induced crisis will negatively affect not only the self-employed themselves, but all members of their household. Individuals and households smooth their consumption over time (Campbell & Deaton, 1989, Morduch, 1995). This might be especially practicable for paid employees, whose wages are usually rigid over time (cf. Goette et al., 2007). For the self-employed, in turn, consumption smoothing might be more challenging because incomes are more volatile and less downward rigid over time. Consider, for example, a pandemic-induced demand shock: Such a shock directly translates into lower incomes for the self-employed, while the paid employees are entitled their usual wages, short-time work compensation, or -in case of job loss- to unemployment benefits.Footnote 1 Most of the social assistance rules are thus designed to dampen the effects of earnings shocks for paid employees, while the self-employed might even suffer a total loss of incomes in a very short time, which also affects their ability to smooth consumption and to maintain their standard of living over time. The objective of this paper is to shed light on the relative importance of the incomes from self-employment in the household context. In addition, we analyzed how much income loss the self-employed could cope with to maintain the household’s standard of living. Finally, we address the implications for individual wellbeing of falling short of a barely adequate income level. For this purpose, we used German household data and examined the individual net income from self-employment, the net household income, as well as the subjective barely adequate household net income. Our empirical investigation suggests that the full-time self-employed are usually the bread-earners of households. However, we also observed that in the year 2018, 9% of full-time self-employed lived in households achieving an income below the barely adequate level and thus seem to struggle in maintaining the living standards, if incomes do not recover in the future. Half of all households will obtain a barely adequate income or less if the self-employed suffer income losses of about 37%. This strikingly reveals the importance of incomes obtained by the self-employed in the household context. Besides, we show that households with self-employed employers are less resilient to income cuts than the ones with solo self-employed. Moreover, our results point towards psychological as well as sociological consequences of falling short of the subjective barely adequate household income. The self-employed living in households with incomes below the barely adequate income level are most concerned about social cohesion and least satisfied with sleep or their lives in general. These results have implications for policy and pave ground for further research about the consequences of entrepreneurial crises in the household context.",

Income shocks from job loss can partly be mitigated by increases in labour supply of the partner—also known as the ‘added-worker effect’ (henceforth AWE). While the empirical literature generally finds the AWE to be small—see, e.g., Hardoy & Schøne (2014), Bredtmann et al. (2018) and Halla et al. (2020) for recent contributions—a pertaining question is whether its effect varies over the business cycle. With higher unemployment risks and larger earnings shocks during recessions, one might expect the overall impact of the AWE to become more sizable. At the same time, partners may find it harder to find a job or work more hours during an economic downturn. The overall consequences of the business cycle on the AWE are therefore mainly an empirical question. This paper studies how the AWE has evolved in the Netherlands between 1999 and 2015. For this, we use administrative data of about 1.8 million individuals from the Labour Market Panel (LMP) of Statistics Netherlands. In the period under investigation, changes in the Dutch labour market can be characterized both by substantial changes in the business cycle—the Great Recession in particular—and secular increases in the (part-time) labour supply of women and self-employed workers. We track labour market outcomes and a broad range of income sources that are included in the LMP, including profits from self-employment. We compare the AWE for various cohorts with different labour market conditions and channelled through income from both wage earnings and profit income. Overall, this provides a broad and consistent overview of the substance and mechanisms behind the AWE over a long stretch of time. Our empirical strategy entails a comparison of women with male partners who became unemployed to women with male partners that remained employed in a given year. The samples consist of female partners with male workers with very similar employment histories. Given that both the treatment and control samples have stable employment positions in the 4 years preceding the possible receipt of UI benefits and job exits are involuntary, we argue it is likely that individuals cannot anticipate or coordinate the onset of UI spells of their partner. This then allows us to follow a differences-in-differences design to estimate the impact of a male partners unemployment shock in a particular year on the earnings of both partners, the employment of the female partner, income from unemployment insurance (UI) and other social benefits and profits from self-employment. All relevant effects are measured over a time window from 4 years before entering UI to 3 years after entering UI. Using different reference years for the unemployment shocks occurring in our sample, we assess how these effects vary with respect to the business cycle. Since the seminal work of Heckman and MaCurdy (1980), an extensive literature has developed that investigates the size of and mechanisms behind added-worker effects. Supplementary Table A.1 provides an overview of related studies, the data that they use, the empirical methodology and the main findings. Since the turn of the century, we observe a switch from the use of survey data to data from larger administrative panels. A number of recent papers use differences-in-differences estimation, as we do in this paper, often using mass layoffs as an instrumental variable for involuntary job loss (Hardoy & Schøne, 2014; Halla et al., 2020). The idea here is that firm closures or reorganizations are exploited as plausibly exogenous drivers of job loss and the consecutive AWE. A common finding of these studies is that the AWE—both in terms of employment and wage earnings—is generally small. Turning to studies with a focus on business cycle effects, the evidence so far does not point at markedly stronger or weaker AWE during times of recessions (Bredtmann et al., 2018, Mattingly & Smith, 2010). Juhn & Potter (2007) and Bryan & Longhi (2018) suggest that labour demand effects may offset the effect of increased labour supply of partners. In this context, increased labour supply and increased job search activities are typically inferred from survey data. Halla et al. (2020) find the AWE to be confined to districts with low unemployment rates. Finally, Ayhan (2018), Ghignoni & Verashchagina (2016) and Parker & Skoufias (2004) also analyze changes in labour supply of partners in times of recession, but do not provide a causal inference on the AWE. At this point, it is important to stress that most studies focus on limited time periods for inference on the presence of the AWE during a specific economic downturn. This renders it difficult to compare changes in the AWE over the business cycle. Our main contribution to the literature is that we provide a broad range of AWE estimates measured over a long time period with substantial variation in labour market conditions. This long time period does not only allow us to consistently compare changes in the AWE over the business cycle, but also to uncover changes in the AWE stemming from secular changes in the labour market. On the one hand, the Dutch labour market was characterized by a steep increase in—mostly part-time—labour force participation of women. Hence, compared to other OECD countries, it can be argued that female workers had more room to expand working hours as a response to the job loss of their partner. Of particular interest, therefore, is the distinction between intensive and extensive margin responses of partners. On the other hand, we observe a steadily growing share of self-employed individuals in the Netherlands since 1999. In this setting, we are the first to analyze the importance of intra-household insurance that runs through increased income from self-employment. The main findings of our analysis can be summarized as follows. First, we find that the unemployment shock of a male partner, causing a loss in the annual gross income of 20–30 thousand euros, on average has a small, positive and statistically significant AWE of 2–5% (500–1000 euros). This is comparable to the AWE estimates of Juhn & Potter (2007), Hardoy & Schøne (2014), Starr (2014), Bredtmann et al. (2018) and Halla et al. (2020). Second, the AWE estimates largely disappeared during the first years of the Great Recession (2008–2009). While this may appear at odds with earlier research in this field—see, e.g., Mattingly & Smith (2010) and Bredtmann et al. (2018)—it is in line with Halla et al. (2020). Third, the AWE from increased profits from self-employment of the female partner has increased over the years, up to about 2% (500 euros). Finally, our findings point to both an intensive and an extensive margin AWE. Here we add to the literature that provides mixed evidence on the importance of the intensive and the extensive margin in the AWE—see, e.g., Hardoy & Schøne (2014), Bredtmann et al. (2018) and Halla et al. (2020). Our results indicate that the decrease in the AWE at the start of the Great Recession is mostly driven by a decrease in the intensive margin effect, i.e., less additional hours worked by partners that were already employed. This points at restrictions from the firm side in recessions. The outline of the paper is as follows. The section ‘Setting’ gives background information on the Dutch labour market and the UI system. The section ‘Empirical methodology’ considers the empirical methodology. The section ‘Data’ discusses the dataset and gives descriptive statistics. The section ‘Estimation results’ presents the estimation results. The section ‘Discussion and conclusion’ discusses our findings and concludes.",2

Whilst the rest of the world made substantial strides towards attaining food security, the majority of countries in South Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) still lag behind (FAO, 2015; FAO et al., 2019). Whereas North America and Europe recorded only about 8% of their population as being food insecure, 57.7% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa is food insecure – in South Asia it is 34.3% and 30.9% in Latin America (FAO et al., 2019). In addition to having the highest proportion of the population that is food insecure, it is even more disconcerting to note that Sub-Saharan Africa records the highest proportion of the severely food insecure population (24.6%).According to FAO et al. (2019) severe food insecurity means people have likely run out of food, experienced hunger or in extreme cases have gone for days without eating. Banerjee and Duflo (2011) note that the consequences of food insecurity are debilitating to long run economic development, including but not limited to, poor general health (Gundersen & Kreider, 2009), mental health problems (Huang et al., 2010) and cognitive impairment (Howard, 2011). Food insecurity is thus a scourge which may propagate a vicious cycle of poverty among the affected regions since it hinders them from reaching their cognitive and productive potential. Recent studies have started to look at household social capital as a potential explanatory factor to aid poor households in combating food insecurity (e.g. Lee et al., 2018) and a host of other outcomes (e.g. Ehsan et al., 2019). In environments where institutional quality is low, social capital embodied in trust and reciprocity improves efficiency in economic exchange, concomitantly meliorating household outcomes such as food security (Acemoglu et al., 2005; Durlauf & Fafchamps, 2005; Fafchamps & Minten, 1999). The efficacy of social capital in improving household outcomes depends on the form of social capital under consideration. Putnam (2000) differentiates bonding social capital which is based around family, close friends and other near kin from bridging social capital which links people to more distant acquaintances. Putnam (2000) contends that, while bonding social capital is effective in improving basic household outcomes such as food security, bridging social capital is crucial for improving complex household outcomes such as employment status of household members. Household acquisition and usage of social capital is inter alia dependent on background characteristics of the household head including gender and spatial proximity to other households. Studies that focus specifically on gender heterogeneity in the impact of social capital on food security incorporating spatial proximity to other households that have social capital are of great interest. To the best of our knowledge, studies that combine these three issues are scarce; probably because data on social capital, spatial proximity, as well as food security are rarely found in the same data sets. This paper adds to the body of knowledge on social capital by bridging this gap on the basis of a large scale data collected in Zimbabwe by the Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee (ZimVAC) in 2019. Specifically, the research seeks to answer the following four questions. Firstly, to what extent does the gender of the household head affect the propensity of a household to possess social capital? Secondly, to what extent does spatial interdependence affect the amount of social capital that the household has? Thirdly, does social capital influence the food security status of the household? Finally, is there heterogeneity in the impact of social capital on household food security on the basis of the gender of the household head? Identification of the linkage between social capital and household food security using observational data is confounded by self-selection bias associated with the ownership of social capital (Heckman et al., 1997; Austin, 2011). We employ propensity score matching (PSM) to cater for the self-selection bias associated with the household ownership of social capital. Furthermore, we check for the robustness of the propensity score matching results using the Inverse Probability Weighting Regression Adjustment approach (IPWRA). The paper offers five major findings. Firstly, female-headed households are more likely to have bonding social capital than their male counterparts. Secondly, there are no gender differences in the household’s ability to possess bridging social capital. Thirdly, spatial proximity to households with social capital improves the probability of a household possessing social capital. Fourthly, both bonding and bridging social capital improves household food security. Finally, female headed households are more able to increase food security than their male counterparts when they have both bonding and bridging social capital. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows; Section 2 reviews relevant literature and outlines hypotheses to be examined in this study. Section 3 details the materials and methods employed in the study, whilst Section 4 provides a discussion of the results. Finally, Section 5 concludes.",2

The effect of households’ indebtedness on their consumption: micro-evidence using Belgian HFCS data,March 2023,Philip Du Caju,Guillaume Périlleux,Ilan Tojerow,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The 2007 financial crisis was a staggering event in recent economic history because of its severity and its worldwide propagation: it threw many economies around the world into severe recession (Ivashina & Scharfstein, 2010). It is often claimed to have been the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, to which it has been largely compared (Temin, 2010). The causes of this crisis and its severity have been debated extensively. However, researchers seem to agree on the fundamental roles, among others, of the credit boom (Acharya & Richardson, 2009; Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011). Although previous models of household behavior, such as the life-cycle model, usually see debt as neutral, the sharp increase observed in household debt in the years leading up to the crisis and the overhang of debt in the following years have often been pointed out as causes for the crisis and the slow pace of the recovery that followed (Eggertsson & Krugman, 2012). In other words, researchers have claimed that the overhang of households’ debt has been holding their consumption back in the aftermath of the crisis. This has led researchers to try and analyze, empirically, the possible impact of household debt on their consumption. Many studies examined the question from a macro perspective. In an attempt to assess on what grounds debt can be good or bad, Cecchetti et al. (2011) came to the conclusion that, despite being a source of growth and stability at low levels, debt becomes harmful at higher levels, as it increases volatility and lowers growth. Other studies found that indebtedness can explain a statistically significant part of consumption spending at the aggregate level (Bunn & Rostom, 2015; Mian et al., 2013) or for the whole economy (Jordà et al., 2013; Murray, 1997). Only recently have researchers focused on this effect at the micro level. Performing an analysis at the household level is of particular interest because it can help shed light on the mechanisms at play and allow to look at the impact of debt for different types of households. This could, in turn, help to formulate better framed policies. Among those studies, Dynan (2012) investigated whether debt overhang, i.e., a high level of debt relative to the value of owned assets, creates a need for deleveraging that, in turn, reduces consumption at the household level. Focusing on the US for the years 2007-2009, she uses the burst of the housing bubble as an exogenous shock to study the effect that too high a debt-to-asset ratio can have on consumption spending. Her results support the view that excessive leverage has contributed to a weakening in consumption. Similar results are found by Andersen et al. (2016) and Kukk (2016), who analyze two European countries – Denmark and Estonia, respectively – that also experienced a sharp decrease in housing prices after the financial crisis of 2007-2008.Footnote 1 Analyzing the case of Korea, Kim & Hwang (2016) also find a negative relation between high levels of indebtedness and consumption. Furthermore, the authors find that this effect is stronger for durable goods and greater in the aftermath than at the heart of a crisis. Finally, Kukk (2019) shows that households’ debt repayment difficulties induce both short-term and long-term problems that result in a decline in spending, and that the longer the repayment difficulties last, the larger this spending decline will be. Our study joins this recent and relatively limited strand of literature as we analyze the potential impact of household indebtedness on food consumption in Belgium between 2010 and 2014.Footnote 2,Footnote 3 To this end, we use microdata from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), a database representative of Belgium and containing detailed information on household liabilities. We believe that focusing on Belgium in that period is particularly interesting, and we expect our results to be somewhat different from those of previous studies. Indeed, Belgium has not been spared by the financial crisis at the macro level: three of its largest banks – Fortis, Dexia, and KBC – had to be bailed out, sold off, and/or nationalized to avoid bankruptcy in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 crisis. Those events received substantial media coverage and raised doubts about the indebtedness behavior of banks. Belgium further suffered from the sovereign debt crisis that hit Europe, resulting in a period of economic uncertainty characterized by a consumer confidence index below its long-term average between August 2011 and August 2013 (OECD, 2021). However, the effects on other indicators at the micro level were less clear-cut. As can be seen in Fig. 2 in the Appendix, the Belgian labor market was not severely hit, nor was household consumption. Furthermore, the indebtedness behavior of households did not change drastically after the crisis. Indeed, Fig. 3 in the Appendix shows that the debt-to-GDP ratio in Belgium continued to grow, with most of the debt still consisting of mortgages. The fact that Belgium did not suffer extensively from the crisis, unlike Spain or Greece, prevents the results from being drawn by such an extreme event. Finally, whereas most previous studies analyzed countries that underwent strong shocks on households’ assets, such as a sharp decline in the housing prices, no such shock was observed in Belgium (Fig. 4 in the Appendix). The absence of a sharp decline in housing prices allows us to extend the existing literature, as we investigate whether a negative effect of indebtedness on consumption can be found ‘simply’ in times of economic uncertainty with low consumer confidence and in the absence of a sharp loss of asset values. Previous studies have discussed potential channels through which debt can affect consumption. A first channel could be the traditional wealth effect, namely that consumption is positively impacted by wealth. Since debt is negative wealth, it should have a negative impact on consumption. A second potential channel is through highly indebted households’ current or future access to credit, as they might face credit refusal or might simply not ask for credit if they anticipate a possible refusal. A third channel, put forward by Dynan & Edelberg (2013), relies more on precautionary motives. The reasoning behind this channel is very similar and close to that developed by Eggertsson & Krugman (2012): households may target a certain level of maximal indebtedness that they consider safe,Footnote 4 which would cause them, in some cases, to reduce their consumption in order not to exceed that level of indebtedness. This reasoning seems particularly plausible in times of uncertainty, such as a recession, as households might then adjust their targeted level of debt downwards. Finally, some researchers have questioned the agents’ rationality to explain why households could end up taking on too much debt, ultimately resulting in forced deleverage (often characterized by a decline in consumption). Betti et al. (2007) express doubts about households’ ability to accurately forecast their future income, and Lusardi & Tufano (2009) put forward that most households might lack basic financial literacy. Both limitations to households’ rationality could result in taking on too much debt. By trying to disentangle and understand which of the potential channels is at play, the present study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, as opposed to previous studies and following Kukk (2016), we investigate two different aspects of debt: stock and flow. Stock relates to the overall size of debt and to its overall sustainability, whereas flow relates to the financial obligations entailed by debt and therefore to its day-to-day sustainability. To measure these two aspects, we focus on two ratios commonly used when referring to debt: the debt-to-asset (DTA) ratio and the debt-service-to-income (DSTI) ratio. In line with Kukk (2016), we argue that the former captures the effect linked to the potential credit constraints faced by households, whereas the latter better captures the effect of debt distress, which can be related to the precautionary motives exposed above. Furthermore, the DTA ratio can be related to households’ solvency and the DSTI ratio to their liquidity. As opposed to other studies focusing on periods with a strong negative shock on households’ assets, ultimately increasing their DTA ratio, we find that it is the day-to-day sustainability of debt that has an impact on household consumption. We claim that, although the overall sustainability of debt has been found to push households to deleverage in the event of a negative shock on their assets, therefore supporting the credit constraint channel, indebtedness can still have a negative effect on consumption in times of economic uncertainty, even in the absence of such shock. This effect is reflected mostly through the financial obligations entailed by debt and therefore supports the precautionary motives as a channel. Second, most of the previous studies finding a negative effect of households’ indebtedness on their consumption argue, sometimes implicitly, that the effect is present when indebtedness is at or beyond a certain level. Using US state-level data, Albuquerque & Krustev (2018) find the effect of excessive indebtedness on consumption to be driven mostly by states where the household sector has particularly severe imbalances. The authors thus claim that this may be indicative of non-linearities in the effect of debt on consumption. Non-linearities in food consumption have been known since the seminal work of Engel (1857, 1895), who showed, using Belgian data, that the share of income dedicated to food consumption decreases with households’ income. This relation has henceforth been referred to as “Engel’s law” and has been proven to hold in many economies and time periods (Lewbel, 2006). It often takes a semi-logarithmic form (see, Chai & Moneta, 2010, for a discussion). Although Engel’s law postulates the non-linearity of food consumption with regards to income rather than debt, it still motivates the need to further explore the potential non-linearities in the relationship between households’ indebtedness and their level of food consumption. Even more so considering that one of the indebtedness indicators used in this study, namely the DSTI ratio, ultimately indicates the amount of income available to households. To the best of our knowledge, Andersen et al. (2016) are the only authors to model the potential effect of households’ debt on their consumption in a non-linear way. However, their method fails to quantify the critical level of debt leading to a reduction in consumption, as they only consider households within the top 25 percent of the debt-to-income distribution as “highly leveraged”. Finding this critical level of indebtedness can also be interesting from a policy perspective as only a few euro area countries impose legal limits on macroprudential instruments such as the DTA or the DSTI (Lang et al., 2020). Our study fills this gap by investigating the possibility of non-linearities in the effect of debt on food consumption. To this end, we propose a method (which we call the “threshold analysis”) that allows us to quantify this critical level of debt. We observe that households with a DSTI ratio greater than 30% ended up reducing their consumption significantly between 2010 and 2014. This result appears to be robust to several different specifications as well as to the inclusion of other European countries. We further confirm this threshold for a DSTI ratio larger than 30% by performing a threshold test, as suggested by Hansen (2000). Third, we investigate the potential heterogeneity of the effect found, taking advantage of the fact that the data is at the household level. This allows us to disentangle some of the potential channels through which households’ indebtedness impacts their consumption and to check whether specific types of households are more affected than others. We find that the effect is stronger and already present from lower thresholds for households that are part of the lowest income tercile, those where the reference person is unemployed, and those where the reference person has a lower level of education. This last result could be seen as somehow supporting the financial literacy hypothesis mentioned earlier. The effect found also seems to materialize as a trade-off between housing and food consumption. Finally, our results appear to be robust to various specifications and changes in the variables of interest. We further show that they are unlikely to suffer from an endogeneity bias, as we perform an instrumental variable analysis, for which we propose an instrument that is new in the literature. From a theoretical perspective, the life-cycle/permanent income (LC-PI) model (Modigliani & Brumberg, 1954; Friedman, 1957) has been a cornerstone of consumer theory for many years. In its simplest form, it states that agents know their expected lifetime income and will therefore smooth their consumption over time by using savings and borrowings. The LC-PI has been largely discussed over the years as it relies on a series of simplifying assumptions. A first assumption made in the standard version of the LC-PI model is the neutrality of debt. This assumption implies that not much focus was put on the households’ balance sheets. Although the later buffer-stock version of the model (Carroll, 1997) introduced the idea of precautionary savings by households, it still relied on perfect capital markets,Footnote 5 and its predictions have also been at odds with some empirical findings (Kaplan et al., 2014). As exposed above, the financial crisis of 2007 put the focus back on debt with more and more studies showing how households’ balance sheets can influence their consumption and, therefore, lead to different results than those suggested by the LC-PI model (Baker, 2018). The theoretical literature on households’ debt and its impact on the business cycle dates back to King (1994), who shows how households’ debt accumulation in some countries in the 1930s and 1990s led to more severe recessions by depressing aggregate consumption. He extends the debt-deflation theory advanced by Fisher (1933) and sets up a model in which adverse shocks on their future income expectations lead households to reduce their consumption. Eggertsson & Krugman (2012) develop a model comprising lenders and borrowers with a debt limit.Footnote 6 If this limit suddenly decreases,Footnote 7 highly indebted agents are forced to deleverage by cutting their spending sharply. This is particularly true in times of recession, when households are more likely to lower their debt limits. The reduced aggregate demand will, in turn, hurt the economy. Another assumption of the LC-PI model as well as its buffer-stock version is that it considers changes in consumption linked to unanticipated income shocks, i.e. the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), to be homogeneous across households. However, many empirical studies have found it to be heterogeneous depending on the households’ balance sheets (see, for instance, Ampudia et al., 2018; Fagereng et al., 2021; Jappelli & Pistaferri 2014). Those studies underline the impact of the households’ credit constraints and (il)liquidity on their MPC. Following this idea, Kaplan et al. (2014) have developed a model in which the assets held by households can be of two types: liquid or illiquid. The authors show that a specific type of households, which they call wealthy hand-to-mouth households,Footnote 8 can have a high MPC despite their positive wealth. This happens because those households prefer holding high-return illiquid assets rather than large balances of cash, even if this goes at the risk of foregoing consumption in the case of an income decline.Footnote 9 Overall, in view of this theoretical literature, the results in this study are in line with the predictions of the LC-PI model for low levels of debt. However, in its simplest form, the LC-PI model is unable to describe the behaviors of highly indebted households in our dataset. Indeed, our results for highly indebted households appear to support revisions of this model or the use of models such as the one developed by Eggertsson and Krugman (2012), which includes a debt limit. Our study further ties to the developments in the theoretical literature in two ways. First, the prevalence of the effect found through the DSTI ratio gives more credit to the importance of households’ liquidity when considering the impact of their balance sheets on their consumption and supports models such as the one developed by Kaplan et al. (2014). Second, our results support the idea of potentially heterogeneous responses of households, as we find heterogeneity in the effect of debt on food consumption, this effect being more prevalent in fragile households. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used and its relevance to the question under study. Section 3 is dedicated to the empirical analysis and presents the results of both the linear and the threshold analyzes. In Section 4, we perform an instrumental variable analysis as well as sensitivity checks to test the robustness of our results. Section 5 looks at the potential heterogeneity in the effects found, and Section 6 finally concludes this study.",

In 2019, nearly half (47.1%) of all the children aged less than three years in the EU were cared for exclusively by their parents, while 35.3% were in formal care for at least one hour per week and 25% were cared for by their grandparents, other relatives, or professional childminders for at least one hour per week (Eurostat, 2021). These informal transfers of care affect important individual decisions such as fertility (Garcia-Moran & Kuehn, 2017), labor force participation (Rupert & Zanella, 2018) and residence (Mendez, 2015). In a recent study, Zamarro (2020), finds evidence that, for some European countries, the childcare provided by working-age grandmothers has a positive effect on the labor force participation of their daughters. The current paper is motivated by the observation that the quality and intensity of the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren may vary with the gender of the intermediate generation (grandparents’ adult children). We define matrilineal advantage as the situation in which the ties involving maternal grandparents and their grandchildren are closer and more intense than those involving paternal grandparents. Because of the high mortality rates prevailing in ancient times, family heads cared not only about their well-being but also about minimizing the probability of lineal (dynastic) extinction (Chu, 1991). This concern led to the development of a patrilineal advantage favoring the eldest son (and his children), not only in Europe (Bertocchi, 2006) but also in China and Japan (Nakane, 1967). In modern societies, the expected increased lifespan may have shifted the attention of grandparents from lineal succession to well-being in older age, and at least in part from sons to daughters.Footnote 1 Recent evidence documents the presence of a matrilineal advantage in the US (Chan & Elder, 2000). Additional evidence in the same direction is provided by Zamarro (2020), who uses the first wave of the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) to show that grandmothers in ten European countries are more likely to provide childcare to the children of adult daughters than to children of adult sons. In this paper, we contribute to this literature in several ways. First, using six waves of SHARE, that cover the 27 EU countries, Switzerland and Israel, we compare grandparents’ childcare of grandchildren when the adult child is either female or male and show that the intensity of childcare – measured in days per month - is higher when the adult child is female. We show that the closer relationship between parents and daughters applies also to personal and household tasks other than childcare, as parents spend more days helping their daughters than their sons with these tasks. Daughters, on the other hand, are more likely than sons to spend time helping their parents with similar tasks. Previous sociological research has explained matrilineal advantage with women’s kin keeping, or the facilitation of contact among kin (see Hagestad, 1986). We interpret instead the combined evidence that grandparents favor daughters in their provision of childcare (and other personal and household tasks) and daughters provide parents with more intensive help than sons do as reciprocity.Footnote 2 Compared to alternative explanations such as cohabitation, kin keeping, and empathy/altruism/lack of antagonism, we argue that reciprocity better fits our empirical evidence. Last but not least, we show that the intensity of matrilineal advantage in grandparents—grandchildren relations is higher in the countries of Europe where the traditional family and the traditional division of labor—with the husband working and the wife specializing in housework and care of children and parents – are more important. The importance of matrilineal advantage and the strength of the mother-daughter relationship imply that maternal grandmothers have an important role in the development of their grandchildren’s worldview and values. Family values are transmitted from grandmothers to grandchildren via the maternal line. Although there is a view that traditional society is characterized by male dominance, the presence of a matrilineal advantage in the countries of Europe suggests that females play an important role in the transmission of family values, consistent with findings for the U.S (Fernandez & Fogli, 2006) and Asia (Kawaguchi & Miyazaki, 2009). Our paper is related to two strands of literature. The first strand investigates the relationship between grandparents’ childcare of grandchildren and the labor supply of both grandparents (see for instance Rupert & Zanella, 2018; Zamarro, 2020; Mendez, 2015) and their adult daughters (see for instance Posadas & Vidal-Fernandez, 2013; Compton & Pollak, 2014 and Garcia-Moran & Kuehn, 2017). We confirm previous evidence indicating that retired grandparents invest more time in the childcare of their grandchildren. The second strand includes the literature on reciprocity, which shows that females are more reciprocal than males (see for instance Croson & Gneezy, 2009),Footnote 3 and the literature on identity (Akerlof & Kranton, 2000), which points out that gender identity can determine economic behavior and the division of labor within a household.Footnote 4 We relate to these contributions by treating reciprocity as the key mechanism explaining our findings, and by showing that matrilineal advantage is more salient where the traditional division of labor prevails. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 introduces the data; Section 2 discusses the empirical approach and Section 3 is dedicated to the results. Conclusions follow.",1

With whom and where to live in a pandemic if you are above 50,June 2023,Inés Berniell,Anne Laferrère,Elizaveta Pronkina,Female,Female,Female,Female,"In the fight for lives during the first spike of the pandemic, governments worldwide implemented strict stay-at-home policies, full lockdown, and the closure of public places. As the virus was assumed to be especially dangerous for older people, their confinement was particularly strict. Confinement measures reduce the spread of the virus, but they also result in social isolation that can affect mental well-being. The intensity of the social isolation resulting from confinement, the fear of contagion and uncertainty about the future and other effects of the pandemic and lockdown measures may depend on with whom and where people lived. As a consequence, housing and living arrangements could become key determinants of well-being during a pandemic. Positive agglomeration externalities have been central in urban economics since Marshall (1890).Footnote 1 They explain why cities expanded: density provides economies of scale, interactions, increasing productivity, far above the negative externalities of transport congestion, pollution or disease contagion. But with confinement aimed at reducing contagion, the positive urban externalities are suddenly reduced with the suppression of face to face interactions. Moreover “within household density” takes a new role: it might generate new externalities, positive if other household members compensate for suppressed outdoor interactions, negative if a crowded apartment is a source of stress. The question can be worded as follows: was it good to live protected from the virus, away from cities, in large houses or alone, like Robinson on his island? Or was it good to stay in the crowd and not be depressed? More precisely, did the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic and the various lockdown measures taken by European governments in the spring of 2020 impact the mental well-being of individuals aged 50 and over differently according to their living arrangements and housing conditions? Leaving aside the effect of living arrangement and housing conditions on the direct spread of the virus, we focus on three mental well-being indicators: depression, loneliness and having trouble sleeping of those aged 50 or more during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020. We use a special telephone interview of SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) run in summer 2020, called SHARE Corona Survey. Along with other questions on many aspects of their life, respondents were asked to report their mental well-being during the month preceding the interview.Footnote 2 We analyze the role of two aspects of living arrangements, household composition and distance to the nearest child; and the role of three housing characteristics, the location (rural versus urban), the type of building (single house versus multiple-unit buildings), and the number of rooms. We ask if depression, loneliness, and trouble sleeping varied with living arrangements and housing characteristics at the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic relative to pre-COVID times. This paper contributes to a rapidly growing literature about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health or well-being. Our focus on the association between mental health and living arrangement/housing conditions is both new and important because living arrangement and housing conditions became clearly more important due to lockdowns or self-imposed restrictions. Another paper focusing on the relationship between living arrangements and mental health is Hamermesh (2020), which uses pre-pandemic time use surveys to examine how life satisfaction is related to with whom and how long we relate. Keeping people with no children under 18, he finds that life satisfaction among married couples increases with additional time spent together. Among singles (above age 30), satisfaction decreases as more time is spent alone. This leads him to predict that the likely impacts of a lockdown will be an increase in satisfaction among couples, a decrease in satisfaction among singles. However, some have underlined the strong pressure lockdowns put on couples. For instance, Béland et al. (2020) report an increase in financial instability and a risk of domestic violence. Our results, based on studying the older population and using actual data pre and post-pandemic, lead to a different conclusion from the one in Hamermesh (2020). While a lot is being documented on the impact for young people or working-age individuals, less is known about the older population. Mendez-Lopez et al. (2022) and García-Prado et al. (2022) aim to estimate the impact of lockdown policies on mental health. Both only use the SHARE Corona data. Measuring the impact of the pandemic on mental health from a single cross-section of respondents observed during the pandemic is challenging. Both papers find a negative impact of lockdowns on mental health.Footnote 3 Also using just SHARE data, Bertoni et al. (2021) look at the impacts of retirement on preventive behavior and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and find no effect on mental health except for singles. Several studies find an increase in mental health problems or a decrease in well-being based on longitudinal survey data (Banks and Xu, 2020; Pierce et al., 2020), on online surveys during the pandemic (Bu et al., 2021; Huebener et al., 2021; Jace and Makridis, 2020), and Google trends (Tubadji et al., 2020; Brodeur et al., 2021). However, there is little evidence about the role of living arrangements and housing characteristics for mental well-being during COVID-19. Atzendorf and Gruber (2021), using the SHARE Corona telephone survey concentrate on retired individuals aged 60 or more, and also rely on respondent reports of increase in loneliness or depression compared to the time before the outbreak of the pandemic. They relate them to macro indicators of the severity of the pandemic, and to some individual factors. They find that macro factors were somewhat less important than individual factors and that those living alone had a higher risk of mentioning increased depression after the first COVID-19 wave than those living with others. Litwin and Levinsky (2021) use not only SHARE Corona Survey, but also wave 6 of SHARE which allows them to control for some baseline individual characteristics. They find that face-to-face contact with members of one’s social network reduced depression and anxiety during the pandemic, while contacts via phone or electronic means did not. None of those studies consider other living arrangements or housing conditions. Our strategy is somewhat similar to Litwin and Levinsky (2021), but we add one more former wave of SHARE, and we also fully make use of the longitudinal aspect of the data in fixed-effects specifications. We do not just look at the association between living arrangements/housing conditions and mental well-being during the first wave of COVID-19, but also at associations before the pandemic and our main focus is on changes in such associations after the first wave of the pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been done before. To summarize, our type of analysis allows us to control for predetermined characteristics and points to new effects linked to a totally new policy, namely lockdown in a pandemic. In addition, we are the first to consider how the pandemic changed the relationship between mental health and some other living arrangements and housing conditions, such as distance to children, city size, type of building, among others. Overall, while feelings of loneliness among the 50+ were slightly higher in summer 2020 compared to what had been measured by SHARE surveys since 2004, the proportion of respondents that felt sad or depressed decreased from 42% in pre-COVID waves to 28% in the Corona Survey, and the proportion who had trouble sleeping decreased from 35% to 26%. Litwin and Levinsky (2021) notice the decrease in depression and quote Reibling et al. (2017) who point out that in Europe people were less depressed during the crisis of 2008. While keeping in mind this somewhat surprising evolution for SHARE respondents as a whole, we show how the mental health of persons with different (pre-determined) living arrangements/housing conditions deviated from that of the general population following the first wave of the pandemic. Our main results are the following: First, with whom the elderly live matters. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, living alone was associated with worse mental well-being, as is well known; that is still the case in the SHARE Corona Survey. However, we find that the relative mental well-being of two particular groups of respondents was markedly different after the first wave of the pandemic. Respondents who were single but living with others (in 80% of cases those “others” are adult children) improved their mental well-being relative to that of the rest of the population, while the mental well-being of respondents who lived only with a spouse (and no one else) became relatively worse. For parents, the presence of an adult child in the household or living in the same building was associated with better mental well-being relative to those whose children lived further away after the first wave of COVID-19. During the first wave of the pandemic, children living outside could not visit their parents during lockdowns, or might not visit them for fear of spreading the virus even if allowed to. Second, the location where a person lived during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic also mattered: depression and loneliness became associated with living in big cities during the pandemic, a totally new phenomenon. Moreover this changed association was primarily driven by respondents living in multi-unit buildings. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the SHARE data and shows some descriptive statistics. In Section 3, we describe our empirical approach. Section 4 reports the results on the changes in the association between mental well-being and living arrangements and housing conditions and discusses causal interpretations and heterogeneity across gender. Section 5 concludes.",
21.0,2.0,Review of Economics of the Household,23 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-022-09623-9,"The COVID-19 pandemic, well-being, and transitions to post-secondary education",June 2023,Malte Sandner,Alexander Patzina,Hans Dietrich,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the related policies to stop the spread of the coronavirus, particularly school closures, present a severe shock to mental and physical well-being for millions of young individuals worldwide. Distancing measures may affect the mental and physical health and life satisfaction of young individuals, as these measures massively change the schooling, learning processes and leisure activities of students, such as physical activity, time spent in front of screens, social contacts, substance use, and sleep time (Belot et al., 2021; Champeaux et al., 2020; Davis, 2021; Hisler & Twenge, 2021; Orgilés et al., 2020; Shanahan et al., 2020). Families with younger kids suffered from decreased well-being (Pisano et al., 2020; Stassart et al., 2021) but pandemic policies may especially impact the well-being of young individuals who are close to graduation because the measures not only affected schooling and leisure but also strongly reduced students’ perceived career security and job and educational opportunities. As students’ well-being presents a crucial resource in the process of educational decision-making and socioeconomic attainment (Haas, 2006), shocks to well-being may disrupt the transition from upper secondary to post-secondary education. Such transition disruptions at this stage may have negative consequences on future educational and labour market success, lifetime earnings and later life health (e.g., Leopold, 2018; Tamborini et al., 2015; Oreopoulos, 2007). However, thus far, no empirical evidence exists on how school closures and the COVID-19 pandemic affect the well-being of students in their final high school years, and how effects on their mental and physical conditions relate to their educational and career plans and transition outcomes. We fill this research gap by using large-scale panel data on well-being, educational and career plans and transition outcomes of 3697 German high school students we sampled from the 2020 and 2021 graduation cohorts. These data have two key features. First, they entail three detailed indicators of well-being, i.e., mental health (10-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist; Derogatis et al., 1974), self-rated physical health (5-point scale; e.g., Mossey & Shapiro, 1982), and life satisfaction (11-point scale; e.g., Lucas, 2007). Second, these data contain both pre-pandemic information and information during the pandemic, as they stem from three survey waves in fall 2019, spring 2020, and fall/winter 2020/21. Drawing on these data enables us to investigate (i) the immediate effects of nationwide school closures on students’ well-being in spring 2020; (ii) the intermediate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in general on students’ well-being in fall/winter 2020/21; (iii) the heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on high school graduates who transition to post-secondary education and students still enrolled in high school; and (iv) the impact of decline in mental health on career and educational plans and educational decisions of graduates. In the first step of our analysis, we separately investigate immediate and intermediate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being. This separation is important, particularly with respect to school policies, since students may perceive school closures as holidays or health protection in the short run (Helliwell & Wang, 2014), while in the long run, stressors due to adverse health, learning achievement, distancing measures or uncertainty about the future may prevail. To evaluate the immediate effects of nationwide school closures, the data allow the application of a difference-and-differences design exploiting the fact that some students within the second survey wave responded just before and other students shortly after the school closures. To elaborate on the intermediate effects of the pandemic (i.e., the developments prior to and during the crisis), we employ linear growth curve modelling. In a second step, we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic has different effects on students who spend most of their two final high school years in times of the pandemic (2021 graduation cohort) and students who graduated from high school shortly after the outbreak of the pandemic (2020 graduation cohort). Differences in well-being between graduation cohorts might occur because students still enrolled in high school may face greater uncertainty about future decisions than graduates who already realized their transition to post-secondary education. However, school graduates face a completely unknown situation at their new educational institutions, since universities and vocational schools have similarly introduced distance learning (Crawford et al., 2020), which hardly enabled any interactions with new fellow students and apprentices. Additionally, the pandemic has reduced the available vocational training positions as alternative educational paths after high school as well as the number of student jobs, which may affect the financial situations of university students (Yükselen et al., 2020). Thus, it remains open whether the pandemic and related distancing measures affect students still at school or school graduates differently. In a final analysis step, this study investigates to what extent a severe decrease in mental health leads to changes in educational and career plans and transition outcomes. Investigating such associations is important because earlier work showed that pre-transition health positively influences university enrolment decisions (Zheng, 2017). Furthermore, poor mental health increases the probability of educational dropout (Cornaglia, Crivellaro, & McNally, 2015). One potential mechanism explaining the importance of mental health for educational decision making might be that, for instance, depressive symptoms alter perceptions of the future (e.g., Leykin et al., 2011; Roepke & Seligman, 2016). Thus, students with decreasing mental health may lose confidence in their educational and career plans or opt for transitions they would not have made with a better mental health status. As other major societal crisis, e.g., the Great Depression, have cumulative negative effects for individuals over the life course (Hale, 2017), investigating changes in mental health and educational plans and outcomes may provide important insights on the potential long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. In analysing the immediate and intermediate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on students’ well-being in two graduation cohorts and how changes in well-being relate to educational and career plans and transition outcomes, we extend the existing and rapidly emerging research on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being and mental health of young adults and teenagers (e.g., Elmer et al., 2020; Giuntella et al., 2021; Shanahan et al., 2020). Furthermore, we contribute to the literature on how lockdowns affect educational and career plans, which until now has concentrated on university students or employed individuals (Aucejo et al., 2020; Fiaschi & Tealdi, 2021). We combine these strands of literature and demonstrate that students who are close to the transition to post-secondary education are most vulnerable to shocks to their well-being due to the COVID-19 pandemic and that such shocks are related to educational and career plans and transition outcomes.",2

According to the May 2020 Current Population Survey (CPS), 35.4% of workers reported working from home (WFH, also refers to work from home) at some point in the past month because of the pandemic (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020–2021). By January 2021, that percentage had fallen to 23.2% and continued to fall gradually after that.Footnote 1 And according to the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), 25.9% of all workdays with at least 4 h of work were WFH days from May 10, 2020 through December 2021, compared to only 7.9% of workdays in 2019.Footnote 2 WFH, either fully remotely or on a hybrid basis, is expected to continue at much higher rates around the world (Barrero et al., 2021; Bick et al., 2022; Erdsiek, 2021, 2022; Pabilonia & Vernon, 2022a, 2022b, 2022c).Footnote 3 This “natural” experiment in WFH due to the pandemic provides an opportunity to re-examine the gendered effects of WFH on childcare and household production for a larger group of parents WFH than previously possible and to analyze the allocation of unpaid work when both parents are WFH. However, during the pandemic, children were also more likely to be at home during core business hours, because many schools were hybrid or virtual, and many daycares and summer camps were closed (Burbio, 2021; Lee & Parolin, 2021; Russell and Sun, 2020).Footnote 4 This placed new demands on parents’ time, and WFH may have eased this additional care burden, especially for mothers, allowing them to work longer and simultaneously supervise their children. However, these were anything but normal times, as social distancing also restricted many leisure activities, potentially influencing how families spent their time together.Footnote 5 In this paper, we focus on the weekday workday time allocation of mothers and fathers in dual-earner couples with children under age 13, using daily time diaries from the 2015–2021 ATUS. Our primary goal is to analyze gender differences in time spent on paid work, childcare, and household production during the COVID-19 pandemic by the couple’s joint WFH status. However, we also examine how differences in time use between parents WFH and those working away from home (WAFH, also refers to work away from home) changed as a result of the pandemic.Footnote 6 We look at parents of young children, because children under age 13 generally need more supervision, and some state laws require parents to ensure that their young children are being supervised during the day (World Population Review 2022), while options for non-household-provided care during the pandemic were severely limited. We can identify the location of work for ATUS respondents directly from their diaries and thus determine if they worked exclusively from home on their diary days. However, because there is only one respondent and one diary per household, we do not observe the WFH statuses of their partners; therefore, we predict their probability of WFH. Because the survey contains information on who was present during each activity, we can also identify parents who do not appear to be using outside childcare options during core working hours (9 a.m. to 2 p.m.) on their WFH days and examine whether having a child at home impacted mothers’ and fathers’ time use differently. During the pandemic, we find that a partner’s WFH status matters for how one allocates their time when WFH. Mothers’ and fathers’ time spent on childcare on weekday workdays rose substantially, whereas their time on household chores remained unchanged. When their partners worked away from home, parents WFH spent 3.4–5.2 h more on childcare and 0.5–0.8 h more on chores compared to their counterparts WAFH, although only mothers worked fewer paid hours. On the average school day, fathers, but not mothers, WFH alone spent about 1.5 h more on chores compared to their counterparts WAFH. When both parents were WFH compared to both WAFH, mothers and fathers maintained their paid hours even while spending more time on childcare. Compared to when WFH alone, mothers in full-time, dual-remotely-working couples spent 3.5 fewer hours and fathers 2 fewer hours supervising children, suggesting that having a partner WFH eased their care burden. When WFH and regardless of whether their partners were also WFH, mothers and fathers spent substantially more time supervising children if their children were at home rather than at school or daycare (5.6–7.1 h more) and directly interacting with children (1.7–3.5 h more), but the same amount of time on primary childcare. However, having a mother also WFH allowed fathers to spend a smaller percentage of their workdays supervising children at home. On the average day during the pandemic, mothers’ total paid and unpaid workload was 0.7 h greater when WFH compared to fathers WFH than it was before the pandemic. However, mothers and fathers WFH did equally more total work compared to their WAFH counterparts, with no variation by their partners’ work locations.",2

Michael Collins,Madelaine L’Esperance,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"School-based banking programs have existed for well over a century (Bowman, 1922; Cruce, 2002).Footnote 1 In the US, federal and local initiatives promote banks in schools (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 2015; Murray, 2017).Footnote 2 One rationale for these programs is that by offering banks in schools, more children can have early life experiences with accounts, which help develop their financial capability (Friedline, 2012). To the extent that children have a positive early life experience with the formal banking sector, they may become favorably disposed to using formal financial institutions in the future. An example of this type of mechanism is shown by Brown et al. (2019), using variation in the number of banks near Native American reservations due to a 1950s era law that subjected banks in some areas to more regulation than others. This legal change resulted in young Native Americans in otherwise similar economic contexts having more exposure to banks than others. Using this variation to identify the effects of exposure to banking, the authors show that access to banking institutions at younger ages accelerates financial engagement, which results in improved credit behavior and higher credit scores by age 30. Several correlational studies suggest that early life experiences could influence how people develop attitudes about financial services. For example, Malmendier, Tate and Yan (2011) find that age cohorts who experience more market downturns in either stocks or bonds are more pessimistic about future returns, and are less likely to invest in those assets. Christelis et al. (2020) study older adults in Europe to find that positive economic experiences in childhood are associated with longer-run risk-taking and investment attitudes. It seems plausible that the experiences children have can contribute to how they perceive financial services as adults, but there is little research on how a specific strategy, such as having banks in schools, impacts children. In the US, as in many countries, there is an ongoing concern that some people, especially those with the lowest incomes, are not able to access basic financial services, and this in turn harms their financial well-being (Célerier & Matray, 2019, Washington, 2006). While many factors may deter people from having a bank account, one key factor appears to be trust in banks (Traweek & Wardlaw, 2020). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has collected regular supplements to the Current Population Survey to better understand which barriers prevent people from opening a bank account. “I do not trust banks” is a commonly reported reason for not having an account, after concerns about costs (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 2021). Access to accounts at younger ages may help young people to develop a stronger sense of trust in financial institutions and increase their use of bank accounts as children (Brown et al., 2019; Horn et al., 2020). Children who are exposed to banking at school may be more likely to have accounts, and even if they do not have an account, the presence of bank branches in school may influence childrens’ perceptions of financial services and the usefulness of bank accounts. While there may be benefits to having access to bank accounts at school, this strategy also imposes costs. Accounts held by students are likely to have very low balances; banks generally do not have a strong profit motive to provide accounts to children (Porteous, 2015; Lewis & Bingham, 1991). Moreover, placing bank programs in schools may impose administrative burdens on teachers and school systems. There are no field studies is the US context that attempt to estimate the causal effects of offering banks in schools on childrens’ short-run financial attitudes and behaviors, although this evidence may be valuable to assess if investments in banks in schools are worthwhile. This 10-week field study examines the short-run effects of adding bank branches and encouraging students to open accounts among fourth grade students in the Amarillo Independent School District in Amarillo, Texas. Out of 33 schools, 15 schools were randomly assigned to open a bank branch in the spring of 2013. After 10 weeks of exposure to in-school banks, the students completed survey questions that measured their financial attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge across schools with bank branches and those without branches. Overall, students who attend a school with a bank branch are more likely to be banked, and also have more favorable views of banks. Students at schools with banks also report more “financial socialization” activities with their parents, such as receiving an allowance (or “pocket money”) or more frequently accompanying parents on trips to a financial institution. The introduction of banking at school doubles the rate of students being banked, while increasing the rate of students getting an allowance by about 10 percentage points (about a 17 percent marginal effect) and more modestly improving attitudes about banks by about 6 percent as a marginal effect. Further analysis of incentives to open accounts and awareness of accounts show consistent findings. These effects are primarily on attitudes toward financial institutions and modest financial experiences, but not on more general attitudes about saving, or financial knowledge assessment scores. At least in the short-run, banks in schools have a positive influence on childrens’ views of banks, and accelerate their engagement on financial issues with their parents. These results are one, short-run outcome, but offer insights into the mechanism that exposure to banking may play at a young age.",1

There is ample evidence on the use of income and consumption as indicators of well-being, with some studies recommending the use of a mix of well-being indicators (Bavier, 2008; Koomson et al., 2021; Orkoh et al., 2020). Others also assert that consumption-based measures represent welfare better than do income-based measures (Meyer & Sullivan, 2012; World Bank, 2001). Etim and Edet (2014) and Sahn and Stifel (2003) have also indicated that asset accumulation is to be preferred as a measure of poverty or welfare over other measures (such as income and expenditure) due to its relative stability. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to better understand the role that financial literacy plays in the asset accumulation process. We review the existing literature in this area below and from this we identify five issues where this work can contribute to advancing our existing knowledge and expanding the evidence base. These are: (i) the need to provide further evidence of the processes underlying the accumulation of durable assets in developing countries, which is especially relevant in this setting given the high opportunity cost of accumulating financial assets; (ii) there are gaps in the level of financial literacy and asset accumulation between genders in both developed and developing countries (albeit that the gap is more pronounced in the latter). This paper provides more evidence regarding the gender aspects of these issues; (iii) previous research has noted that policy that encourages households, and women especially, to accumulate more productive assets should be implemented; (iv) the establishment of causality has been limited in prior research, since most estimates have been produced using methodologies from which causality cannot be determined. This paper employs a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to fully establish causality; and (v) we use data from Ghana; a developing country with country-level evidence of low levels of household asset accumulation. Few prior studies have explored these questions from a developing country perspective. Previous studies have largely focused on the relationship between financial literacy and accumulation of financial assets in general and not specifically upon durable household assets (Caskey, 2006; Lusardi et al., 2015). Hirad and Zorn (2002) do consider durable asset ownership in the United States but limit their examination to mortgages. Studies that have considered both financial and durable assets have, for the most part, used data from developed or European countries; for example, Chile (Behrman et al., 2012), the United States (Bernheim & Garrett, 2003; Letkiewicz & Fox, 2014), the Netherlands (Van Rooij et al., 2012), and across 11 European countries (Jappelli & Padula, 2013). Steel et al. (1997) make the point that while financial assets are likely to yield high returns, the opportunity cost of holding them may be too high for poor people in the short term and where there is an absence of proper institutional arrangements in the financial sector. This observation is likely to be true for an entire economy in which the financial sector is not highly developed, as is the case in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Prior research indicates the existence of a gender asset gap across the globe (Deere & Doss, 2006; Doss et al., 2011; Oduro et al., 2011; Grabka et al., 2015; Meriküll et al., 20201; Peprah & Koomson, 2017). Although there has been an improvement in account ownership globally, evidence from the Global Findex database indicates that there is still a 7% gender gap (65% female, 72% male) in account ownership (Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2018). An innovative form of account ownership and savings in developing countries is mobile money, which is considered a key driver of the fintech revolution in developing countries (Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2018). Recent levels of financial inclusion in Africa have been largely driven by government policies targeted at improving mobile- and internet-based access to financial services and payments (Bukari & Koomson, 2020; Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2018; Koomson et al., 2020a). Although mobile money adoption in SSA stands at 24% and continues to increase, there is a significant gap in adoption rates between genders; adoption rates are 6.1% lower for females (Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2018). At the spousal level, Lee and Pocock (2007) have shown that women have a higher propensity to save than men. Deere and Doss (2006) suggest that marital and inheritance regimes play a role in affecting the ability of women to accumulate assets. They also point out that relatively little has been done to determine how asset distribution influences the gendered pattern of overall wealth ownership and, further, how this impacts household decision-making and female wellbeing. A study by Haussen (2019) has shown that women are poorer, on average, compared to men. According to Hannan (2000) sustainable and effective development can only be achieved if the interests and needs of all groups in society are taken into account and calls for the inclusion of gender perspectives as vital components of research, analysis, policy making, planning and institutional development in all areas of development. The UNDP (2012) also backs this call and has stated that the capacity of economic policy interventions to achieve efficiency and equity objectives can be strongly affected by gender relations. With this backdrop, we explore the gender dimensions inherent in the impact of financial literacy training on asset accumulation, with the objective of suggesting gender-informed policy interventions. A number of commentators (Aryeetey, 2004; Doss et al., 2011) have noted that the accumulation of productive durable assets should specifically be encouraged, particularly for women. The suggestion is that this can encourage female-led business start-ups and enhance household welfare since women in developing economies are considered more entrepreneurial than men (Fairlie & Krashinsky, 2012; GSS, 2014; Peprah & Koomson, 2015; Perl-Kot, 2011). Accumulation of productive durable assets has been shown to enhance access to credit and can improve rural households’ welfare because rural households have been noted to invest more in productive assets (Aryeetey, 2004; Kelkar, 2009). Kelkar (2009) notes that lack of control and ownership of productive assets hinders inclusive economic growth and results in gender inequality (Kelkar, 2009) and further, urges for the development of research-based programmes to help advance the accumulation of productive assets by women. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the differences in the impact of financial literacy training on productive and non-productive asset accumulation and hence provide further evidence in establishing whether financial literacy can enhance household welfare in sustainable ways through income generation. Several studies have found that improvement in financial literacy enhances household wealth and wellbeing (Behrman et al., 2012), savings and investment practices (Hilgert et al., 2003) and, the accumulation of illiquid and liquid assets among the young (Letkiewicz & Fox, 2014). This results in the spread of household wealth over a diverse class of assets, including the holding of more diversified portfolios for retirement purposes (Van Rooij Lusardi & Alessie, 2012). This evidence notwithstanding, Lusardi and Mitchell (2011) and Caskey (2006) have questioned whether studies that report a positive relationship between financial literacy and asset accumulation establish a causal relationship. Their doubt is based on the fact that existing studies make limited use of experimental methods to assess the link between financial literacy and asset accumulation. To establish a causal link between two variables, the use of an RCT is considered the ‘gold standard’ since the method follows a carefully structured process to assign respondents to treatment and control groups (Kondo et al., 2008). Our results are derived from an RCT and so provide robust empirical evidence of the impact of financial literacy training on asset accumulation. We also establish the effect of financial literacy training on asset accumulation across different age cohorts. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section describes our adapted model, which integrates financial literacy into a life cycle model. We also explain why we focus on Ghana. Section 3 describes the data, randomisation process, measure of variables and the estimation techniques used for the analyses. Section 4 presents and discusses the results and Section 5 concludes the paper, with some policy recommendations.",6

Clark,Luis Diaz-Serrano,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Interest in adaptation in social sciences has increased notably in recent years. If individuals adapt to changes in their living conditions, then the associated initial short-run impact of an event on subjective wellbeing will diminish over time. If the long-run effect is zero, then conditions and circumstances will not matter in the long run, so that adaptation is complete; on the contrary, if there is no adaptation then an event that starts bad will remain equally bad and one that starts good will remain equally good. The speed of adaptation may reflect the importance of the event to the individual: adaptation could be faster to a change in the job environment than to unemployment, for example. In the context of housing, which is what we consider here, individuals may adapt faster to a move that does not involve changing tenure status than to a move that involves becoming a homeowner (or no longer being one). The speed of adaptation to life events can also depend on individual personality (Headey & Wearing, 1989), with the optimistic adapting faster to unpleasant events while the pessimistic may adapt faster to pleasant events. Adaptation may then contain substantial individual heterogeneity, which is generally not observed by the analyst. Equally, it has been argued that adaptation to positive events may be faster than that to negative events (Lyubomirsky, 2011).Footnote 1 Some research on adaptation in social science has used cross-section data, where the test consists of the comparison of different groups of individuals at the same moment who experienced the event in question at different points in the past. However, this comparison is muddied by the difficulty in distinguishing whether the observed differences across groups in terms of the time elapsed since a specific event reflect adaptation or rather initial (unobserved) differences in subjective well-being (SWB): see Clark et al. (2008). Panel data avoid this difficulty by following the well-being of the same individual over time, leading up to and following the life-course event. As the focus is on within-individual changes, panel estimation allows us to control for time-invariant unobserved individual heterogeneity that may reflect personality traits, e.g. optimism or pessimism.Footnote 2 We will here estimate linear models with individual fixed-effects (as in Clark et al., 2008; Clark & Georgellis, 2013) to analyse how individual well-being moves in the years around a variety of housing transitions, not only before the event in question but also in the years following it (i.e. adaptation to housing changes). These are of interest as housing is not only one of the most important decisions that individuals make in their life (along with partnership and occupation), but also probably their largest financial investment. In developed economies, homeownership is not only a way of accumulating wealth but also a sign of personal success (although negative externalities via status concerns may also be at play here: see Wei et al., 2012; Foye et al., 2018; Bellet, 2019; Bao & Meng, 2021). There is in addition a general consensus that homeownership is beneficial for both individuals (Dietz & Haurin, 2003; Elsinga & Hoekstra, 2005; Diaz-Serrano, 2009; Diaz-Serrano & Stoyanova, 2010; Hu, 2013) and society (Rohe & Stewart, 2010; Rosi & Weber, 1996; DiPasquale & Glaeser, 1999; Glaeser & Sacerdote, 2000; Dietz & Haurin, 2003). However, this may not always be the case. For example, Oswald (1997) explicitly links unemployment to home ownership, arguing that the latter acts as an impediment to mobility and so increases unemployment. At the individual level, the debt that many households take on may have long-lasting effects, for example via labour supply, household consumption and fertility decisions. Equally, there is a literature on “mis-wanting” that emphasises, in the domain of housing, individuals’ under-estimation of their adaptation to house size and their over-estimation of their adaptation to commuting (Stutzer & Frey, 2008; Odermatt & Stutzer, 2019). Despite the potentially important link between housing and well-being, the dynamic analysis of the relationship between the two has not been thoroughly analysed. Our empirical analysis below will cover all of the following types of housing transitions: renters becoming homeowners, homeowners becoming renters, and housing mobility that does not produce a change in housing tenure, either for renters or homeowners. For renters who become homeowners, we also distinguish between those who buy the dwelling where they were residing as renters, and those who buy a different dwelling (i.e. renter-homeowner transitions without and with mobility). Our use of this complete set of housing transitions allows us to disentangle mobility and housing-tenure effects on subjective well-being. We find that all of these transitions have large effects on housing satisfaction, but their relationship to life satisfaction is generally more modest or even zero. As such, either housing is only a fairly small part of overall life satisfaction, or greater housing satisfaction is being offset by movements in some other domain. There are lead effects with respect to most of the transitions, for both housing satisfaction and life satisfaction. These are of the usual type (as found for quitting one’s job and marital transitions: see Clark, 2001; Clark & Georgellis, 2013; Odermatt & Stutzer, 2019, for example), with lower satisfaction preceding a change in housing. There is relatively little evidence of lag effects in terms of life satisfaction, with the effect of housing mostly being transitory; on the contrary, there is little adaptation with respect to housing satisfaction for all of the transitions we analyse here. There are two exceptions to this pattern. Entering homeownership with geographical movement at the same time seems to produce a long-run boost for both types of satisfaction (which is larger than that from buying the house/flat that you were previously renting). Equally, moving from homeownership to renting is associated with a long-run fall in both life and housing satisfaction. These results are important, as well-being relating to housing can be used as a barometer to assess housing programmes and policies.Footnote 3 The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the conceptual framework and reviews the main research in the field of housing satisfaction. Section 3 then describes the data and the empirical framework, and Section 4 sets out the empirical results. Last, Section 5 concludes.",1

Child marriage is widely considered to be undesirable yet there is very little rigorous research examining its consequences. Greater research attention has been directed at understanding the drivers of child marriage.Footnote 1 While this may seem reasonable as an understanding of drivers informs policy that seeks to reduce the prevalence of child marriage, a clear understanding of the lived experience of those who married as children is necessary for raising awareness of the possible consequences of this custom and to validate efforts to dissuade parents from marrying their children at a young age. The impact of child marriage is entangled with the effects of other confounding variables, such as poverty and low levels of education, that are likely to lead to poor outcomes even in the absence of child marriage. Its impact is thus difficult to isolate and the majority of existing studies of the factors associated with child marriage present descriptive correlations. For example, Jensen and Thornton (2003) pool Demographic Health Survey (DHS) data from 35 countries and show that women who marry young have less education, begin child-rearing earlier, have less decision-making power in the household and are more likely to experience domestic violence. Child marriage is also associated with early childbirth which is a major cause of death among girls aged 15–19, Mayor (2004), and worse mental health. John et al. (2019) find a significant negative association between very early marriage (marriage at 15 years or earlier) and overall psychological well-being using cross sectional data from ever-married women in Niger and Ethiopia. In the context of Indonesia—the focus of this paper—child marriage has been found to be associated with lower educational attainment, less access to social protection, lower probability of a birth with a skilled birth attendant and breastfeeding, higher rates of divorce and a greater probability of working in the informal sector (BPS, 2016, 2017, 2020).Footnote 2 A small number of studies have examined outcomes for children of child brides. Fall et al. (2015) examined the relationship between maternal age and outcomes of offspring in Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines and South Africa. Compared to offspring of mothers aged 20–24, offspring of mothers under the age of 19 had lower birthweight. They also had a greater likelihood of pre-term birth, being stunted by two years of age and failure to complete secondary schooling. Efevbera et al. (2017), in a study using 16 national and sub-national cross-sectional surveys across sub-Saharan Africa, find that children born to women who married before the age of 18 were more likely to be stunted and off-track for development. However, once they control for other confounders, there was no effect of child marriage. This highlights that in many cases it is not clear if child marriage directly impacts offsprings’ outcomes or if it is other characteristics of the mother, like low education, poverty etc., that cause the poor outcomes in their children. A few studies have gone beyond an associational analysis. In Bangladesh, girls tend to get married once they reach puberty. Field and Ambrus (2008) use the age of menarche in rural Bangladesh to estimate the probability of an early marriage. They find that for each additional year that marriage is delayed, girls gain 0.22 additional years of schooling and are 5.6 percent more likely to be literate. Delayed marriage also results in an increase in the use of preventative health services like prenatal care and tetanus vaccination. Yount et al. (2016) looks at the effect of early marriage on Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in Bangladesh using panel data from 2013 and 2014. They find that marrying before the age of 18 is a risk factor for IPV, with the risk of IPV being even stronger for those who were married before the age of 15. Jayawardana (2019) looks at the effect of child marriage on mental health for women in Indonesia using differences-in-differences and matching techniques. She finds that marrying early, particularly by the age of 18 years, has a strong negative effect on women’s mental health.Footnote 3 Using a similar strategy to Field and Ambrus (2008), Sekhri and Debnath (2014) and Chari et al. (2017) evaluate the intergenerational consequences of child marriage in India. Using population representative cross-sectional data from India they show that children of women who got married later perform significantly better on arithmetic and reading tasks (Sekhri and Debnath, 2014) and that a one-year delay in the mother’s marriage increases the probability of her child completing the recommended vaccinations, the probability of school enrolment, the child’s weight-for-height z-score and his/her reading and mathematics test scores (Chari et al., 2017). Asadullah et al. (2016) uses the same identification strategy on household survey data in Bangladesh and obtains similar results—finding a negative effect of mother’s early marriage on own schooling as well as children’s cognitive outcomes, with larger effects on daughters. A small number of quasi-experimental published papers use changes in the legal minimum age of marriage to examine the effects of child marriage. Garcia-Hombrados (2022) exploits differential exposure by age to a law that raised the legal age of marriage for women in Ethiopia to study the impacts on infant mortality. They find a 1-year delay in a woman’s age at cohabitation during her teenage years reduces the probability of infant death by 3.8 percentage points. Using a similar identification design and examining the same legal change, McGavock (2021) finds a similar delay in marriage with the strongest effect of a delay of 3.4 percentage points for girls aged under 16. She however finds a weaker effect for girls belonging to ethnic groups with strong child marriage preferences and mixed results for women’s empowerment outcomes. Rokicki (2021) uses a country-cohort comparison to identify the effect of the same legal change in Ethiopia on fertility behaviour and infant mortality. She finds that in comparison to similar countries in the region, the law reduced the proportion of child marriage by 6.6 percentage points and there was a 6.3 percentage point reduction in adolescent birth. There was no consistent effect on infant death. Bellés-Obrero and Lombardi (2020) exploit the differential adoption of states of a similar legal change in Mexico and found a reduction in the number of registered child marriages. However, they find no effect on school attendance or early fertility rates. The bulk of research on the factors associated with child marriage has been focused on South Asia, and more recently sub-Saharan Africa, with there being little research on countries in South East Asia, including Indonesia, where child marriage is also prevalent and cultural norms are very different. Approximately eleven percent of Indonesian women aged 20 to 24 in 2018 had been married before the age of 18. This amounts to more than a million Indonesian women, approximately 60,000 of whom were married before the age of 15 (BPS, 2020). Child marriage is also seen as an important policy issue in South East Asia. In September 2019, Indonesia’s parliament voted unanimously to raise the legal age of marriage for women from 16 to 19 years, in line with the legal age of marriage for men (House of Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia, 2019). A reduction in child marriage is also a stated target in Indonesia’s National Mid-term Development Plan (2020–2024) and a National Strategy on the Prevention of Child Marriage has been developed. The effectiveness of the new law will however depend heavily on the commitment and actions of local (district) governments. A case for change needs to be made. In this paper we use the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS)—a high quality, longitudinal socioeconomic survey which allows us to follow the lives of a sample of 40,800 women and men, some of whom were married at a young age, for up to 20 years—to examine impacts on a wide range of variables including educational attainment, labor force participation, participation in household decision-making, divorce-rates, maternal and child health. We use fixed effects estimation (the inclusion of geographic fixed effects at diminishing levels of aggregation and sister fixed effects models where possible) to move from associations towards causal estimates (while acknowledging that the estimates are unlikely to be entirely causal). Our first contribution is to provide evidence of the differential experiences of girls who marry before the age of 18 compared to those who marry after that age in a cultural context where less evidence is available.Footnote 4 Second, we use data that covers a longer time frame than existing studies and hence allows an examination of different stages of women’s lives. The data source is also especially rich and allows us to look at a wider range of outcomes than is normally possible. Third, we extend the literature by examining early marriage of boys. There is very limited research on the early marriage of boys, even though its prevalence internationally is estimated to average 4.5% (with a maximum approaching 30% in some places), Murray Gaston et al. (2019). A final contribution of the paper is that it compares outcomes for young girls who married young boys, and young girls who married older men. In the next section we discuss the characteristics of the IFLS. Our empirical methodology is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the results with Section 5 drawing conclusions and policy implications.",2

Saad,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This study examines the effect of the closure of the Israeli labor market for Palestinian workers (commuters) on marriage rates among young men in the West Bank of the occupied Palestinian territory (simply “the West Bank” hereafter). This is an important issue, as recent studies have pointed out the role of social norms in mediating and determining the direct impact that economic shocks have on marriage rates (Asadullah & Wahhaj, 2019; Corno et al., 2020; Loughran & Zissimopoulos, 2009; Oppenheimer et al., 1997; Rotz, 2016). More importantly, marriage decisions, particularly at young ages, have profound economic and social implications for society as a whole (Asadullah & Wahhaj, 2019; Field & Ambrus, 2008). An evidence-based understanding of the effect of economic shocks on patterns of male marriage in the context of Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East region, which is characterized by traditional marriage customs, is necessary to shed light on the connections between the economic changes and the social dynamics. The effect on male marriage of negative aggregate economic shock stemming from the closure is complex in our setting. Commuter jobs are a major source of employment that benefits young male workers (women represent less than one percent of commuters and are therefore not impacted directly by the labor market closure). On the one hand, young unmarried men, who are expected to shoulder the cost of marriage, might be unable to afford the high cost of marriage and might thus decide to postpone the decision to marry. On the other hand, the bride’s father (or other male providers in the family) face the same economic shock and might be even more eager to “marry off” their daughters in order to reduce household expenses. Put differently, faced with a community-wide economic crisis and tight budget constraint, a bride’s family might be willing to accept a lower bride price and less lavish wedding ceremonies in order to hasten marriage and to reduce its household size. The relative strength of these two potential but opposing forces depends on numerous factors, including cultural influences such as religious practices and social norms and expectations. For example, both the groom’s and the bride’s families could be reluctant to change customary practices related to marriage costs, especially the wedding ceremony, which reinforce their social status in their respective communities and publicly show respect to the bride’s family. This makes marriage costs, which at times can be excessive, rigid and stubborn to economic pressures. We find that marriage rates for men aged 19 to 29 years, defined as the proportion of married men in the specified group age, declined in the West Bank following the abrupt closure of the Israeli labor market in 2001 to Palestinian commuters. Our empirical strategy relies on the variations in locality exposure to the Israeli labor market before the closure, measured by the locality share of male commuters in total male employment, as in (Saad & Fallah, 2020). We use a difference in difference (DiD) strategy to compare marriage rates for young men across localities before and after the shock. We find that the effect of the closure is large and highly significant. One standard deviation increase in locality exposure reduced the marriage rate by 10 percent relative to the mean marriage rate in the base year. Our results are robust to many sensitivity analyses including: dropping localities with high conflict intensity in order to mitigate the concern that our results might be driven by violence; using a binary treatment variable instead of the commuting share; limiting the sample to young men living with their parents in order to address concerns related to internal migration; and controlling for time-varying locality variables. We argue that rising male unemployment rates in communities affected by the closure led to a decline in marriage. We show that the unemployment rate among young men increased more in hard-hit localities than in less-exposed localities after the shock. That is, localities that had higher exposure to the shock experienced steeper declines in employment rates and suffered a more-severe decline in marriage rates after the outbreak of the Second Intifada. Additionally, we observe male unemployment and marriage rate trends converging across localities after the relaxation of mobility restrictions in 2006. Our analysis demonstrates the different impacts of the closure across age and education groups, with young (19 to 24 years) and less-educated men being affected most. This heterogeneous impact analysis further strengthens our identification, as the shock had an asymmetrical effect not only across localities but also across age and education groups. Commuters affected by the shock tended to be predominantly young and unskilled, compared to non-commuters, who had a higher age and skills profile. The results of the triple-difference model confirm our heterogeneous effect analysis by comparing male marriage rates within localities across educational groups over time. It is important to mention that our paper does not directly examine the effect of the closure on marriage decisions for young women in the West Bank. The effect of the closure on marriage for women aged 19 to 29 years might be qualitatively different from its effect on male marriage. The female marriage rate is nearly twice as large as male marriage rates for the age group 19 to 29 years, pointing to a large marriage age gap in the West Bank. The closure mostly affected young and unskilled male workers (commuters are predominately unskilled young men), with marriage trends among older males being highly stable during the investigated period (see Section 3). However, it is not readily clear how female marriage responded to the closure especially in the long run due to the general equilibrium effect and structural shifts in the labor market. To mitigate the effect of the closure, the Palestinian Authority expanded public sector employment, which disproportionately boosted female labor force participation and educational attainment (Fallah et al., 2021). On the other hand, competition from returning male commuters led to lower employment rates among women in specific sectors. While higher female labor force participation resulted in higher employment rates, more economic empowerment, and perhaps lower marriage rates for young women, the competition from returning commuters reverses the trends in women’s employment and marriage. At any rate, examining the long-run effect of the closure on marriage for young women requires a different conceptual framework and a new identification strategy that incorporate both the general equilibrium effects and high marriage migration for women - topics that we leave for future work. This study adds to the sparse and divergent empirical evidence on the impact of business cycles’ changing economic outcomes on marriage decisions in developed and developing countries owing to the challenge of finding a plausibly exogenous economic shock (Autor et al., 2019; Bishai & Grossbard, 2010; Brandt et al., 2016; Chu et al., 2018, Farzanegan & Gholipour, 2016; Kis-Katos et al., 2018; Krafft & Assaad, 2020; Schaller, 2013; Schneider & Hastings, 2015). It also contributes to the literature investigating the impact of the closure on labor market outcomes (Mansour, 2010; Miaari & Sauer, 2011), child labor, (Di Maio & Nandi, 2013), young people’s educational choices and outcomes (Brück et al., 2019; Di Maio & Nisticó, 2019; Saad & Fallah, 2020), and political outcomes (Miaari et al., 2014). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight the link between working in Israel and marriage among young men in the West Bank. Previous studies have focused on the role that those social norms play in marriage decisions, including during times of adverse economic shocks. Kearney and Wilson (2018) find that marriage among women increased during the 1970s and 1980s following a positive economic shock but remained unchanged during a similar shock during the 2000s in the United States. The authors relate the opposite responses to economic shocks for cultural reasons, as non-marital births became more acceptable in the 2000s relative to the 1970s. On the other hand, Amin et al. (2017) show that economic incentives such as cash transfer programs might not be able to influence early marriage. In a recent paper, Rexer (2022) studies the impact of male marriage on violence in Nigeria, citing the role of polygamy and pride price. Our paper is closely related to a recent study by Corno et al. (2020). It demonstrates that marriage decisions correlate differently to negative income shocks in sub-Saharan Africa and India. In explaining these differences, they emphasize the role of the direction of the resource transfer. Corno et al. (2020) argue that, where resource transfers move from the bride’s family to the groom’s (e.g., the dowry practice in India), marriage rates decline in response to a negative shock, as families struggle to afford their daughters’ marriages. By contrast, in sub-Saharan Africa, where payments flow from the groom’s family (bride price) to the bride’s, marriage rates increase, as women’s families are eager to smooth consumption by reducing household size. Our results seem to differ from those of Corno et al. (2020). While they have shown that marriage rates for women increased in bride-price-paying communities after a negative economic shock, we find the opposite for male marriage rates. Gender and the nature of the shock might partially explain why marriage responded differently across the two studies, as the impact of general negative economic shock on females could be different from mostly male-specific negative economic shock on marriage among men. In addition, the role of social norms is critical but it is more complex and may involve multiple dimensions besides just the direction of the transfer of wealth across spouses at the time of marriage, as postulated in Corno et al. (2020). One possible explanation is that social norms and expectations in the West Bank impose strict rigidity on the costs of marriage, thereby keeping the “price” of marriage out of reach of young men struggling with the adverse economic effects of border closures.Footnote 1 Also, the differences in economic development between the West Bank (a middle-income country) and sub-Saharan Africa (low-income countries) might explain why both communities’ marriage rates will respond differently to shocks. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief background about the Second Intifada and subsequent labor market closure and Section 3 discusses marriage in the West Bank. Section 4 introduces the empirical model, Section 5 describes the datasets, Section 6 discusses the causal mechanisms and event analysis, and Section 7 presents the results. We discuss the results in Section 8. Section 9 concludes.",

These cohorts experience an increase in divorce and separation, in cohabitation relative to marriage, and in re-partnering and remarriage chances over the last decades (Brown & Lin, 2012). Seniors today have not spent most of their adult lives married anymore. Munnell et al. (2017) document that US women born in the 1930s spent 77% of their adult lives married, while this share dropped to 54% two generations later. In France, 90% of women (respectively 86% of men) born in the fifties have even been married at age 45. These frequencies decrease sharply for the next generations, only 70% of women and 65% of men born at the mid-sixties (Rault & Régnier-Loilier, 2015). This marks the beginning of the rise of cohabitation among post-war cohorts. Beyond their marital life course, baby boomer cohorts who are now reaching retirement ages also differ in many other aspects from the previous generations. Women have been more active, allowing them to be more financially autonomous from their partner or former partner. At a given age, baby-boomers are in better health and have longer life expectancy. Their retirement pensions become more uncertain. All these characteristics may potentially change consumption and saving behaviours during active life and hereafter. The high diversification of marital trajectories and the new characteristics of most recent cohorts of seniors will then have an impact on wealth accumulation over the life course and the amount reached in older ages. This raises questions concerning future well-being and inequality among the older population depending on marital status. Wealth has indeed been shown to be more unequally distributed among the elderly than among the rest of the population (Lersch, 2017b). Wealth is particularly important at this stage, because it can help smooth consumption when labor market resources diminish as people reach retirement age. Wealth provides an insurance against possible future income shocks, such as change in family structure (divorce or widowhood), or against health shocks that involve long-term care needs (Wolff, 1998). Marital histories may affect wealth accumulation and its composition through different channels. The first one is that different types of unions may be associated with different levels of intra-household transfers. A second channel may be that marital break-up interrupts the wealth accumulation process within couple. Lastly, marital statuses are associated with many other patterns that may potentially affect wealth such as labour market histories. These different channels, and especially labour market histories, may work differently for men and women, affecting gender inequality in individual wealth at older ages. The gender dimension and the necessity to compare individuals in a partnership or not, both require an analysis of wealth accumulation at the individual level. The number of married couples who are not pooling their wealth has been increasing, as well the number of unmarried couples, who have, by default, a regime of separation of property (Frémeaux & Leturcq, 2018).Footnote 1 In this paper, we aim at analyzing the contribution of marital histories to the own wealth of individuals over 50 years old across different cohorts in France. France is a particularly interesting country in this context since it was a forerunner of the rise in cohabitation in the 1970s, which allows us to observe diverse marital histories. As other countries, divorce and separation increased a lot from the 1970’s and we observe a recent rise of “grey divorces” (Solaz, 2021). This paper makes three main contributions. First, using three cross-sectional French wealth surveys from the 2003 to 2015, we document wealth accumulation of 50 and plus by marital history across different birth cohorts in the European context, while most of the previous literature has focused on one cohort only and on US or more recently on German data. Second, we are able to measure individual wealth precisely (even for respondents in a relationship) and to distinguish a broad variety of marital histories, taking into account union legal status, duration and ranking. Building individual measures of wealth allows us to establish how much relying on the equal sharing assumption among partners, as is often done in the literature due to a lack of appropriate data, would distort the results of the analysis. Lastly, using unconditional quantile regressions, we consider possible heterogeneous effects of marital histories across cohorts, and along the wealth distribution, and not only at the mean or median. This emphasizes the possible contribution of the diversification of marital histories over cohorts on overall current and future inequalities in wealth. We find that there is not only a marriage wealth premium, but rather a couple premium, observed for both married and unmarried partners for all cohorts considered. We find that marital histories are strongly correlated with wealth accumulation, especially for women. A separation or a divorce result in wealth penalties in older ages, which are only partially compensated for in case of remarriage or repartnering. For men, we do not observe any relationship at the mean but huge heterogeneous effects: while non continuously married men experience a wealth penalty at the bottom of the distribution, they have higher wealth in the upper part of the distribution. The comparisons of the association between marital histories and wealth across cohorts born before and after WWII suggest that the effects of marital histories on wealth are mainly noticeable for cohorts born after WWII.",1

21.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,27 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-022-09626-6,Employment protection legislation and household formation: evidence from Italy,September 2023,Gianluca Cerruti,Gianluca Mazzarella,Mauro Migliavacca,Male,Male,Male,Male,"According to Eurostat data, across the European Union in 2020 the average age at which young people leave their parents’ homes has been increasing. The average age at the European Union level is 26.4 years. However, there are significant differences between member states, with youths in southern countries tending to stay longer in their parents’ homes with respect to their peers in Northern Europe.Footnote 1 The determinants of these disparities have been investigated in several papers. For example, Di Stefano (2019) finds that poor labor market conditions and high housing costs drive the choice of youth Italians to remain with their parents. Using data from eleven European countries, Stella (2017) analyzes the relation between parental retirement and son’s decision to leave the parental home.Footnote 2 As for fertility, rates have instead been decreasing. The total fertility rate at the European Union level decreased from 1.62 in 2010 to 1.50 in 2020, while in Italy the decline was from 1.46 to 1.24.Footnote 3 Some papers have studied the relationship between employment protection legislation (EPL hereafter) and both household formation and fertility realizations, reporting that when a young worker receives an open-ended contract, this may influence her/his household formation and fertility decisions. For example, Prifti and Vuri (2013) analyzed an early reform in the 1990s that increased employment protection for small firms, finding that women who already had an open-ended contract showed an increase in fertility decisions for Italy. De Paola, Nisticò and Scoppa (2022), analyzing the “Jobs Act” reform (the one considered in this paper), and by comparing women with open ended contracts started before and after the reform, find a negative effect of the reduction in EPL on fertility realizations, measured as the number of maternity leaves taken.Footnote 4 However, from the moment a young worker receives an open-ended contract, the realization of intentions may require months or years. In addition, the misalignment between intentions and realizations can be due to both unrealized intentions and unintended pregnancies. As noted by Billari, Philipov and Testa (2009) regarding fertility: “the timing of this proceptive behavior is frequently approximated by the date of start of a pregnancy or the birth of a child. This approximation is evidently problematic, not only because of the delay between the decision to interrupt contraception and actual conception, but also because conceptions include unintended pregnancies that may result in an induced abortion or in an unwanted birth.”Footnote 5 Household formation can also be affected by difficulties searching for a house and obstacles in accessing a loan. This underscores how, from a policymaker perspective, employment protection legislation can only alter household and fertility intentions, while their future realization also depends on external factors that are not necessarily under policy control. In addition to that, previous studies that compare individuals with open-ended contracts does not take into account the potential variation in the probability of receiving a permanent position due to the variation in EPL (see Boeri & Garibaldi, 2019). In this paper, we explicitly address these issues in two ways. Firstly, by focusing our investigation on the short-term impacts of employment protection on both household formation and fertility intentions instead of realizations. Secondly, by comparing areas more exposed to the reform with areas less exposed, we are able to identify the overall effect of the reduction in EPL and not the effect given having received an open ended contract. We exploit the variation provided by the introduction of the 2015 “Jobs Act” reform approved by the government led by Mr. Matteo Renzi, which eliminates the need to bring disputes to the courts in case of dismissal.Footnote 6 Our starting hypothesis is that firms have rationally adjusted their hiring strategies depending on the efficiency of the courts in their district. We expect that in districts where the courts are less efficient, the increase in open-ended contracts will be greater with respect to districts where courts are more efficient and where firing costs were thus already limited. Finally, this increase in open-ended contracts may have had an impact on both household formation and fertility intentions.Footnote 7 We retrieve information about household and fertility intentions from a survey carried out by the ""Osservatorio Giovani” (Youth Observatory), which is part of the Giuseppe Toniolo Institute of Higher Education. This survey was administered in 2012 and then again from 2015 to 2017 amongst young individuals aged 18 to 34. We complement this information with data on court efficiency computed at the district level.Footnote 8 We estimate the effects of the Jobs Act on household formation and fertility decisions using a difference-in-differences strategy, comparing outcomes for individuals living in areas with more and less efficient courts before and after the implementation of the policy. Our results suggest that young individuals living in areas where the courts are less efficient show a greater increase in both their household formation and fertility intentions. This underlines how the positive effect generated by the higher probability of receiving an open-ended contract overcomes the potential negative effect of the reduction in EPL given having received a permanent contract. We also show that the effect is particularly relevant for graduates and older individuals and that our results are mainly driven by individuals living in less disadvantaged areas, who are more able to react to policy changes. This work is also related to a strand of literature that analyses the effects of the Jobs Act. Among the works that have dealt with the effects of the Jobs Act, of particular importance are Sestito and Viviano (2016), Boeri and Garibaldi (2019), and De Paola et al. (2022). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the main changes in Italian labor market regulation initiated by the 2015 Jobs Act. In Section 3, we present the data. In Section 4, we describe the identification strategy, while in Section 5 we present the results, some robustness checks, and heterogeneous effects. Section 6 offers some concluding remarks.",1
21.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,19 January 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-022-09643-5,On the economic determinants of prostitution: marriage compensation and unilateral divorce in U.S. states,September 2023,Riccardo Ciacci,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There is a growing literature in economics and other social sciences that has studied prostitution from both theoretical and empirical perspectives (for a review of the literature, see Cunningham & Shah, 2021). Recently, there have been important policy debates on prostitution (Della Giusta, 2016, Yttergren & Westerstrand, 2016). In particular, in 2014, the European Parliament voted in favor of a resolution to criminalize the purchase of prostitution. According to this school of thought, whether it is forced or voluntary, prostitution is a violation of human rights and human dignity. Prostitution laws aside, little is known about how to reduce prostitution. In this paper, I study how a seemingly unrelated policy (namely, unilateral divorce) reduces prostitution. This result is aligned with a branch of the literature led by Edlund and Korn (2002). Edlund and Korn (2002) suggest two supply-mechanisms that might explain such a reduction. I test several potential mechanisms, but I find empirical evidence in favor of only one of the supply-mechanisms hypothesized by Edlund and Korn (2002). Specifically, my results offer evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the enforcement of unilateral divorce laws ameliorates wives’ welfare, thereby improving one of the main economic determinants of prostitution: prostitutes’ outside options. Consequently, once prostitution is relatively less attractive, prostitution decreases. Although the link between divorce regimes and prostitution may appear weak at first glance, there are several channels through which such a relationship could be established. For example, because the availability of unilateral divorce alters the bargaining position of partners within married couples relative to more rigid divorce regimes where mutual consent is required, introducing such a divorce law could impinge on prostitution via downward shifts in its demand and supply. On the one hand, it could be argued that those married men who are prostitutes’ clients become more reluctant to purchase their services because their wives could dissolve their marriages more easily under unilateral divorce. As a result, this change in clients’ behavior would translate into a reduction in the demand for prostitution. On the other hand, the threat of unilateral divorce may improve the conditions of married women and therefore make marriage a more attractive option, leading to a fall in the supply of prostitution. In either of these two cases, the entry into force of unilateral divorce laws reduces the amount of prostitution in equilibrium. By the same token, there are reasonable alternative mechanisms that instead imply an increase in the amount of prostitution. For instance, it could be argued that unilateral divorce laws are likely to increase the number of divorces in the short term and therefore lead to a rise in the share of single people in the population. To the extent that single men demand more prostitution services than married men and insofar as single women supply more prostitution services than married women, these two forces could jointly lead to a larger amount of prostitution in equilibrium. In view of the previous mechanisms, it seems relevant to determine the sign and size of the causal effect of unilateral divorce on prostitution as well as to identify its underlying mechanism. Indeed, the nature of this effect could change people’s prior beliefs on these two issues (i.e., on divorce and on prostitution). A negative effect could generate a trade-off for those who oppose divorce and prostitution: barriers to divorce would imply higher levels of prostitution. Conversely, a positive effect would reinforce their beliefs. Moreover, as long as governments and non-governmental actors are interested in reducing prostitution, it is key to understand what factors determine women participation in this activity. This paper addresses this issue by exploiting a quasinatural experiment provided by differences in the timing of the implementation of unilateral divorce laws across U.S. states. Such differences enable one to use a difference-in-difference approach (DiD hereafter) to identify the potential causal effect of such laws on the arrests of female prostitutes. Note that arrests for female prostitution are used as a proxy for the amount of prostitution, an activity for which there is very scant information given its illegality.Footnote 1 To implement the DiD approach, two sources of data are combined: the month in which unilateral divorce laws became effective in each U.S. state and information on arrests drawn from the agency-level UCR (Uniform Crime Reporting) database. Since there might be the concern that UCR data proxy outdoor prostitution, this paper also makes use of CPS (Current Population Survey) data to proxy indoor prostitution; results do not change. The evidence provided in this paper relies on the plausible identification assumption that the month in which unilateral divorce laws became effective in each state was correlated neither with any crime pattern in general nor with any prostitution pattern in particular. There might be concerns about the plausibility of the identification assumption. I tackle this issue in two ways. First, I check that there are no pre-trends and that the effect of unilateral divorce law on prostitution occurs only after the treatment date. To this extent, I make use of an event study analysis and of depiction of the raw data. Second, there might be the concern that a third variable, omitted in the regression, is driving the results. To this extent, a candidate might be the women’s rights movement. Indeed, there might be the concern that the omission of this variable is biasing the findings of the paper. It is unclear what variable to use to proxy this movement, however, to address this issue, I take into account different control variables measuring the number of female representatives elected in the congress. Moreover, it might be also thought that other laws, such as human trafficking legislation, might be leading to the findings of the paper. For this to be the case, their effective date should be systematically correlated to the effective date of unilateral divorce which does not seem the case by looking at such dates. Yet, I control for changes of the human trafficking legislations as well. All these explorations show strong support in favor of the identification assumption. My main finding is that the reduction in arrested female prostitutes due to unilateral divorce laws lies between 5% and 10%. It is possible to make a guess regarding the decrease in the overall number of female prostitutes by using information drawn from Fondation-Scelles (2012), which reports that there were approximately 1 million prostitutes in the U.S. during the 2000s. Using such a figure and my estimated effect, a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that unilateral divorce laws reduce the number of prostitutes by 100,000. In order to explore the robustness of the findings of the paper I perform tests accounting for concerns related to the dependent variable, changes in the specification and concerns related to the DiD estimator. In the paragraphs below I carefully explain each one of them. First, since the UCR dataset is built using data voluntarily reported by law enforcement agencies there might be concerns that results are driven by how and when such agencies reported crime statistics. This would bias my estimates if it correlates to enforcement of unilateral divorce across states. Even if it might seem implausible to believe that such agencies change their reporting depending on the effective date of unilateral divorce laws, I use data on such agencies and find results do not change. In addition, there might be the concern that data at monthly level is less precise than data at yearly level due to the voluntary reporting pattern of enforcement agencies. To this end, as a further check, I also collapse data at county year level and find results are robust.Footnote 2 Finally, CPS data are only available at state-year level, yet results also hold using this frequency and geographical unit. Moreover, since in various states no-fault divorce laws went into effect slightly before unilateral divorce laws were enacted, one could be concerned that the former divorce laws also played an important role in the decline in arrests of female prostitutes to the extent that these laws reduced the cost of divorce relative to traditional (i.e., mutual consent) regimes. Using the month in which no-fault divorce laws entered into force as a further control in the DiD specification, I find that this factor does not change the previous estimate of the causal effect. An interpretation of this result is that no-fault divorce laws do not change the bargaining structure within couples but merely reduce the costs of filing for a divorce. Second, I consider changes in the functional form of the dependent variable and the control groups used in the regression. Results hold across such tests. Third, given the structure of the data and length of the sample period, there might also be the concern that my results are driven by heterogeneous effects across treated units or potentially negative weights affecting the classical DiD estimator. I explore this possibility using novel methodologies developed by De Chaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille (2020), Goodman-Bacon (2021), and Sun and Abraham (2020). My findings show that the results of this article are robust to a number of tests suggested in the papers mentioned above. Such tests conclude my robustness checks. Next, I consider the potential mechanisms that could be driving the results. These mechanisms range from a general decline in the number of arrests for all types of crimes to changes in both the demand and supply of prostitution. First, I examine the mechanisms suggested by Edlund and Korn (2002). These are supply-driven mechanisms stemming from changes in the value of marriage as an outside option to prostitution. Namely, these two mechanisms are an increase in wives’ wages and an improvement of conditions in marriage for wives (i.e., wives’ welfare) that results from wives’ greater bargaining power when unilateral divorce laws enter into force. Using data on the real average wage of wives across U.S. states, I do not find empirical evidence to support the notion that unilateral divorce laws affect wives’ real wages. Then, I analyze whether there is evidence of unilateral divorce law improving wives’ conditions in marriage. If this were the case, it seems plausible to conjecture that mainly female prostitutes of marriageable and fertile age would exit prostitution since they would be the main beneficiaries of an improvement in wives’ welfare (Edlund, 2013, Edlund & Korn, 2002).Footnote 3 To test this hypothesis, I divide the data on arrests of female prostitutes into different age groups and find that female prostitutes of marriageable and fertile age are the main drivers of the estimated reduction in arrests of female prostitutes. Second, I explore whether unilateral divorce laws led to a general reduction in arrests for crimes not connected to prostitution per se. Using data on police officers and on women arrested for robberies, drug crimes/usage and vandalism’ (three crimes with higher frequency than prostitution), I find that these alternative crimes are not affected by the implementation of unilateral divorce laws. Finally, I examine whether unilateral divorce changed the demand for prostitution. Two separate data sets are used to capture different features of such demand described by Edlund and Korn (2002). I do not find empirical support in any of these exercises that unilateral divorce decreases the demand for prostitution. These findings have important policy implications. Currently governments target prostitution by changing its regulation. On this regard, many different regulations have been considered; ranging from decriminalization (e.g., Denmark), to licenses (e.g., the Netherlands) or to criminalizing the purchase of prostitution (e.g., Sweden). These regulations are not backed up by an apolitical consensus. As a matter of fact, even feminist scholars do not share the same view on such regulations. Pro-prostitution feminists consider that an individual can choose to sell sex as long as it is not a forced decision. Thus, they support decriminalization or licenses. Anti-prostitution feminists reckon that an individual cannot choose to sell sex since it is a violation of human rights and human dignity. Thus, they support criminalization of the purchase of prostitution.Footnote 4 Taken together, the results of this paper suggest that improving gender equality conditions that enhance prostitutes’ opportunity cost might reduce prostitution. Consequently, governments that target to decrease prostitution can focus on policies that might improve prostitutes’ outside options instead of changing the prostitution regulation of the country. This paper contributes to three strands of the literature. First, a current of the literature deals with studying the economic determinants of prostitution, such articles provide different hypotheses to explain why prostitutes might earn high wages (Della Giusta, Di Tommaso & Strøm, 2009, Edlund & Korn, 2002, Gertler, Shah & Bertozzi, 2005). This paper provides an empirical test for this current of the literature. Second, this manuscript contributes to a stream of the literature in social sciences that evaluates the impact of unilateral divorce on numerous outcomes (see, among other, Gray,1998, Stevenson & Wolfers, 2006, Voena, 2015, Weitzman, 1985). This article contributes to this strand of the literature by exploring the effect of unilateral divorce on a further outcome: prostitution. Third, this study contributes to an important line of the literature that studies whether changing the opportunity cost of criminals affects crimes. This line of research was primarily led by the seminal work Becker (1968). Section B in the Appendix carefully explores the contibution of this article to each of these three branches of the literature. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes a conceptual framework explaining the main hypothesis tested throughout this paper. Section 3 describes the data sets used in this paper. Section 4 discusses the estimation approach and the main results obtained. Section 5 examines the identification assumption of the regression models. Section 6 tests the robustness of the results. In section 7, I empirically explore the numerous underlying mechanisms that might explain the findings of the paper. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper.",1

21.0,3.0,Review of Economics of the Household,06 January 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-022-09638-2,The minimum wage and parent time use,September 2023,Taryn W. Morrissey,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Income gaps in health and achievement emerge early in life, influencing life-long economic trajectories and perpetuating lifelong social and economic inequalities (Kim & Durden, 2007; Reardon, 2011). Household production theory suggests low-income households lag behind their peers because they have fewer resources—both time and money – to invest in themselves and in their children (Becker, 1993). Indeed, a recent study estimates that more than two-thirds of all family expenditures on child development for children under age 12 come in the form of parental time investments, such as reading to children or helping with homework (Caucutt et al., 2020). Further, science and theory emphasize the developmental importance of household resources, parent-child time, and the activities and emotional valence during their time together (Duncan et al., 2010). What is less well understood, however, is how public policies that change household resources affect parent-child time use. For example, while the effects of minimum wage on employment and worker earnings has been studied extensively, with mixed findings (Card & Krueger, 2015; CBO, 2014; Cengiz et al., 2019; Neumark, 2018), a smaller but growing body of research suggests that increases in the minimum wage may improve several measures of adult and child health and well-being (Hill & Romich, 2018; Komro et al., 2016; Leigh, 2016; Leigh & Du, 2018; Lenhart, 2016, 2017; Wehby et al., 2020). Improved resources, reduced stress, and changes in time use may be mechanisms underlying the benefits of a policy like minimum wage, but to date, little research has examined how the minimum wage affects non-employment time. One exception is Lenhart (2019), who used data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to examine the effects of changes in effective state minimum wage rates on health-related time use from 2003 to 2017, finding increased leisure time, and that non-employed individuals living with children spent an additional 37 min in total time caring for children (Lenhart, 2019). However, the study examined only total child care time, while developmental theory and science emphasizes the importance of developmental or interactive time in enriching activities such as playing with or reading to children or helping with homework (Committee on Integrating the Science of Early Childhood Development Youth, and Families and Press, 2000; Kalil et al., 2012). A second exception is a recent study by Gearhart and colleagues (2022), who also used the ATUS and found that Black mothers with a high school degree or less exhibit large changes in their time spent in child care and in enriching activities following minimum wage increases (Gearhart et al., 2022). Notably, though, this study did not distinguish the time parents spend on activities important to children’s health and education, nor did it examine the extensive margin of minimum wage on time use, or the likelihood of performing any child care, or specific forms, on a given day. Further, both studies lag state-level minimum wage changes by one year, despite the possibility that an increase in the minimum wage leads to an immediate change in the trade-off parents may make between work hours and other forms of time use, including time with children, as well as in employers’ labor costs and potentially in the work shifts available to parents. Given the importance of health, educated-related, and enriching activities such as reading to children for later outcomes (Caucutt et al., 2020; Price & Kalil, 2019), research that sheds more light on the effects of the minimum wage on parent-child engagement is needed. Using a differences-in-differences approach, this study addresses this gap by examining how changes in the federal and states’ the effective minimum wage rates affect parents’ time spent engaged in caring for or helping children and in activities related to children’s education and health. Studies examining time use find socioeconomic (SES) gaps in both the quality and quantity of parental time spent interacting with children (Flood et al., 2022; Gershenson, 2013; Kalil et al., 2012). Gaps in parent-child time by family income or parental education may stem from differences in parents’ work hours, family structure, and household production responsibilities (e.g., caring for other children or adults). More recent research suggests gaps by maternal education in parent-child time (Prickett & Augustine, 2021), educational resources and activities (Bassok et al., 2016), and in certain activities such as visiting libraries (Kalil et al., 2016) have narrowed, largely driven by increases in lower-educated mothers’ time (Prickett & Augustine, 2021). Likewise, recent research indicates that the effects of time investments on children’s outcomes does not vary with maternal educational attainment (Caucutt et al., 2020). Despite this narrowing, however, evidence suggests that income gaps in young children’s experiences – including in activities like reading to children, teaching them numbers, and other forms of parental engagement – persist (Bassok et al., 2016; Kalil et al., 2016). Further, there is a strong association between maternal education and increased total expenditures on child development, with expenditures inclusive of parental time, household goods, and market-based child care (Caucutt et al., 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated economic crisis may have widened pre-existing disparities in parent-child time use and engagement (Kalil et al., 2020; Lyttleton et al., 2022). A growing body of research suggests that income disparities in children’s early experiences and parent and child well-being are modifiable with changes in household resources. Indeed, a growing body of research suggests that policies and programs like the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) contribute to improved outcomes (Spencer & Komro, 2017). For example, higher disbursements from EITC have been linked to improved birth outcomes (Braga et al., 2020; Hoynes et al., 2015) and child development outcomes (Hamad & Rehkopf, 2016). Studies link increased income to improvements in the home environment (Votruba-Drzal, 2003), food security (Jacknowitz et al., 2015), academic outcomes (Dahl & Lochner, 2012; Duncan et al., 2015; Morrissey et al., 2014), and long-term educational attainment outcomes (Akee et al., 2010) among children. In contrast, a weak economy is associated with more risky behaviors and health-related time use among teenagers (Pabilonia, 2017). A recent study found that EITC expansions in the 1990s led to mothers’ increased time working and decreased time in housework, personal care, and leisure; but mothers’ “investment” time with children – including reading, playing, and providing medical care – was largely unaffected (Bastian & Lochner, 2020). This result is consistent with historical trends of mothers’ increased time in paid work, with no corresponding decrease in active or engaged time with children (Bianchi, 2000). Viewed by proponents as a means to reduce poverty and income inequality, and by opponents as increasing employers’ labor costs and prices and decreasing employment, minimum wage has received increased policy attention. Several cities (e.g., Seattle and Washington, DC) recently increased their minimum wages to $15 per hour or higher, and 21 states began 2020 with higher minimum wages compared to 2019 (NCSL, 2020). By contrast, the federal minimum wage, which serves as the “floor” for states and localities’ minimum wages, has been stable for more than a decade. A minimum wage of $5.15 was set in 1997, which was increased in 2007, 2008, and again in 2009, where it has remained at $7.25 per hour. The BLS reports that in 2015, an estimated 2.6 million workers earned the federal minimum wage or lower (3.3 percent of 78.2 million workers paid hourly rates), with two-thirds of those employed in service occupations (e.g., food preparation and hospitality jobs). Women and Black workers were more likely to earn the minimum wage relative to men and White, Asian, or Hispanic or Latino workers. Earnings varied with age, such that teenagers aged 16 to 19 were much more likely to earn the minimum wage compared to those 25 or older (11 percent vs. 2 percent). The likelihood of earning the minimum wage varies with education, such that in 2015, 6 percent of those without a high school diploma, 3 percent with a high school diploma and no college degree or an associate’s degree, and 2 percent of college graduates with a four year degree or more earning the federal minimum wage (BLS, 2016). International research links higher minimum wages to reductions in overall mortality (Lenhart, 2016) and improved self-reported health, reductions in health conditions, and in doctors’ visits over the last year (Lenhart, 2017). Research in the U.S. has linked higher minimum wages to improved birth outcomes (Komro et al., 2016; Wehby et al., 2020), reductions in child maltreatment (Raissian & Bullinger, 2017; W. Schneider et al., 2021), and adolescent fertility (Bullinger, 2017). Despite the growing evidence of its benefits, very few studies have investigated the effects of minimum wage on time use outside of employment. Recent exception finds that increases in the minimum wage may change leisure, health-related time, and overall time in child care (Lenhart, 2019) and in enriching child care activities, particularly by Black mothers (Gearhart et al., 2022). However, developmental science demonstrates that the level and type of activities that parents and children are engaged in matter to children’s subsequent outcomes as well as the enjoyment parents derive (Caucutt et al., 2020; Price & Kalil, 2019), but the effects on specific types of parent-child engagement, or in activities related to children’s development that are not spent together (e.g., arranging activities), are not understood. The benefits of increased minimum wage for health and well-being may operate via several mechanisms: more disposable income; more disposable time; and reduced stress. In general, research suggests that an increase in the minimum wage leads to an increase in worker earnings (Belman et al., 2015; Card & Krueger, 2015; CBO, 2014; Dube, 2018; Jardim et al., 2018). Increased income can improve physical conditions like housing, food, health care, and educational materials, and may lead to more and higher-quality activities for children (e.g., enrichment activities). While an increased minimum wage may increase local labor costs, research has found minimal price effects (Allegretto & Reich, 2018). Notable for working parents, however, may be increases in the cost of child care resulting from a minimum wage increase, given that workers in the child care sector earn low wages (Thomason et al., 2018). An increase in income resulting from minimum wage may also change how time is spent within a household, allowing for individuals to make purchases that reduce time spent in certain activities (e.g., purchasing a car to avoid public transit) or to outsource tasks, and spend that time engaged in more enjoyable activities. The minimum wage may also affect time use by changing labor force activity. The minimum wage may serve as a work incentive, as it makes each hour of work more lucrative to the worker, and thus, increased minimum wage floors may increase work hours (e.g., Meyer & Rosenbaum, 2001). Alternatively, an increase in the minimum wage may lead employers to reduce the number of employees or their work hours due to higher labor costs (Jardim et al., 2018; Sabia et al., 2016). In projecting the effects of a federal increase to $10.10 per hour, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted a small (3%) decrease in employment among those affected, although the effects of higher minimum wage on time spent working are not entirely clear. Some studies find little evidence that increases in the minimum wage affects employment or time spent working (Card & Krueger, 1994; Cengiz et al., 2019; Dube et al., 2010; Lenhart, 2019) with others finding job losses or reductions in hours (Jardim et al., 2018; Neumark, 2018; Sabia, 2008). While increased time spent working may come at the expense of time spent with children, research finds that despite mothers’ dramatic increase in paid work hours over the last quarter-century, their time with children has remained surprisingly consistent (Bianchi, 2000; Sayer et al., 2004). Among parents—particularly mothers—minimum wage increases may lead to spend more time with children (Gearhart et al., 2022; Hill & Romich, 2018). Finally, increased finances and more flexible time may reduce financial stress, and thereby improve the emotional valence of social interactions. Indeed, in the study of minimum wage in the U.K., there was evidence that the health improvements could be attributed to reduced financial stress, changes in health behaviors, and increased leisure activities (Lenhart, 2017). In turn, changes in stress can change time use. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence suggests that parents who were very stressed showed decreased investment in enriching time with children (Kalil et al., 2020). Several characteristics may affect if and how a change in the minimum wage affects one’s time use. Women are more likely to earn minimum wage (BLS, 2018; Sawhill & Karpilow, 2014), and there are wide gender gaps in child caregiving and activities (Lyttleton et al., 2022; Milkie et al., 2010). In response to greater income, or greater incentives for work, one parent may specialize in earning income whereas the other may decrease work and increase the time spent with children. This may account for the pattern of increased child care time among non-employed adults found by Lenhart (2019). Further, never-married individuals and individuals of color are more likely to be minimum wage earners than their counterparts (Sawhill & Karpilow, 2014) and time use varies by marital and employment status (Kalil et al., 2014; Pepin et al., 2018). Finally, the age of children in the household is likely relevant, as caring for younger children is more time-intensive and nonparental care is more expensive (Bianchi, 2000; Chaudry et al., 2021; Kalil et al., 2012). This study estimates the plausibly causal impacts of the minimum wage on time use using a quasi-experimental approach with daily time-diary data linked to monthly data on federal and state minimum wage rates. Focusing on a subsample of parents, I exploit state and time variation in minimum wage laws to examine the following research questions: Does the minimum wage rate affect parents’ time actively caring for children? Does the minimum wage rate affect specific types of parents’ time investments in activities related to children’s education and health? Do the [expected] effects of the minimum wage rate on parents’ time use vary by parent gender, race, marital status, employment status, or child age? Given previous research, I expect that increases in the minimum wage will be associated with increased time spent in parent-child time, particularly in education-related activities, and that these changes in time use will be stronger among mothers, unmarried parents, racial/ethnic minority parents, and for parents whose youngest child is under age 6.",

There were about 7.1 million fewer girls than boys under the age of six in India. This gap has grown substantially overtime; the 2001 census found 6 million fewer girls, while in 1991 there were approximately 4.2 million fewer girls than boys under age six. Child sex ratios are skewed prenatally due to sex determination and sex selective abortions and postnatally through neglect of the girl child which leads to higher female mortality. Thus, any imbalances in the CSR are likely to be a consequence of deep-rooted son preferences which is common across several Asian economies.Footnote 2 Existing studies have shown that sex ratio can affect marriage market outcomes, consumption, savings, human capital and labor market outcomes (Grossbard, 2015). The aim of this paper is to study the effect of sex ratio among the younger population (0 to 6 and 10–16 year olds) on crime outcomes in India. Sex ratio among younger population better captures son preference as it is not biased by male out migration or cross-border migration. Further, unbalanced sex ratios within younger populations affects expectations about the future marriage market. These expectations may lead to both behavioral changes and changes in rigid social norms. For instance, Cameron et al. (2019) find that sex ratio affects underlying behavioral parameters, patience and risk-taking, and these in turn affect criminality in China. In India, Larsen and Kaur (2013) and Kaur (2010, 2012) find that sex ratio imbalance are associated with changes in social norms regarding marriages, including a rise in cross-border marriages as a response to the shortage of brides. These social norms may have implications for criminal behavior. Some recent papers have studied the relation between sex ratio and social norms in a developed country context. Grosjean and Khattar (2019) show that in areas in Australia with more male-biased sex ratios, gender norms are more conservative. Baranov et al. (2020) show evidence of changes in social norms around masculinity as a result of a more imbalanced sex ratio in Australia. Using district-level data from India, spanning across five census years since 1961, we study the effect of an increase in the sex ratio on crime. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimates will be biased due to the endogeneity of sex ratio itself. First, omitted variables can affect both sex ratio and crime. For instance cultural and societal norms that lead to a preference for sons may also determine tolerance towards crime. Second, while a skewed sex ratio may lead to more crime, an unsafe environment in turn may affect son preference. We deal with this identification problem by using an instrumental variable (IV) strategy. The IV exploits exogenous district-level variation in historical (1961) area under wheat and rice cultivation and across time variation in relative producer prices of wheat and rice. We argue that variation in child sex ratios can be explained by differences in women’s economic value—that is driven by the intensity of female participation in agricultural activities. The higher demand for female labor in rice areas makes them more valuable than in wheat areas, thus contributing to less discrimination against girls in rice-growing regions.Footnote 3 The associated change in adult income affects the desirability of daughters relative to sons through changing both the consumption and investment value of having a girl relative to a boy. In non-unitary households, a change in adult income can also affect the relative desirability of girls by changing the bargaining power of parents (Qian, 2008; Browning & Chiappori, 1998). Results suggest that an increase in CSR (for those aged 0 to 6) and pre-marital (10–16 years) sex ratio leads to a significant increase in violent and non-violent crime. As further robustness checks, we use the Lewbel (2012) instrumental variable strategy. This approach relies on the presence of heteroskedasticity in the error term of the first-stage equation to construct a valid instrument when external instruments are weak or not available. The results confirm that sex ratio is positively associated with non-violent crime, but not violent crime. Our estimates suggest a 17% increase in non-violent crime over a 40 year period (between 1961 and 2001) due to a 24 point increase in child sex ratio during this time. These numbers are consistent with South et al. (2014) who find that over a 30-year period (1981–2011), male biased sex ratio in India for the 15–39 age group led to an 8–11% increase in theft/house break and 11% increase in assault. Using survey data from the Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS-II), we explore the channels through which sex ratio affects crime. Our results point to the role of societal norms in explaining the sex ratio and crime relation in India. A direct consequence of an increase in sex ratio is a marriage squeeze i.e., the effect on marriage due to an imbalance between the numbers of males and females. The shortage of females within a district leads to the relaxation of rigid marriage norms related to arranging marriages within a known network. If brides can now be “imported” from outside the known network, then, in fact, a marriage squeeze may lead to a reduction in the expected social stigma cost of crime. Consistent with this theory, we find that in districts with high marital age sex ratio, marriages are being arranged in distant locations and outside the known network. These relaxed norms are evident to everyone in a district, including parents of young children. Thus, for parents of young children, the expectation about the future marriage market is that it is easy to import brides. This may lead to a rise in crime as the social stigma cost of crime has gone down (since the “quality” of the groom, or his family, is no longer visible to the bride’s family). As predicted, we find that as these norms get relaxed, there is an increase in victimization rate and harassment of women in India. We cannot, however, rule out that these relaxed norms may also affect crime through changes in dowry payments. The early literature on the effect of skewed sex ratio on crime focused on the marriage market channel. This literature argued that as sex ratios increased, the marginal product of wives would increase (Becker, 1974; Grossbard, 1976; Angrist, 2002; Grossbard, 2015). Females, due to their relative scarcity, will be valued more, leading to greater protection and less violence. Contrary to this, recent empirical evidence suggests that sex ratio is positively related with reported crime (Dreze & Khera, 2000). The relative shortage of women leads to increased competition for them, potentially resulting in increased violence. Imbalances in sex ratios are found to have accounted for a one-seventh increase in crime in China (Edlund et al. 2013). In India, South et al. (2014) also suggest that higher sex ratio is associated with frequent harassment of unmarried females. Amaral and Bhalotra (2018) find strong effects of an increase in the 20-24 age-specific sex-ratio on violence against women in India. The existing studies in India specifically look at violence against women due to sex ratio distortions in the marriageable age group. We add to this literature in three ways. First, we are interested in studying the effect of 0 to 6 and 10 to 16 age-specific sex ratio on crime, age groups that are better able to capture son preference as well as pre marital effects. Second, we argue that a marriage squeeze that leads parents of sons to seek brides from outside known networks will reduce the stigma cost of committing crime. This is because, the “quality” of the prospective groom and/or his family is unknown to the bride’s family. We find that this is an important channel that explains the causal relation between sex ratios and crime in India. This explanation is also consistent with the literature on stigma and crime. Stigmatization imposes costs on offenders if it limits their social or professional interaction with others. Rasmusen (1996) explains that stigma can be either economic (in terms of lower wages) or social (for example, difficulty in finding a spouse). Similarly, civic norms may attach guilt and shame to criminal behavior, thus increasing its opportunity cost (Buonanno et al. 2009). Third, we use a novel instrument to identify the causal effect of sex ratio. While, sex ratio among younger population better captures son preference as it is not biased by male out migration or cross-border migration, our IV strategy ensures that this preference for a male child is purely economic and not biased by cultural factors. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical strategy and discusses the threats to identification. In section 3 we present the data while section 4 shows the results and robustness checks. We discuss the role of norms in section 5 and conclude the discussion in section 6.",
