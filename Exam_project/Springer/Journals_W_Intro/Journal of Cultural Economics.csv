Baumol,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Ironically, as Mark himself recognized, perhaps his most remembered work is his Economic Theory in Retrospect (1962), a book translated into an impressive array of languages.Footnote 1 In later years, Mark came to regard this as one of his less significant contributions—much as Hicks eventually viewed his Value and Capital. Here I am driven to disagree with Mark, as I did with Hicks. Both shifted their interests over the years and subsequently made significant contributions in new arenas. But this in no way reduces the significance of their earlier work. As a field of study, the history of economic ideas occupies a curious position. It has attracted great scholars, including Schumpeter, Viner, and Robbins, among many others. During the time of Alfred Marshall, for instance, no scholar could be considered respectable without demonstrating a reasonable understanding of earlier writings. Yet in today’s journals, the topic is nearly forgotten, and few students seek out courses in the subject.Footnote 2 Mark had the misfortune to be caught up in this transition. Having taught the subject at Yale early in his career, he was denied tenure on the grounds that the subject area no longer merited the devotion of resources.Footnote 3
 I do not know the content of Mark’s courses on this subject, but I do know his great book, which offers much more than simply another explanation of what earlier thinkers in economics meant to say, how they have been misunderstood, and how forces, such as religion, have influenced the content of their work. Rather, Mark’s book examines the past in order to determine what it implies for research in the future. His book is unique in that it seeks to determine where we go from here, using analytic tools more sophisticated than those available to the predecessors he examined. In short, Mark helped to show us how we can build a richer body of economic analysis on the foundations of the work of our predecessors. Here, it is important to emphasize that the mathematics employed in Mark’s book is not inserted as mere decoration but, rather, as an instrument to carry earlier ideas forward. Surely, this helps to explain the book’s continuing popularity throughout the world and the unending stream of translations it has elicited.",1

Ebbers,Nachoem M. Wijnberg,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Corporate reputations can derive from many different sources. Besides past performance in terms of perceived quality by consumers (Shapiro 1983; Podolny 1993), there are many other sources of reputation in the literature that include certification by third parties (Rao 1994), ratings (Durand et al. 2007), reviews (Basuroy et al. 2003; Eliashberg and Shugan 1997), awards (Anand and Watson 2004; Gemser et al. 2008) and even the mere volume of media attention (Pollock and Rindova 2003; Rindova et al. 2007). While many studies about corporate reputation focus on its effects on eventual market performance of firms (e.g., Fombrun and Shanley 1990; Roberts and Dowling 2002; Rindova et al. 2005), a related research stream focuses on the effects of corporate reputation on the behavior of resource providers, especially that of investors (Stuart et al. 1999; Certo 2003; Higgins and Gulati 2006). However, a new organization in the process of being founded, and in search for investment capital, will suffer from a liability of newness (Freeman et al. 1983) since it does not have a corporate reputation based on its own past performance. Earlier studies, however, show that the reputations of important core members that are affiliated to an organization, such as CEOs (D’Aveni 1990; Higgins and Gulati 2003, 2006; Cohen and Dean 2005) or other board members (Certo 2003; Musteen et al. 2010), can also have an impact on the reputation of the firm as a whole. In addition, the composition (Deutsch and Ross 2003) of the board and the background (Beckman et al. 2007; Beckman and Burton 2008) of the top management team or individual entrepreneur (Hsu 2007) of a new firm has a significant effect on the behavior of investors. Similar to corporate reputations, reputations of top management team members in new ventures in search of investment capital can derive from many sources. An important source is the performance of the organizations in which these individuals were involved in the past (Hsu 2007). In addition, since a reputation can have multiple facets or dimensions (Fombrun and Shanley 1990; Fombrun and Van Riel 1997; Jensen and Roy 2008), one might expect investors to differ with respect to the value they attach to the scores of these top management team members along these different dimensions of reputation. Investors may also be expected to pay attention to the ways in which the scores along different dimensions of the reputation are distributed among these founding members. In other words, building on Porac et al. (1995), one might expect investors to attach greater weight to dimensions of reputations that are particularly informative in relation to the role of the particular founder members, and which can, therefore, better serve as predictors of desired outcomes of an organization founded by members occupying these particular roles. Linking particular dimensions of reputation to the roles of the individuals to whom these reputations belong is important, since roles itself are also a means of getting access to resources (Baker and Faulkner 1991), such as investment capital. Assuming that corporate reputations are constructed out of individual reputations that can be scored along different dimensions, it also becomes necessary to think about possible interactions. If one individual scores well along different dimensions of reputation; will this increase the reputational resources this individual brings to the organization? Or are there dimensions of reputation that are considered less compatible in particular contexts and, therefore, interact negatively? This study of the film industry will explicitly test this last possibility because it focuses on two dimensions of reputation—artistic and commercial—that precisely in cultural industries, such as the film industry, are seen to be not well compatible (Caves 2000) and are linked to competing logics (Glynn and Lounsbury 2005; Eikhof and Haunschild 2007). Earlier studies (e.g., Delmestri et al. 2005; Holbrook and Addis 2008; Ferriani et al. 2009) already used these two dimensions in their analyses of the film industry. A recent study by Hadida (2010) showed that past commercial success—in terms of box office—has a positive effect on both the future budget and commercial performance of a film, while past artistic success of a film project team’s members—in terms of awards—is a good predictor of artistic performance. This paper will build on these earlier results and specifically focus on the effect of the individual reputations in relation to the specific roles of these individuals on the behavior of a particular group of investors, namely distributors offering minimum guarantees. Precisely by focusing on one group of investors who have similar motivations and have to make their decisions at a very early stage, long before any outcomes of the venture can be evaluated; we can test theoretical arguments about the impact of reputations based on past performance of the individuals involved in the new organization. The first contribution of this paper is that we distinguish between different dimensions of reputations of new ventures’ founding members and study to what extent investor behavior is influenced by these dimensions of reputations being role congruent. We, therefore, study whether there is a positive relation between reputational scores along particular dimensions of particular founding members that occupy particular roles in the new venture, and the size of investments. Second, we will focus on the possible negative interaction effects between having a positive non-role-congruent reputation at the same time as a positive role-congruent reputation. Unfocused identities or category spanning may lead to more attention, but it is also risky since it could lead to lower appeal or negative evaluation (Zuckerman 1999; Zuckerman and Kim 2003; Zuckerman et al. 2003; Hsu 2006; Hsu et al. 2009). Unfocused reputations may be especially harmful if the different dimensions are incompatible. Again, this is especially relevant in the cultural industries where there is a possible tension between having both a favorable artistic as well as commercial reputation (Caves 2000). Whereas previous studies focus on the risks of ex ante strategies of spanning categories such as a producer’s choice between making a multiple-genre as opposed to a single-genre film (Hsu 2006), or stretching identities by film actors and actresses trying to break away from being typecast for specific roles (Zuckerman et al. 2003), our study focuses on the effect of being positively evaluated ex post by different categories of evaluators along different dimensions of performance and how this subsequently affects investor behavior. In other words, we focus on the detrimental effects of having an unfocused reputation as a specific form of having an unfocused identity. Although one would expect that past performance in more than one dimension at the same time would constitute a positive signal that reduces investment risk, this may also create uncertainty for investors with respect to the intentions of a founding member of a new ventures as to which goals he or she will pursue. In Hollywood, this is illustrated by director Michael Cimino who, after directing the both commercially and artistically highly successful film ‘the Deer Hunter’, nearly ruined the film studio United Artists with his huge flop ‘Heaven’s Gate’ (Bach 1999). In addition and possibly more important, it may also create uncertainty to investors as to which category of evaluators he or she will (try to) appeal to. Reputations, and the issue of unfocused reputations, are especially relevant in the context of the cultural industries that are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. In order to reduce risk, investors can regard the reputations of the founding members derived from their past performance as insurance. However, organizations in cultural industries also need to balance the tension between art and commerce (Caves 2000). A film can be a commercial success in terms of the number of tickets sold at the box office, but at the same time, it can be an artistic success in terms of favorable critics’ reviews (Gemser et al. 2007; Basuroy et al. 2003; Eliashberg and Shugan 1997). In this paper, we posit that investors face an investment risk when financing new ventures of which the core members have both a favorable commercial as well as a favorable artistic reputation at the same time. The empirical setting of this paper is the film industry. The film industry is a highly uncertain and risky industry due to the high sunk costs and difficulty of predicting market demand. This is reflected in the ‘no one knows anything’ principle (Goldman 1984). Moreover, since in the film industry the strategic resources of an organization are almost all human resources, it seems reasonable to focus even more on the reputations of the key individuals involved. We limit ourselves to two dimensions of reputation: commercial and artistic, which are the basic dimensions along which performance is measured in cultural industries (Caves 2000). We also focus on two roles: the producer and the director, each of whom is specifically associated with one of these dimensions. The director is assumed to have the main responsibility for artistic quality, the producer for the commercial performance. The investors whose behavior we will study are the film distributors who have to decide on the size of the so-called minimum guarantee that they want to invest in a project when it is still in its pre-production stage. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In the theory section, we review the literature on reputation and investment, and category spanning, on the basis of which a number of hypotheses will be proposed. This will be followed by a description of the research setting—the Dutch film industry—the data and the results. Discussion and conclusions will round off the paper.",18

The development of the market depends on the level and quality of the users’ equipment (in e-reading devices like tablets, readers, computers and phones). Consumers also require sufficient storage capacity and speed of information transmission (for enriched books including videos and music). Digitization generates direct and indirect network externalities (David 1985; Shapiro and Varian 1998). Katz and Shapiro (1986) show that for many products, the utility that a user derives from consumption increases with the number of agents consuming the good. Moreover, a full range of content needs to be easily available. Catalogs and devices are complementary goods: When one of them becomes cheaper or of better quality, the market of the other extends. If more eBooks are available and if the depth and variety of catalogs increase, people buy more devices, and, reciprocally, the rise in demand for devices acts as an incentive to increase the number of eBooks that can be downloaded. Consumers demand easy online payment systems and fair prices. Publishers have to take into account that buyers expect a significant price gap between books and eBooks. But they ignore the willingness to pay for the digital version of a book and a fortiori for enhanced contents. They cannot rely on the sole observation of early adopters’ behavior. In the USA, the market is booming: It represented 0.6 % of the total trade market in 2008, 6.4 % in 2010 and 22 % in 2012. In 2012, eBook sales represented $3.04 billion (Source: Bookstats 2013, American Publishers Ass.). Conversely, the market is narrow and still in its infancy in Europe: in 2012, it represented 12 % of the UK’s total book market (8  % in 2011 and 5 % in 2010), the equivalent of £411 million (Source: The Publishers Ass.). It is <3 % of the total market in France (source: SNE), where publishers do not wish to destabilize the paper bookselling sector by launching eBooks at a discounted price. 
This paper stresses the importance and the rise of giant actors, who try to organize the market following two different economic models: an open model (Google) and a lock-in model (Amazon, Apple). Whichever model on which they build their growth, these actors continuously strengthen their dominant position. Considering the history of this very recent market, we wonder whether legal tools and antitrust decisions are appropriate in order to curtail the risk of dominant positions being abused. After a short review of the literature, this paper provides a description of the main characteristics of the market (2), addressing the effects of Google Books on the one side (3), and of Amazon’s strategy on the other (4). It concludes with some questions about the future of regulation (5).",18

Alan Peacock had a long and very distinguished career in economics, as an adviser to the UK government, as a university administrator and as Chairman of the Scottish Arts Council. He remains a towering figure in cultural economics and was one of the earliest contributors to our subject, in which he worked for over 40 years. He became the first ACEI Distinguished Fellow in 1996, one among the many honours and awards that he received. There have been many obituaries of Alan Peacock and an account of his huge and varied contribution to economics and indeed of his other activities is beyond our scope. Therefore, we concentrate on his contribution to cultural economics and his activities in the arts more generally. The task is certainly made the easier as Alan was a dedicated writer on his interest in these topics, as many readers will know from his Paying the Piper (1993). He continued to do valuable work in cultural economics, particularly in the economics of heritage, until only a year or so before he died.
 Before turning to his work in cultural economics, we offer a brief sketch of the beliefs and principles that motivated Alan Peacock’s work in economics and, one might almost say, his life. First and foremost he was a classical liberal following in the footsteps of his fellow Scot, Adam Smith. This philosophy has come to be debased as simply a belief in small government and free markets, but Alan was truly liberal in all he thought and did; he was open to new ideas, hated hypocrisy and pomposity and in his own way was anti-Establishment, at least that of England. It is therefore not surprising that he was attracted to political economy, welfare economics and public choice theory. This stance put him in league with free market organisations such as the Institute of Economic Affairs and the David Hume Institute in Edinburgh which he founded, and led to his support of the first private university in the UK, University of Buckingham, of which he became the first Vice Chancellor, but he was also Chief Economic Advisor to the UK government’s Department of Trade and Industry and chair of the committee of enquiry into the finance of British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), resulting in the 1986 Peacock Report which was far ahead of its times in recommending the licence fee be replaced by subscription (now being reconsidered but regarded as ‘lunatic fringe’ at the time); he was knighted for this service. Long before that, he had been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) for his wartime service in the Royal Navy. He was also Chairman of the Scottish Arts Council, which entailed membership of the Arts Council of Great Britain (ACGB), of which he was inevitably critical. So Alan had a foot in both worlds as the free-thinking, irreverent Scot and part-time member of the UK establishment. His sardonic sense of humour, great intelligence and integrity carried him though unscathed. In addition to his activities in the UK, Alan Peacock had strong professional connections abroad, especially in Italy, where he was honoured with membership of the Accademia dei Lincei. Eleven European universities acknowledged his academic and professional achievements and conferred him honorary degrees. He was also consultant to many international organisations and to foreign governments throughout the world. Besides this wide-ranging professional life, Alan Peacock was a keen musician, playing the violin, singing, conducting and composing (he studied composition with Hans Gál, the Viennese composer who had settled in Edinburgh) and this led him to have an interest in the finance of orchestras; one of his first forays into the economics of the arts (which, by the way, was spelt with a capital ‘A’ in those more respectful days) was to chair an Arts Council enquiry in 1970 into the London orchestras, of which there were (and still are) four: Peacock recommended they be reduced to two, which stirred up a hornets’ nest. Alan loved to refer to economics as the dismal science and did not flinch from applying it as such; he also often said that what governments and similar institutions wanted of economists was a ‘hired gun’ who would provide the result they wanted to see. He declined to do so and stuck to his belief in independent thinking. He did not ‘suffer fools gladly’ and could be a hard critic but he was a kind and generous man especially with students and young researchers.",2

By now, there has been a significant amount of published academic work by economists in the field of music. A significant earlier survey of the field can be found in Connolly and Krueger (2006). A substantial amount of such work has appeared in the present journal and in other publications by members of the Association for Cultural Economics International. However, the body of work has an extremely skewed distribution. If we do a simple division of economics into demand, supply and pricing, then most of the work on music is on the demand side. Supply side work is very scarce and has generally been about live music chiefly the costs of orchestras (e.g. Lange and Luksetich 1993; Schulze and Anselm 1999. Work on pricing of anything in music apart from concert tickets (see, e.g. Connolly and Krueger 2006; Courty and Pagliero 2014; Halcousis and Matthews 2007) on collectibles [see, e.g. Eaton (2007) on guitars, Graddy and Margolis (2011) on violins, Georges and Seçkin (2013) on classical music manuscripts, Cameron and Reynolds (2015) on minidiscs] is relatively infrequent. We may also note a lack of interest in international trade in music which is explored in a descriptive manner in Cameron (2015, Chapter 10) in terms of movement of artists, recorded media and musical equipment across borders. Early demand work concentrated on aggregate single equation models, specifically focusing on the impact of price and seasonality Burke (1994, 1996). There has also been a trickle of problematic attempts to predict success in the music sector using data on chart positions (most usually the US Billboard album or singles charts) or the award of gold records (e.g. Cox et al. 1995; Hamlen 1991, 1994; Strobl and Tucker 2000; Ordanini 2006; Giles 2006, 2007; Dubini and Provera 2008; Hendricks and Sorensen 2009; Moe and Earl 2009 {Swedish charts}; Elliott and Simmons 2011 {UK Charts}). Some of this work is comparable to a prominent area of research in the study of films as the focus is on skewness in terms of there being a small number of very successful entities and a large number of very unsuccessful ones. Identification of individual factors in the success of works/artists in a way suitable for econometric testing is a major problem. To be fully implemented, this requires some sort of coding of the recorded works, and so far, use of things like key and tempo has not been very insightful. In addition, there is a censorship problem in that charting music is the top slice of the distribution of released music, so comparative data on very unsuccessful music are typically omitted. Papers on success in terms of performance are sometimes by non-economists such as the work by Gloor (2011) which appeared in the music educators journal and is pinned around Andy Warhol’s ‘Famous for fifteen minutes dictum’ that popular musical stars have often only one major landmark work on which they subsist. Gloor looks at different eras over a long time frame. He specifically identifies the disco era of the late 1970’s as possible cause of increased skewness in reward to effort, but his data and methods do not permit any testing of this hypothesis. The special issue paper by Phillips and Strachan (2016) continues the use of chart data, (Billboard again), but in this instance, the chart data are used to illustrate the potential efficiency of the musical group format rather then being the topic of interest in itself. More recently, the resurgence of talent competitions has raised concerns about the possible extent of market failure due to short-termism in the management of talent and over-focusing on non-musical aspects of performers (Amegashie 2009; Zwaan and ter Bogt 2010). Of the special issue papers, two deal with little-studied aspects of supply (the sustainability of musical ‘groups’ or ‘bands’ versus alternatives such as solo work, financing via crowdsouring), one with the totally neglected market failure problem of the environmental damage from the music sector. The first paper, by Liebowitz (2016), seeks to reach, in so far as possible, a definitive conclusion on the musical matter that has most occupied economists in recent times, to wit the impact of copyright infringement, by consumers, on the demand for recorded music. An alternative review of the impacts of digitisation can be found in Waldfogel (2014). The study of this is a demand issue, although the problems are caused by a supply side revolution. That is, once we begin turning musical recordings into sets of 0’s and 1’s stored on digital media, it is possible to transfer them across time and space and make infinite numbers of copies at low cost. Formal cost may be zero, but it is best to consider this as ‘near-zero’ pricing as there are some costs to the user such as impact of use of illegal sites on their own browsing efficiency or indeed the risk and magnitude of prosecution.",18

Francisco,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Brazil is one of the major music producing and consuming regions worldwide, and it had the 11th largest market in 2009 (IFPI 2010). Although 58 % of the market was national and 90 % of the best-selling albums were by local musicians in 2009 (IFPI 2014), music production differs little from the world market, as a few record companies compose the local market (Cassiolato et al. 2008). As such, the cost of entry for budding musicians is high (Cameron 2015). Although there is often demand from Brazilian artists for financing their activities (Lucas 2000), access to resources for beginners is scarce. Indeed, if we consider musicians as entrepreneurs, at the outset of their initiatives they find it difficult to attract external capital. The problem of accessing specific financing sources is inherent to their initial stage (Berger and Udell 1998; Cosh et al. 2009). This difficulty places a limiting factor on the entrepreneur’s chances of survival and growth, especially given the lack of true guarantees and what potential investors would view as sufficient cash flows or good reputation. It should also be noted that investors are faced with asymmetric information. According to Cosh et al. (2009), entrepreneurs requiring smaller amounts of capital are unable to access venture capital, private equity or banks, which may be available in other stages. Hence, these entrepreneurs tend to find backing from: (1) their own resources, (2) their family and (3) their circle of close friends (Parker 2009; Sheng and Mendes-da-Silva 2014). Crowdfunding has become an innovative method for bringing investors and those requiring capital closer together, especially when the latter are developing artistic, cultural, social or other types of initiatives (Shiller 2013). This method has enabled relatively small sums pledged by a large number of people to make businesses viable in a more flexible and less costly way that does not require intermediate financiers. A large number of platforms for raising funds through crowdfunding have appeared as a result of this phenomenon. One example is Kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/), which is currently the largest platform in the world. Kickstarter is a North American website hosting projects including films, games, music, design and technology. Since its launch in 2009, it has attracted more than R$ 1.5 billion from 5.1 million people to finance more than 50,000 creative projects (Qiu 2013). Although the World Bank (2013) and specialized consultants point to the rapid growth of this financing mode, it still tends to be highly concentrated in North America and Europe (59 and 35 % of the total value around the world, respectively) with a negligible presence in developing continents. South America, for example, represented only 0.03 % of this market and that portion exceeded only the corresponding one for the African continent, which represented just 0.003 % (Massolution 2013). In addition to the social impact of crowdfunding and its interest from the financial media, and more recently, the academic business community (Shiller 2013; Mollick 2014; Bruton et al. 2015), various governments have recognized its relevance to developing countries (Royal and Windsor 2014), and consequently, they have given attention to regulating this activity (Agrawal et al. 2014). For example, the US Government recently approved legislation entitled the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), which has the main objective of stimulating access by companies in the emerging growth stage (Stemler 2013). In finance, investors tend to demand relatively more information from embryonic businesses, given the high level of risk when dealing with new businesses (Berger and Udell 1998). Investors in startups also tend to prefer businesses that are physically closer, as they are motivated by the wish to reduce the information asymmetry (Lee et al. 2008). However, crowdfunding allows an unlimited number of geographically dispersed people to be reached for the purpose of obtaining small amounts of money for financing a project or enterprise. It also allows business activities to be monitored as they progress, and this monitoring can occur over large distances, which will reduce information asymmetries. Moreover, in their mode of pledges, creative entrepreneurs like musicians can overcome problems of market capitalism as a delivery mechanism (Cameron 2015). This article examines the associations that exist between the fundraising period, geographic distances, socioeconomic factors and the pledges made to projects financed through crowdfunding in an emerging economy. For this purpose, the data that were analyzed are related to 1835 pledges toward ten music production projects that were judged to be successful on the main Brazilian crowdfunding platform in 2013: Catarse. This work is organized in five sections. Section 2 presents background material about crowdfunding, its uses and the hypotheses tested in this study. Then, Sect. 3 sets out the methodology we used. The results are discussed in Sect. 4, and our conclusions are given in Sect. 5.",48

Over 15 years ago, the explosive growth of the file-sharing network Napster put the issue on the agenda of policy makers and stakeholders. So far, neither private nor public copyright enforcement measures have resolved the issue. Copyrights holders face a tough choice between continuing to try and enforce exclusive rights in the digital realm or exploring alternatives, such as the one discussed in this paper. This paper discusses whether a copyright compensation system (CCS) for recorded music—endowing private Internet subscribers with the right to download and use works in return for a fee—would be welfare increasing under current market conditions. It reports the results of a discrete choice experiment conducted with a representative sample of the Dutch population consisting of 4986 participants. The Internet penetration rate in the Netherlands is 95 %, one of the highest worldwide (Eurostat 2014a, b). The Netherlands also entertains a system of levies on copying technology, so that basic elements of a CCS should be familiar to many residences. We find that applied only to recorded music, a mandatory CCS could increase the welfare of rights holders and users in the Netherlands by over €600 million per year (over €35 per capita). This far exceeds the current sales value of recorded music of ca. €144 million. Even if a CCS were to substitute all of the current sales of recorded music and provided no cost-savings, it could simultaneously increase user welfare and rights holder revenues at a price that constitutes a reasonable surplus split. According to our results, this is achieved over a broad range of CCS user fees, for example between ca. €1.74 and €9.25 for a CCS that is mandatory for all households with Internet subscription. Some market conditions in the Netherlands make this result particularly noteworthy. On the one hand, during data collection, unauthorized private copying from unlawful sources was not outlawed in contrast to some other European countries. On the other hand, the digital market for recorded music in the Netherlands is relatively advanced. In 2012, the year preceding data collection, the digital market in the Netherlands already accounted for 31 % of all revenues in the primary market for recorded music, in which authorized services make copies of recordings available to end users (IFPI 2013). Given lower average retail prices for digital copies, the share of “digital” in unit sales would be higher. Music subscription services and ad-supported online music services accounted for 54 % of digital revenues.Footnote 1 Residents of the Netherlands thus report substantial willingness to pay (WTP) for participation in a compensation system covering recorded music, in spite of (1) virtually no legal risk associated with private copying from unlawful sources at the time of data collection, and (2) availability and widespread use of authorized digital music services and in particular music subscriptions. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 briefly discusses digitization in the copyright industries and the literature on CCS. Section 3 describes the application and limitation of contingent valuation methods to value untraded goods and discrete choice experiments in particular, and provides information on the method and data used in this paper. Section 4 describes basic results, and Sect. 5 presents estimates of the effect of several CCS options on user welfare and rights holder revenues. Section 6 discusses a number of limitations and extensions to our assessment. Section 7 presents main conclusions.",15

SWB, referring to an individual’s self-assessment of their overall well-being (Diener et al. 1999), has become the focus of an expanding range of research within the social sciences. The extant literature has centred on improving our understanding of: (1) what individuals value and; (2) the factors affecting their well-being (see Clark et al. 2008; Dolan et al. 2008; MacKerron 2012). This body of literature has been partly driven by acknowledgement of the limitations of relying solely on economic data, including gross domestic product, which is arguably the single most important economic statistic in public discourse, as measures of welfare (Hicks et al. 2013: 74). These economic measures, never intended as complete measures of progress, have been criticised for not accounting for all relevant production, income and wealth, and failing to capture the value of relationships, health and happiness (Weijers and Jarden 2013: 1–2). In respect of cultural goods including arts events, museums, historical sites and certain sporting activities, gross domestic product has limited relevance as individuals participate in these activities for a range of reasons, both economic and cultural. In recent years, there has been a significant public debate about the role of gross domestic product and its profile in policy making processes, prompting attempts to construct alternative measures of economic performance and well-being: the UK Office for National Statistics now reports on well-being. From a measurement perspective, there is an important distinction between objective and subjective measures of well-being (see Galloway et al. 2006, 19–22). Objective measures of well-being typically take the form of a basket of indicators or a composite index such as the Measure of Domestic Progress (Cobb and Daly 1989) and its successors. They generally capture material conditions that influence well-being. These measures adjust GDP in a number of ways that attempt to capture non-market activities (e.g. adding the value of domestic labour or subtracting costs associated with crime). Arts, cultural and sporting activities, as cultural goods exhibit certain characteristics which generate cultural value. Aspects of these activities are, therefore, unmeasurable on a monetary scale (Throsby 2001: 32). Calculating shadow prices is problematic with the potential for significant bias (Fujiwara 2013). Measures of SWB, in contrast, capture how people experience the quality of their lives and incorporate emotional responses and cognitive judgements. SWB, though, has been the subject of significant debate, not least in regard to its use as a substitute, or complement, to long-standing revealed preference and income-based welfare measures (Kesebir and Diener 2008). SWB measures provide a proxy for ‘utility’ and there is a large body of literature exploring potential arguments for this proxy utility function (Frey and Stutzer 2002: 405). This ‘experienced’ utility is empirically measured using either a ‘single-item scale’ or ‘multi-item measures’ (Downward and Rasciute 2011: 333). The two most common single-item scales focus on ‘happiness with life’ and ‘satisfaction with life’ (Dolan et al. 2008), measures which have been shown empirically to generate largely consistent responses (Smith and Exton 2013). As stated preference measures, SWB measures capture how individuals feel about their life on ‘aggregate’ or ‘overall’ (life satisfaction or happiness), and in regard to individual satisfaction with different domains of life termed ‘domain satisfaction’ (van Praag et al. 2003: 30), e.g. job and leisure satisfaction. Measures of SWB tend to be derived from survey questions, of the form ‘All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days’, where responses are provided on a Likert scale usually comprising either five, seven or eleven categories ranging from ‘not at all’ or ‘completely unsatisfied’ to ‘completely satisfied’ (Hicks et al. 2013: 78; Helliwell et al. 2015). This paper considers both ‘overall’ (life satisfaction and a measure of general happiness) and domain satisfaction (job and leisure satisfaction). This paper aims to assess the relationship between these measures and participation and engagement in arts, cultural and sporting activities. A further contribution of the paper is to extend the findings of the extant literature by considering a wide range of these activities, comprising 70 activities in total, using data extracted from the UK Understanding Society survey. Specifically, this paper seeks to answer the following research questions: (1) do empirical measures of SWB support the hypothesis that cultural goods—including arts activities and events, museums, historical sites and sporting activities—generate positive leisure experience and are a source of cultural value; (2) does the frequency of participation and engagement in arts, cultural and sporting activities have relevance to SWB; and (3) is there a domain spillover between satisfaction with leisure and satisfaction with other aspects of life (job, life, general happiness)?",81

In particular, arts participation can take place in interaction with other individuals, who can enrich such an experience. Time is becoming an increasingly precious resource, one that shapes our lives. The amount of time allocated to arts activities—whether attending arts events or engaging in amateur art practices—can indicate how much individuals value the arts, and add to other measurements of arts demand, such as money spent, stated preferences, and retrospective surveys on participation. This paper sheds light on these different aspects by focusing on one fundamental social unit—couples—and by considering the joint arts participation of spouses. We will examine not only the probability of their participating in the arts but also the factors that determine the amount of time couples dedicate to the arts and how partners may influence each other. The country under consideration—Italy—is distinguished not only by an extremely rich cultural supply but also by striking gender inequalities in terms of paid and unpaid work distribution between spouses. This has repercussions on both the free and discretionary time, in which arts participation could take place. In our analysis, we apply a household production framework, where a combination of goods and time contribute to such a production. In this study, diary data drawn from the national Time Use Survey of Italian households (ISTAT 2002–2003) will be used for the first time to study arts participation. We will also distinguish between arts attendance (visiting a theatre, a museum, a concert, etc.) and amateur arts practices (playing music, painting, dancing, etc.). In the next section, we contextualise our study in the literature on couples’ leisure and arts participation, including contributions based on diary data. Section 3 describes the data set, while Sect. 4 introduces the empirical model and the underlying hypotheses in explaining couples’ time use and togetherness in arts participation. In Sect. 5, we present and discuss the empirical results. The final section concludes the paper.",15

Tourists visiting a particular city often differ widely in their travel motives. History, museums, the design of the city and its historical buildings, theatres, music halls, the cultural atmosphere may all contribute to its attraction for various groups of tourists. City marketers emphasize the various aspects to attract different groups of visitors. It seems likely that the travel motives of these visitors, which are related to the aspects of the city that attract them, are also related to their activities and expenditure patterns and, through this, to their impact on the local economy. However, little seems to be known about such differences and it is the purpose of this paper to shed more light on this issue by studying the expenditure pattern of tourists with different travel motives, while controlling for other potentially important determinants of expenditure like country of origin. The data we analyse refer to the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area in the Netherlands.Footnote 1 Amsterdam is an important attractor of tourists in Western Europe and the major tourist city of the Netherlands. People from all over the world visit the city. Like many other Western European cities, Amsterdam is an old city, founded in the Middle Ages, with a wide range of cultural heritage. Van der Ark and Richards (2006) state that culture has become a major driving force of the urban tourism system. The canals and the related cultural heritage of the seventeenth century ‘Golden Age’ of the city are probably the ‘trademark’ of the city, and a large part of the ancient centre is on the UNESCO World Heritage list. However, this is certainly not the only amenity that Amsterdam has to offer. The Amsterdam museums (the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum are probably the best-known examples) also have international reputations. Moreover, and partly related to this, Amsterdam is a popular location for conferences and exhibitions. Amsterdam is also widely known for the Dutch governments’ tolerance for the use and sale of cannabis. In the Netherlands, its use and selling are quasi-legalized which has given Amsterdam in particular a reputation as a ‘cannabis Valhalla’ among foreigners and consequently tourists. The focus on Amsterdam thus offers the possibility to investigate the expenditures of tourists who come with widely different travel motives ranging from visiting Amsterdam’s cultural heritage to experiencing the quasi-legalized cannabis scene. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews existing empirical studies on tourism expenditure analysis at the micro-level. Section 3 describes the data we use and provides some descriptives. Section 4 elaborates briefly on the micro-econometric method used and reports estimation results for total daily expenditure and budgets shares of a number of categories. Section 5 concludes.",19

There seems to be a genuine public interest in knowing how other people rate almost everything. In contrast, not so much is known of the meaning of rankings. In this paper, it is argued that rankings are coordination games. The players in this game are people who want to coordinate a social activity that has characteristics of both a private good and a public good. The respective social activity may be a productive process, for instance, scientific work, or a leisure event such as listening to pop music. The private good of the activity may be individual status (in productive processes) or simply personal enjoyment (in leisure events). However, the social activity also has characteristics of a public good, as it requires many coordinated activities to be productive or to be a fully enjoyable event. In leisure events, the good itself—the “event”—is collectively provided by the participants themselves (see DeSerpa and Faith 1996, who dubbed such goods “mob goods”). Rankings as such, and especially rankings as coordination games, raise two related questions. Firstly, how stable and contestable are rankings? Superstars, for instance, are those people or institutions who are at the top of rankings, in some cases for a long time. Although there is an economic theory of superstardom (Rosen 1981; Adler 1985; MacDonald 1988), it neither is known whether the superstar position is stable nor whether it is contestable. The second question is how these rankings and their contestability can be explained. To answer these questions, in this paper, the Top 2000 charts of the Dutch public NPO Radio 2 (www.radio2.nl/top2000) are analyzed. This chart started in 1999 and has become very popular until today. The chart is based on a voting by radio listeners, i.e., it is not a ranking of songs according to commercial success. Rather, it looks for the 2000 “most meaningful songs to our audience,” as pointed out by the broadcaster (NPO Radio 2 2015a). The songs are ranked according to votes and are broadcast (starting with position 2000) from Christmas Day to midnight on New Year’s Eve. The Top 2000 is a big social event nationwide in the Netherlands. The data of all rankings from 1999 to 2014 are available on the Web site of NPO Radio 2 (2014). The song titles, the artists, and the year of song production are all indicated. Almost the same dataset (i.e., the data without 2014) was analyzed recently by Sterken (2014). Sterken’s main objective was to analyze the impact of the year of song production on its ranking. The “loss of collective memory” effect was juxtaposed with the “nostalgia” effect of pop songs. Additionally, Sterken (2014) explained empirically the life span of songs by means of the respective artists’ superstar status (The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and several others are present in the ranking with a large number of songs), the songs’ lengths and language, as well as their debut rankings. The dataset of the Top 2000 songs and their rankings over time are an unusual source for studying the dynamics of popularity and success in popular music. Charts and bestseller lists are normally very short (about ten to 100 ranks). Consequently, they represent only a small fragment of the respective market, so that the distribution of popularity and success can only be measured for the very top level. In addition, charts measure mainly commercial success. In contrast to music charts and bestseller lists, the Top 2000 event takes place annually, and the song rankings are voted on by a large part of the Dutch population. Hence, the rankings represent a much greater share of the popular music market. Moreover, song success in the Top 2000 charts is not commercially defined and motivated. Hence, this data basis allows for a much broader analysis, both statistically and economically. In this paper, the distribution of song success over all rankings, as well as the underlying stochastic process, is studied. The first objective is to determine the contestability of the song ranking. Although this issue is related to the topics studied in Sterken (2014), the objective is nevertheless quite different. The second objective of the paper is to provide a rationale for the distribution of the popularity of songs in the Top 2000 charts. Since the database of these charts is large, the distribution of song success can be analyzed thoroughly. Moreover, the statistical results constitute a solid basis for economic interpretation. The result is that the Top 2000 ranking is seen here as a coordination game of the Dutch population. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the second section, the relevant literature on the distribution of success in the industry of popular music is reviewed. Section 3 contains the descriptive statistics of the bilateral ranking correlations for the years 1999–2014, as well as an analysis of the empirical distribution of song success. In Sect. 4, the empirical results are discussed and interpreted. Section 5 concludes.",1

Regional economies constantly strive to strengthen their knowledge base and future growth strategies point at knowledge and innovation as the key driving forces to achieve sustainable growth (European Commission 2010). In relation to this, there is a large focus in the literature on the role played by regional characteristics related to location-specific amenities in attracting skilled labor (cf. McGranahan 1999; Glaeser et al. 2001; Florida 2002; Clark et al. 2002; Rappaport 2007; Glaeser, and Kahn 2010; Albouy 2015). An important perspective set forth in this research is that amenities have a tendency to be income elastic, such that their demand rises with income and education (Brueckner et al. 1999; Moretti 2004; Lee 2010). This suggests that amenity valuations vary for skilled and unskilled workers in that high human capital workers likely have a stronger preference for amenities. A number of studies argue along these lines and show that natural amenities play a significant role in explaining individual location decisions, and especially of those individuals with high levels of human capital (Berry and Glaeser 2005; Brown and Scott 2012). Different types of amenities, such as favorable climate, proximity to lakes, oceans, forests and mountain areas are identified as important drivers of regional growth.Footnote 1
 Although the influence of natural amenities on human capital migration and regional growth is well documented in the literature, significantly less attention has been devoted to the influence of cultural heritage as a potentially important local attribute that is able to attract high-skilled labor (Moretti 2004; Falck et al. 2011). This is despite the increased focus on cultural heritage as an area of priority and as an important strategic resource with the potential to improve regional attractiveness and competitiveness (cf. Throsby 2001; Heidenreich and Plaza 2015; Barile and Saviano 2015).Footnote 2 Sweden is no exception, and cultural heritage is viewed as an important local resource that can generate social and environmental benefits and contribute to community-led development. Studies that address the role played by listed buildings and cultural heritage sites on various types of economic indicators tend to be case studies that focus on certain types of cultural heritages or specific regions (e.g., Bedate et al. 2004; Ruijgrok 2006; Bowitz and Ibenholt 2009; Lazrak et al. 2014). One obvious limitation of such approaches is that their results are not generalizable, but apply to the specific region in focus. This paper contributes to the literature by addressing the role played by listed buildings and cultural environments in attracting high-skilled individuals across the whole Swedish geography and over time. Moreover, the analysis takes on an integrated approach and focuses on cultural heritage as a potentially important locational attribute alongside other key characteristics related to natural amenities, agglomeration and labor market characteristics. A distinction is made between different natural, cultural and urban qualities, and measures of local supply are constructed using georeferenced data. The study uses a spatially disaggregated approach based on neighborhood-level data from Sweden and employs a multilevel approach to account for unobserved heterogeneity and spatial dependencies. The presence of unobserved heterogeneity is a problem that inevitably arises in the analysis of locational factors and a particular concern in this study is that cultural amenities may not be exogenously determined in the same way as natural amenities (Falck et al. 2011). In particular, since their demand rises with income and education, there is a possibility that cultural heritages are, in part, caused by regional economic growth and market size effects. To overcome these potential endogeneity problems and identify a relationship between cultural amenities and the spatial concentration of high-skilled labor, we employ multilevel random effects estimations with instruments in the form of clustered centered means (Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh 2004; Snijders and Berkhof 2008). With the intention to gain a deeper understanding of the contribution of cultural heritage in attracting skilled individuals, we also investigate whether the associations differ between urban and rural regions. The authors are unaware of any similar approaches in the literature. A line of argument that follows through this analysis is that amenity-led regional growth may not be a one-size-fit-all solution and that regions may have varying potential when it comes to exploiting amenities depending on their size (McGranahan et al. 2011; Dissart and Marcouiller 2012). In order to study regional heterogeneity in the outcomes, we create interaction terms by using the amenity variables and an urban–rural taxonomy that reflect regional size and commuting patterns in Sweden. Using this approach, we find support for the importance of built heritages and cultural environments in explaining the local growth of skilled individuals in Sweden; we also find significant differences in the outcomes over the urban–rural range. Among the tested amenities, we find that it is profoundly cultural heritages that are scale driven, e.g., that have a larger effect in urban compared to rural areas.",37

Those who read books, go to theatre or attend music concerts, do not only increase their own utility, but generate also positive effects for the society, for example, in the form of improved education and literacy. Welfare theory informs us about the existence of dead-weight if goods and services that incorporate externalities are consumed. This is caused by the fact that markets do not internalize externalities and thus trade does not occur at efficient quantities. Therefore, the action of policy makers is required so that the right quantities are supplied and consumed. An economics textbook solution to this inefficiency is fiscal policy: by the means of taxes and subsidies consumption of cultural goods and services can be steered so that efficient outcomes are obtained. There is, however, little understanding of these measures, especially of fiscal discounts in the European context, and there is also only limited agreement on whether these tools should be used. This paper attempts to fill this void by documenting fiscal rates across the EU Member States over time, including rates for cultural goods, by analysing the local context (i.e. population, GDP). The goal of this paper is to improve our understanding of fiscal rates for cultural goods and services, with a particular focus on books. This is done by documenting discounted value added tax (VAT) rates across EU Member States from 1993 and by illuminating the effects of fiscal incentives on the prices of selected cultural goods and services and on the cultural expenditure of households on books. Governments in Europe can chose to lower the VAT for books in order to stimulate an increase in literacy, as did the Netherlands lowering the tax for books from 21 to 6%, or Ireland from 21 to 0%, or Sweden from 25 to 6%. Tax literature has raised concerns on the efficiency of VAT for culture as they are considered “expensive and poor targeted means of addressing distributional concerns” (Borselli et al. 2012, p. 14). As indirect subsidy, VAT is less visible as it is not formally discussed in parliament (Hemels 2009). These concerns become more critical with the expanding international online markets and as new Member States homogenize fiscal practices. The reduced rates as a whole are regarded as a revenue loss of up to 1.7% of the share of GDP (CE 2007). Reduced VAT rates for culture are a significant cost and as such are included as tax expenditure in national budgets (O’Hagan 2003). Arguments to support the implementation of a VAT rate for culture focus on the positive externalities that come with cultural consumption (EC 2014; Frey 2008). By consuming culture, self-interested individuals provide benefits to society as a whole, be it in the form of improved education or literacy (Krashen et al. 2012) or as higher consumption of goods and services offered during cultural consumption (e.g. purchases in the museum café) (Plaza 2000). An important international comparative analysis on fiscal policy to support the arts was conducted more than three decades ago and focused on tax breaks in the USA (Feld et al. 1983). The model of tax concessions for cultural goods and services in Europe is introduced and analysed economically in an important study by O’Hagan (1998), while Schuster (2006) provides insights on tax incentives in cultural policy with a particular focus on the USA. Recent publications on cultural VAT rates include country analysis to estimate consumption as a result of changes in the fiscal policy (Gesko 2013; Hjorth-Andersen 2000; MvF 2014; Prieto-Rodriguez et al. 2005; Ringstad and Løyland 2006), to focus on the nature of the policy (Campbell 2013; Colbjørnsen 2014; Hemels 2009), or to estimate the revenue raised by the VAT (O’Hagan 2003). Publications on the relationship between pricing and cultural consumption remain dissociated from VAT rate policy. This article contributes to the body of work on the economic analysis of fiscal policy by comparing the VAT rates in all EU Member States for the last two decades and by adding country-specific determinants to the analysis of cultural consumption. That is, we not only analyse the changes in VAT rates and their effect on book prices in time, but we also examine the association with cultural consumption. Specifically, we look at the standard and reduced VAT rates for cultural goods in EU Member States from 1993 to 2014. Since VAT rates are part of a national tax policy, not all Member States have the same reduction on specific types of goods and services, and most, but not all, countries have introduced reduced rates in different years. These geographical and temporal variations offer a very convenient setting that can be exploited quantitatively; in doing so, we shed light on the determinants of fiscal rates. One key finding is that the VAT rates are not related to the fundamental variables that determine cultural consumption—namely GDP, level of education and population size—but instead appear to be set following a different rationale. This seems to question the notion that cultural tax discounts are used to stimulate cultural consumption. The paper also explores how reduced cultural rates affect book prices and household expenditure. Indirectly, our results contribute thus to research on price elasticity in the arts. We show that these associations are in accordance with theory and demonstrate also that an increase in VAT rates for books has a causal influence on book consumption. The book angle is also particularly interesting in light of current policy developments. France and Luxembourg were two EU countries that introduced a reduced VAT rate also for e-books from 2012, at 5.5 and 3%, respectively. This was done, however, without the Commission’s approval and, as a result, in 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that e-books supplied via download or streaming are a service and therefore fall outside of the VAT exemption. The VAT rate is established based on the carrier and not on the content, resulting in a negative incentive for technologic development in Europe. This appears in stark contrast to the substantial support and funding into the improvement and promotion of Europe’s digital cultural heritage. Not surprisingly, in March 2017 a last amendment is discussed in the Council of Europe which would enable the introduction of reduced (and super reduced) VAT rates for electronic books (albeit not for music or video content in general). This amendment would form a key element in the enabling of the Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe.Footnote 1 It is hoped that the here disclosed enhancing role of VAT rate discounts on consumption of books will contribute further to related discussions in the future. In general, the overall role of digital technologies in increasing cultural consumption has to be acknowledged as well (e.g., Borowiecki and Navarrete 2017; Navarrete and Borowiecki 2016), albeit is addressed in this paper only incidentally. At the EU-level, decision-making on cultural fiscal rates is conducted by the taxation departments, which have likely divergent aims and priorities than the department responsible for cultural policies. The extended period considered here allows for a potentially rich insight into policy analysis and, in this way, we bridge the gap found between fiscal policy and cultural policy. It is hoped that results from this analysis will contribute not only to the research on public economics (fiscal studies) and cultural economics, but also to fiscal policy, particularly regarding the use of tax discounts as indirect support to the arts across EU Member States. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces VAT as an instrument used to collect revenue and as a policy tool to incentivise a desired behaviour. Section 3 reviews the empirical studies in Europe aimed at documenting the change in prices and in consumption brought on by a reduced or increased VAT rate. Section 4 presents the theory, followed by Sect. 5 where the data are presented. In Sect. 6, we describe our analysis. Section 7 concludes and proposes future research.",9

The paper extends the expanding body of recent research in this area, including Hand (2018), Schüttoff et al. (2018), Taylor et al. (2015) and Wheatley and Bickerton (2017). Existing evidence is consistent with the arts, culture and sport generating well-being benefits through positive leisure experiences, although the evidence base is incomplete and conflicting in some respects (Hand 2018; Marsh and Bertranou 2012; Michalos and Kahlke 2008, 2010; Wang and Wong 2011, 2014). This paper considers the impacts of leisure activities on self-assessed or subjective measures of well-being. Measures of subjective well-being capture how people experience the quality of their lives, and incorporate emotional responses and cognitive judgements (Kesebir and Diener 2008). While research into subjective well-being in the psychology discipline initially centred on the concept of happiness set points, from which individuals subjective well-being would only deviate in the short-run, research evidencing longer-term changes in subjective well-being has prompted arguments for well-being research to focus on factors causing change (Huang et al. 2018). Applying ordered logit, generalized ordered logit, ANCOVA and change score analysis to UK longitudinal data from two waves of Understanding Society, this paper responds to these arguments by assessing whether changes in subjective well-being are recorded in response to changing levels of engagement in arts, cultural and sporting leisure activities. In doing so, the analysis provides insight into the impact of the arts, culture and sport on overall well-being as well as reported satisfaction with specific domains of life. Building on the current evidence base, this paper aims to answer the following research questions: How do levels of engagement in arts, cultural and sporting leisure activities impact subjective well-being? Do changes in engagement in arts, cultural and sporting leisure activities have differentiated impacts on satisfaction with life overall and individual well-being domains (leisure time, health and job)?",16

India continues to be by far the world’s largest producer of films, producing 1724 films in 2013 compared to 738 films produced in the USA, and 638 films produced in China.Footnote 1 Nevertheless, domestic demand for films appears to be waning as in a number of developed countries including the USA and UK. For comparison purposes, film industry data for China, the USA and the UK as well as India are provided in Table 1. It is immediately clear that while India produces by far the greatest number of films, with the number of films produced continuing to rise, the number of consumers paying to see films at cinemas in India has declined dramatically in recent years, despite significant growth in GDP since 2000 and international investment in the Indian film industry, Fetscherin (2010). However, falling popularity of going to the cinema is not exclusive to India, with falls in cinema ticket sales also seen in the USA and UK. Each of these film markets can be considered mature markets, with long established, successful film production industries, and cinema visits a long-established social activity. Indeed, the first full-length Indian film, Raja Harischandra, was produced in 1913, and by the 1920s, large-scale Indian film studio companies existed, and Mumbai had established itself as an early hub for film making (to become known as Bollywood). See Jones et al. (2008) for a history of the Indian film industry. The importance of the Indian film industry to the Indian economy cannot be overstated: in 2012, Indian cinema box office revenues were $1.6 billion (McCarthy, 2014), in a services sector which accounts for more than 50% of the Indian economy.Footnote 2 Fetscherin (2010) suggests that the film industry accounts for approximately 20% of all revenues in the Indian media and entertainment industries. Further, despite the high profile of ‘Bollywood’ which is based in Mumbai, film production also has positive spillover benefits to other local economies, particularly Chennai where film production has long been established, with films made in four key southern Indian languages. There are also notable film production activities in Hyderabad, Karnataka, Kolkata and Kerala that benefit the local economies. Local economy benefits are not restricted to the direct benefits and multiplier effects associated with film production and therefore employment in specific local economies. Bollywood, in particular, also has tourism benefits with Bollywood locations boosting tourist visitor numbers, i.e. an indirect channel through which the Indian film industry contributes to gross domestic product (GDP). Yet, the Indian film industry currently faces a number of challenges. First, a major challenge remains film piracy which limits the revenues that can be reinvested by producers, distributors and exhibitors. A complicated system of regulations with responsibility shared by a number of national and state level government departments only contributes to the often ineffective nature of policies and laws that should guard against piracy, Jones et al. (2008). The problem of piracy results in lower revenues across the film industry, and the negative effect on investment in the industry is compounded by the high entertainment tax rates imposed in India. Second, relative to many countries, domestic cinema ticket prices remain low, Jones et al. (2008) and see Table 1. This again results in smaller box office revenues to be shared between film exhibitors, distributors and producers, reducing opportunities for reinvestment across the Indian film industry. This is particularly important at the moment as international film producers are increasingly investing in expensive technology associated with ‘enhanced format’ films, such as 3D and IMAX. Elliott et al. (2018) have found these films particularly popular with Chinese audiences, but these films require very large production budgets, as well as investment in cinemas by film exhibitors. Nevertheless, despite the costs of producing enhanced format films, they offer the advantage that the piracy of these films is less attractive as the special effects will be much less impressive to viewers when watching pirated films either on television screens or computer monitors. A further issue relating to low ticket prices is that regardless of this advantage, consumers are still purchasing fewer cinema tickets. Meanwhile, despite difficulties until the early 1990s, the Chinese film market now continues to grow rapidly, both in terms of films produced and audiences’ desire to view films at cinemas. Despite initially slow growth of the film industry in China prior to the 1990s, its film box office revenues were expected to exceed $10 billion in 2016, coming close to overtaking the USA which enjoyed box office revenues of $11 billion in 2015, Shoard (2016). It is within this context that the performance of the Indian film industry has to be considered. The Indian and Chinese film industries share some similarities. Both countries have adopted economic liberalisation policies since the later years of the twentieth century, and as a result in both countries, the film industry has attracted greater foreign investment. Meanwhile, liberalisation has led to greater competition for domestic films from large budget, internationally produced films, often originating in Hollywood, with both Indian and Chinese audiences keen to watch these films. This paper seeks to identify the factors that contribute to films’ success in Indian cinemas using an econometric analysis such that film production companies are in a better position to identify strategies to ensure their future success. These strategies relate to film characteristics as well as marketing strategy. Given the importance of the film industry to the Indian economy and the difficulties currently faced by the industry, our analysis is particularly important and timely. We believe this to be the first paper econometrically to estimate the determinants of domestic box office success for the Indian film industry. To do this, an original dataset has been collated and utilised, considering all Bollywood films released in Indian cinemas over the period 2011 to 2015. For each film, released data are collected on the size of production budget; Indian cinema box office revenues; film genre; the use of Bollywood star actors and directors; and the distributor of the film in India. Alternative measures of critical acclaim for each film are also collected. As well as identifying those factors associated with films’ Indian box office success, the results of the statistical analysis are used to develop government policy recommendations. A literature review covering economic analyses of the film industry, both in India and more broadly, is provided in Sect. 2. The data and econometric methodology are described in Sect. 3. Results are reported in Sect. 4, with discussion of these results, policy implications and conclusions provided in Sect. 5.",15

Patreon is the biggest crowdfunding platform that turns the one-off interaction between creator and crowd into a continuous relationship. It facilitates the presentation and communication of past/present/planned content and allows patrons to support creators of all kind (e.g., musicians, visual artists, podcasters, video creators, writers and journalists) with a monthly pledge. The patron can discontinue support at any time. Our study uses data from Patreon in order to analyze crowdfunding for a monthly income, focusing on projects’ success determinants and funding dynamics. The previous research on conventional reward crowdfunding platforms, like Kickstarter or Indiegogo, shows that projects’ communication with funders is a key driver of success. For instance, Mollick (2014), Colombo et al. (2015), Crosetto and Regner (2018) find that Web site measures like videos, images and blog entries are determinants of project success.Footnote 1 This evidence suggests that effort put into communicating the project’s goal pays off as it is rewarded by the crowd. Studies analyzing the dynamics in reward crowdfunding show herding behavior among the crowd, very early in the funding period (van de Rijt et al. 2014; Colombo et al. 2015) but also later (Crosetto and Regner 2018). Our data show that the income distribution at Patreon is very skewed. Hundreds of creators crowdfund a sizable income via Patreon—the top 1% of campaigns make at least $2500 monthly—while the majority of all campaigns attract only negligible amounts. Our analysis results in similar project-level success determinants as the existing research: Indicators of communication quality, like an image upload, the length of texts that describe the campaign, its creator or their goals, or a thank you video, are correlated with funding success. Funding dynamics are heterogeneous across campaigns. Some attract pledge boosts—in the beginning as well as later in their life—and others increase their pledge level at a slow and steady rate. Pledge deletions commonly occur only occasionally, but some campaigns experience substantial drops of crowd support. Our study extends the analysis of reward crowdfunding (see Butticè et al. 2018, for a recent review) to a new, membership-based platform type, crowdfunding for a monthly income. We show that previous insights about the importance of communication quality for reward crowdfunding success and about funding dynamics also apply in this new context. These results are a stepping stone for a better understanding of a way of funding that can provide a monthly stream of income to creators. This is a relevant issue, because for creators without an established reputation generating revenues from their work is a serious challenge. Crowdfunding may offer an alternative to the standard approach of the Internet era. In the advertising-based business model, the creative class makes their content freely available on platforms like YouTube in return for a share of the revenue from advertisements shown in connection to their content. Online advertising comes with a series of question marks (ad blocking software, privacy regulations, biased content), though, see Peukert (2019) for an overview. Instead, crowdfunding gives creators an opportunity to receive transparent financial support directly from the people enjoying their content—if they convince the crowd of their potential and if they deliver on their promises.",28

Abraham Ravid,Olav Sorenson,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The film industry rarely involves film anymore. The cameras and microphones use sensors. They translate the images and sounds into bits and bytes. Directors and editors manipulate the raw footage on computers, rather than with light boxes and scissors. Finished “films” get distributed as large files rather than as giant spools. Analog has given way to digital. Although the film industry has witnessed many technological changes—the introduction of sound, of color, the invention of television—digitalization, more than any of these others, has unleashed a radical transformation of the industry. It has changed not just the nature of production, but also the businesses of distribution and of exhibition. It has challenged decades-long industry rules and routines. COVID-19, if anything, has accelerated this transformation. When the pandemic kept people home, streaming services came to the rescue, providing audiences with filmed entertainment on their televisions, computers, tablets, and other digital devices. Since the advent of digitalization in the late 1990s, some of the more radical reconfigurations of the industry had been delayed by those with entrenched interests in the old system. But the pandemic has swept their objections aside. Major players have repositioned themselves, re-envisioning their business models. After nearly a century of reaching audiences through middlemen, Disney became the first studio to offer their content direct to the consumer. As of December 2020, only one Hollywood studio (Sony) has yet to launch its own streaming service. Hollywood studios and their parent conglomerates have even begun to premiere their movies on streaming platforms. Universal/Comcast’s “Trolls World Tour” first played in video-on-demand. It made almost $100 million in pay-per-view, with the lion’s share going straight to the studio (Whitten 2020). Warner/AT&T announced that their entire slate of blockbuster productions in 2021 would open on the firm’s streaming service, HBO Max, on the same dates that they began to play in theaters. Studios and theaters are not the only players affected by digitalization. The traditional model for television—often referred to as “linear” television—where a single uniform signal goes out to all viewers, mixing content with advertisements, has also been in decline. Digital distribution has made it easier and cheaper to offer the content each viewer wants, when they want it. Streaming services, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, offer all-you-can-view buffets of video content, all with little or no advertising. Digitalization has also been disruptive to academic research on the film industry. Decades of insight into the factors behind the success and failure of filmed entertainment had been garnered from studying the old model, one that had been dominant for more than half a century.Footnote 1 But as that model evolves, many of the patterns that had been found no longer hold. Film has become a dichotomous business, of tentpoles and niche titles. Anything in-between hardly exists anymore. People consume more video entertainment than ever, but they do so in different ways. The strategic landscape has shifted, forcing changes across all segments of the industry’s value chain. But exactly how all of these changes have rewritten, or will rewrite, the “recipes” for success in film has been an open question. We therefore asked a group of experts on the industry, the “Mallen Group”—economists, finance, marketing, and strategy scholars—to think deeply about how digitalization would alter the various stages of the value chain in film. Which of the past patterns can we expect to persist? Which have become obsolete? We organized the groups to cut across disciplines and to include both academics and practitioners, to ensure that each group had a broad base of expertise and grounding in the phenomenon it was studying. This special issue of the Journal of Cultural Economics reports their answers. It includes five articles, each addressing the challenges that digitalization brings for filmed entertainment in a different segment of the industry: for film producers, for integrated film studios and conglomerates, for theatrical exhibitors, for television broadcasters, and for digital streaming services and platforms. In this introduction, we begin by providing some historical background on the “Mallen Group” and its founder, Bruce Mallen. We then highlight some of the key ideas raised in these five papers. Finally, we broaden the perspective and speculate as to what the future may hold beyond what the contributing authors propose, both in terms of the continuing evolution of the industry and in terms of an emerging research agenda for this new digital era.",10

Hadida,Joseph Lampel,Amit Joshi,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"For almost 100 years, the Hollywood studios ruled the global film industry. They did not always produce the most critically acclaimed films, nor did they dominate in every country. Even so, their market power and box-office returns were unassailable. Lately however, new online content providers have been challenging the continuing power of the five major Hollywood studios still in operation—that is, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and (after their merger took effect on 20 March 2019) Walt Disney Studios—21st Century Fox. Prominent streaming services Netflix and Amazon Studios both engage in multi-billion-dollar investments in content production and appropriate most of the value derived from the shift in global consumer spending from theatrical (from 36.4 billion USD in 2014 to 41.1 billion USD in 2018) to home entertainment (from 15.8 billion USD in 2014 to 42.6 billion USD in 2018: MPAA 2019). Such systemic changes have led to the contention that “Hollywood is in the midst of a full-blown identity crisis”.Footnote 1 The identity crisis facing Hollywood is not simply one of an alternative technology eroding its dominance, as was the case in the 1950s when television broadcasting emerged. Rather, a new set of players, online streaming services, are overtly challenging how Hollywood does business. In this article, we contend that to understand this challenge, it is important to contrast the organizing practices (that is, routines and procedures) of the studios with those of the online streaming services. We argue that these organizing practices and the decision-making criteria they give rise to are manifestations of “institutional logics”, defined as: “the formal and informal rules of action, interaction, and interpretation that guide and constrain decision makers in accomplishing the organization’s tasks” (Thornton and Ocasio 1999: 804). Online streaming services pose a challenge to the institutional logic that governs the studios’ decision-making processes. These digital players offer, in contrast to the studios, subscription packages (e.g. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Apple TV+) and single film deals (e.g. Amazon Video, Apple iTunes).Footnote 2 They follow a different institutional logic and consequently use a different set of organizing practices and decision criteria when developing film projects and making distribution decisions. The core question we seek to address is the following: How will the competition between the two institutional logics, one well established and the other new, develop? The article is structured as follows. The next section introduces the institutional logics theoretical framework. We then proceed to define the two alternative logics that are currently shaping the production and distribution of films. The first, which we label “commitment logic”, is the traditional “theatrical release” (that is, the screening of a movie in a cinema) logic of the five Hollywood major studios. The second, which we call “convenience logic”, is manifest in the digital libraries and subscription models implemented by newer entrants such as Netflix, Amazon Studios, and Apple TV+. After comparing how the five studios and their digital rivals implement both institutional logics, we turn our attention to the development of alternative scenarios: in particular, scenarios in which the two logics are complementary, and others where they compete with, or become substitutes for, one another. We argue that complementary logics scenarios would reduce the threat to the studios, who would then be able to continue to use digital players as outlets to stream their films after their initial cinema release, and to partner with them to produce and release content both in cinemas and online. Alternatively, competing logics scenarios increase the likelihood of one logic dominating the other. Domination by the commitment logic would result in traditional studios acquiring or developing online streaming services. We already see evidence of such actions, with the launch of Disney+ in November 2019 and of WarnerMedia’s and NBCUniversal’s bespoke streaming services in 2020. Alternatively, domination by the convenience logic would lead to upstream vertical integration of digital players into traditional studios, as they increasingly seek to expand their portfolios of intellectual property assets and content and to control production facilities. Such integration has also started, with Netflix’s October 2018 acquisition of Albuquerque production studio ABQFootnote 3 and deal to set up a permanent UK production hub at Shepperton Studios from October 2019.Footnote 4 Last, a scenario of logics substitution could lead to the obsolescence of the two existing logics and the emergence of a new one. We discuss four scenarios articulating these alternatives and offer recommendations to the studios and streaming services. We close the article with our main conclusions and suggestions for further research.",25

This technological development has culminated in a vast array of digital video subscription platforms (DSPs) such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu absorbing a majority stake in movie consumption (Deloitte 2018; PwC 2019). In 2018, Netflix (2019) alone generated $15.79 billion in worldwide revenues, with the USA and Canada contributing $8.28 billion. In the USA alone, 55% of homes spent more than $2 billion a month on streaming entertainment for the more than 200 video-on-demand services available (Wang 2018). We take as our focus DSPs in which consumers pay a specific fee to access a pool of audiovisual content. This DSP market has witnessed substantial growth in the last decade, with its major players—Netflix and Amazon Prime—not only dominating the online video-on-demand landscape (Statista 2019) but also affecting other parts of audiovisual entertainment. According to Hennig-Thurau et al. (2019), German consumers spend more time with Netflix than with any single TV station, and even Hollywood studios such as Disney, Warner/AT&T, and Universal have entered the streaming business. By 2023, streaming revenues are expected to represent roughly 75% of the revenues of the sequential audiovisual content cash flow chain, with a predicted market volume of $37.3 bn (Statista 2019). DSPs must provide content that inspires new customers to join, retains existing customers vital to the platform, and prevents users from switching to competitors or churning the service. However, determining content that satisfies these requirements and thus generates value for the DSP is challenging. Most platforms currently rely on rather simplistic approaches (Dastin 2018), such as monitoring the intensity per cost of newly acquired customers to calculate acquisition content value. However, they ignore indirect and difficult-to-observe effects that have been shown in non-entertainment industries to lead to income losses of more than 20% due to misallocation of marketing budgets and erroneous portfolio decisions (De Haan et al. 2016; Kannan et al. 2016). Content valuation becomes even more challenging given consumers’ transition from passive consumption (e.g., of TV broadcasting) to active, individualized, and diversified behavior (Hennig-Thurau et al. 2019; PwC 2019). The substantial growth of the market has attracted more competitors that try to conquer market share with the help of aggressive pricing and bundling (e.g., Disney + with Hulu, ESPN +) or third-party content integration (e.g., Amazon channels) (Sherman 2019a). In this increasingly competitive environment, platforms try to secure or protect market share by investing in content, as underscored by intensely discussed investments such as the US$100 m exclusive one-year acquisition of the TV show Friends by Netflix (Lee 2018) or the US$250 m Lord of the Rings deal of Amazon (Sherman 2019b). Such fundamental initial investments in a market with fluctuating consumer preferences for a holistic product pose substantive corporate risk—as experienced by managers enduring multiple box office bombs every year (Clark 2019). Given the high risks involved and the high investments necessary, being able to value content and its impact on platform revenues becomes even more essential. However, the question of how to determine the value of content is, at best, under-developed. So far, the economic literature on bundling has shown that digital home entertainment distribution is especially suited for bundling (Geng et al. 2005; Stigler 1963). The marketing literature provides different general return-on-investment (ROI) valuation frameworks (Rust et al. 2004) for products and services. In addition, research has expended substantial effort to understand the success factors of movies and TV shows at the box office and in home video distribution (e.g., Danaher et al. 2010; Eliashberg et al. 2006; Ravid 1999). However, no research has accounted for the particularities (i.e., relying on flat rates rather than valuating single content pieces or the dynamic interaction of revenues from subscriptions, advertising, and cross-sales over time) of the DSP market. Therefore, in this article, we develop a conceptual framework that enables all parties involved in the production, marketing, distribution, and sales of content to determine the incremental value contribution of a content piece and its value drivers. Our model should therefore be helpful for producers, distributors, and platform managers to properly assess the value of content for a DSP and thus enable all parties to fairly negotiate content transactions. Furthermore, our model can benefit future entertainment and cultural economics scholars who aim to model the film and media industry and its transaction processes. Overall, we are interested in two key questions: (1) How can the value of a content piece for a DSP be determined while accounting for direct and indirect cash flow contributions? and (2) How do content and platform contingencies moderate the relationship between content and value for a DSP? In addressing these questions, we provide three contributions to the literature. First, we develop a framework for content valuation and relate content to the decision funnels of non-customers and acquired customers. This involves including an extensive set of possible performance indicators. For each factor, we recommend measures that can be applied to determine content value. Second, we investigate how specific content and platform contingencies influence the particular stages of the customer journey. Our conceptual framework is flexible with regard to a broad range of factors occurring at each stage. We explicitly discuss these factors, which are new and of substantial relevance. Third, we describe an extensive set of content and platform contingencies, derived from current industry practice, potential future industry trends, and related academic literature. Based on theoretical considerations, we postulate the impact of these contingencies and provide measures to capture them.",19

In the latter, government and private enterprise invest in strengthening these relationships through programs that primarily emphasize arts workers’ entrepreneurial behavior, and their innovative contributions to both artistic and non-artistic sectors. For example, policies aimed at stimulating production in the cultural and creative industries focus on supporting entrepreneurial workers in this sector. An array of local government agencies and private corporations now run artist-in-residence programs where the goal of the programs is to inject entrepreneurial thinking into decision-making (Antal, 2009; Antal & Strauß, 2013; Sherrod-Hale &Woronkowicz, 2020; Woronkowicz & Schert, 2020). The concept of “embeddedness”—where artists are recognized for their work contributions to non-artistic sectors—has taken hold globally, with national governments demonstrating the prevalence of artists in non-artistic sectors (Australia Council for the Arts, 2017) and scholars following suit (Goldsmith & Bridgstock, 2015; Markusen, 2020). These programs in both government and private enterprise largely rest on the assumption that artists and artistic work have entrepreneurial qualities that result in positive externalities, such as knowledge spillover (Audretsch & Keilbach, 2007). Program implementation, however, rarely integrates research that would buttress these assumptions, or theories of value creation in the cultural and creative industries, which can support practice. There is now a growing literature that encompasses how entrepreneurial activity in the cultural and creative industries translates to economic value (Chang et al., 2021; Ellmeier, 2003; Throsby, 2008). These theories rest on the assumption that there is a market for symbolic meaning tied to cultural and creative products that is unique to production in other sectors. While the process for creating meaning in the cultural and creative industries is becoming more clear through scholarship, the behavior of individuals and firms who engage in entrepreneurial activities is still rather fuzzy. This lack of clarity presents challenges for policymakers to apply theory on value creation in the CCI to practice. Therefore, the goal of this special issue was to highlight research that uncovers the activities of specific actors who are part of the entrepreneurial process in the cultural and creative industries, and the new forms they create. This special issue is the third such issue out of the Arts, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation (AEI) LabFootnote 1 that exclusively focuses on research that empirically investigates crossovers between arts, entrepreneurship and innovation—this one specifically by using the lens of cultural economics. In selecting the articles for this issue, it was my intention to choose ones that not only had clear implications for policy and practice, but that also contributed to theories of value creation in the cultural and creative industries. The result is a selection of seven articles that address relationships between arts, entrepreneurship and innovation for workers, firms, and industry that start to bring clarity to how value is created in the arts.",6

Yet recent trends in the arts workforce toward freelancing (Woronkowicz and Noonan 2019) make economies of scope particularly timely as a strategy in the creative industries (Caves 2000). This paper analyzes applications of economies of scope to artist-led incubators and co-working spaces. These spaces exist in a wide variety of forms (Essig 2014) but are generally scale-limited in order to protect their sense of community. Because, as Essig finds, these incubators show a wide variety of funding and governance models, this paper’s contribution is to assist managers, increase capacity and best use of funds, and inform the academic literature on incubators, co-working spaces, and by extension creative industries. As this paper argues, without economies of scale, these incubators and co-working spaces can benefit strongly from economies of scope in both the economic sense of joint production (Chandler 1994) and the financial sense of risk pooling (Markowitz 1952). This paper proposes a conceptual framework for cooperative strategies that employ economies of scope. The framework is developed through case studies of two US organizations—ArtBuilt and REC (Resources for Every Creator). ArtBuilt is an artists’ studio space in the Brooklyn Army Terminal, New York. REC is a co-working space whose current location is in the Fashion District mall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This paper argues that these venues can benefit from franchise and cooperative organizational structures both operationally and financially. These strategies achieve via scope and risk pooling what cannot in the arts be achieved via scale. These strategies offer a timely contribution given the continued precarity of artistic labor and the increase in the number of artists who are freelancing. With regard to precarity, relatively recent studies by both Creative Independent (2018) and Arts Council England (2018) show low levels of earnings and high uncertainty around sustainable support for artistic practice. Artists also are freelancers or self-employed at much higher rates than for other occupations, at approximately 35% of artists as compared to 15% of other professions (Woronkowicz and Noonan 2019, at 657). Although not well studied in the academic literature in the arts, economies of scope and risk pooling in the arts can be placed within organizational architectures of franchise and federation. The Tate in London has a federation structure, analogous to the states that comprise the USA, whereas the Guggenheim had a franchise structure. After the opening of the Guggenheim Bilbao in 1997, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation was approached to create the “Bilbao Effect” in other locations and accepted the offer to brand what were effectively franchise locations worldwide (Whitaker 2021). In contrast, after the opening of the Tate Modern in 2000, Tate was approached to create that effect in other areas of the UK. Instead of creating many Tate Moderns, the organization instead started a federation of the existing local arts organizations and shared resources across a network, occasionally lending reputational endorsement from Tate’s central leadership visiting local events around the UK. The ensuing program, called Plus Tate (Collier and Serota 2015), continued this initiative as a membership body, reinforcing its federation approach. A key differentiation between franchise and federation as governance models is the centralization of decision rights, which are dispersed substantially more in a federated structure. Other organizations have taken this knowledge-sharing or, more broadly, resource-sharing approach across a network of organizations. Springboard for the Arts, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA, has focused on replicating programs in communities, sharing resources out to a network of other organizations in such a way that those other organizations can customize them for their own purposes (author interview, Laura Zabel, Springboard for the Arts, December 7, 2020). This focus on resource-sharing combines some aspects of scale with scope and builds infrastructure to share templates that can then be customized. Gener8tor, a Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based accelerator with a dedicated arts program, has built a distributed model of replicable structures rolled out across other cities (author interview, Maureen Ragalie, Gener8tor, November 20, 2020). (See Fig. 1 for a diagrammatic overview of franchise, federation, and resource-sharing networks.) Diagram of franchise, federation, and resource-sharing network These models exemplify different governance structures of franchise in the case of the Guggenheim, of federation in the case of Tate Plus, and of resource-sharing for mass customization in the case of Springboard for the Arts and Gener8tor. These approaches form the basis of the case study analysis of ArtBuilt and REC as projects that consider cooperative and collaborative models that invoke economies of scope in the arts. The method of analysis draws on author interviews with the leaders of these organizations and application of theories described in this literature review section.Footnote 1 Because these strategies are relatively new, this paper approaches managerial strategy as an emergent discipline using methods of strategic foresight (MacKay and Costanzo 2009) and case study analysis as both “linear” and “iterative” as a process (Yin 2009). Section 1 provides a literature review of relevant theories in finance and economics, followed by an overview of methodology. Section 2 provides in-depth descriptions of the cases in application to issues of scope and risk. Section 3 offers analysis of the implications. Section 4 concludes by laying out a structure for future empirical investigation.",4

Reinventing business, constantly questioning the traditional approach, responding to new trends and developing and pursuing long-term strategies are the prerequisites for sustainable corporate success. Combining the principles of evolution and entrepreneurial research, various analogies can be found (Nielsen and Lassen 2012), highlighting the application of an entrepreneurial mindset as a viable approach for existing businesses. Thus, not only new market actors and their entrepreneurial activities, but also existing companies are subject to continuous development in order not to be made obsolete by economic evolution. Very few industries are static, but the music industry is particularly creatively challenged because it has clung to established but anachronistic models for too long (Wilde and Schwerzmann 2004). So what are the new needs and challenges that the players in the industry are confronted with, which make them continuously become entrepreneurs within their industry? The paper at hand aims to answer this question from the perspective of music publishers focusing their interaction with copyright collecting societies (CCS) and sub-publishers in the context of the international exploitation of music copyrights. In contrast to the past, the business model of music publishers today is more extensive and complex, involving the management, promotion and licensing of the use of copyrights of their represented writers. Due to the complexity and volume, the licensing of these rights is not feasible for a single economic entity. Therefore, this task is solved cooperatively: publishers become members of copyright collecting societies, authorizing them to handle the licensing of various types of copyright use on their behalf. If licensing takes place outside the area of operation of the (usually domestic) CCS, royalties are paid via intermediaries such as foreign collecting societies or sub-publishers. Consequences are payment delays, non-transparency and higher transaction costs. Due to increasing technology-driven internationalization, this has also a major impact on smaller publishers, as they generate increasing amounts of royalties in foreign markets. However, there is growing awareness among music publishers regarding a relevant market change: Legal harmonization and technological developments have facilitated the option of direct memberships of publishers in multiple, international CCS. Due to these trends and challenges, also existing music publishing companies need to evolve constantly by applying entrepreneurial principles. Transferring these principles to the current situation of music publishers in general and the opportunity of direct membership in particular illustrates the analogies. The first aspect is the correct interpretation of market-changes (Kirzner 1973). Applied to the music industry this covers the recognition of an increasing competition for music publishers driven by self-marketing platforms and technology-driven publishing administrators. Second, entrepreneurs need to perceive opportunities to improve the current state (Stevenson et al. 1999). In terms of the music business, publishers, for example, need to identify ways to increase payment speed, reduce transaction costs and transparency which is enabled by direct CCS membership. Third, entrepreneurs must implement proactive decision making and risk taking (Miller 1983). Since applying for direct CCS membership in foreign countries is still in its infancy, music publishers are often faced with technical and organizational challenges and risks. Finally, it can be argued that direct membership of music publishers in foreign CCS is consistent with the emerging consensus that internationalization is an entrepreneurial activity (O’Cass and Weerawardena 2009). In this paper, we observe this market change and contribute to this topic from multiple perspectives by gathering needs, challenges, opportunities and highlighting solutions for music publishers in the implementation of direct memberships in foreign CCS. The first sections cover a short summary of the mechanics of the music business (Sect. 2) and a detailed explanation of direct memberships as an entrepreneurial opportunity (Sect. 3). In Sect. 4, we give details about the methodology used to gather information about the state of the art of copyright exploitation. Based on these findings, Sects. 5, 6 and 7 present needs, challenges and opportunities from the publishers’ perspective. Major outcomes are clearly depicted requirements of the publishers and an aggregated view on the interaction with CCS by deriving harmonized process and data models. Based on these models, software tools supporting a seamless integration of different international CCS can be developed. Corresponding prototypes are introduced in Sect. 8. The economic potential of direct membership is assessed in Sect. 9, whereas a more prospective view including future research steps and necessary development tasks is presented in Sect. 10.",2
45.0,4.0,Journal of Cultural Economics,01 May 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10824-021-09418-3,Do museums foster innovation through engagement with the cultural and creative industries?,December 2021,Chiara Dalle Nogare,Monika Murzyn-Kupisz,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The role of innovation in fostering economic growth is well established in macroeconomics (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2003; Romer 1996), and recent contributions highlight that creative professions may play a role in making a nation or a region more innovative (Cerisola 2019; Rodriguez-Pose and Lee 2020). This is different from saying that the creative sector (the cultural and creative industries, CCIs hereafter) plays a special role in the innovation ecosystem, yet policymakers often translate scholarly evidence into agendas focusing on (variously defined) CCIs (Sternberg 2017). However, while support for CCIs by governments makes sense in many respects (positive effects on well-being and on the attractiveness of local contexts for individuals and firms), it is not to be taken for granted that this is an effective innovation policy. In fact, there is still a lack of robust evidence on both the relative innovativeness of CCIs compared to other industries and the extent to which CCIs foster innovation in the wider economy. Museums are included in most recent definitions of CCIs (see Sect. 2), and so policy documents have begun including them in agendas for innovation, highlighting the need for them to closely interact with other CCIs. The very presence of interactions is considered as evidence of their being part of the cultural and creative sector, as well as a positive element in terms of the enhancement of the overall impact of CCIs on innovativeness. This has put pressure on museum directors. Traditionally, contributing to innovation has not been part of museums’ goals. Their core missions have long been collection, conservation, research, exhibition, and education.Footnote 1 In this article, we aim to highlight that museums do produce positive externalities for the local and regional economy in terms of a higher level of innovativeness, but probably not primarily through their relations with the CCIs. The claim that museums foster innovation by making the CCIs more creative rests upon the assumption that the links between museums and the CCIs generate strong knowledge spillovers that benefit the latter. In fact, this is how infra-industry relations can spread innovation (Bakhshi and McVittie 2009). A direct way to assess whether this condition is met is to estimate a model where some measure of innovation for the CCI is the dependent variable and the presence of a CCI–museum relation is a covariate. To our knowledge, however, there have been no surveys investigating the innovative products and processes of CCIs in the context of their cooperation with museums. We therefore use an indirect way of verifying whether there are strong knowledge spillovers from museums to CCIs, through the analysis of a unique dataset collected from 261 Polish museums regarding their activities and relations with CCI firms and institutions in the 2017–2018 reporting period. We first elaborate a taxonomy of museum–CCI cooperation modes, distinguishing between those potentially rich and those likely to be poor in knowledge spillovers. For example, designers who access and get direct inspiration from a museum’s collection may be considered an instance of a rich relation (which we define as a strong link). Space rentals are an example of a much poorer relation in terms of the likelihood of knowledge spillovers (weak link). We then apply this taxonomy to the data on Polish museums and conclude that although most museums have relatively frequent exchanges with CCI firms and institutions, weak links greatly outnumber strong ones. This does not conclusively prove, but certainly suggests that the contribution of museums to innovation through their relations with CCIs is not particularly strong in the Polish context. More generally, our evidence points to the fact that networking with CCI firms may be overrated for museums because often only the quantitative—rather than the qualitative—dimension of the relation is considered (quality is understood here as a strong potential in terms of knowledge spillovers). Such findings may have direct policy implications and may also help inform future quantitative and qualitative investigations of museum–CCI relations and their impact on CCI innovativeness. On the other hand, what appears to be an underrated phenomenon is that the traditional core missions of museums may have important consequences in terms of enhancement of innovation in a given national or local context, with positive impacts on economic performance. For instance, the knowledge spillover effects when conservation activities are shared with other institutions (firms, universities) in backward supply linkages are often important. Museums’ contributions to innovation through their education mission may be even more significant. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces to the literature on the definitions of CCIs and the inclusion of museums into these, as well as innovation and innovation spreading mechanisms. Section 3 clarifies how our contribution relates to this literature and outlines the model we refer to. Section 4 lays out the conceptual framework we propose for classifying the relationships between museums and other CCIs. In Sect. 5, we apply this framework to the Polish case and illustrate the core of our evidence. The subsequent section suggests how the education mission of museums (sometimes implemented in cooperation with CCI firms) may impact innovation, while Sect. 7 presents our conclusions.",10

Introduction to the special issue,June 2022,Ellen Loots,Diana Betzler,Boram Lee,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The first quarter of the twenty-first century has challenged the world with epochal changes affecting every aspect of our communities, including the arenas in which the Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI) operate (Borowiecki et al., 2016). These changes continue to accelerate with the ongoing developments and possibilities in digitization and intelligent technologies, and as new players and instruments have become a feature in the CCI. Markets in the CCI are undergoing dynamic change, driven by globalization, technological and societal developments, and a more entrepreneurial-oriented system of public funding. The coronavirus pandemic has further reinforced these developments. Cultural products and services, as well as the demand for artistic/creative content, are being reshaped. New players in the digital economy have entered markets. Cultural taste and consumption have shifted, and cultural production is being redesigned (Betzler & Leuschen, 2021). The rules of the game in the CCI are being reinvented, and evoking changes in the behavior of market participants. This also affects the procurement of resources. Financing and funding in the inefficient markets of the CCI (characterized by suboptimal resource allocation, uncertain demand behavior, and market failure) have traditionally relied on a combination of various public and private resources. Concurrently, existing participants and new entrants to the creative economy face renewed opportunities and new types of risks. For example, low interest rates have attracted investors to innovative companies backed by venture capital funds, incubators (including publicly funded ones), and the services of numerous crowdfunding providers (Block et al., 2018). Novel technologies, including reward-based crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending on platforms (Tosatto et al., 2019), and virtual currencies processed through the blockchain technology (Patrickson, 2021; Peukert, 2019), can be expected to increase the efficiency of entrepreneurial finance by reducing transaction costs and information asymmetries, also in the CCI. Individuals and firms operating in the CCI are known to show reluctance in using “other people’s money” (Sigurdardottir & Candi, 2019, p. 4), while professional funders express distrust of artistic and creative producers (Lee et al., 2018; O’Dair & Owen, 2019), indicating that a new funding paradigm does not emerge per se. The Special Issue focuses on new forms of finance and funding, and their implications for organizations and markets in the CCI. The Issue seeks to address the perennial question of support options for the CCI by bringing together articles that examine and explain various dynamics in CCI financing and funding. The CCI span sectors as diverse as the performing and visual arts, music, film, TV and radio, gaming, design and fashion, publishing and advertising, museums, crafts, literature, and heritage. The Issue comprises an article examining access to finance as experienced by innovative firms in the creative industries, on the basis of primary data collected through a questionnaire issued in the United Kingdom (Di Novo et al., 2022). It includes two articles dealing with crowdfunding: one that conceptually relates the phenomenon of crowdfunding to important themes in cultural economics (Handke & Dalla Chiesa, 2022), and one that examines the determinants of a very specific form of crowdfunding (remote donations via a platform) in the case of street performers, based on secondary data generated by the platform (Elkins & Fry, 2021). Additionally, the Issue comprises two articles that address funding by means of cryptocurrency, highlighting the functionalities of initial coin offerings (Knott et al., 2022) and NFTs and contracts (van Haaften-Schick & Whitaker, 2022). This introduction provides a brief outline of recent developments in public, private, and hybrid funding in the CCI, before overviewing the articles. It discusses how the articles take up a role in foregrounding a new funding paradigm that encompasses collaborative mechanisms such as crowdfunding, incubator and accelerator funding, online public feeder investment markets, and social funding, as well as the technologies that enable new forms of funding.",3

To make a living, they need to balance art and innovation with entrepreneurship (Eikhof & Haunschild, 2006; Elkins & Fry, 2021; Parker, 2013; Regner, 2021). On the one hand, they need to be creative developers who create new and innovative content (Caves, 2000; Rosselló & Wright, 2010). On the other hand, artists also need to act in profit-oriented ways and take on entrepreneurial liability (Eikhof & Haunschild, 2006; Ellmeier, 2003; Leadbeater & Oakley, 1999; Regner, 2021). Coupling these two facets is vital for artists to ensure the funding of their work and projects (Bridgstock, 2011; Dex et al., 2000). However, artists encounter difficulties using traditional funding channels, such as banks or venture capitalists, to finance their projects (Konrad, 2015, 2018; Mendes-da-silva et al., 2016). They find it difficult to raise funding due to the high risk associated with their work (Fraser & Lomax, 2011; Li et al., 2019; Maman & Rosenhek, 2020). Because the value of artistic work lies in intellectual property, artists own hardly any substantial business assets or securities (Caves, 2000; Mendes-da-silva et al., 2016). At the same time, the problematic predictability of demand for intellectual property leads to information asymmetries between artists and investors (Fraser & Lomax, 2011; Higson et al., 2007; Vismara, 2018). Consequently, artistic projects are high-risk investments with minimal collaterals, and the artists struggle to obtain funding through traditional financing channels (Dalla Chiesa, 2021; Higson et al., 2007; Regner, 2021; Tosatto et al., 2019). Nevertheless, an emerging form of reward-based crowdfunding, the so-called Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), now rises as a promising new funding alternative for artists. ICOs can be defined as “open calls for funding promoted by organizations, companies, and entrepreneurs to raise money through cryptocurrencies, in exchange for a ‘token’ that can be sold on the Internet or used in the future to obtain products or services and, at times, profits” (Adhami et al., 2018, p. 64). ICOs enable reward-based mass financing similar to classical crowdfunding campaigns particularly used for small to medium-scale projects. However, in contrast to classical crowdfunding, such as Kickstarter, ICOs are less regulated and can be used regardless of country-specific constraints or legal frameworks (Adhami et al., 2018; O’Dair & Owen, 2019). While classical crowdfunding is typically limited to sending and receiving money within a single country, ICOs can be used beyond country barriers (O’Dair & Owen, 2019). Further, classical crowdfunding campaigns provide investors with money in exchange for future participative use of the final product, envisaged discounts, or limited merchandise (Dalla Chiesa, 2021; Ekins & Fry, 2021; Regner, 2021). In contrast, ICOs provide investors with tokens that can be traded like shares (Essaghoolian, 2019). Accessing ICOs as financing sources can also benefit small-scale projects, thereby enhancing artists’ independence, focusing on individual creativity, benefiting the long tail of cultural production, and ensuring content diversity (McGrath et al., 2017; Peukert, 2019). Consequently, ICOs offer artists a promising alternative for project funding (Beck et al., 2016; Sadhya et al., 2018). The advantages of ICOs have led to widespread adoption of this form of financing in various sectors and industries. Within the first ten months of 2019, the distribution of tokens raised more than USD 4.1 billion in a total of 380 ICOs (PwC, 2019). The high investment volume emphasizes investors’ increasing interest in ICOs. However, only 5.5% of all successful ICOs in 2019 were related to artistic projects’ funding, and then all these projects were related to the media and entertainment sector (PwC, 2019). Considering the compelling advantages of funding art projects and the generally high investment volume in ICOs, it seems surprising that artists have not adopted this form of financing much more widely. This manuscript aims to uncover which barriers deter artists from financing their projects through ICOs. Our research question reads as follows: Which barriers do artists perceive to funding projects using ICOs? Based on 35 qualitative interviews with artists and software developers working in the creative and cultural industries (CCI), we identify eight external barriers that hinder the use of ICOs and investigate the influence governments, investors, consumers, and intermediaries have on these barriers. In doing so, we highlight the dyadic barriers and relationships between stakeholders and artists and uncover their indirect connections (Rowley, 1997). Our findings provide a holistic picture of the barriers that hinder artists’ adoption of ICOs. Our research makes several significant contributions to the literature. First, our research contributes to the literature on cultural finance and funding (Angelini & Castellani, 2019; Li et al., 2019; McGrath et al., 2017; Schweizer, 2018). By focusing on artist-specific barriers (O’Dair & Owen, 2019), we extend previous findings on the challenges ICOs encounter, e.g., the emergence of speculative investment bubbles, weak legal and regulatory control, and an insufficient number of fractional ownerships. We find that artists’ complex and fragmented legal situation leads to a high effort and error risk in preparation for ICOs. Further, our findings illustrate that investors frequently reallocate artistic products and services into more lucrative industries. Second, we contribute to the literature on stakeholder resistance by uncovering lack of consumer interest regarding artists’ support needs. Also, we disclose how influential intermediaries’ resistance hinders artists’ widespread adoption of ICOs. Third, our paper contributes to the growing body of research on ICOs in general by illustrating that, rather than reducing investment risk (Fisch, 2019; Yu et al., 2018), ICOs merely shift the risk. Although ICOs can provide security for investors and reduce information asymmetries (Chen et al., 2017; Cong & He, 2019; Lee, 2019), the lack of regulations can cause considerable price fluctuations due to coin volatility. In turn, price fluctuations can result in extensive financial losses and associated risks for investors and capital seekers. Finally, we answer the recent call for research to examine the usefulness of regulations (Adhami et al., 2018) by clearly advocating in favor of regulatory measures in the debate on whether ICOs should be regulated (O’Dair & Owen, 2019) or not (Amsden & Schweizer, 2018).",3

Access to finance for innovators in the creative industries,June 2022,Salvatore Di Novo,Giorgio Fazio,Josh Siepel,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Do creative industries firms face unique challenges in accessing capital? In other sectors, we do know that being innovative does not guarantee that a business will be able to access appropriate external funds. Despite the many benefits that come from innovative activities, innovative businesses may struggle to access finance (Hall, 1992; Hall & Lerner, 2010; Hall et al., 2016; Mazzucato, 2013; Mina et al., 2013; O’Sullivan, 2006). Some of these issues are due to the nature of any capital investments, such as adverse selection and moral hazard (Fazzari et al., 1987; Hall & Lerner, 2010), which under financial constraints may force firms to seek internal capital (Myers & Majluf, 1984). But other issues are particularly relevant for investments in innovative, and particularly R&D activities. Uncertainty of outcomes, information asymmetry and opaqueness between lenders and borrowers mean that companies seeking to fund R&D may not be able to access appropriate funding (Cowling et al., 2018; Hall & Lerner, 2010). Consequently, some innovative businesses are able to ’signal’ the quality of their technologies to investors as a means of overcoming these barriers (Colombo, 2021; Ebbers & Wijnberg, 2012; Engel & Keilbach, 2007; Francis et al., 2012). Yet while the existing literature has explored these financial constraints in some detail, implicit in this assumption is that the R&D funding being sought is for capital investment. Intriguingly, the implications of innovation in more service and content-based settings, as it is typically the case for the creative industries, have not been explored in as much depth. This paper, therefore, explores the extent to which creative industries firms that engage in innovative activities apply for and are able to access finance when they seek it. The creative industries, which according to the definition we use (DCMS, 2017) includes cultural businesses such as arts organisations, museums and publishing, content developers for TV, film and video games as well as creative services businesses such as advertising, marketing and architecture (see Cunningham & Higgs, 2008 for history of definitions), are different in several respects from other sectors that have been studied in this context. While creative industries businesses engage in innovation activities (Bird et al., 2020), the nature of these innovation activities is not necessarily consistent with those in conventional “high-tech” sectors. Innovation in creative industries is often reliant on changes to symbolic value (Townley & Gulledge, 2015) rather than functionality, what has been called “soft innovation” (Stoneman, 2010), which relies on aesthetics and subjective preferences rather than pure technological advances. Creative industries firms’ innovative activities may not be captured by traditional definitions of R&D (Bakhshi et al., 2013; Bakhshi & Lomas, 2017), as they may rely more on design and service-oriented development rather than “traditional” and “lab-based” research. Moreover, it is well-known that the creative industries are characterised by a large number of nano, micro, small and medium-sized businesses and few large firms (Piergiovanni et al., 2012). Therefore, while on one side firms in the creative industries may be, on average, more able to innovate because of lower fixed costs to innovation (compared, for instance, to biotechnology companies), they may also lack features, such as the tangibility of their assets, the patentability of innovative outputs, or the size and scalability of operations, that could provide a signal of quality to lenders and investors.Footnote 1 An extensive literature has investigated the barriers to accessing finance and those to innovation in general. However, there is relatively limited literature exploring whether innovators are successful when they seek external finance (see for instance Cowling et al., 2018; Gregori et al., 2022; Santos & Cincera, 2021). Even less is known about this issue with regard to creative industries businesses, given the specificities of these sectors . The main research question of this paper, therefore, asks specifically for the creative industries firms, whether having innovated acts as a (negative or positive) signal to lenders, investors and funders, i.e., is innovation an enabler or a barrier to the creative industries firms’ ability to access finance? Specifically, we address the above question using a representative survey of UK creative industries businesses and exploring whether, after seeking different forms of finance (i.e., informal, bank/debt, public and venture capital sources), creative companies that report having innovated are more likely to obtain that type of finance compared to those that have not innovated. This is achieved by estimating two-equations models (à-la-Heckman) for the probability of obtaining funding, conditional on firms applying for that specific funding source in the first place. The first equation allows inference on what determines the choice of firms to apply for a specific form of finance (the firm perspective) and the second reports on the factors which have resulted in a successful application (the funder perspective). In anticipation of some of the key results, we find that creative innovators are not more likely to apply for mainstream debt-based finance and, when they do, they are either less or equally likely to be successful than the non-innovators. Secondly, they are more likely to apply for venture capital, but they are not more likely to receive this type of funding than non-innovators. There is no evidence that public funding sources take prior innovation as a signal when addressing this shortage of funds. Instead, innovative creative industries businesses are more likely to rely on internal and informal capital. These results are confirmed as we consider ‘combined’ innovators who have realised both product and business improvements. The paper, then, makes two main contributions to the existing empirical literature in the area, First, it provides novel evidence that suggests prior innovation behaviour does not provide a meaningful signal, positive or negative, to funders for businesses in the creative industries. Second, it highlights the role of informal and personal capital as a source of funding for innovative (and non-innovative) businesses in the creative industries. In this way, it highlights issues of social and personal wealth that have recently been identified as determining participation in creative sectors (Brook et al., 2020; O’Brien et al., 2016). Like Aesop’s fabled ’golden goose’, which met a messy end, these results raise the question as to whether the creative industries’ shiny outputs are endangered because of a misunderstanding of how they work and what they need to thrive. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the literature. Sections 3 and 4 describe the data and empirical strategy employed to answer the above questions. Sections 5 and 6 present the results and discuss the main conclusions from the paper.",1

I began to listen with my eyes, and there is no way that your eyes don’t affect your judgment. The only true way to listen is with your ears and your heart.” –Julie Landsman in Gladwell, Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking Auditions are common practice in the performing arts to hire the best candidate. The evaluator, who makes the hiring decision, chooses upfront between two audition forms. If informed, the evaluator requires applicants to submit information prior to the audition. This often takes the form of a CV which contains valuable information about ability. One proxy for ability is the school an applicant went to, such as Juilliard, which leads the evaluator’s belief about her ability to increase. A CV, however, also contains irrelevant information about gender or race.Footnote 1 This may result in first impression biases which discount more relevant information obtained at a later stage (Thorngate et al. 2010). If blind, the evaluator receives no information and, because the evaluator cannot see the applicant during her performance, the hiring decision is based purely on sound. Given the audition form, the applicant decides whether to participate and how much effort to invest in preparing a performance. Importantly, this sequential decision-making of the potentially biased evaluator and the applicant allows the audition form to affect effort incentives. In this paper, I analyse the repercussions of the evaluator’s bias against a specific group of applicants. I examine whether, and under which conditions, it can be rational for the evaluator to commit to ignore supplementary information about an applicant to avoid misleading first impressions. I ask whether the move to a blind audition can lead to better candidates being hired; in essence, can a blind audition provide better effort incentives exclusively for highly able applicants? My main contribution lies in providing a theory for Goldin and Rouse’s (2000) finding that the use of blind auditions in US orchestras has lead to a severalfold increase in the probability that a female will be hired. Furthermore, I address the two polarised views on the use of blind auditions to hire the best candidate. Proponents argue that blind auditions have helped evaluators avoid misleading first impressions (Gladwell 2005).Footnote 2 In fact, blind auditions have often been marketed as a fairer form of audition and equal opportunity policy (Karl Schiebler in The Economist 1996).Footnote 3 Opponents fear that, while avoiding bias, the evaluator loses valuable information that can screen applicants by ability (Blasko in Makoff-Clark 2019). Consequently, top talent may be lost in an increasingly large applicant pool and standards of fairness may even deteriorate (Holland 1981). My second contribution is to show that the two polarised views are not mutually exclusive. I argue that a blind audition comes with a fundamental trade-off: it grants impartiality to the evaluator but may prohibit the screening of applicants by ability. I develop a game-theoretic framework in which the evaluator is biased against females and his bias is common knowledge. The evaluator commits to a blind or an informed audition given an exogenously determined wage. He always fills the position with an applicant or a random outside option. His revenue is determined by performance quality and ability, whereas the applicant cares only about being hired. In the benchmark model, effort maps one-to-one into performance quality. In an extension, I allow for moral hazard by considering a setting where low effort can result in low or high performance quality. I focus on a gender bias and frequently use the context of an orchestra to build intuition. This focus also emphasises that artistic auditions are a key application as the underrepresentation of women in virtually all the arts provides evidence for some degree of discrimination (Hellmanzik 2020).Footnote 4 However, my framework pertains to a broader range of contexts in which the evaluator requires the applicant to prepare a project for review and possibly submit additional information susceptible to bias, before deciding upon acceptance. In particular, technology companies like ‘GapJumpers’ (Cain Miller 2016) or ‘Applied’ (Glazebrook 2019) allow firms to implement blind hiring through software that withholds personal information.Footnote 5 Academia may be another application if blind auditioning can help to address the lower success rates of female applicants for funding schemes such as ERC grants (Vernos 2013).Footnote 6 My main result is that there exists a threshold bias above which the evaluator prefers a blind audition to provide targeted effort incentives: high effort incentives for highly able applicants while low-ability applicants do not participate. Consequently, committing to no information can be beneficial for the evaluator. Moreover, above the threshold bias, equal opportunity and targeted effort incentives are complementary objectives: there is no trade-off between implementing blind auditions as a policy to counteract first impression biases and efficiency due to adverse effects on targeted effort provision. If anything, the implementation of equal opportunity is effort-enhancing for high-ability applicants above this threshold. Perhaps surprisingly, the preferences of a highly biased evaluator align with the preferences of high-ability females: a blind audition provides targeted effort incentives and, as a side effect, plays out in favour of high-ability females, as they prefer to conceal their gender. My model sheds light on the forces underlying the empirical findings on the use of blind auditions and shows that the gains from being able to conceal one’s gender need not be uniform. For a low bias, the gains from moving to a blind audition accrue to low-ability females. If the bias is high, the gains accrue to high-ability females. I show in an extension that a blind audition cannot provide targeted effort incentives if performance uncertainty exceeds some threshold. Consequently, for a highly biased evaluator, a blind audition is no longer guaranteed to be more profitable than an informed audition. Moreover, there is the sizeable risk of market failure: for certain parameter combinations, neither a blind nor an informed audition is profitable and the evaluator might not want to hold an audition at all. Interventions that ensure the applicant pool to be of sufficiently high ability under performance uncertainty guarantee the profitability of a blind audition when the evaluator is highly biased and avoid market failure. Finally, I show that a policy maker may want to allow a moderately biased evaluator to request a gender-blind CV prior to a blind audition. My paper relates to several strands of the literature. I draw upon the literature on cognitive biases: I argue that the evaluator in an informed audition is likely subject to different types of biases which may be summarised in a reduced-form parameter. One potential driver is intergroup bias: the evaluator may judge members of his own group more favourably (Hewstone et al. 2002; Anwar 2012; Bagues and Perez-Villadoniga 2012). In orchestras, gender associations with instruments may drive bias (Abeles 2009; Stronsick et al. 2018; Sergeant and Himonides 2019). A third potential driver is due to interaction effects of gender and race: in experimental judging sessions, videotaped males tend to score lowest among black performers; females lowest among whites (Elliott 1995). Extraneous factors warrant the modelling of bias in performance evaluation. This can be as subtle as the strength of the applicant’s handshake at the audition if this opening ritual influences the evaluator’s belief about her character strength.Footnote 7 Other examples are attractiveness or accent (Purkiss et al. 2006).Footnote 8 I draw upon contract theory by assuming verifiable disclosure (Milgrom 1981; Grossman 1981): in an informed audition, the applicant cannot misrepresent her gender nor ability on her CV. Conversely, the evaluator cannot commit to cherry-pick relevant information. Effort incentives are, therefore, influenced by the evaluator’s bias via his hiring rule. This feature is similar to implicit incentives arising in a dynamic setting (Meyer and Vickers 1997). The evaluator has a menu of audition forms available to hire the best candidate and, given his commonly known bias, needs to choose the optimal form (Laffont and Tirole 1986).Footnote 9 Moreover, the blind audition is akin to a signalling model à la Spence (1973) as the applicant’s effort decision may be informative about the ability dimension of her type while gender cannot be signalled. My paper builds on the literature in the economics of discrimination. In models of statistical discrimination (Phelps 1972; Arrow 1973), the evaluator has to believe that women are, on average, less productive than men to use gender in the hiring decision as a proxy for unobservable ability. In taste-based models (Becker 1971), the evaluator instead has a preference for hiring members of the dominant group; say, men. Also, an evaluator’s self-image bias (Siniscalchi and Veronesi 2020) or type-based mentoring (Athey et al. 2000) can perpetuate gender imbalance. I draw on experimental evidence that discrimination widens labour market differences between women and men in male occupations (Riach and Rich 2006), and that women can suffer from discrimination based on their physical appearance (Alaref et al. 2020). Blind auditions are studied by Taylor and Yildirim (2011), focusing on the effort and selection effects when the evaluator observes a signal of performance quality. Their model can explain the association of blind auditions with an increased probability of hiring females through a form of statistical discrimination, as a blind audition forces the evaluator to ignore the applicant’s ability. Similar to Taylor and Yildirim (2011), I study the conditions under which a blind audition provides better effort incentives. However, I allow for taste-based discrimination of the evaluator so that a blind audition forces him to ignore the applicant’s ability and gender. In my model, females and males are equally productive for the same level of ability. This assumption stresses that prejudices against female musicians (Seltzer 1989), social attitudes (Allmendinger and Hackman 1995) and self-identity (Starr 1974) are key in explaining the findings of Goldin and Rouse (2000). When the evaluator in Taylor and Yildirim (2011) can commit to an acceptance threshold prior to the audition and the observed quality signal is verifiable, he is forced to reject performances that he knows to be of high quality with positive probability to provide effort incentives. Such a trade-off at the high end of the quality spectrum does not arise in my informed audition; rather, applicants with low ability may be screened  as they anticipate a lower probability of being hired. Moreover, in Taylor and Yildirim’s (2011) blind audition, the evaluator uses a uniform acceptance threshold. My blind audition, in contrast, allows for signalling concerns: a uniform hiring probability only arises when applicants pool on high effort. In Taylor and Yildirim (2011), if the applicant pool is of mainly high ability, the evaluator prefers a blind audition as assessing performance quality is less important than providing effort incentives; if the applicant pool is of predominantly low ability, the evaluator prefers an informed audition as selecting high-quality performances is crucial. Taste-based discrimination, in contrast, allows for richer predictions: if there is little bias and the applicant pool is highly able, my blind audition attracts low-ability applicants rather than providing targeted effort incentives. For a high bias, the evaluator prefers a blind audition irrespective of the applicant pool’s ability composition. In Taylor and Yildirim (2011), if the signal of performance quality is precise, the evaluator prefers a blind audition as the incremental information from observing ability is low; if imprecise, he prefers an informed audition as observing ability has a large incremental informational value. My model, in contrast, makes more nuanced predictions about the effect of performance uncertainty: if there is little bias, informed auditions are preferred irrespective of the degree of performance uncertainty. If the bias is high and performance uncertainty is above a threshold, the ability composition of the applicant pool determines the evaluator’s preferences. For a very low prior about ability, it is paramount to include ability in the hiring policy. While blind auditions provide better effort incentives for the highly able, these types are infrequent. For a sufficiently high prior, high effort incentives for the highly able are paramount, making blind auditions preferable. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sets out preliminaries common to both auditions. In Sects. 3 and 4, I solve for equilibrium in the informed and blind audition. Section 5 details my main results on the evaluator’s and applicant’s audition preferences. I introduce asymmetric uncertainty in Sect. 6. I compare blind auditions to quotas and subsidies in Sect. 7. I briefly highlight the agency cost in the two audition forms in Sect. 8. I discuss the use of gender-blind CVs in Sect. 9 and conclude with avenues for further research in Sect. 10.",2

Paulsen,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Great Recession was a time of significant economic hardship for many Americans. Officially, the Great Recession began in December of 2007 and ended in June of 2009, but the negative impact on employment lasted much longer. During this period, the unemployment rate increased from a pre-recession level of about 5% to a peak of 10%, with rates growing far higher for disadvantaged groups, young adults, and those with lower levels of education (Cunningham, 2018). While economic downturns have a negative impact across the board, those industries that rely on discretionary consumer spending, like the arts and entertainment, are especially likely to suffer. Arts organizations and funding for the arts took significant hits during the Great Recession. Many arts organizations closed, saw endowment losses, or saw budget cuts during this period. Adult attendance of the performing arts fell. Adults and children were less likely to go to the movies and attend live performances (Miringoff & Opdycke, 2010). Perceptions of the value of arts education and funding for arts education also took a hit during this period (Ramos & Baugher, 2013). As the arts suffered during the Great Recession, it is natural to wonder how the labor market and educational attainment in the arts were affected. During this time artists were disproportionately unemployed or underemployed relative to other types of workers. Further, many artists switched to non-arts occupations or pursued self-employment (Woronkowicz, 2015). One group of workers likely to pursue work in the arts are college graduates with degrees in the arts. While studies have looked at the employment experiences of artists during this time, the labor market and educational experiences of art majors directly have not been explored. This study will look at the impact of the Great Recession on art majors.Footnote 1 Specifically, this study will explore how the Great Recession impacted the educational decisions of arts majors and their long-term employment outcomes in the USA. Educational decisions explored include the decision to major in an arts field, the decision to double major, and the decision to pursue an advanced degree. Parental approval is an important determinant of major choice, and economic conditions may impact which majors earn parental approval (Zafar, 2012). As employers demand greater skills of workers during economic downturns, students may take steps to increase their human capital (Modestino et al., 2020). Employment-related outcomes considered include employment status, earnings, hours worked, and job type. These outcomes mirror the employment outcomes of Woronkowicz (2015) which focused on the impact of the Great Recession on the employment of artists. Overall, this study finds notable impacts of graduating during or following the Great Recession on the educational choices and career outcomes of art majors relative to non-art college graduates. Relative to those who graduated shortly prior to the Great Recession, those who graduate during or shortly after were less likely to major in a traditional art field, like music or performing arts, though more likely to major in a related creative field, like art education or literature. Graduating during or shortly after the recession had a positive impact on double majoring and a negative impact on completing advanced degrees for those majoring in traditional arts or related creative fields, though the opposite effect was observed for architecture majors. With regard to career outcomes, art majors who graduated during the Great Recession are more likely to be self-employed and have lower earnings conditional on being employed despite working significantly longer hours. For architecture majors, graduating during or after the recession is found to have a positive impact on earnings, though this is likely attributable to an increased likelihood of completing an advanced degree. Art majors who graduated during the recession are significantly more likely to be working in the arts, in occupations like actor or musician, than those who graduated before the recession, but this may be attributable to the increased likelihood of self-employment. Before proceeding, it is important to call attention to the contributions of this work. First, while other works have focused on the employment impacts of the Great Recession on the employment of artists, this work focuses specifically on college graduates with major fields of study in the arts. While there is some overlap between these groups, that overlap is small. Only about a quarter of traditional arts majors within the sample used for this analysis work directly in an arts occupation. Among those working as artists, only a small share has completed education relevant to working in their field (Bille & Jensen, 2018). Second, while other works have focused on employment-related outcomes, this work also looks at the impact on educational outcomes for art majors. Beyond playing a role in artistic creation, college graduates with majors in the arts play an important role in entrepreneurship and innovation (Paulsen et al., 2021). As entrepreneurship and innovation are important drivers of economic growth, understanding how economic downturns impact the educational choices and employment of arts majors can have important implications for both developed and developing economies. While the Great Recession was a significant economic downturn, it will be far from the last downturn. Already we have seen an economic downturn associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, so insights gained in analyzing the impacts of the Great Recession can be used in informing reactions to future downturns.",2

This amounts to about 4% of the total municipal expenditure. Owing to the federal system of Austria, the national and the provincial (regional) governments also have their stakes in cultural policies, through annual expenditures of about € 95 and € 105 per capita, respectively (data from Statistics Austria, 2020). Compared to other (European) countries, the public cultural spending in Austria is substantial and above-average both in absolute as well as relative terms (Compendium, 2021; see Sect. 3 of this paper). It is therefore of great interest to investigate the determinants of public cultural spending, and to discuss how these expenditures relate to socio-economic, budgetary, political and spatial variables. In order to place this paper in the cultural policy framework of a federal state, it is, first of all, important to clarify the role of municipalities in cultural policies. The design and implementation of cultural policies fall into the authority of each of the different levels of government. The Austrian constitution does not provide for precise regulations in regard to cultural policies (Getzner & Bröthaler, 2019; Zembylas & Mokre, 2003). Generally, cultural policies fall under the category of ‘voluntary’ public tasks of municipalities, contrary to the mandatory (statutory) or strictly regulated municipal infrastructures and services. However, there are federal laws for conserving cultural heritage and managing national museums and theaters. Provincial laws regulate, for instance, the organization, provision and funding of Schools of Music. In fact, it has been argued that cultural policies are one of the few areas in which municipalities have a significant freedom in making local decisions (Schulze & Rose, 1998). Theories of federalism, cultural policies and economics generally infer that these different levels of government may fulfill specific functions and roles in cultural policies. ‘Cultural policy’ is understood in this paper as a municipal policy field dealing with cultural institutions (Hasitschka, 2018; Zembylas, 2004). Besides institutions of the performing and fine arts, Hasitschka (2018) included the fields of education, research, media, religion, and legal systems, in his definition of cultural institutions. Tröndle and Steigerwald (2019) follow a more pragmatic approach by focusing on the concept of cultural policy in a narrow analytical framework. They account for cultural policies in the sense of dealing with the legal regulations of producing and distributing artistic products, such as copyright law, constitutional rights (freedom of artistic expression), as well as cultural institutions confined to the arts and typically considered as such (theaters, museums, art shows, concert halls). In this paper, a narrow approach to cultural policies in the latter sense is chosen. While there is no legal obligation to spend for cultural affairs as these are ‘voluntary’ municipal tasks, municipalities operate, of course, cultural institutions, often support cultural activities, fund local art associations and manage cultural centers for live events, such as concerts and art exhibitions. Given the argument that municipal decision-makers are ‘close to the citizens’ (e.g., Benito et al., 2013), it may be hypothesized that municipal cultural spending may be more in line with the citizens’ cultural preferences. Municipal cultural spending is eventually also more susceptible to political cycles. However, scholars have stressed the importance of a wide range of determinants of cultural spending, such as socio-economic, fiscal, political and spatial variables (e.g., López et al., 2017). In this paper, the determinants of the cultural spending of Austrian municipalities are investigated within a panel time series framework. While the approach accounts for the socio-economic variables that are commonly used, in regard to education, age and the income of citizens, the paper extends the standard frameworks by spatial determinants, such as the type of municipality (urban vs. rural), the size of the municipality, as well as the spatial distribution of the expenditures. The latter aspect is studied by using several spatial econometric models. Against this background, the following research questions guide the empirical work of this paper: How do socio-economic variables, such as the average income, age, and education of residents, correlate with municipal cultural spending? To what extent does cultural spending depend on the financial situation of the municipality? Which spatial variables, such as the size of the municipality, and the location (urban vs. rural), influence municipal spending? Is cultural spending of neighboring municipalities correlated? By answering these research questions, the paper is intended to contribute to the growing empirical literature in which the various hypotheses and concepts of cultural economics, cultural sociology and cultural studies are tested (e.g., on the differences between urban and rural populations, and on the socio-economic determinants of cultural policies). Based on the research questions outlined above, and on the detailed literature review of potential determinants of municipal cultural spending in Sect. 2, this paper empirically tests the following hypotheses. Firstly, it is hypothesized that the size of the municipality matters; cities and larger municipalities are assumed to provide cultural infrastructures not only to their own citizens but to the surrounding regions, and therefore face higher per-capita cultural spending. Secondly, the socio-economic composition of the municipal population influences cultural spending significantly. Based on the available evidence on cultural consumption, it is hypothesized that cultural spending increases with average income, age and education of the electorate. Thirdly, it is hypothesized that cultural spending depends on the municipality’s fiscal position. Cultural expenditure increases with the financial resources of the municipality (own taxes, total expenditure, cash-flow), but is reduced in times of fiscal stress (denoted by municipal debt). Finally, cultural spending is supposed to be influenced by the party affiliation of the mayor (and the majority of the representatives in the respective municipal councils). It is hypothesized that conservative mayors spend more on culture than social-democrats. In regard to the spatial correlation of the municipal spending of neighboring municipalities, it is hypothesized that there is a strong correlation between cultural spending. The novelty of this paper lies in the use of a huge dataset on municipal cultural spending (about 2100 Austrian municipalities over a period from 2004 to 2018), and on a distance matrix that includes all spatial relationships between Austrian municipalities. Furthermore, this paper draws on a recent study on the cultural participation and cultural consumption of Austrian citizens (Getzner, 2020a). From this study, there is detailed information available about the average distance traveled to cultural events. The neighborhood of municipalities is empirically defined by a radius (distance) of 15–30 min (details are provided below), resulting in a respective weighting matrix for the spatial regressions presented in this paper. The structure of the paper is as follows: A brief literature review on the empirical evidence of the potential determinants of municipal cultural spending is presented in Sect. 2. The methods and data sources are described in Sect. 3. The descriptive and econometric results are discussed in Sects. 4 and 5, while in Sect. 6, the results are summarized and conclusions are drawn.",

Here yet another step forward in history is taken. The focus is on the twentieth century cultural policy endeavour for inclusion in Swedish opera houses and concert halls of the underprivileged and disadvantaged. In the previous article a prediction was made: It is much less likely that the growth of workers’ incomes during the twentieth century has led to a similar increase in working class demand for opera as it did for the bourgeoisie during the period studied. . . . If opera demand increases in the near future, this will possibly be based on the growth of income for population segments that already constitute opera audiences. (Albinsson, 2020). This idea is elaborated here. Workers’ wages are compared to clerks’ salaries and with ticket prices. The study is longitudinal. It includes data from the opening of the Oscarian opera house in Stockholm in 1898 until 2019. The main research question is the following: Does the explicit cultural policy goal for social inclusion mean that increases in ticket prices have mirrored raised wages levels for workers? If not: has this been detrimental to workers’ access to opera houses and concert halls? An important sub-issue is whether price discrimination policies have been implemented to the advantage of the low-income strata of society. The choice of Sweden is principally due to the long tradition of explicit political goals to include, first, ‘manual workers’ (Engberg, 1921), then ‘the disadvantaged’ (SOU, 1972:66, 155), ‘underprivileged groups’ (SOU, 1972:66, 158), ‘an open social community’ (SOU, 2009:16, 21) and, now, ‘the broad public’ (Uppsala, 2020, 5; Region Västra Götaland, 2019, 13). Furthermore, because the work was undertaken during the Covid-19 pandemic, the author was restricted to work within the borders of his country of residence. Modern Swedish cultural policy is based on the ideal of folkbildning, which was inspired by the Humboldtian concept of Bildung (Hofmann, 2010). In Sweden, folkbildning is ascribed to the mostly voluntary education and formation of unprivileged groups of the population that was established within the framework of the three social movements that emerged during the nineteenth century: the free church movement, the sobriety movement and the labour movement (Key, 1897; SOU, 1952:23, 167; SOU, 1972:66, 47–51; Sundgren, 2007, ch. 1; Proposition, 2009/10:3, 111; Folkbildningsrådet, 2020). The major Swedish opera houses and concert halls are state, regional or municipal government institutions. Although they are all separate entities outside the governmental administration, their boards consist of politically nominated members. Furthermore, their funding is largely tax based. National government institutions receive funding only from the Riksdag (the national parliament). Regional institutions are funded by both the Riksdag and the regional cultural councils. Municipal institutions normally receive funding from all three levels of governments. While the first CPA of 1974 was more or less copied word for word into regional and municipal CPAs, the 2009 national act has been reformulated into regional and municipal cultural strategies with more concrete objectives than the national cultural policy goals. Most of the latter start with the rather undecisive Swedish word främja, which translates into ‘encourage, promote, further, or facilitate’, of which ‘promote everyone’s opportunities for cultural experiences, Bildung, and develop their creative abilities’ is the most relevant for this study. The initial folkbildning ideal is still an inspirational source in the CPAs on all three levels. The inclusion of all inhabitants in cultural activities is part and parcel of all the CPAs. A major change has also occurred in Sweden with the broadening of what is regarded as, in this case, music of high quality. However, the funding of what were formerly considered to be culturally worthy fine arts institutions has not diminished. The Socialdemokratiska Arbetarpartiet (SAP; Social Democratic Workers’ Party) was formed in 1889. From its perspective, the role of cultural policy was to improve the cultural standard for underprivileged sections of the population and thus, particularly, to elevate the working class to a more refined level where it could be considered worthy of participating in the country’s political affairs. For the working class the conquest of culture became a way of qualifying for the position of political power it sought. The task was to foster the taste of the working class and to make it rise to ever higher cultural levels. This taste-formation attitude is both strong and self-evident in the whole of society even in the 1940s. (Sundgren, 2007, 272)Footnote 1 From a near majority parliament position the SAP led the development of the Swedish welfare society from 1932 to 1976. The 1947 parliamentary Music Inquiry pointed out that the Swedish music arena by then was more extensive than ever before. Although the working class, like others, thereby gained improved accessibility to high-quality music experiences, the audience still consisted mainly of the better off. Ticket prices were identified as an obstacle: ‘The cost of concert attendance certainly seems to, largely, restrain the participation at concerts of a large share of the population in the desired extent’ (SOU 1954: 2, 109–110). In 1921 Arthur Engberg, a few years later the SAP Minister of Education and Culture, wrote that ‘foxtrot and other nonsense’ should be worked against (Engberg, 1921). This tradition was followed by another SAP Minister of Education and Culture, Ragnar Edenman (1959), who worked for the cultural formation of the nation against the forces of ‘weekly tabloids, kitschy paintings, “schlager” music, films of dubious value and all kinds of “entertainment”’. The musicologist Martin Tegen (1949) discussed this issue along similar lines but with a musical twist: ‘The many layers of contemporary music audiences each have their own habits and needs, which are, occasionally, satisfied in a rather harsh, commercially calculating way, even in terms of such details as timbre and style.’ The overarching objective of the 1974 Cultural Policy Act/CPA was that it should ‘contribute to a better society with greater equality’. One of the eight sub-goals was: ‘cultural policy must to a greater extent be modelled with regard to the experiences and needs of disadvantaged groups’. Here one could expect that the working class could be, explicitly, considered as such a group and that low fees could be thought of as a way of framing the performing arts to its needs. However, there is no such consideration in the bill. Only ‘children, the disabled, institutionalised, immigrants and other ethnic groups as well as people in sparsely populated areas’ were regarded as disadvantaged (Proposition, 1974: 28, 300). Although the cultural policy bill was based on 38 years of SAP dominance, the decision on cultural policy was both broadly and deeply rooted in all parliamentary parties. The 2004 Orchestra Inquiry’s report, ‘Professional orchestra music in Sweden’, identifies that also today there is a need for strategies and methods to reach a wider audience. The inquiry found that many orchestras were aware that the world around them had changed and, hence, new strategies had been drawn up. However, ‘these strategies have not been able to sufficiently counteract the decrease in audiences that has affected orchestral music.’ The inquiry states that ‘the audience today mainly consists of a Swedish [ethnicity] middle-class audience with a certain dominance of female visitors’. That is why the report results in, among other things, a proposal that a new directive should include conditions to ‘strengthen the diffusion of orchestral (and opera) music, but also concert music in other forms, to a broad audience’ (SOU, 2006: 34, 108–114). A recent article by Wu et al. (2019) provides an extended cultural economics literature review. They find that ‘a positive effect of income and a negative effect of price on the demand for performing arts are mainstream results in cultural economics literature.’ Ziebe and O’Hagan (2013) make a similar argument, writing that ‘[p]rice and income are shown to be highly significant,’ but their research is based on data from individuals. Here, no such data are used. Tentative attempts with econometric tools using the average income levels for workers and clerks and the ticket price data collected here show a similar response. However, this study does not intend to establish such already known causality facts but rather tries to bring the pricing issue a small step further. Bearing the rather intuitive price-income relation in mind, the narrative is centred on how ticket prices in publicly owned or subsided opera houses and concert halls have (or have not), over time, facilitated low-income earners’ attendance in line with public funders’ cultural policy ambitions that date back more than a century. The ticket pricing issue has been little researched in Sweden. In the USA, where opera houses and symphony orchestras are primarily based on private funding, the ticket price instrument is discussed in academic journals. Scheff (1999) discusses subscriptions versus single-ticket purchases. Rosen and Rosenfield (1997) discuss the economic principles in price discrimination on tickets. Cortey and Pagliero (2012) use a multiple regression model to account for a multitude of artists, venues, cities and concert characteristics. They find that price discrimination through multiple ticket prices can increase revenues by 5%—the same result as Leslie (2004) finds in an earlier study of Broadway theatres. Eckard and Smith (2012) find a 4.2% revenue benefit from the use of multi-tier pricing at a major US pop music venue. Ekelund and Ritenour (1999) add the variable of time opportunity cost, adapting the approach introduced by Owen (1971) in their quantitative analyses on the demand for symphony orchestra tickets. Lange and Luksetich (1984) calculated the demand elasticities for 128 US symphony orchestras with respect to prices, quality and promotion. They found a negative price elasticity at a similar level (circa − 0.48) to what was found by other contemporary researchers (e.g. Withers, 1980). Ziebe (2009) discusses price elasticity in the demand for German theatre. She finds that the opportunity cost for leisure time has a higher negative elasticity factor than ticket price. The more people earn, the higher their ‘cost’ for participating in time-intensive performing arts consumption. The same pattern is found in this study of Swedish venues. The main finding of the study is that workers now need to work for more hours to be able to pay for a ticket to an opera house or a concert hall than during the 1970s, despite the consideration of workers, explicitly or implicitly, as an ‘underprivileged group’ and their inclusion in the ‘broad public’ having been a major focal point in all national CPAs. Workers are compared to clerks because the latter are not generally considered to be underprivileged—the workers’ ‘penalty’ versus that of clerks is used in the analysis. Another finding is that opera houses do use elements of price discrimination strategies, whereas symphony orchestras and their concert halls engage less in this practice. However, most pricing strategies are uniform. They apply equally to all kinds of content. Instead publicly funded music institutions currently try to appeal to new audience groups through the use of repertoire from a fundamentally commercial musical domain in ‘special events’. The hope is that this will make such new listeners interested also in the standard repertoire and to ‘lower the venue thresholds’. The choice of a high level of ticket prices for the more traditional content means that this hope is in vain. The audience remains monocultural.",1

In 2014, Italian cultural institutions (in particular museums) were affected by a reform in their governance aimed at reinstituting their education and research mission leading to a greater uptake of cultural heritage by the public. Specifically, one of the main features of the reform was special autonomy, which was awarded to 32 selected museums; these museums constitute the sample for our causal effect investigation. Museums are permanent, accessible, non-profit institutions that research, acquire, conserve, communicate, and exhibit the cultural heritage of a country with the aim of promoting learning, participation, and the well-being of the community.Footnote 1 In view of this, one objective of museums is to contribute to economic development through a growth in cultural, human, and social capital. To achieve these goals, the traditional mission of museums over the last few decades, which mainly focused on conservation of their collections (including preservation, interpretation, research, and display), has been re-thought in line with the enhancement of valorization, utilization, communication, and exhibition to meet the needs of visitors and improve the social and economic impact of cultural goods on the community (Anderson, 2004; Weil, 1995, 1999). Indeed, a museum has to provide both local residents and foreign visitors with education and entertainment content (Mairesse and Desvallées 2010), contributing to the creation of a better educated and informed population (Johnson, 2003), and reassessing national identity in a changing political climate (Dodd et al., 2012).Footnote 2 To address the trade-off between conservation and valorization (or utilization) of collections, new models (and strategies) of governance of state museums and, to an even greater extent, the design of ad hoc policies are required. This need is amplified by the general lack of public resources and, in recent years, by the economic crisis that saw the imposition of budget restrictions on public museums in many countries. Since the 1980s, the New Public Management (NPM) philosophy (Hood,1995) has promoted the diffusion of an economic-managerial approach in public sector organizations. Accordingly, some studies point out that a transfer of managerial and financial responsibilities to autonomous public bodies may be better than either private or centralized public management for the provision of public services (Besley & Ghatak, 2003). NPM has inspired administrative reforms that redesign the strategic orientation of public museums from a focus on conservation to a more contemporary focus on accessibility. Since 2014, the governance of Italian state museums has been affected by a substantial reform designed from the perspective of NPM: the Franceschini reformFootnote 3 that brought Italy more in line with international best practices. The reform was part of a cultural project aimed at reinstituting the education and research mission (lost in the past decades—see Argan, 1957) of cultural heritage in the light of widespread culture as a pillar of economic growth. One of the most important features of the reform was the identification of 32 state museums and archaeological parks eligible for special autonomy, specifically, organizational, scientific, accounting, and financial autonomy. This policy advocates the management of museums being carried out by directors (no longer the Ministry) responsible for ensuring their performance and the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of activities as well as for enhancing the promotion of artistic heritage. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of this policy reform in pursuing their new function of the valorization/utilization of their collections. We test whether special autonomy is an incentive for museum management to realize the valorization function, measured by the number of visitors and the amount of revenue from admissions. Indeed, at a time of tight public budget constraints, effective valorization of museums’ cultural heritage can increase the financial resources directors have available to re-invest in valorization. Due to restricted financial resources, at the beginning of 2016, autonomy was awarded to 22 museums, and, at the end of 2017, to the remaining 10. Therefore, in the 2 years between early 2016 and the end of 2017, only 22 special museums were affected by the reform. We exploit the staggered pattern in the achievement of special autonomy as an as good as exogenous shock in the outcomes of interest. Indeed, exogeneity is assumed because no criteria involving visitors and/or revenue was adopted in the selection of the first and second tranche of special museums. This exogenous shock thus allows us to implement a difference-in-differences (diff-in-diff) approach, comparing the outcomes of museums (visitors and revenue) between the treated (the first museums being autonomous) and the control (the last 10) groups of museums before and after the reform was applied. However, when visitors and revenue are considered as outcomes, an endogeneity problem may arise due to possible omitted variables catching characteristics of museums affecting the outcomes. The staggered pattern in the achievement of special autonomy by the 32 special museums allows us to deal with this endogeneity issue by studying, in a natural experimental setting, the causal effect of the policy reform: the reform, being an exogenous shock, makes the treatment and the control group unrelated to such unobserved museums’ characteristics affecting the dependent variable of our analysis. Our findings suggest that the policy reform increased the share of visitors by more than 3.7 percentage points and the share of revenue by more than 4.3 percentage points in the treatment group of museums compared to the counterfactual. We also give graphical support to our findings by plotting the Kernel density distribution of both the outputs in the treatment and control group of museums before and after the reform: the shift of the distribution to the right after the reform is more pronounced for the treatment group than the control group. The results remain robust to the external factors affecting the development of the outcome variables, as the tourist flows, and to the location of museums in regional capitals. Moreover, we verify that the increase in revenue is only due to the growth in the number of visitors because there is no significant change in the new managements’ pricing strategy. We provide evidence of the parallel trend in museums’ outcomes for the treatment and control groups in the pre-reform period and of the dynamic of the outcome variables with an event study estimation. Moreover, our results are robust to a number of sample size variations. This paper contributes to the literature on the effectiveness of the NPM view of museum management, whose empirical literature is still scarce. It falls into the more general debate addressing whether ownership structures and organizational models of cultural institutions affect differently their efficiency and effectiveness in the trade-off between preservation and utilization. Indeed, looking at the distinction between public and private museums, the former, with public grants covering their budget, have low incentives to search for alternative income sources, being oriented mainly toward the promotion of the social role of museums and improvements in people’s culture. Moreover, when a centralized bureaucratic organization manages cultural institutions, it fails in coordinating the diverse museum functions and in promoting visitor-oriented activities (Benhamou, 1998; Frey & Pommerehne, 1989). Private museums on the other hand have “market-oriented” government with greater attention to additional financial sources such as sponsorship and donations (Rushton, 2000); moreover, to ensure the organization’s financial sustainability, they also have a greater incentive to engage in managerial practices and strategies, particularly the optimal price strategy, to maximize revenue (Frey & Meier, 2006). However, there is a lack of empirical evidence showing the effect of ownership on museums’ efficiency and performance. Camarero et al. (2011) find public funding has a significant and negative impact on museums’ capacity to invest in technological innovation, whereas evidence of the effect of public ownership on museums’ economic and social performance is mixed. Studies on Italian museums find that, according to some measures of effectiveness, autonomous or outsourced public museums show the best performance, while private museums achieve a better performance than those publicly managed in the traditional way (Beretta et al., 2019; Bertacchini et al., 2018; Leva et al., 2019). In a very recent work, Guccio et al. (2020) show that the operational environment (per capita income levels and larger hospitality sectors) also matters in positively affecting museums’ efficiency; moreover, they show that private ownership is associated with a higher level of efficiency and that state museums present a lower level of efficiency than local museums. Our main findings highlight the effectiveness of a policy oriented to providing state museums with greater managerial autonomy. We show that the design of such policies can be interpreted as an attempt by policymakers to preserve the “welfare-oriented” conservation function of state museums and, at the same time, to enhance the fruition of collections by providing greater museum sustainability due to its more “market-oriented” managerial approach. The recent research of del Barrio-Tellado and Herrero-Prieto (2019), evaluating the performance of publicly owned Spanish museums, reveals that good levels of efficiency in terms of management do not guarantee success when attracting visitors, and there seems to be a trade-off between the two goals. In this respect, our paper, using a number of communication and supplementary services provided by museums (as the number of guided tours, of coffees and meals at restaurants, of audio guides, and of gadgets) offers evidence that seems to mitigate the del Barrio-Tellado and Herrero-Prieto (2019)’s trade-off.Footnote 4 We find that the reform increased the number of such services by about 5.3 percentage points more in the treatment group than in the control group. An increase of about 4.8 p.p occurs when we consider the revenue from those services. Although communication and supplementary services are under the direct management of directors (rather than number of visitors and amount of revenue from admissions, whose trend may be affected by other specific conditions—for example, the trend in demand—external from management control), their analysis allows us to give only a “suggestive” evidence of the effectiveness of managerial autonomy. Indeed, supplementary services are not direct measures of museum management autonomy, as temporary exhibitions or fundraising (whose data are not actually available) could be. Therefore, our study evaluates a museum cultural policy in terms of two variables (visitors and revenue from admissions) related to the exhibition function of museums. Not much can be said about how successful changes in management have been. In this sense, a criticism may arise referring to the unchanged pricing strategy that is an aspect of the museums’ own capacity to act. Our study, although subject to the limitations pointed out just above, provides robust policy indications for defining future cultural management strategy in the context of public budget crises. The paper continues as follows. Section 2 outlines the institutional framework and data. Section 3 develops the empirical methodology. Section 4 provides the results of the empirical analysis, where Subsection 4.1 summarizes the main findings and Subsection 4.2 discusses the validity of the identification assumptions and the dynamic impact of the reform. Subsection 4.3 offers some robustness checks in terms of a number of sample size variation (in Subsection 4.3.1) and of the provision of communication and supplementary services (in Subsection 4.3.2). In Sect. 5, we conclude.",2

People use consumption to offset the negative impact of economic fluctuations. This paper shows that the consumption of cultural services with low production marginal costs, is an instrument to counterbalance the mood impact of aggregate macroeconomic conditions. This analysis sheds light on the relationship between the consumption decisions for cultural services and the wellbeing effects of business cycles. A recession increases unemployment, reduces income, and modifies expenditure decisions. Consumers postpone the purchase of durables, use more repair services, provide some services on their own and are most likely prone to pursuing pleasure consumption. Interestingly, in this sense, consumption of some low cost high emotional return products increases during economic downturns. In some cases, consumption increases due to a search for hedonic pleasure or mood regulation. This is known as the lipstick effect. There is no evidence of similar effects for cultural services. Although some information exists regarding the “lipstick effects” related with tangible goods (Hamilton et al., 2019; MacDonald & Dildar, 2020), far less is known with respect to cultural consumption and non-priced services (e.g., environmental goods or listening to music on the radio). In the present paper, we try to fill this gap. From a macroeconomic perspective, the relationship between wellbeing and the business cycle sheds light on the issue of the ‘personal’ costs of cycles and the strategies used by consumers to overcome adverse economic situations. People use music in order to alleviate stress and anxiety as well as boosting their emotional and mental wellbeing. We elaborate a new dataset with weekly information relating to the 100 most trendy songs and then go on to analyse the lyrics sentiment. We use the mood collected by music consumption as an indicator of how society regulates the mood effects of business cycles. We do not analyse the amount of music consumed, but the sentiment perceived in the songs consumed. We regress the consumption of lyrics sentiments with macroeconomic variables that reflect the short-term economic fluctuations (mainly unemployment, but also inflation, the stock exchange and the interest rate). We find that society reacts to the general business climate by offsetting the negative wellbeing effects of economic cycles with an increase in the cultural consumption that offers positive emotional rewards. This result is robust with respect to the various economic indicators used as well as the different lyrics sentiment measures. As far as we know, this is the first study to show a higher (lower) preference for positive (negative) songs during less favourable macroeconomic periods of time. As the principal result, this has important implications for wellbeing policies. In tandem, it also provides relevant insights with respect to the significant role of culture as a stabilizer of macroeconomic fluctuation effects on well-being. The remainder of the article proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a literature framework. Section 3 describes the methodology and database. Sections 4 and 5 presents the empirical results and robustness checks, respectively. The final section concludes.",1

In both, the semifinals and the final, professional juries of five experts in each country rank all songs, with the exception of the one presented by their own country. Abstentions are not allowed, and it is forbidden to award the same rank to two different songs. In each country, the song receiving the highest number of votes is ranked first, the song receiving the second highest number of votes is ranked second and so on. Only the first ten collect points: 12 points for the top song, 10 for the second, 8 to 1 for the eight remaining songs; all other songs get zero. Each country’s jury includes five experts. The rules state that members of each national jury must rank all songs and that “the combined rank of each country’s jury members determines the jury result of that particular country,” but no details are given as to what is meant by combined rank. The literature on social choice discussed in Sect. 2 shows that this is far from being a trivial issue. Tele-viewers do not vote in the semifinals, but participate in the final via the official app, telephone and/or SMS. Each tele-voter can vote for any finalist (except for the one representing her own country of residence), but voters seem to have the possibility to vote as many times as they wish during the 15 minutes between the last song and the moment at which final results become public. Once votes are cast, they are added to produce a ranking for each country, in a similar way to what happens with the juries of experts. The final ranking is obtained by simply adding the number of points given by experts and tele-voters. Classical contributions in social choice explain the above voting procedures. We, nevertheless, endorse a different voting method based on the Shapley Value (Shapley, 1953), a classical contribution in game theory that provides a natural way to allocate the total surplus generated by the coalition of all players involved in a joint venture, or a cooperative game, based on the marginal contributions players produce. Beyond the normative foundations for Shapley Voting we offer, we also emphasize an important advantage from a practical viewpoint: It is easier and faster than the current protocol in the ES Contest. To wit, under the current rules in the ES Contest, experts and tele-voters have a short period of time to decide on their choices (points, rankings or votes) after having listened to all 26 singers. There is a vast literature on speed–accuracy trade-offs documenting that people are more likely to make mistakes under time pressure, or that they regret their ranking when forced to do it quickly; see, for instance, Kocher & Sutter (2006), Milosavljevic et al. (2010), Fehr & Rangel (2011) or Heitz (2014). Thus, simplifying the process is a worthy enterprise. As we shall argue later, the Shapley Voting method would help to do so. The method would imply that judges simply say “yes” or “no” to each option, without the need to impose a ranking. We also consider some biases that may have an effect on the outcomes of the ES Contest. First, there is literature on how alternative framings of information may influence final rankings in a positive or negative way (Flores & Ginsburgh, 1996; Glejser & Heyndels, 2001). We explore whether they may also play a role in the ES Contest, concentrating on the so-called opening advantage, as well as contrast effects. More precisely, we show that being surrounded by bad performers may enhance one’s own performance or the perception of those who have to judge the performers. If a song is performed among objectively poor performances, its quality might be perceived as higher than it objectively is. This is connected to observations made on status-seeking behavior and (relative) performance rankings in flat-wage environments (Charness et al., 2014). Small world networks (Watts & Strogatz, 1998) abound everywhere. They are regular networks “rewired” to introduce increasing amounts of disorder, which can be highly clustered. We find that clustering effects can also be observed in the ES Contest. More precisely, we observe that obvious pairwise clusters (such as Cyprus and Greece) or larger clusters (such as Scandinavian countries) exhibit a more collusive voting pattern than generic countries. In other words, reciprocity seems to be a non-written norm for the scoring mechanism of countries within the clusters. We conclude addressing the long-standing debate of whether experts are better judges than average citizens (tele-voters in this case), resorting to their respective predictive power. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss and formalize the voting rules used in the 2021 ES Contest and their results, as well as alternative voting rules and the comparison of their results with those that were officially announced. Section 3 explores the remaining issues reflecting biases, ranging from contrast effects to clustering effects and expert versus tele-voting. Section 4 concludes.",1
