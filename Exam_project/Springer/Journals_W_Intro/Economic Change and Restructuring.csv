Yet, growth came at the expenses of the egalitarian income distribution inherited from the socialist period. Income imbalances started to become evident not only between different regions but also within regions, mainly due to the increasing gap between urban and rural areas. By contrast, in the same period the income inequality in rural areas remained substantially unmodified (see Table 1). While the increasing urban rural gap has attracted the attention of many scholars (Glewwe et al. 2002; Baulch and Minot 2004
inter alia), the issue of stability of income distribution in rural areas has been less analyzed, although almost 80% of the population was residing there during the 1990s.Footnote 1 In particular, a part for few exceptions (Benjamin and Brandt 2004), it has been overlooked the nexus between key reforms like the de-collectivization of land and the liberalization of crop markets and their ultimate impact on the income distribution.
 The aim of this paper is precisely filling this gap. We plan to investigate the sources of rural inequality and quantify their contributions. Next, through an inter-temporal comparison between the two available surveys (1993–1998), we try to interpret the modification of income inequality determinants. The so-conducted analysis, besides the validity on its own, it is useful to both foresee future trends and provide useful insights to policy makers. In the first case, once the main determinants are identified and quantified, it becomes easier predicting likely changes in the overall inequality. In the second case, a quantitative analysis on inequality determinants might be used in deciding the tools and the targets for redistributive policies. For example, government can better justify infrastructure investments in poor regions if location is found to be dis-equalising and contributing for a significant amount to total inequality. The analytical method used in this paper is a combination of regression-based decomposition of Wan (2004) with the Shapley’s value technique of Shorrocks (1999, Unpublished Manuscript). Regression-based decomposition was initiated by Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973), which has been largely used to analyze discrimination in the labour market. The Shapley’s value technique is based on cooperative game theory and is a general decomposition framework which can be used in contexts other than inequality decomposition. This combination introduces flexibility in the specification of the underlying income or consumption function and in the choice of inequality measures. The paper is organised as follows. Sections 2–4 provide a general overview on initial conditions, economic reforms and income distribution of Vietnam from late 1980s to the 1990s. In Sect. 5, we present the Shapley’s value decomposition and the data used while in Sects.  6 and 7 are discussed the econometric and the decomposition results, respectively. Section 8 concludes.",7

Most aggregate models, however, do not distinguish between total costs of labour (i.e. gross payroll plus all related expenses) and net wages, notwithstanding the fact that employers’ decisions are determined by the former, while employees decide to take jobs in response to the latter. Therefore, because of the time-varying dynamics of the charges related to wages (payroll), i.e. taxes and social insurance contributions, taking account of them is crucial for explaining inflationary phenomena correctly. Another simplification that can be found in many models is that the producer prices (PPI) and the consumer price index (CPI) are treated as equivalent to each other. The former is determined by (unit) costs that mainly consist of labour cost, whereas CPI is shaped not only by producer prices, but also by the prices of services, of imports and also taxes which show variability in time that is not only strong but also essentially different from the variability of producer prices. The presented study aimed to build a model taking account of both payroll expenses and their effects on inflationary processes and to analyse the factors that make CPI grow faster than PPI. The study employed deseasonalized monthly data spanning the period January 1993–December 2008, i.e. covering also the first years of Poland’s membership in the EU. At the same time, the final months of the sample mark the outset of a global financial crisis that emerged in the fall of 2008. Because the variables are generated by nonstationary stochastic processes integrated of order one and two, the analytical tool used was a vector (equilibrium) correction model, VECM (VEqCM).",4

The heterogeneity of the different countries, in term of economic development’ level, market institutions’ maturity, technology and innovation capacity, make particularly difficult to suggest some conclusions. Therefore, the scope of this Special issue is mainly to underline some crucial questions related to policies and strategies, referring to the different economic and institutional contexts. Michael Porter’ “Diamond of National Advantage” (Porter 1990) for improving national competitiveness, at the core of which there are innovation and productivity growth, refers to mature economies where “factor conditions”—including the quality of labour and other inputs, “the demand
conditions” for specific products, “the related supporting industries” and the “firm’ strategy and environment, including rivalry”—necessary element to stimulate innovation—are dynamically interrelated. The balance among these fundamental components for an ideal well-functioning market, has become also part of long-term strategy for catching up of emerging economies (Kim 1997) adapting them to the respective socio-economic development conditions. Few emerging countries have achieved good results—looking for improving their capacity to adapt and absorb technology, upgrading their domestic resources, and apply innovation coming from abroad, as long as institutions have been able to become facilitator and propellant of such structural changes.",3

Raheem,Kazeem O. Isah,Abdulfatai A. Adedeji,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A layman would have an eye-catching and appealing picture of natural resource abundance. But a closer and scientific investigation of the effects of natural resources on both the macro- and socio-economic variables would suggest otherwise. For instance, natural resource abundance has been found to fuel growth “exclusiveness”. The entire supply chain of natural resources from discovery to sales has features of growth elitism. As an illustration, governments or their appointees hold property rights to natural resource wealth, in which case, the immediate effect of the supply chain is self-enrichment of the property rights holders. Second, in a case where the private sector is allowed to be among the stakeholders, selfish interest of the government through excessive taxation might discourage investment required to discover natural resources in the first place. Another channel is if the political elite or other powerful groups were given preferential access to the resource wealth, they would use it for their own benefit without investing the generated wealth for overall growth (Warner 2012). Also, the exact macroeconomic effect of natural resource abundance is difficult to unravel. In the short term, there is existence of volatility in the revenue accruable from the exploitation, exploration and sales of these resources. This makes it difficult to conduct macroeconomic stabilization policies. The long run challenge relates to the ample evidences that have shown that resource-endowed countries tend to have slower economic growth rate as compared with resource-scarce countries (Frankel 2012; Oyinlola et al. 2015; Arezki and Nabli 2012). This strand of the literature is referred to as “Resource Curse Hypothesis” (RCH), a coinage attributed to Sachs and Warner (1995). It should be noted that the RCH debate is inconclusive, as studies have argued and documented evidences on both sides of the argument (See Frankel 2012 for a survey). The problem identified by the studies that have refuted RCH is due to the fact that they concentrate on aggregate growth. These studies have an implicit assumption that all the citizens enjoy the rents received from the sales/export of these resources, which is the hardly the case in reality. In the sub-Saharan African (SSA) case, there are ample evidences that have proved that a selected proportion of the population, mostly the political elite and urban dwellers, enjoy these proceeds. Also, a large chuck of this revenue is spent on recurrent and administrative expenditures, which is biased against the poor and unemployed. Thus, this being the case is an indication that these categories of citizenry (i.e. the poor and unemployed) are potentially being deprived from reaping the benefits of the endowment.Footnote 1 This among others might limit the ability of these sets of citizens to contribute their productivity quota to the national output. Hence, it could then be summarily stated that natural resource abundance would not lead to inclusive growth,Footnote 2 as this might be a plausible candidate in explaining the RCH. The existence of inclusive growth ensures that all the sections of the country are active in the growth process of the economy. To this end, there would be increase in the tax-based revenue of the government, through increase in job creation. Hence, government would have more funds to formulate and implement developmental policies. The importance of inclusive growth has been demonstrated on a global, regional and national levels. A classical example is the tagging of the World Economic Forum that was held in Nigeria Forging Inclusive Growth, Creating Jobs; in February 2014, UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) highlighted inclusive growth as part of work plans and strategies. Also, in May 2014, European Commission emphasized the important role of the private sector led strategy in achieving inclusive growth. Nigeria’s 2013 Federal Government Budget was coined ‘Fiscal Consolidation with Inclusive Growth’; in November 2013, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) set inclusive growth as a pivotal part of their research agenda for 2014.Footnote 3 To further demonstrate the importance of inclusive growth, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have actively been engaging in coming up with policy papers geared towards enhancing inclusive growth. Examples of such papers include OECD (2012) whose report identified three problems: poverty,Footnote 4 unemploymentFootnote 5 and inequality,Footnote 6 that growth from 1990s to date had failed to tackle. OECD (2013a, b, c) also emphasizes the importance of inclusive growth. Goal 8 of the proposed Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goal is related to inclusive growth. G20 (2013) have confirmed the absence of inclusive growth in the region and further argued not only for a strong, sustainable and balanced growth but also for a more inclusive pattern of growth that will mobilize the talents of the citizenry. Also, Anand et al. (2013) argued that the Arab Spring, the growing divide between Main Street and Wall Street in advanced economies, and the “three speed” world economy have placed inclusive growth at the forefront of policy debates. In this study, we make a case for Human Capital Development (HCD) as a likely and efficient candidate/mechanism to ensure and enhance inclusive growth. HCD is a broad concept and cannot be measured holistically. However, we postulate that education and health are key indicators of HCD. This claim has also been backed by the fact that they (education and health) have retained their prominence by being among the nine objectives of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and recently, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Also, agencies such as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), OECD, UNDP and World Health Organization (WHO) have advocated for the improvement in the quality of service delivery as well as increase in government expenditures on these sectors. Based on the foregoing, this study seeks to achieve two broad objectives. Firstly, to empirically examine the possibility of achieving inclusive growth through increase in government expenditures on health and education. The second objective is to examine the potential benefit of investing the natural resources rent on HCD indicators. To this end, the study uses financing gap model and simulation methodology under certain assumptions to estimate the potential economic growth accruable by investing natural resource rent on human capital indicators. The novelty this study brings forth is based on its objective. Most of the existing papers on inclusive growth are policy papers, which is less empirical, as it is not driven by econometric or other scientific approaches.Footnote 7 The scope of this study is limited to 18 SSA countries for the period 1995–2013. The reasons adduced to limiting the scope to SSA are because (1) with the exception of very few countries (Botswana, Namibia and may be South Africa), statistics have shown that resource-rich countries in SSA are ensnared with RCH; (2) resource rents have been the major source of revenue for SSA countries; (3) the region is the least in the global HDI rankings and (4) the region has the highest prevalence of poverty and inequality. The selected countries are based on data availability. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: section two dwells on inclusive growth issues and further argued for the beneficial effects of inclusive growth. In section three, we discuss the data and provide a detailed trend analysis of the key variables in the study. Model specification and methodological related issues are offered in section four. Sections five and six house the empirical result and conclusion respectively.",48

Khoerul Mubin,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Inflation is a complex economic issue that has remained the main concern in the world for governments, policy makers, central bankers, as well as macroeconomists (Hussain and Malik 2011). Inflation also associates with various circumstances ranging from the national scale (such as economic stability) to the individual scale (such as social welfare). On the national or regional scale, inflation might pertain the price surge on the general price of goods and services in a country, so it makes the economy unstable. This price surge will impact people’s purchasing power, so that social welfare might be diminished. The large population of a country makes inflation more complicated to be tackled as in Indonesia, for instance. For a population that is more than 250 million (according to the 2010 Census) scattered in 35 provinces in 2019, there will be substantial distinguished traits of inflation experienced by each region. Each region can experience different production or distribution disruptions, so that the solution of these issues should be particularly uniquely distinguished. Furthermore, the cause of inflation also does not merely consist one aspect, for instance the inflation determinant that is not only from the demand side controlled by Indonesia’s central bank, Bank Indonesia, but also from the supply side such as production and distribution generally controlled by government regulation. Therefore, the precise policy is necessarily able to embrace aforementioned issues of inflation. One policy to monitor inflation, especially at the regional level, is through the formation of a Regional Inflation Controlling Team (RICT) known as Tim Pengendalian Inflasi Daerah (TPID). TPID/RICT was initiated in 2008 after forming the Inflation Controlling Team known as TPI in 2005.Footnote 1 As stated in the 2017 President’s Decree of the Republic of Indonesia Number 23, regarding the National Inflation Controlling Team, TPID has the following duties: collecting the price data of essential goods and services, arranging a regional policy to control inflation by referring to the national inflation policy, strengthening the logistic system and other programmes that are able to lower inflation. To run its programme, the TPID was coordinated by the local government leaders at the city or regency level. By involving local government leaders, it is expected that the TPID will be able to exercise an effective measure in controlling inflation. The inflation target as an indicator of the inflation rate plays an important role in this disparity reduction. As Arimurto and Trisnanto (2011) argue, this policy instrument works best with a more holistic monetary policy that deals with interest rates and is anticipative in nature. This means that regions ought to be able to achieve a predetermined target of inflation rate, so that they could maintain their economic stability. Another implication of the inflation target level is the aim to overcome structural problems in the supply chain, both for goods and services that cause disruption in inventory stability. Murwito et al. (2013) suggested that regions could cooperate with each other to maintain the logistic distribution among regions in case of maintaining price stability. This is because the World Bank (2016) states that Indonesian logistics tends to fluctuate due to uncertainty in the logistics chain and the different costs of the distribution of goods and services among regions. Moreover, Susanty and Ribka (2016) noted that the high cost of distribution among islands in Indonesia enormously contributes to the lack of local product competitiveness. Consequently, Indonesia’s logistic cost is approximately 26% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), double those of Malaysia and Singapore. Therefore, logistics problems will further increase the inter-regional inflation gaps if performance evaluation and policy making among regions are not aligned by each local government. Systematic economic evaluation is essential to ensure that the inflation rate in each region is convergent on the inflation target. Magkonis and Sharma (2019) stated that since the 1990s, there has been an increasing number of central banks that have adopted the inflation target level, so that this target could anchor people’s expectations. Adiwilaga and Tirtosuharto (2013) contended that determining a target for the inflation rate can discourage the inflation gap among regions and thus control inflation in each region. Regions would have target levels by stipulating various regional programmes that can minimise the impact of a macroeconomic shock. Studies have shown that there are various approaches to detect dispersion of the inflation rate: research on the inflation dynamic within the distribution dynamic approach (Cavallero 2011; Soares and Aguiar-Conraria, 2014), the influence of macro policies on inflation convergence (Arestis et al. 2014; Hasriati 2016; Lopez and Papell 2012), and measuring inflation convergence as an evaluation of stipulated programmes (Dridi and Nguyen 2018). These studies were able to evaluate the inflation rate in a country effectively by testing inflation convergence. This study examines the inflation convergence in Indonesia in order to provide evidence as the basis for an Indonesian regional policy making. The convergence test results could become a main indicator to evaluate the performance of various programmes that have been undertaken thus far. As far as we aware, study of Adiwilaga and Tirtosuharto (2013) is the only study of Indonesia’s inflation convergence in 26 provinces. In this study, we employed 82 cities, so we could state that our study is the first paper to test the convergence of inflation rate in the city level. We selected the city level because the city level is more well-represented and specific on inflation issues in each city, instead of provincial level that might remain too extensive to discuss. This study contributes to the literature by deploying data of regional inflation in Indonesia. The case of the Indonesian inflation is distinct due to its geographical condition as an archipelago country. The consequence of this condition is the possible high disparity of inflation rates at the regional level. This disparity takes place even if the stability of the national inflation rates has been maintained. For example, in 2009, even though the inflation rate had successfully decreased to 2.41% (year-on-year), there were 39 out of 66 cities that experienced an inflation rate greater than the national inflation, notably the greatest rate was 7.52%. The inflation variation among regions will serve as an appropriate evidence to investigate the existence of convergence. The utilisation of Indonesian regional inflation in this study becomes more advantageous due to the existence of the Regional Inflation Controlling Team in each city during the period of interest.",7

The reported decline in the labor share of income since the early 1980s (see, for example, Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014; Elsby et al. 2013), however, has challenged this perception and renewed the interest in the factor shares. The declining amount of income accruing to labor translates to rising income inequality on the premise that profits are less equally distributed than wages (Piketty 2014). Jacobson and Occhino (2012), in fact, provide numerical estimates for the increase in the US Gini index attributed to the decline in labor income share. Atkinson (2009) advocates the importance of studying factor shares drawing upon arguments about interpersonal income inequality, social justice and the proper tax treatment of different sources of income. Against this background, several attempts have been made to empirically establish the determinants of the labor share of income (see, among others, Stockhammer 2017; Furceri and Loungani 2018). Lawrence (2015) offers an alternative explanation of the declining labor income share, relying on neoclassical considerations. Lawrence (2015) shows that in the USA, the combination of a relatively low elasticity of substitution between capital and labor (σ < 1) and “labor-augmenting” technical change can explain the declining labor/capital ratio. One implication is that higher capital formation will raise labor income shares. Laurence (2015) uses sectoral data from the USA to show that low elasticities of substitution and the decline in the effective capital/labor ratio can account for much of the decline in labor’s share in the USA. In the neoclassical paradigm, the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor determines the way in which income is distributed between the two factors of production.Footnote 1 Thus, under specific assumptions about the elasticities between capital and labor of different skill levels, technological innovations that are capital augmenting (i.e., the marginal product of capital is higher than the marginal product of labor) induce firms to substitute labor with capital, and the labor’s share of income falls. Guerriero and Sen (2012) provide evidence on the relationship between investment and the functional distribution of income, and report, for some of the specifications employed, a “puzzling” positive relationship for the developing countries. The present paper produces international evidence to characterize empirically the implications of capital formation for the total amount of income accruing to labor. We provide panel estimations of labor share growth on investment and on a set of theoretically motivated control variables that emerge in the literature as important determinants of income’s functional distribution between labor and capital. The control variables aim to capture technological change, real and financial globalization, the size of welfare state, workers’ bargaining power and human capital. We use a panel framework that includes up to 99 countries, advanced and emerging, covering the period from 2004 to 2015. The existing empirical evidence on the role of technology in labor share decline is mixed. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014), for instance, use calibration methods and find that the higher capital/labor ratios, as a consequence of technologically induced lower relative investment prices, account for almost half of the decline in labor income share. IMF (2007) using data from 18 OECD countries also provides empirical evidence, showing that the effects of technological progress on the labor share can be negative. Stockhammer (2017), on the contrary, does not find evidence that technological change, measured by the logarithm of the GDP per worker, is an important factor driving labor shares. Instead, a small positive impact of technological change on the labor income share emerges in developing countries. Guerriero and Sen (2012) report a positive relationship between technology, proxied either by the number of patent applications or the expenses on research and development (R&D), and labor share. The level of workers’ educational attainment is customarily considered an important moderating factor for the relationship between technological progress and labor’s income share. Skilled labor is commonly considered to exhibit lower substitutability/complementarity with capital (Elsby et al. 2013; Lawrence 2015). This motivates the inclusion of human capital as a factor that might explain the functional distribution of income. Existing evidence from Guerriero and Sen (2012) suggests that human capital, proxied by the number of years in schooling, increases labor income share only in OECD economies, while it does not seem to be a significant factor for the developing ones. Another factor, which might account for the recent decline in labor’s share of output, is the deterioration of labor’s bargaining power compared to capital. For example, Guschanski and Özlem (2018), in addition to the role of technological change, consider workers’ bargaining power and globalization. The globalization argument suggests that the bargaining power of employees is thwarted by higher real and financial integration with the world. Focusing on the role of trade openness, the empirical evidence on this matter is mixed. There is, for instance, cross-country empirical evidence that trade openness is associated with lower labor income share (Harrison 2005; Dünhaupt 2017). Nevertheless, Guerriero and Sen (2012) in their cross-country study using data from 89 countries find a positive relationship between trade openness and labor share, especially for developing countries. An extant literature also focuses on the impact of financial globalization on labor income shares. Elsby et al. (2013), for example, identify offshoring to be the most reliable explanation for the reported decline in the US labor income share. The literature employs several proxies for a country’s degree of financial integration. Furceri and Loungani (2018) use a de jure measure of capital account openness, Jayadev (2007) constructs an index measuring capital account openness, Stockhammer (2017) uses the total amount of foreign assets and liabilities as a percentage of GDP, and Guerriero and Sen (2012) use the FDI inflows. Regardless of the measure employed, these studies show that financial globalization reduces the amount of income accruing to labor. Finally, unionization and labor market institutions are also confounding factors that might influence the bargaining power of labor and, thus, its share of income. Elsby et al. (2013) claim that the impact of unions on the labor share is ambiguous; however, there is empirical evidence suggesting otherwise. Fichtenbaum (2009) finds that union density is positively related to the labor income share in the US manufacturing industry. Stockhammer (2017), focusing on OECD economies, obtains a similar positive relationship. Earlier studies on the determinants of labor income share also consider the effects of the size of government spending as a percentage of GDP. Stockhammer (2017) interprets this variable as a measure of welfare state, while Harrison (2005) and Jayadev (2007) treat it as a control for the importance of the government in the economy. An emerging consensus is that government spending tends to have a positive impact on labor share. Lawrence (2015) uses data from the US manufacturing, mining and IT sectors to develop an alternative explanation for the decline in labor income share. His analysis suggests that the decreasing labor share in the USA is not due to the relative slower growth in wages. Instead, it is due to a combination of insufficient capital formation and labor-augmenting technology which leads to lower effective capital/labor ratios. This increase in the supply of “effective labor,” in turn, under gross complementarity between labor and capital in the sectors under consideration leads to lower labor shares. This paper probes further into this literature that attempts to identify empirically the drivers of labor income shares focusing on the role of investment. We consider several of the control variables used in the most recent literature on the determination of labor income share, including workers’ bargaining power and globalization. In addition, we consider the impact on labor shares of variables measuring a country’s capital formation and R&D expenses. Moreover, we do not only investigate the link between capital formation and labor income share covering more recent data, but also we seek to identify the magnitude of this relationship for varying levels of countries’ income and economic freedom. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The subsequent section describes the empirical methods and specifications employed, the variables and data sources. Section 3 presents and discusses the estimation results, and, finally, Sect. 4 concludes.",3

Huw Edwards,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"When an Empire breaks up, its legacy does not disappear overnight. In the last century, over 200 countries gained independence from their colonizers—especially after World War II. For example, when Algeria gained its independence in 1962, trade with its former colonial master (France) was around 80% of its total and after 30 years this fell to 6%. Similar patterns were observed throughout the other similar post-colonial relations. This is because colonialism diverts trade away from ‘natural’ trading partners to colonies/colonizers, but after independence, a former colony (as well as colonizer) will begin to build new economic linkages with countries outside its former colonial relationships. As a result, a post-colonial country like Algeria reduces its economic relations with the metropole (ex-colonizer) in favor of more ‘optimal’ trade partners and, consequently, the colony’s trade gradually begins to decline with its ex-colonizer. Nevertheless, the reorientation can be slow or sudden, depending partly upon the nature of the colonial breakup. Gravity analysis of trade patterns shows that trade between the former colonizer and colonies typically remains raised for decades after independence: for example, in 2004, France continued to account for 24% of Cote d’Ivoire’s exports. Trade with former colonial siblings also retains importance: for example, Ghana’s principal export destination is South Africa. These factors decline over time: sometimes rapidly, if independence leads to a nationalist backlash against the former colonist, but more typically, gradually. In this context, we wish to explore a recent post-colonial experience—namely of the post-Soviet republics, and particularly those who re-joined to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and its associates, which we term ‘CIS+’. Table 1 in the next subsection provides a listing of countries in our study and their memberships of various groupings in the Soviet and post-Soviet eras. Note that we are using the term ‘CIS+’ because we are including Ukraine, in particular, which left the CIS recently, as well as Turkmenistan, which is not formally a member.Footnote 1 Prior to 1991–92, these were all bound together in a tightly integrated system, which was de facto dominated by (Soviet-) Russia, which we can perhaps view as ‘Big Brother’ of the post-Soviet republics. Russia remains by far the largest and most powerful member of the CIS+ club. Consequently, we choose to divide the CIS+ group into two: we term Russia the ‘metropole’ and all other ‘CIS+’ republics as ‘siblings’ to each other as they belong to the same former colonial group. We argue this is a valid distinction due to the dominance of Russia within the former Soviet Union (which did, after all, originate in the pre-1917 Russian Empire), and we use this division of the CIS+ into metropole and CIS+ siblings—‘SIB’—in much of our analysis below. Soviet-era integration was very tight, especially given the lack of freedom to trade outside the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). By contrast, pursuit of standardization and scale economies within the USSR led to integration of enterprises and distribution systems, under the control of Moscow-based ministries, the direction of transport infrastructure, strict control over external trade (semi-autarky for the USSR) and the spread of Russian-speakers as a diaspora across the republics, all of which integrated the republics tightly. In the post-Soviet period, and particularly since the economic stabilization after 2000, Russia has continued to seek close hegemonic ties, particularly with the relatively isolated and slower-reforming autocracies of Central AsiaFootnote 2 in the form of a revival of a fledgling Eurasian Economic Union—formed by treaty in 2014, successor of the Eurasian Custom Union launched in 2011, whose current membership is Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan—as a more authoritarian rival to the European Union. There are obvious limitations to data comparisons between the Soviet and post-Soviet eras. Nevertheless, the early breakup was very marked. Djankov and Freund (2002a, b) document that in 1990 all Soviet republics apart from Russia sent more than 80% of their exports to other Soviet republics,Footnote 3 while by 1996 most republics had undergone a significant realignment. This early breakup was clearly a major disruption, but for reasons of data continuity (pre-1991 trading prices were clearly distorted within the Soviet system, while after 1991 there were several years of hyperinflation), we prefer to focus our study on the period after this, from 1995. Looking at the former Soviet republics other than Russia, the share of trade with other ex-Soviet republics in this early breakup period was quite variable, with the Baltic States, whose breakup with the Soviet Union was hostile, among those seeing the sharpest falls, but also Tajikistan, Armenia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan. Moldova and Belarus, perhaps for geo-political but also economic reasons, continued their alignment with the other former Soviet republics. Our study focuses on the period subsequent to this. We acknowledge difficulties in deriving consistent data between the pre-1995 and post-1995 periods and focus on the latter. Most notably, during the post-1995 period, unlike the earlier period, trade started recovering sharply between former Soviet republics. For example, trade between the Central Asian former Soviet republics and Russia (the metropole), during the 1995–2014 period increased almost 11-fold from its post-Soviet nadir (from 2.1 to 23 billion U.S. dollars) and ex-Soviet republics’ shares in each other’s total bilateral trade actually increased.Footnote 4 The more Western republics have perhaps not moved as sharply back toward Russia—indeed, the Baltic States, Georgia, Moldova and, latterly, Ukraine, have begun orienting toward Europe—but the resumption of former Soviet trade ties is still apparent. This compares to the steadier decline in post-colonial ties indicated by Head, Mayer and Ries’ (HMR 2010) classic study, which examined the effect of independence on post-colonial trade of over 220 countries (including post-Soviets) between 1948 and 2006. Their work suggests that typically trade between a colony and its metropole (colonizer) erodes by 65% after 40 years passes since independence of the colony. Hence our paper starts by analyzing whether the sharp recovery in trade volumes between ex-Soviet countries since 1995 reflects a return to old ties, perhaps driven by policies (such as the various Free Trade Agreements, leading toward the institution of the recent Eurasian Economic Union), or whether the primary driver of recovery is simply the recovery of GDP, given stabilization and a recovery of oil prices after 1998. We review this below, although a first answer is that it is more of the second (recovery of output) than the first. We do, however, investigate these issues more thoroughly in the rest of the paper. In particular, we develop and modify the gravity analysis of post-colonial ties developed by HMR (2010), to analyze post-Soviet relationships. In doing this, we find considerable heterogeneity between the post-Soviet republics. In this paper, we aim to strike a balance between acknowledging this heterogeneity, on the one hand, and seeking evidence of common trends, on the lines of other studies of post-colonial trade, on the other. We particularly favor the idea that ‘clubs’ of countries closer to Russia and further from it (politically and economically, rather than geographically) may help us understand the developments in the region. In the rest of this section, we analyze the stylized facts of trade flows between the former Soviet republics. In Sect. 2, we discuss a basic gravity framework, following from HMR (2010), while in Sect. 3 we then start interpreting this in terms of potential factors which might influence post-colonial persistence in the former Soviet case. Sections 4 and 5 outline the data and discuss results, while Sect. 6 concludes. The Soviet Union (USSR) was formally dissolved on December 26, 1991, ending a 70-year experiment in centrally planned integration between and within the republics. Table 1 lists all the countries in our study—these include 12 out of the 15 former members of the USSR.Footnote 5 The breakup was with varying degrees of hostility: in the first instance (de facto prior to the formal Soviet breakup), the three Baltic States (which had been occupied by Stalin after the Second World War) broke more or less completely with Russia (Rajasalu 1995), leading to the immediate imposition of sizeable trade barriers. These states never returned to any post-Soviet club, and eventually joined the European Union. Other states formed the relatively loose Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), as listed in Table 1. This failed to prevent some conflicts between states, notably with the ‘metropole’ of the former Soviet Union (Russia), and eventually Georgia and recently Ukraine left the CIS. Despite the attempts to maintain economic ties, the demise of planning links, imposition of different currencies and regulatory regimes and general economic turbulence led to huge drops in trade between the republics. For example, an early study by Djankov and Freund (2002a, b) compared the share of trade of former USSR states before and after the USSR collapse in 1991–92, showing that between 1990 and 1996 the internal trade among ex-USSR states declined by about 40%, with largest drops in Estonia (65%)—which left the CIS and had trade barriers imposed—and Armenia (53%), which had a conflict with Azerbaijan, and the smallest drops in Belarus (9%) and Moldova (20%). For Russia the share of inter-republican trade declined from 65 to 23%. Another study by Sinitsina (2012) reported a tenfold decline in internal trade between Central Asian republics and Russia during the first decade after the Soviet breakup. None of the former Soviet republics was a member of the WTO at its inception in 1995. Crucially, Russia only gained full membership in 2012, Ukraine in 2008 and Kazakhstan in 2015. Azerbaijan, Belarus and Uzbekistan still have observer status (or in Belarus’ case, ‘strategic focus’), while Turkmenistan has no WTO ties at all. An implication of this is that these countries generally took into the twenty-first century to liberalize trade, and some have yet to do so to the WTO’s satisfaction. It is worth noting that, in the period after 2000, attempts were gradually made to reestablish economic integration within the former Soviet area (and this is one of the topics in this paper): however, a number of countries chose not to participate—not just the EU-joining Baltic States, but also Georgia, which left the CIS in 2008 after a Russian invasion in support of rebels, and Ukraine, which chose a pro-EU path after the fall of Viktor Yanukovych, and eventually left the CIS in 2018, four years after the Russian takeover of Crimea. Nevertheless, for those countries choosing to return to a Russian-linked sphere, integration included the development of a formal CIS Free Trade Area from 2012, and, for just four countries on our list (plus Armenia), the more tightly integrated Eurasian Economic Union from 2015, which bills itself as an integrated single market of 180 million people. The decline in post-Soviet trade following 1991 can be interpreted in comparison with other colonial breakups, as emphasized in the HMR (2010) findings of post-colonial trade erosion in colony-metropole trade relations. As a key benchmark for post-colonial trade erosion, HMR (2010) utilized a sophisticated, time-varying adaptation of Anderson and van Wincoop’s (AvW 2003) multilateral trade resistances, and found that a country’s trade with the colonizer, typically, erodes by 65% after 40 years of independence. While the ex-Soviet republics were not formally colonies of Russia during the era of the USSR, Russia was at least informally dominant. Thus, we can view the relationship of the CIS and Russia as a highly specific application of the HMR (2010) study of post-colonial ties, albeit we prefer to talk of the ‘metropole’ (Russia) and ‘siblings’ (‘SIB,’ i.e., the rest of CIS+ excluding Russia). Defining ‘CIS+’ as slightly broader than the Commonwealth of Independent States (as listed in Table 1), still including Ukraine plus associate member Turkmenistan, changes in trade patterns between CIS+ countries in the post-Soviet period are presented in Fig. 1. The first line (the blue line) is the siblings’ (CIS+ other than Russia) exports (X) to Russia (RUS) divided by the same countries’ export to Germany (DEU)Footnote 6, i.e., (\(X_{RUS}/X_{DEU}\)). By taking trade ratios, we are avoiding possible misinterpretation of actual trade changes which could happen if we only look at value changes in exports and imports. The second line (the red line) is CIS+ siblings’ exports (X) to other CIS+ siblings (i.e., other than Russia) divided by their export to Germany (DEU), i.e., (\(X_{SIB}/X_{DEU}\)). However, in interpreting these trade patterns, we need to compare this with the relative GDPs of Russia to Germany (the dotted line): this ratio started rising (along with the oil price) from 1998 on, and the average export ratio gradually approaches the GDP ratio (while still exceeding it) over the whole period. Figure 1 shows that export flows from the CIS+ siblings to Russia were declining in the first decade as expected but then they have been restored in the second decade. We also observe that the GDP ratio was rising during 2000s which might explain part of the trade persistence with the Big Brother. Changes in exports among the siblings look similar to those with Russia, strongly reflecting the GDP ratio changes.  Source: Authors’ calculations using trade data from WITS database CIS+ Sibling States’ export flows to Russia and to the other siblings, compared to those to Germany. Separately, we construct the ratios for incoming trade flows in Fig. 2. The first line (the blue line) is CIS+ siblings’ (‘SIB’) imports (M) from Russia (RUS) divided by their imports from Germany (DEU), i.e., (\(M_{RUS}/M_{DEU}\)) and the second line (the red line) is CIS+ siblings’ imports (M) from the other siblings (SIB) divided by their imports from Germany (DEU), i.e., (\(M_{SIB}/M_{DEU}\)). Unlike Fig. 1 for exports, Fig. 2 shows that the average import from Russia compared to imports from Germany remains remarkably flat, after an initial uplift in 1996. The import ratio for siblings’ trade almost mirrors the former import ratio, especially in the first part, showing a sudden decline in 1996, then flat until 2007, with a ‘U-shaped’ dip, most likely caused by the financial crisis of 2008, followed by a renewed increase.  Source: Authors’ calculations using trade data from WITS database CIS+ Sibling States’ import flows from Russia and from other Siblings, compared to those from Germany. One question is whether, in fact, we are looking at post-colonial trade persistence which contradicts the HMR (2010) general findings.Footnote 7 To obtain the trade ratios we use the same bilateral trade data set obtained from World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS). An important caveat here is that we cannot derive the ratios for the initial (1991–94) trade collapse between the regions, due to a lack of good data.Footnote 8 Note that this is not inconsistent with observations of the even sharper trade realignment of the Baltic States (Rajasalu 1995), though in those cases the fall was even more acute, due to trade sanctions in response to their decision to leave the Soviet Union and not to enter the CIS. Indeed, both the Russian and CIS+ economies endured huge trade and production hardships with the Soviet collapse and subsequent hyperinflation in 1991–95. In fact, the disruption of what had been integrated supply chains by managerial independence, the introduction of border controls and initial currency convertibility issues, is often cited as a major cause of the collapse of output across the former Soviet Union in this period (see, for example, Linn 2004). In order to examine changes in the relative orientation of trade presented in Figs. 1 and 2, it is useful to look at trade ratios of each individual CIS+ sibling member with Russia. These are shown in the two parts of Fig. 5 in ‘Appendix.’ Most CIS+ countries share similar trade patterns to those shown in Figures 1 and 2; however, there is some heterogeneity. Some CIS+ countries (Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan) had above average export ratios toward Russia, while the oil exporters such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan had reoriented their exports toward the rest of the World (non-USSR). Country-level import ratios suggest that only Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan (which are isolated from Europe) and Belarus (which clung faithfully to Soviet standards) were above average in terms of relative import share from Russia, while Ukraine and Moldova had joined Lithuania in shifting imports toward Germany.",3

Ekeocha,Jonathan E. Ogbuabor,Anthony Orji,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Economic research on infrastructural development has witnessed increased interest from scholars in recent times, and some have expressed support for the symmetric impact of infrastructure on economic growth (Levoli et al. 2019; Nugraha et al. 2020). Consequently, policymakers and governments in various economies, especially in Africa, have recognized that there is need for them to evolve and implement policies that will increase investments in basic infrastructures as a means of enhancing economic performance on a sustainable basis. Unfortunately, Africa’s share of developed infrastructures has remained dismal compared to other regions of the world. For instance, just as in other African countries, most schools in Kenya have very low investments in information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, and this has been attributed to high costs in the procurement protocols (Bariu 2020). One main feature of the extant literature is that most studies have hardly focussed on the disaggregated indices of infrastructural development, such as transportation and ICT infrastructure indices. Some of the existing studies (such as Hussain et al. 2019, which studied Asian countries; Bottasso et al. 2018, which studied Brazil; and Baita 2020, which studied Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS; Pereira and Pereira 2020, which studied Portugal) centred on the role that aggregate infrastructure plays in delivering improved trade. Pereira and Pereira (2020) specifically found a positive and significant impact of infrastructure development on both traded and non-traded industries. Nazneen et al. (2019) found symmetry between China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) infrastructural development and perceived tourism cost. The study demonstrated that people are more likely to support tourism even in prevailing higher costs. Castelnovo et al. (2018) examined the economic impact of the procurement events of the Large Hadron Collider (i.e. largest scale research infrastructure) using balance-sheet data of supply companies. The study found significant symmetry between procurement and company research and development, knowledge creation and economic performance. Clearly, the extant literature has hardly classified infrastructures as hard infrastructures (like transport and telecommunications) and soft infrastructures (like financial infrastructures and border-transport efficiency) so that the impacts of these disaggregated forms of infrastructure can be highlighted. Some aspects of the extant literature have also focussed on the role of infrastructure in advancing growth. Some of such studies have found evidence in support of symmetric effect of infrastructure on growth (Sama and Afuge 2016 studied in Cameroon; Amos and Jidda 2018 studied Nigeria; Samir and Mefteh 2020 studied a panel of 63 countries). Studies that investigated South Asia and Indonesia have also established symmetric infrastructure–growth relationship as well as mutual causal feedbacks (Sahoo and Dash 2012; Khan et al. 2020; Kurniesih 2020). Wang et al. (2020b) also found that improved efficiency of urban infrastructures in Chinese cities lead to improved economic growth, while Heshmati and Rashidghalam (2020) found significant positive correlations between urban infrastructure and urbanization in China. Lin and Chen (2020) used a panel tobit model to show that land transport infrastructure, technological progress and industrial structure have positive and significant influence on China’s manufacturing industry. In spite of the important roles of infrastructure in advancing trade, tourism and growth as shown in the foregoing paragraphs, some studies in the extant literature have also demonstrated that the role of infrastructure as a driver of economic performance is largely muted. Luiz (2010) evinced this in Africa, while Enilolobo and Sodeinde (2019) showed it in Nigeria’s industrial sector. These studies argued that even though infrastructure is necessary, it is not a sufficient condition for economic development. Zolfaghari et al. (2020) investigated the effects of economic (water, energy and ICT) and social (health and education) infrastructures on income inequality in Iranian provinces, and found that improvements in economic and social infrastructures reduce income inequality. However, the new financial commitments to African infrastructure in 2018 totalled USD 101 billion (Organisation for Economic Corporation and Development–ECD, 2021). The origin of these new commitments was: 37% African governments; 26% China; 22% Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA) members; 12% private sector and 2% Arab Co-ordination Group. Compared to 2017, the new commitments in 2018 increased by approximately 12%, mostly from higher financing by African governments and the inclusion of some sub-national financing, along with a major increase in new commitments from Chinese sources, which rose from USD 19 billion in 2017 to USD 26 billion in 2018, including a USD 5.8 billion commitment to a 3.5 GW hydro complex in Nigeria which will take 6 years to complete. The sectoral distribution of total new commitments in 2018 was 44% energy, 33% transport, 13% water, 7% ICT and 4% multisector (ICA 2019). The following stylized facts can be observed from the foregoing discussions. The first fact is that there is mixed evidence in the extant literature on the role of infrastructure as a key driver of economic performance. The second fact is that there is paucity of studies in the extant literature on the infrastructure–growth nexus in Africa, especially studies that centred on the roles of infrastructure at disaggregated level. Studies that focus only on aggregate infrastructural index do not allow for proper targeting of economic policies. The third fact is that the few studies in Africa are mainly country-specific investigations. This shows that a large scope still needs to be covered towards understanding the effects of infrastructure at aggregate and disaggregated levels on economic performance in Africa. To fill this gap, this study investigated the dynamic effects of aggregate and disaggregated infrastructural development indices (such as transport, electricity, ICT, and water and sanitation infrastructure indices) on economic performance of Africa. The system GMM estimator is used to achieve this objective.",5

An empirical evidence from Indian states,May 2022,Amit Nandan,Hrushikesh Mallick,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Tracing the historical roots of the Indian economy, which currently features in the league of lower–middle-income developing economies, a dramatic transition is evident, from over three decades of slow growth (famously called as the “Hindu rate of growth”) after independence till its emergence as one of the fastest-growing economies post the 1990s.Footnote 1 The latter phase is mainly associated with the pursuit of liberalization measures in 1991, which were implemented against the backdrop of an external economic crisis in the early 1990s. The major macroeconomic policies undertaken in that period had far-reaching impact in terms of safeguarding the economy from various turbulences including the South-East Asian Financial Crisis of 1997–1998 and the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2010—and helping it chart out its course toward one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. However, in recent years, the economy has been growing at a slower pace and is yet to join the league of upper-middle per capita income countries such as China, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa. Furthermore, given its recent slow pace of growth that is also inflicted with the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic since the beginning of 2020 has complicated matters. The recent slowdown of the Indian economy can be attributed both to the global economic slowdown and the slump in domestic industrial investment demand, a key driving force behind the success of major industrial economies today. Notwithstanding India’s remarkable success in ameliorating the high poverty ratio and achieving robust economic growth performance during the post-liberalization period, the rising income inequality has posed a more serious and intense challenge for macroeconomic policymaking since 2000. India has emerged as a highly unequal society compared with its Asian neighbors such as China. The inequality has persisted because of the substantial increase in the unemployment rates of both educated and uneducated labor forces, slow upward social mobility, lack of work opportunities and freedom of choice for women to participate in various economic activities and decision-making process. Besides, the lack of social security and government welfare programs for the elderly and women, all indicate toward the structural rigidities and institutional weaknesses in the system. In this context, this study makes a valuable contribution to the literature by examining the effects of fiscal policies and quality of governance on the economic growth of Indian states in the post-liberalization period. The findings offer significant policy insights across various social and economic dimensions for promoting social welfare. Additionally, in line with the endogenous growth framework this study endogenizes the effects of institutional quality and human capital formation as key factors, which can play critical role in driving the higher economic growth of Indian states. We further examine whether any of the growth-promoting factors can induce higher inequality in income distribution across the sub-federations in India (Chancel and Piketty, 2019; Hai-Anh and  Lanjouw, 2018).Footnote 2 For an understanding of factors leading to economic growth in various regions, the seminal contribution of Solow(1956), which constitutes the very foundation of the development of the neoclassical growth model, is at the forefront of public policy discussions. Solow (1956)’s analysis demonstrated that the long-run growth of an economy depends on exogenous factors such as technological progress and population growth. The growing literature in the late 1980s and early 1990s countered the central tenets of Solow and supported the intrinsic ideas embedded in endogenous growth theory. The critique further advocated that growth is an endogenous outcome of an economic system(Romer 1994). The long-run growth of an economy is driven by the actions of forward-moving and profit-oriented agents who invest in the creation and accumulation of knowledge, which in turn generates positive spillovers or externalities for other economic agents(Romer 1986). Further, Lucas (1988), while highlighting the importance of physical capital in achieving higher growth, simultaneously emphasized the contribution of human capital in economic growth. He defined human capital as, “the ways an individual devotes his time in comparison to other activities in the current period, which affects her/his productivity in the future periods”. Thus, individuals who devote their time to academia and learning various skills, rather than joining the labor force in the current period, may benefit society in the future through higher productivity. This newly formed human capital has positive externalities that lead to the productivity growth of other individuals, and therefore, to long-run economic growth. Barro (1990) adopted an endogenous growth framework while assessing the role of public expenditure policy in his growth model, concluding that there were components of public expenditure that contribute to the long-run growth of an economy by augmenting private sector investment, known as productive public expenditure. Factors such as human capital formation and knowledge creation in the form of research and innovation are widely acknowledged as essential components of a knowledge economy with international and internal migration dynamics that lead to external resources in the form of remittances and greater investment productivity; these help achieve greater competitiveness and comprise productive public expenditures that generate long-run economic growth.Footnote 3 With a view to refine the existing ideas and advance new theories, some later economists additionally accredited the significant role of institutions as a determinant of cross-country long-run growth. They explored how institutions affect the decisions of economic agents, and whether differences in economic growth can be explained by differences in institutional quality across economies (North 1986). Institutional economists should investigate the implications of rules or norms on the enforcement of property rights and contracts, and their analyses should be based on political process models (North, 1986). Acemoglu et al. (2005) believed that political institutions and resource distribution affect economic outcomes through economic institutions. Political institutions include the form of government, constraints on political leaders, other power-holding elite groups and the demarcation of power among different organs of the government, whereas economic institutions mainly include property rights and contract enforcement. Political institutions shape political incentives and separation of powers, whereas economic institutions and policy enforcement affect economic outcomes through incentive mechanisms and by improving the consistency in decision-making processes of various economic actors (North 1991; Acemoglu et al. 2005).Footnote 4 Besely and Ghatak (2010) emphasized four principal channels whereby secure property right produces better economic outcomes and thereby promotes the efficiency in a market-based economy.Footnote 5 Besides property rights, contract enforcement is also an important part of the economic institution that supports a flourishing market economy. Market-based production requires a developed capital market to finance fixed investment in equipment and tools, trained labor, a developed transportation system, and a market for inputs and outputs. A robust contract enforcement system seamlessly coordinates and decreases the costs associated with economic transactions. The decrease in costs associated with transactions helps economic agents realize the benefits of mutual cooperation, despite their physical distance. A specific region may have an informal contract enforcement mechanism that facilitates transactions among economic agents; however, the costs due to informality can exceed their benefits. Banerjee (2001) documented the informal money-lending system in India, wherein the contracts between borrowers and lenders are enforced through an informal system. Because of high associated transaction costs, the rates of interest charged on loans are exorbitant and that act as a deterrent for the poor availing the loans. Even they receive the amount in the current period, it imposes substantial future obligations on them. Given that there exist extensive contributions to the growth literature on many dimensions, this study examines the effects of enforcement of property rights as an important economic institution, along with incorporating four sub-components of developmental public expenditure, private investment and the role of human capital on the economic growth of Indian states in a dynamic panel framework from 1991 to 2017.Footnote 6 Furthermore, this study goes a step further by investigating a much-debated issue based on the pioneering Kuznets curve hypothesis, which suggests that the relationship between per capita income and inequality follows an inverted-U-shaped curve. Many researchers such as Kar and Sakthivel (2007), Nayyar (2008), and Kumar and Subramanian (2012) have observed that income inequality has been widening among the Indian states with the adoption of market-based reforms since the early 1990s. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to analyze the factors affecting income inequality in the present context, because persistent growth in income disparities can lead to political instability, thereby endangering the liberal democratic ethos of the country. Ahluwalia (2000) argued that the continued growth of interstate income inequality among Indian states can be one of the main reasons contributing to the growth of future political uncertainty and instability in India. Mounk (2018) noted that the growth of income inequality in a country is one of the main factors leading to political instability and threatening liberal democracy. This study is the first to examine the issue of growth-promoting income inequality-inducing factors in a dynamic multivariate regression framework for a developing economy or even for a region. Given the worsening interstate income inequality in India, we examine whether growth-impacting variables based on our growth model estimation (measured in per capita gross domestic product (GDP) can explain interstate income disparity during the same period. Thus, this study makes a twofold contributions. First, it examines the factors affecting per capita income growth. Second, it explores whether our model’s growth-influencing factors also explain the interstate income differences across major Indian states. To empirically examine these two objectives, we use pooled mean group (PMG) econometric method for estimation of a standard growth model along the line as envisaged by the endogenous growth theory which is specified later and then we use an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) time-series model for the estimation of income inequality model as a suitable econometric estimation strategy. The next section discusses the existing relevant empirical literature on those two dimensions with a special emphasis on India, to glean broad insights about the key factors influencing economic growth and inequality over time. This would also reflect on the factors which so far have been recognized to be influencing India’s economic growth and income inequality.",2

It initiated the debate in scientific literature as well as national and international economic policy, including the European Union (e.g., European Commission 2011). The successive crises contribute to the deteriorating situation of the youngest participants of the labor market. At the macroeconomic level, failing to integrate the young generation implies a loss of production, productivity and probably also innovation potential (Berlingieri et al. 2014). The situation of young people depends strongly on the processes of globalization, the supply of jobs, qualifications and, obviously, periods of economic prosperity. The ongoing transformation processes and socioeconomic changes result in the need to monitor this problem and refresh the relevant knowledge on a continuous basis. The purpose of this paper is to assess the situation of young women and men on the domestic labor markets in the context of macroeconomic and structural determinants of national economies. The study analyses 28 EU countries, including the UK. The analysis period covers the years 2008–2018, for which statistical data were available at the time of conducting the research. The study uses the data available in the EUROSTAT database, which ensured their comparability between countries as well as high quality of statistical information. The econometric methods dedicated to panel data were used to characterize relations between the determinants of domestic markets and the situation of young people. It allowed for including the country-specific unobservable effects in the conducted analysis. When assessing the situation of population on the national labor markets, the macro-solutions influencing a given labor market should be taken into account. The economic and macroeconomic situation expressed through the values of the most important economic parameters shapes the basic conditions for the population functioning on the labor market. In addition, cultural, demographic, political or institutional factors, as well as active and passive labor market policy instruments should be considered along with the extent of skills, job mismatch and spatial mismatches (Bal-Domańska and Sobczak 2018). Additionally, the situation of each person will depend on their individual predispositions, skills and education. As (Marelli et al. 2013) states, the effect of various macro-factors on youth unemployment is greater than the effect on overall unemployment and the significance between the results for youth and total unemployment rate differs. Current debates, addressing the employment policy, frequently include gender-specific factors such as human capital accumulation, medical advances, gender-biased technical change, cultural change and antidiscrimination interventions, which imply a rise in the female intensity across the whole economic structure (Ngai and Petrongolo 2017). The presented analysis also relates the problem under consideration to the situation of young women and men. The presented study is organized as follows. Section 1 provides an introduction into the discussed problem. Section 2 presents the theoretical approach to youth unemployment and the factors determining the position of young women and men on domestic labor markets. Section 3 describes the proposed procedure and research questions, while Sect. 4 addresses YUN (youth unemployment rate), the defined phenomena (factors) used in the analysis, as well as the scope and sources of statistical data. Section 5 outlines the applied statistical approach, while Sect. 6 presents and discusses econometric models being the subject of the essential analysis covering the situation of youth on the domestic labor markets in the EU-28. Section 7 describes the empirical results. The study is concluded with a discussion and an outlook of the current research.",3

Jijin,Alok Kumar Mishra,M. Nithin,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Remittances have emerged as a significant contributor to the development of many emerging economies over the last few decades. Remittances are fundamentally a transfer of money as payment or gift from emigrants to their families or other individuals in their home country. It primarily represents “household income from foreign economies, arising mainly from the temporary or permanent movement of people to those economies” (IMF 2009). The remittances are the second-largest foreign currency source in the world economy, and it forms a significant part of the Balance of Payment (BoP) account in most developing countries. In several emerging economies, remittances exceed the value of total export as well as the capital flows such as a Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and Official Development Assistance (ODA) [World Bank, 2018]. In 2019, total global remittances exceeded $700 billion. The share of Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) constitutes around $550 billion (World Bank 2021), nearly three times the foreign aid inflows. The World Bank (2021) reports that the remittances to LMICs declined by 1.6 percent in 2020 owing to the Covid-19 crisis. However, the decline in remittances is far lower than the decline in FDI inflows (11%, World Bank 2021). Further, this fall is lesser than the decline recorded during the global financial crisis in 2009. It signifies the resilient behaviour of remittances during a crisis. The only other instance of a drop in remittances in recent history was during 2015–2016 when the remittances to LMICs plummeted by 1.3%. It may be due to the weakening of the US dollar and the financial tightening of host countries resulting from the oil price crash. At the same time, the employment opportunities for Indian migrants were also limited by the stringent nationalisation policies of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, especially Saudi Arabia (World Bank 2018,2021). Given the expected global economic recovery from the pandemic, World Bank (2021) projects the rebound of remittances to $553 billion (an increase of 2.6%) to the developing countries in 2021. In the literature, it is well recognised that a stable flow of remittances undoubtedly has a substantial role in developing countries. Based on a quantitative survey of the literature, Cazachevici et al. (2020) find that the mean effect of remittances on economic growth is positive but economically small. Remittances are a catalyst for financial sector development, through its significant contribution to the credit market development and the outreach of financial services (Giuliano and Ruiz-Arranz 2009; Aggarwal et al. 2011; Cooray 2012; Anzoategui et al. 2014; Fromentin 2017; Bangake and Eggoh 2020). In low- and middle-income countries, remittances have a positive long-run impact on both household credit and firm credit (Fromentin and Leon 2019). It also mitigates growth volatility, especially in countries with high financial development status (Chami et al. 2008; Ahamada and Coulibaly 2011). Many studies also observe the capacity of remittances in both physical and human capital accumulation, and poverty and inequality reduction, as it directly impacts income distribution (Imai et al. 2014; Jouini 2015; Bang et al. 2016; Akobeng 2016; Ahmed et al. 2018; Akter 2018). The welfare gains are high when the internal distribution of remittances is skewed towards entrepreneurs (Bahadir et al. 2018). However, few studies argue that the remittances-growth effect is country-specific, where institutional and development factors and cultural idiosyncrasies have a profound role in determining the outcome of remittances (Kadozi 2019; Piteli et al. 2019). Since India is the largest remittances receiver, one cannot undermine the significance of remittances in its development process. Several macroeconomic studies reveal that remittances contribute to India’s current account deficit by financing a large part of the balance of the trade deficit. Moreover, remittances have positive implications for the overall output growth through their direct utilisation for consumption and investment (Gupta 2006; Pande 2018; Singh and Hari 2011; Noushad et al. 2020). However, little attention has been paid to explore the macroeconomic determinants of remittances in the Indian context. Understanding the key factors affecting remittances at the macro-level may help design policies to ensure uninterrupted inflow. Therefore, the study contributes to the literature by identifying the macroeconomic determinants of migrants’ transfers to India. To this end, we use the ARDL bound testing approach [following Pesaran and Shin (1995) and Pesaran et al. (2001)] to identify the presence of a long-run equilibrium relationship. The key findings of the study suggest that exchange rate, oil price, and domestic GDP have a substantial impact on India’s inward remittances. The study also finds that pure altruism does not dominate the underlying motive for remittances to India. Moreover, the inflows are found to be procyclical. Remittances have a long-run equilibrium association with the exchange rate, oil price, and domestic GDP, and any shock to these variables quickly converges to the long-run path. The Indian migrants (mostly in gulf countries) are more vulnerable to the oil price shocks. Therefore, we suggest that the policies be framed to protect the vulnerable migrants from the relentless external economic shocks. Providing them with investment opportunities in their country of origin may ensure a stable inflow of remittances. Also, protective policies are the need of the hour against the backdrop of the Covid-19 crisis. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The trajectory of remittances to India is briefly outlined in section two. The third section briefly explores the current literature on the macroeconomic determinants of remittances. The fourth section describes the data used and the methodology employed to discover the link between remittances and macroeconomic variables in the Indian context. The fifth section presents the empirical results and discussion, followed by a conclusion in the sixth section.",4

Another impact of these wars and protectionist trade policies is that trade policy-related uncertainties (henceforth, TPU), scaled by the TPU index, have drastically increased. For instance, these indexes in the U.S and Japan, as our sample countries of this study, have increased by 1153% and 290%, respectively, between August 2016–2019 (Census 2020). In this context, firstly, we seek the answer to a crucial question as to whether the changes in the TPU indexes impact Japan’s bilateral trade balance with its top partner, namely the U.S. which totaled at $219 billion in two ways in 2019 (Census 2020). If so, secondly, as to whether this impact on this balance is symmetric (linear) or asymmetric (nonlinear). The answer to this question technically will require a decomposition process of the TPU index as \({TPU}^{+}\) and \({TPU}^{-},\) which corresponds to increases ( +) and decreases (-) in this index. Detailed technical instruction about symmetry, asymmetry, and the decomposition process will be explained in the empirical methodology section. It should be noted that this study does not specifically test the impacts of increasing TPU indexes related to US-China trade policy tension in 2018 and U.S withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017, but, rather, it tests this in a longer period 1996M1-2021M5, which, of course, includes these two significant years. To constructFootnote 1 the TPU index, leading national newspapers’ coverages are used. Some predetermined words which may correspond to the uncertainties in trade policies are scanned-counted and scaled using a weighting process. These words include the following: trade treaty, trade agreement, tariffs, trade policy, uncertainty, policy, economy, central banks, monetary policies, etc. US and Japan’s TPU indexes were created by Caldara et al. (2020) and Arbatli et al. (2019), respectively. Some such main newspapers scanned are Yomiuri, Asahi, Mainichi and Nikkei for Japan and USA Today, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New York Times for the U.S. The construction methodology for the TPU index consists of the following steps: (1): Scanning the (aforementioned) words in the newspapers; (2): Getting raw word counts; (3): Scaling the raw word count by the counts of all words; (4): Standardizing each newspaper’s series of scaled TPU word counts; (5): Taking a monthly newspaper average to get the TPU index; (6): Multiplicatively normalizing the TPU index to 100. It should be noted that the TPU index, as a categorical version of the EPUFootnote 2 (economic policy uncertainty) index by Baker et al. (2016), also gives references to trade policy uncertainties with additional scanned words in trade policy literature. Therefore, we can speculate that changes-shocks in trade flows related to trade policy uncertainties can be better/more thoroughly explained by the TPU index rather than by the EPU index. Hence, the TPU index seems to be a unique independent variable in trade models as compared to the EPU index. The rest of this study is structured as follows: Sects. 2 provides a literature review, and Sect. 3 explains and provides the empirical methodology and data set. Section 4 provides empirical findings, and Sect. 5 presents the conclusion.",1

Turkey is an exemplary laboratory for studying inflation dynamics. Unlike advanced countries, the inflation rate in Turkey is quite volatile and got through several phases: chronic and acute inflation, implicit and explicit inflation-targeting regimes. In the 1990s, Turkey experienced very high inflation rates, as shown in Fig. 1. After uncontrollable inflation, thanks to successful policies and determined policymakers, Turkey entered a low and stable inflation period in the early 2000s. Since the adoption of explicit inflation targeting, while inflation was still high and notably volatile by international standards, it was not as wild as before. However, in 2017, this relatively favorable outlook has changed dramatically, and inflation has turned into well above the double-digit figure, which warrants policymakers once again. The conventional wisdom of monetary policy suggests the tightening of the policy rate in response to a rise in inflation. Opposing the mainstream theory, the President of Turkey stated that ""...low interest rates deliver low inflation"" in an investors meeting in London in May 2018. Accordingly, the Turkish government overestimates the cost channel component of inflation, and since then, they have been bashing the monetary policymakers for interest rate hikes.  In this paper, we aim to enlighten the ongoing conflict between policymakers and the political authority on the conduct of monetary policy. To do so, we derive an augmented Phillips equation that includes the cost channel of monetary transmission, economic activity, and open economy elements by synthesizing the narrative background of Turkey with macroeconomic theory. Among others, Ravenna and Walsh (2006); Chowdhury et al. (2006); Tillman (2009) study the structural dynamics of inflation in a context in which firms face cash-in-advance constraints, and the cost of working capital is a function of the policy rate. Therefore, the interest rate enters the firm’s effective marginal cost function, which leads to an increase in inflation as a direct impact of an interest rate hike, which is called the cost channel. Many empirical studies estimate the effect of the interest rate on marginal costs in developed countries and conclude that the cost channel is quantitatively important, and the strength varies across countries and over time.Footnote 1 Yet the studies on emerging economies, especially for Turkey, are very limited. Kara et al. (2017) estimate a reduced-form time-varying parameter backward-looking Phillips relation for Turkey with exchange rate dynamics, import prices, output gap, and real unit wages for the period 2006–2016. The findings of the paper emphasize the significance of the exchange rate pass-through during the analyzed period for Turkey without considering the cost channel. With a similar specification for the Phillips relation, Ozmen and Sarıkaya (2014) studies the sensitivity of consumer inflation to credit by estimating a Phillips curve for subgroups of consumer prices in Turkey. We contribute to the literature investigating the empirical relevance of the cost channel in inflation dynamics for a small open economy in the context of a New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC). To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first paper exploring the empirical relevance of the cost channel on inflation dynamics in Turkey. We first derive an open economy NKPC with unit labor cost, interest rate, and import price dynamics. Next, we estimate the augmented Phillips equation by the generalized method of moments. We find that the cost channel-augmented Phillips equation is a pertinent description of short-run inflation dynamics in Turkey. The main result is robust under different inflation measures: GDP deflator, producer price inflation (PPI), and consumer price inflation (CPI). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theory. In Sect. 3, we provide facts about inflation and drivers of inflation. In Sect. 4, we analyze our findings and discuss the perspective of the illusion it generates. Section 5 concludes.",4

Up-to-date, the research on market efficiency during the coronavirus pandemic has been dominated by enquires into equity markets (Frezza et al, 2021; Vasileiou (2021); Vasileiou et al. 2021; Okorie and Lin, 2021, Wang and Wang, 2021), cryptocurrency markets (Mnif, 2020; Naeem et al., 2021; Goodell and Goute, 2021) and more recently on currency markets (Aslam et al., 2020; Gunay, 2021; Umar and Gubareva, 2020; Xu and Lien, 2021; Yameni, 2021; Li et al., 2021; Narayan, 2020; Narayan et al., 2020; Iyke, 2020; Feng et al, 2021). Investigating market efficiency in exchange rates during the pandemic is important since currencies are the most traded asset in financial markets and are vulnerable to speculative attacks which could threaten the stability of the entire financial system. Moreover, currency markets are financial institutions which are more vulnerable to market crash since, unlike equity markets, currency exchanges do not have ‘circuit breakers’ mechanisms as indicators of market despair, such as those which were triggered in US stock markets and other international exchanges in mid-March 2020 (Ozkan, 2021). Examining market efficiency in currency exchanges in emerging markets during the COVID-19 pandemic is of particular interest, considering that currencies in emerging economies have been historically prone to speculative attacks and crises (Pazarbasioglu and Otker, 1997). Our study examines informational efficiency of currency markets in BRICS economies as the most advanced emerging economies over the last few decades (Xu and Lien, 2021). We consider the BRICS countries an interesting case study since these economies mutually experienced unprecedented increases in capital outflows during the pandemic as investors shifted large amounts of capital from emerging markets to safe-haven assets (Beirne et al., 2020). This, in turn, led to significant distortions in the BRICS currency markets requiring Central Banks to make direct and indirect interventions in currency markets. Recent literature further identifies a number of COVID-related events such as the announcements of lockdowns, travel bans, government interventions (Narayan et al, 2021; Goodell, 2020), the geopolitical oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia (Jefferson, 2020) as well as the recent rollout of vaccines (Rouatbi et al., 2021) which have had significant impacts on global financial markets. Some other literature further finds spillover effects from the stock exchanges and oil markets into currency markets in developing countries (Narayan et al., 2020). Our study treats the coronavirus pandemic as a natural experiment to test the informational efficiency in currency markets, that is, we question whether public information from the coronavirus health statistics can be used to predict movements in exchange rate returns and offer market participants the opportunity to beat the market through speculative behaviour. Whilst acknowledging the existence of recent literature which has examined the efficiency of international currency markets during the pandemic (Aslam et al., 2020; Umar and Gubareva, 2020; Narayan, 2020; Iyke, 2020) as well as the literature for individual BRICS countries (Gunay, 2021; Li et al., 2021) or the entire BRICS group (Xu and Lien, 2021), this current study differs from the previous literature in two ways. Firstly, this study uses a longer time series than those used in previous studies. As far as we are concerned only the more recent studies of Xu and Lien (2021) and Li et al. (2021) use data which covers the 2021 period whilst the remaining studies cover periods extending to as far as November 2020. Therefore, most previous studies fail to account for recent events such as the announcement of second lockdowns in December 2020, the announcement of discovery of alpha and beta variants of the COVID virus, the US presidential elections, the capitol riots in January 2021, the rollout of vaccines as well as the more recent announcement of delta variant in April 2021. Furthermore, we point out that the more recent studies of Xu and Lien (2021) covers a period up to April 2021 and May 2021, respectively, these sample periods do not cover more recent events such as the Kabul airport bombings following the Taliban’s hostile takeover of the Afghanistan government, which have had adverse effects on financial markets. This current study uses more extensive data coverage from 3rd February 2020 to 31st August 2021 for empirical purposes. Secondly, we methodologically differ from previous studies by making use of continuous wavelet transforms to examine the lead-lag co-movement between global COVID-19 statistics and exchange rate returns in BRICS countries across time and frequency domains. The use of wavelet coherence tools allows us to examine the changing strength and duration of the co-movements between the variables in a time-varying fashion hence accommodating the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) of Lo (2004) which advocates for financial markets evolving as a switching process between market efficiency and inefficiency. Evidence of AMH has been previously found for currency returns in developing economies (Katusiime et al., 2015), emerging economies (Al-Khazali et al., 2011) and advanced economies (Neely et al., 2007; Charles et al., 2012) albeit these studies using rolling regression windows to capture time-variation in the series. Not only do wavelets endogenously model time-variation in market efficiency, but they simultaneously allow us to examine market efficiency at different cyclical frequencies which we treat as being analogous to capturing nonlinearities and asymmetries in exchange rate returns such as those recently modelled by Yang et al. (2019) and Han et al. (2020). Our study presents a fresh empirical perspective on market efficiency in currency markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. In our preliminary analysis, we use time-domain techniques to investigate of random walk and martingale process existing in BRICS currency series whilst in our main empirical analysis we use continuous wavelet transforms to examine semi-strong-form market efficiency in a time–frequency domain. Our findings produce evidence of changing informational market efficiency during the pandemic with currency markets being more informational efficient subsequent to government interventions in financial markets as well as the recent roll out of mass vaccination programmes. All-in-all, our study has important implications for academics, market participants and policymakers. The rest of the study is presented as follows. The next section presents our literature review. The third section outlines our methods. The fourth section presents the data, empirical analysis and discussion of the results. The fifth section concludes the study.",2

Ogbonna,Jonathan E. Ogbuabor,Davidmac O. Ekeocha,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow is a fundamental contributor to the economic growth of many developing countries. This is because nations that are plagued by scarcity of capital and technological expertise are most likely to face slower growth rate than those that have abundance of capital and technological expertise (Asiedu 2006). Thus, FDI inflow is envisaged as a vital channel to bridge the capital and technological gap, especially in third world economies with low capital formation (Dunning and Hamdani, 1997). The transmission channel of operation is through technological diffusion that improves the production base of the host country, thereby enhancing income generation and employment (Anyanwu 2011). FDI inflow also fosters sectoral growth through diversification and expansion of the production capacities of recipient countries, thereby increasing the volume and quality of exports (Gerschewski 2013; World Bank 2017). Due to the significant roles of FDI inflow in stimulating growth and development, the extant literature has paid much attention to the determining factors of FDI inflows across regions (see for example, Anyanwu 2011; Abbott et al. 2012; Blonigen and Piger 2014; Kasasbeh et al. 2018). In recent years, economic researchers have focused on the effect of economic policy uncertainty as one of the key determinants of FDI inflows. The debate has been that the gains from FDI inflow may not materialize in an environment characterized by uncertainty, which is typical of most African economies (Zhu et al. 2019; Avom et al. 2020). The huge sunk cost associated with FDI makes a foreign investor hesitant to take investment decision unless the business has mild level of uncertainty and risk to its capital and personnel (Aziz 2018). Keynes (1936) opines that investment demand is highly sensitive to the perception of future events and thus, undesirable perception on future events will retard investments demand. According to the investment report of UNCTAD (2017), the low level of recovery of global FDI flows after 2% decline in 2016 is associated with global uncertainty following global commodity price shock. The rationale is that the investment decisions of companies depend on the level of uncertainty, and that at the period of high uncertainty, firms prefer to postpone investment decisions, which ultimately impede investment rate (Bloom 2009). Therefore, countries or regions of the world with high levels of uncertainty are likely to experience low levels of FDI inflow. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the recent fall in global commodity prices have not only heightened uncertainty on the continent but have also put enormous pressure on the already declining FDI inflows to Africa. FDI inflows to the continent declined by 10% to $45.3 billion in 2019 relative to 2018 (see Figs. 2 and 3 in the Appendix). The uncertainty occasioned by the pandemic has also led to the suspension of major projects on the continent (UNCTAD 2020). This is evidenced by 62% decline in value and number of Greenfield project declarations in the first quarter of 2020 and 72% decline in cross-border mergers and acquisitions from their 2019 monthly average. In fact, UNCTAD forecasts a decline of 25% to 40% in FDI inflows to Africa in 2020, with a more decline expected in 2021 (UNCTAD 2020). Indeed, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a typical reflection of the growing importance of world factors in driving uncertainty globally.Footnote 1 Incidentally, Ahir et al., (2018) had documented that the heightened level of uncertainty in Africa in the past decade is quite greater than the level experienced in the Middle East and Central Asia. Despite several decades of economic reforms and arrangements to facilitate FDI inflow in Africa, the region not only receives the least FDI inflow relative to other regions of the world but also ranks as the least of investors’ preferences according to UNCTAD (Buchanan et al. 2012). Such economic reform efforts include the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (Adams 2009; AUC 2018), the Structural Adjustment Programmes (Ayadi et al. 2014; Cleeve 2012), among others. According to UNCTAD (2017) statistics, after a steady increase in FDI inflows to African economies as share of total world FDI inflows for almost a decade, it fell from a peak of 4% in 2008 to 3% in 2010 following the 2007–2009 Global Financial Crisis. Within the same periods, developing Asia economies received FDI inflows of 25% of total world inflows in 2008 and it rose to 30% in 2010. Similar experience occurred during the global commodity price shock in 2016, when the proportion of FDI inflows to Africa to global developing economies dropped to 5.9% in 2017 from 7.8% in 2015. Clearly, developing economies in Africa have not fared well in terms of FDI inflows compared to their Asian counterparts, especially during period of high uncertainty occasioned by one economic crisis or the other (see Table 4 and Fig. 1 in the Appendix). The pertinent question becomes: why are African economies attracting lesser FDI inflowsFootnote 2? To answer this question, it is important to understand how FDI inflow to Africa is responding to global uncertainty, and whether economic governance institutions on the continent reduce or heighten the effect of global uncertainty on FDI inflow to Africa. This is particularly relevant to policy formulation on the continent given the ongoing global pandemic cum global commodity price shock. The variation in FDI inflows across countries in the presence of global uncertainty is deemed to reflect differences in economic governance institutions. This is particularly so because recent trend has shown that the conventional determinants of FDI inflow as embodied in the eclectic paradigm of Dunning (1977) do not completely explain Africa’s experience, and as such attention has shifted toward the role of governance institutions (Asiedu 2006; Kasasbeh et al. 2018). Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) contend that economic policy, value system, culture, or geography do not guarantee success or failure of economies, rather success or failure of economies is conditional upon their institutions. Therefore, this study is motivated to investigate the moderating effect of economic governance institutions in the uncertainty-FDI relationship in Africa due to the fact that most African economies are known to have extractive institutions that are exploitative in nature (Acemoglu andRobinson 2010), and these institutions may be lacking the will to mitigate uncertainty and support foreign investment on the continent (Cleeve 2012). According to North (1990), healthy governance institutions have the capacity to create conducive environment and engender investors’ confidence by ensuring that property rights are protected and that the rule of law is enforced. Besides, sound governance institutions uphold ownership-specific benefits like patents and trademarks while ensuring that corruption does not get a foothold in the economy. According to Bartlett et al. (2013), foreign-owned firms are mostly attracted to countries with sound economic governance institutions, but the bureaucratic bottlenecks, bribery, and rent-seeking behaviors that characterize most African economies engender distrust among foreign investors, and thus deter investments on the continent (Ndulu et al. 2008). According to World Bank’s World governance Indicators, Africa is ranked as the region with poorest economic governance institutions as illustrated in Table 5 in the Appendix. Consequently, this study seeks to: (i) ascertain the impacts of global uncertainty and economic governance institutions on FDI inflow to Africa; (ii) establish the moderating effect of economic governance institutions on the global uncertainty-FDI relationship in Africa; and (iii) determine other significant drivers of FDI inflow to Africa. The contributions of this study to the literature are twofold. First, the effect of uncertainty on FDI inflow can be examined in several ways. Existing studies mainly concentrated on the effect of domestic uncertainties on foreign investment decision. Sources of domestic uncertainties considered by such studies include terrorism (Bezić et al. 2016), exchange rate (Asamoah et al. 2016; Eregha 2019), political crises (Gulen and Ion 2016; Bonaime et al. 2018), among others. This means that the extant literature is somewhat biased against the effect of global uncertainty on foreign investment decision, notwithstanding that many uncertainty inducing events have occurred across the globe, particularly in the last decade (Al-Thaqeb and Algharabali 2019). Due to global connectedness, shocks originating from one part of the world that heighten uncertainty will surely have spillover effect in other parts of the world, and foreign investors usually consider such spillover effect before making investment decision (Cheng 2017; Carrière-Swallow and Céspedes 2013; Colombo 2013). Thus, this paper contributes to the extant literature by analyzing the effect of world uncertainty on FDI inflow in Africa. This is important because a rise in world uncertainty is usually associated with potential changes in foreign investment decisions such that foreign investors could adopt a wait-and-see behavior considering the long-term commitment associated with foreign investments that are usually costly to reverse. Second, although few studies (e.g., Avom et al. 2020; Ho and Gan 2021) have investigated the effect of global uncertainty on FDI, this study is quite relevant because the extant literature has largely neglected how economic governance institutions could moderate the uncertainty-FDI relationship. Even though it has been shown that uncertainty could exert negative influence on FDI inflow (e.g., Avom et al. 2020), it has also been revealed that quality institutions attract FDI inflows (Busse and Hefeker 2007; Aziz 2018). What remains unclear, particularly in Africa, is how economic governance institutions moderate the effect of global uncertainty on FDI inflows. In fact, revealing how economic governance institutions interact with global uncertainty to influence FDI inflows in Africa will significantly enrich the robustness of the existing evidence about uncertainty-FDI nexus in Africa, thereby providing information to aid evidence-based policies on the continent. This is an important contribution because macroeconomic risk management alone as advocated by earlier studies may not be sufficient to drive FDI inflow unless other fundamental factors such as economic governance institutions are taken into the consideration.",10

It plays a vital role in supporting and guaranteeing economic development and social progress. However, for many years, China's transportation infrastructure has lagged behind the requirements of economic development. The government has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure facilities while adhering to the principle of moderate advancement. In particular, the government has attached great importance to planning and investment in the high-speed rail (HSR) industry. In 2004, 2008, and 2016, the State Railway Administration of China promulgated the Medium- and Long-term Railway Network Plan. In 2016, the westernmost section of the Shanghai–Kunming high-speed railway—the Guizhou–Yunnan section—realized the ""Yunnan-Guizhou"" hand in hand, and the entire Shanghai–Kunming high-speed railway line was completed. At this moment, China's high-speed ""four vertical and four horizontal"" rail transportation network was accomplished (Jiang et al. 2017). In 2019, the Outline for the Construction of a Strong Transportation CountryFootnote 1 stated that China should, as soon as possible, actively guide and collaborate in the development of fast intercity railroads, fast trunk railroads, urban (suburban) fast railroads, and urban rail transit networks, and promote the construction of an international urban cluster rail transit network with two integrations. Data show that by the end of 2020, China's high-speed railroad operating mileage has reached 146,300 km, including 38,000 km of high-speed railroads.Footnote 2 Railroad construction has made historic achievements and played an important supporting role for economic and social development. The Chinese government attaches great importance to the investment, planning, and construction of high-speed railroads. Accelerating their construction is an important means to solve the fundamental dilemma of China's backward transportation infrastructure and an essential link in the process of China's high-quality economic development. Fiscal policy is one of the core tools of national macro-control. The Central Economic Conference in December 2019 emphasized once and for all the critical role of fiscal policy in keeping the economy running smoothly.Footnote 3 Therefore, the investment and construction of high-speed railroads are inseparable from the strong support of fiscal policy. Fiscal policy plays a crucial role in promoting green economic development. On the one hand, the government can increase fiscal expenditures on environmental protection and green infrastructure investment, reducing the challenges of green investment and thus improving the efficiency of green credit allocation (Wei and Cao 2019). On the other hand, the government can collect environmental taxes through taxation policies and create tax incentives and other means to guide the flow of capital, talent, and technology to the low-carbon economy through the competitive mechanism of the market (Chu 2018; Zheng 2017), thus promoting the green and low-carbon development of the economy. Therefore, achieving a green economic recovery in the post-COVID-19 era requires the active role of the government. However, the implementation of China's fiscal policy is currently under severe pressure. Specifically, the debt problem accumulated from the ""4 trillion"" fiscal stimulus plan introduced in response to the global economic crisis has made subsequent funding challenging to obtain. At the same time, China is in a critical period—economic growth is shifting from high speed to high quality (Kong et al. 2021a, b; Zhang et al. 2017a, b, c, 2021; Zhang and Xue 2020), and an active fiscal policy is needed to escort economic growth (Zhang et al. 2020). The pressure of debt and transformation has made ""do not waste a penny""Footnote 4 one of the principles for the Chinese government's rational and efficient use of fiscal funds. Consequently, can the use of monetary funds in the form of investments in transportation infrastructure construction result in a win–win situation for economic growth and environmental protection? Is it conducive to promoting industrial transformation and green development? Further, will the changing external environment, such as economic policy uncertainty and marketization, reduce the efficiency of such funds and ultimately hamper the effectiveness of fiscal policy implementation? How do regions at different development levels plan their fiscal approach toward high-speed rail construction? At present, high-speed railroad projects financed by government investment are on the fast track. Based on the perspective of green infrastructure construction, this paper explores the impact effect of fiscal policy on high-speed railway investment and construction through a theoretical explanation and empirical analysis. It uses the 2013 ""Opinions of the State Council on Reforming the Railway Investment and Financing System to Accelerate Railway Construction"" as the node of fiscal policy implementation to discern the effect of fiscal policy on investment in high-speed rail construction. At the same time, this paper evaluates the economic and environmental effects of investments in high-speed rail construction to provide targeted policy recommendations on how developing countries can plan for green infrastructure development. Judging the economic benefits of high-speed railroads is of great concern for academics. Compared with existing studies, the contributions of this paper are mainly in the following two aspects. First, most existing studies on investment in HSR construction have focused on industrial clustering (Deng et al. 2017; Fritsch et al. 2011), economic growth (Ahlfeldt et al. 2018; Jia et al. 2017; Liu and Li 2017), and the shaping of spatial layout (Wang and Ni 2016; Zhang et al. 2018). Although a few scholars have also started to pay attention to the investment and financing of high-speed railway construction, most are concerned with the economic benefits of investment in high-speed railway construction (Han et al. 2012; Jiang et al. 2017). From the perspective of the effectiveness of fiscal policy implementation, this paper empirically examines the impact of fiscal policy on investment in high-speed railway construction, as represented by the 2013 ""State Council Opinions on Reforming the Railway Investment and Financing System to Speed Up Railway Construction."" This approach enriches the research related to the investment and construction of green transportation infrastructure. Moreover, this paper introduces economic policy uncertainty, degree of marketization, urban characteristics, and geographic location in an attempt to analyze how external environmental characteristics affect the relationship between fiscal policy and investment in HSR construction to target policy recommendations for planning green infrastructure development in developing countries. Second, the existing literature is inconclusive about the relationship between investment in HSR construction and economic growth, and significantly less attention has been paid to the economic performance of investments in HSR construction. The investment in and construction of high-speed rail in China have been questioned in many ways, including the economic efficiency of high-speed rail projects, debt risk issues, and safety issues (Nash 2015; Wu et al. 2014; Zhuang and Hou 2012). Based on the relationship between fiscal policy and HSR construction investment, this paper analyzes the dual economic and environmental impacts of HSR construction investment in terms of long-term and short-term effects. It is found that the investment in high-speed railway construction directly contributes to the improvement of urban productivity, the expansion of investment scale, and the upgrading of industrial sector. In terms of environmental effects, investing in HSR construction contributes to the long-term suppression of urban pollutant emissions, thus promoting urban eco-efficiency. This finding can help developing countries better understand the ""appropriateness"" of transportation infrastructure investment and rationally plan the investment scale and construction of inter-regional high-speed rail lines. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 outlines the theoretical analysis and provides the research hypotheses to be tested in the following empirical analysis; Sect. 3 constructs an econometric model to explain the data sources and variable measurements; Sect. 4 empirically analyzes the relationship between fiscal policy implementation and investment in high-speed rail construction; Sect. 5 discusses the economic and environmental effects brought about by investment in high-speed rail construction; Sect. 6 sorts out the research findings and makes policy recommendations.",7

How to achieve maximum levels of welfare and improve competitiveness and economic growth have been the topics of a large body of political and scientific research. Analyzing economic growth and its determinants is important for all economies and especially less developed countries and is critical in times of economic crisis such as those triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, we need to pay attention to the importance of efficiency to achieve growth, and the productivity of internal activities such as innovation and job creation which are fundamental for achieving competitive advantage to promote sectoral growth and market dominance. In this context, we need to focus on the factors which influence value-added growth such as gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), trade openness and the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to understand the national economic reality and formulate strategies to enable future economic development. The role of trade openness in stimulating economic development has been the topic of research since at least the 1950s (Huchet-Bourdon et al. 2018). Carnevali et al. (2020) highlight the work of economists such as Smith, Kalecki, Kaldor, Ricardo and Thirwall among others, which emphasizes that trade between the countries allows intensification of production levels and increased income. Similarly, Toader et al. (2018) highlight the importance of international trade, both export and import, to facilitate economic expansion. Likewise, Zaman et al. (2021) consider that trade openness and GFCF are significant in terms of identifying the level of income derived from exports and the capital outflows related to imports. They evaluate national trade competitiveness at the international level. The theoretical and empirical literature emphasizes the increasingly major role played by technological innovation particularly ICTs which are considered general purpose technologies (GPTs), for improving sectoral productivity and accelerating economic growth. Innovative ICTs are considered radical innovations. Their introduction as GPTs has brought several technological and organizational changes in a wide range of activities (Antonelli 2017). According to Mickoleit et al. (2009), the diffusion of ICT throughout the economy is providing opportunities for productivity improvements by firms, and public and social institutions and the development of new products and services which are boosting multifactor productivity. This points to the importance of up-to-date knowledge on the effects of those factors that can lead to economic growth and development. The present work analyzes the impact of these factors in the context of the Tunisian economy based on three input Cobb–Douglas production functions, to understand Tunisian economic growth and the elasticities of its components. This study makes at least two contributions to the specialized literature on the impacts of ICTs on economic growth. First, it extends it by decomposing new OECD input–output data to construct an ICT diffusion index and uses the dynamic common correlated effects modeling technique for panel data proposed initially by Chudik et al. (2016) and developed further by Ditzen (2018) to perform the sectoral analysis. Second, our use of cross-sectoral data in the context of Tunisia is quite rare. Section 2 introduces the theoretical framework and discusses the relevant literature. Section 3 presents the data and the analyzed variables and describes the empirical methodology. Section 4 presents the results and draws some conclusions.",9

A period of high economic growth has emerged under the impetus of the globalized economy, especially since China became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. However, behind this unprecedented growth trend is the factor-input type of ‘sloppy growth’. This process has brought about many hidden dangers, including the depletion of local resources, economic inefficiency, increased environmental pollution, economic structural imbalance, and unbalanced economic development, among others (Chen and Chen 2018; Zhang 2021). As China’s economy moves into a ‘new normal’, the past high-input, high-consumption resource-input-based approach to economic growth is no longer sustainable. The internal and external conditions that supported past economic growth have changed, and China’s economic development requires a change to its approach to growth (Zhao and Ge 2019; Zhang and Kong 2022). High-quality development has become the main feature of contemporary China’s society and economy. It can be said that the relationship and focus between the quantity of economic growth and the quality of economic growth have begun to change, and the quality of economic growth has become a critical factor in determining economic development (Zhang 2022). At the same time, in a stage during which the quantity of economic growth in China is rapidly increasing, differences in the level of economic development between different regions are subsequently expanding due to differences in natural endowments, policy tilts, etc. There is obvious heterogeneity in both the quality of economic development and the growth rate, with both factors being higher in the eastern regions and lower in the western regions (Su and Guo 2021; Kong et al. 2021b; Wong et al. 2021a). Therefore, reducing regional disparity cannot be ignored when encouraging high-quality economic growth. The spatial correlation of regional economic growth indicates that the economic growth process of a region is closely related to the regions surrounding it. Spatial proximity, spatial accessibility, and knowledge spillover between regions are important mechanisms for convergence in economic growth clubs (Bin et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2020). The relationship between the urbanization process and the quality of economic growth is extremely close, and urban economic growth is a highly important component of China’s economic growth (Kong et al. 2021a; Zhang et al. 2021). China has also entered into a phase of rapid urbanization. According to statistics, China’s urbanization rate has increased by 50 percentage points from 1949 to the present and has exceeded 60% in 2019.Footnote 1 As the core space and important carrier of regional economic development, the economic growth of China's cities is closely linked to the nation’s overall socioeconomic growth. It can be said that cities bear the burden of economic development, and urban economic growth is an important component of China’s economic growth (Jiang and Yang 2020; Kong et al. 2021c; Wong et al. 2021b). Improvements in the quality of China’s economic growth must therefore be specifically reflected in the quality of economic growth in cities. This begs the question, how can the quality of urban economic growth be understood? How can it be measured? Furthermore, how has the quality of China’s urban economic growth evolved over time? What kind of spatial dependence and heterogeneity do territorial units have at the microscopic scale? What development trends are likely to emerge in the future? And considering that the agglomeration economy is the source and driver of urban expansion and economic growth (Sun et al. 2015), what will the trend of urban economic growth influenced by the agglomeration economy be? This paper intends to answer these questions by taking the following three approaches. First, this paper takes 284 Chinese cities of prefecture level and above as research objects and measures the quality of urban economic growth in these cities in four dimensions: economic growth dynamics, structure, mode, and outcome. On this basis, we attempt to generalize their spatial and temporal evolution characteristics to determine the spatial convergence trend of economic growth quality in Chinese cities. The results of this study can help to clarify the future trend of urban economic development quality and to objectively understand the source of the gap in China’s urban economic development quality; this study can also help to deepen understanding of the current situation of regional economies and provide a reference for future urban economic development quality. Second, this study will identify the key factors affecting the spatial convergence of urban economic growth quality and their degrees of influence. Since this paper takes cities as the object of investigation, and considering that urban economic growth has distinctive spatial aggregation characteristics compared with traditional economic growth, it is necessary to focus on distinguishing urban economic growth from traditional economic growth in the study of urban economic growth quality. Since 1978, spatial shift and agglomeration of industries have occurred in China, and widening regional economic disparity in China is closely related to this phenomenon. Especially after 1995, industrial agglomeration has become the dominant factor affecting regional disparity and industrial structure (Geo 2020). Therefore, the second problem that this paper aims to solve is the identification of whether the effect of agglomeration economy on the spatial convergence of urban economic growth quality is a result of specialized agglomeration or diversified agglomeration. Third, the balanced development of regional economic growth is a key concern of government macro-control, and fiscal policy plays an active role in coordinating the balanced development of regional economies. The reasonable selection and application of fiscal policy tools can effectively optimize the supply structure, transform growth dynamics, and promote the synergistic development of heterogeneous regional spaces (Bian et al. 2019; Zhang and Yang 2021). Therefore, this paper further introduces fiscal policy tools, which can be used to analyze the factors influencing the spatial convergence of urban economic growth quality, and examines the changes in impact brought about by changes in the scale of fiscal expenditure. The study’s results are used to analyze the relationship and path of influence between the regional economic growth gap, the spatial convergence trend, and fiscal policy tools in China in order to provide reliable empirical evidence for policy makers.",4

Examples here might be the concentration of bank lending in the energy sector in Texas and Oklahoma in the 1980s; as well as over-exposure to the construction and development sector in Sweden in the early 1990s, and in Spain and Ireland in 2000. The materialisation of concentration risk during the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 was in turn a source of huge losses for European and global banks that left them weakened economically, financially, and as regards operational security. Such circumstances ensure the huge importance from a macroprudential point of view of concentration risk being measured. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will hit home just as soon as we see restriction of the emergency measures that governments, central banks and regulators across Europe have introduced. That said, it is reasonable to expect that banks struggling currently with declining interest margins and low profitability, among other things, will prove to be most affected by the crisis, where there is marked concentration in sectors more affected by the pandemic, i.e. hospitality, transport and some manufacturing sub-sectors; as well as in those other sectors already characterised by a high level of non-performing loans on account of COVID. The pandemic may emerge as concentrating bank exposures to the domestic government sector to an excessive degree. This is to say nothing of Poland’s energy transformation, with its requirement for a very considerable amount of investment (given costs at the level of 1.6 trillion PLN estimated for 2021–2040. The risk that banks’ credit portfolios will be affected by concentration mainly arises out of over-exposure to a single entity or related entities (name concentration), or out of over-exposure to a given economic sector or related sectors (sector concentration) (see Heitfield et al., 2005). Currently, supervisors interested in banks operating in a stable and safe way recognise the importance of appropriate management of sector concentration risk. The Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS 2010) has presented its broad and comprehensive definition of concentration risk, which is said to relate mainly to lending activities, and not only to risk associated with loans granted to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers, but also to other major exposures of related assets or liabilities ensuring that disturbances in certain markets or sectors of the economy are able to threaten institutional stability. Concentration risk has not been taken full account of in Pillar I of the New Capital Accord, given that, where credit risk is concerned, the IRB approach assumes perfect diversification of portfolios. As the Asymptotic Single Risk Factor (hereafter ASRF) model assumes that the relationship between individual exposures is explained by one systematic risk factor (see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 2006), it does not provide for concentration risk being measured. Accordingly, concentration risk is assessed under Pillar-2 principles (see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 2019). Any resulting underestimation of credit risk ought to be corrected for concentration risk. A supervisory authority anyway expects financial institutions to hold sufficient capital to cover all types of risk, including concentration risk. Recommendation C developed by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority is a collection of good practices regarding concentration-risk management (see Polish Financial Supervision Authority 2016). It takes account of provisions of Polish law, in particular the Banking Law Act of August 29, 1997, and the provisions of the CRR Regulation. Recommendation C enshrines a comprehensive and forward-looking approach to concentration-risk management in banks, with the latter regarded as an element essential if operations are to be stable and safe. It is in fact divided into six parts, including the identification, measurement or estimation of concentration risk, tools supporting the process whereby that is managed; approaches to prevention and reduction; and monitoring plus reporting. That said, the regulations and guidelines published by both foreign and Polish supervisory authorities offer little guidance on how to measure sector concentration risk accurately, and how to take account of it as capital requirements for credit risk are calculated. This matter has in fact been taken up repeatedly in studies by many economists, who have applied various models and methodologies as they seek to estimate the impact of sector concentration risk on amounts of economic capital. The literature distinguishes two types of method by which to measure sectoral concentration risk, i.e. the heuristic (otherwise “ad hoc”) and the multi-factor (see Gupton et al. 1997; Gordy 2003; Bluhm et al. 2003) 2003). Heuristic methods are most helpful in the determination of limits and concentration ratios, even as they fail to take account of dependence between individual business sectors where credit risk is concerned; or to provide information on the economic capital needed to hedge against concentration risk. The multi-factor models are the more interesting of the two kinds, given possibilities for solutions more varied than with, for example, the ASRF model. Conceptually, they are underpinned by the existence of dependent relationships (nonzero correlations) between the values of borrowers’ assets belonging to different portfolios. Impacts of the market factor on this value may vary in strength, depending on the sector of the economy to which a given entity belongs. Certain sectors may prove more sensitive to changes in the business cycle. Moreover, there may be other factors of importance beyond the differential impacts the same market factor is able to exert on the value of borrowers’ assets. Some may have an independent effect on those assets, depending on whether they belong to the sector. The work underpinning this article has sought to track the evolution of tail risk in banks’ NPL portfolios, as present under normal and worst-case conditions (i.e. before and during the pandemic); and to estimate the impact of sector concentration risk on the amount of economic capital. Analysis of the different sectors with a view to identifying the riskiest one was a further possibility arising out of the work. Sectoral concentration equates to a lack of sectoral diversification of the loan portfolio. The risk of excessive concentration in a given sector materialises where there is a deteriorating situation in a sector of the economy to which a bank has a high level of exposure. The study of that issue forming the basis of this paper has deployed a simulation-based Multi-Factor Model to estimate the loss distribution of non-financial enterprises of commercial banks in Poland, in line with the effect on each sector of a differentiated systematic risk factor, and with the effect that assets of borrowers belonging to the same sector will correlate strongly with each other, even as that correlation will be limited for different sectors. This work has basically entailed further development of the methodology proposed by Düllmann and Masschelein in 2006—in the direction of improved accuracy of economic-capital estimates, thanks to alternate means of mapping the sectoral factor correlation matrix. Results are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of sectoral concentration of lending activities of individual banks on risk level; and may be used in both the running of stress tests, and the formulation of supervisory recommendations by Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority. This paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, scientists engaged in credit-risk modelling have worked on specific elements thereof, such as probability of default, recovery rates, and default correlations. Moreover, research mainly focuses on analytically feasible models, through an assumption of independence or Gaussian processes, and with a view to mathematical expressions in closed form being obtained. This limits flexibility, as well as the applicability of the model to the actual behavior of risk factors. There is a need to consider all realities in credit portfolios, in order to model credit risk, not only by considering appropriate models for each risk factor, but also by ensuring that account is taken of their empirical interactions and individual characteristics, especially in periods of economic recession, e.g. due to COVID-19. Secondly, the existing literature does not contain precise descriptions of the measurement of sectoral concentration, hence this article’s contribution to that body of literature. The article describes the methodology pursued. Thirdly, there is verification as to whether a difference can be noted between the designated Economic Capital (hereafter EC) on the basis of the Basel Guidelines, and the analytical model or use of Monte Carlo simulations. This objective seems quite important, especially now that the proper use of risk-management models, on capital markets in particular, is looking to be a matter of crucial importance. Fourth, the research is carried out using a unique database, which includes data on bank exposures to non-financial sector enterprises, corporate Probability of Default (hereafter PD) and model Loss Given Default (hereafter LGD) estimates (based on historical data). Fifth, as the work implements simulation-based Multi-Factor Models, the risk of default is not synchronised across sectors, and the degree of exposure to shocks varies from one to another. As the flexible nature of the simulation-based methods allows for assessment of the evolution of concentration over time, this can prove helpful as micro- and macroprudential authorities seek to detect sectoral risks in individual banks, and in the banking system in general. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. The next two sections present the related literature in more detail. Section 4 presents the methodology, and Sect. 5 the data, while Sect. 6 presents and discusses the empirical results, as well as concluding the paper in its final part.",2

We assume that an efficient portfolio provides the best-expected return on a given level of risk that the investor is willing to take. The first quantitative treatment of the trade-off between profit and risk refers to Harry Markowitz (1952), pioneering Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), where the probabilistic formalization of ""return"" and ""risk"" concepts were introduced. The main problem of the Markowitz model is the assumption of linear dependence between asset returns. In practice, estimation errors of the expected returns and the covariance matrix of these returns might significantly affect the asset allocations. A small change in the estimates may lead to a drastic change in portfolio weights. Moreover, during the past two decades, researchers have come to an agreement on several stylized facts about financial markets, i.e., heavy tails in asset return distributions, volatility clustering, etc. (Cont. 2001; Mantegna et al. 2000). Therefore, the application of the classical Markowitz theory with the assumption of the normality of the logarithmic return distribution might lead to significant drawdown during nonstable periods of the economy. Several approaches e.g., Bayesian framework, higher moments, robust portfolio optimization, tail risk optimization, and weight constraints have been developed to alleviate the effects of estimation error. A major novelty of this paper is that the suggested copula-based Black-Litterman portfolio’s performance is compared against the copula-CVaR portfolio performance since they share a common part of multidimensional distribution modeling and avoid excessive corner solutions that many optimization approaches would generate in case of extreme values of parameters’ estimates. Moreover, to further control sensitivity to input parameters we evaluate the performances of optimization strategies at three levels of weight constraints (30%, 40%, and 50%). Weights constraints are often encountered in practice and can be inherent to the internal investing fund policy or set by regulators in the case of bank-based markets. Moreover, instead of setting the level of confidence exogenously as usually done in other papers (Beach and Orlov 2007; Sahamkhadam et al. 2022), we test a range of τ values, as the level of confidence may significantly affect the obtained results and inferences. The confidence in estimates determines the extent to which the model will deviate from the equilibrium weightings. We also support our results with the classical mean–variance and equally weighted optimization results as benchmarks. In addition, we provide the tail risk measures, maximum drawdown for 1 day and 3 months, portfolio turnover, and the break-even transaction cost of all optimization approaches. In Sect. 2 we present a literature review, notations, and definitions. The data we use are briefly discussed in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we describe the methodology. Section 5 summarizes the empirical results of the analyses, while Sect. 6 concludes and provides suggestions for future research.",1

Climate change—an alarming global phenomenon, has inflicted considerable damage to environment worldwide. With the global threat due to climate change looming large, last few years have witnessed numerous initiatives undertaken to promote environmental awareness. Among them, promoting the usage of renewable energy to reduce carbon footprints and discourage fossil fuel consumption is significant (Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino, 2020). The primary objective of Paris Agreement was to redirect funds to projects, that foster climate resilience, while reducing carbon emissions. With the transition to reduced reliance on carbon as a fuel, economies now require huge investments to fund environment friendly projects (Tiron-Tudor et al. 2021). To achieve the Paris Agreement climate targets and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), enormous commitment of financial resources in climate friendly projects and investment opportunities is imperative (Reboredo and Ugolini, 2020). The many ways through which finance sector acts as a catalyst for advancing sustainability include promoting investments into sustainable projects through innovative financial products. Since green bonds facilitate attainment of the objectives of Paris Agreement, investments in them have become a necessity. International Capital Market Association (2018) defines green bonds as “any bond instrument where the proceeds will be exclusively applied to finance or refinance, in part or full, to new or existing eligible green projects.” The main difference between conventional and green bonds lies in the end use of proceeds; green bonds employ all the proceeds in projects that are focused on renewable energy, green building, clean infrastructure and energy efficiency (Flammer, 2020; Nguyen et al. 2020). Green bonds are also called sustainable bonds, as they promote sustainable development and have emerged as a plausible source of sustainable financing for institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, and sovereign wealth funds), allowing them to divert funds to sustainable infrastructure investments. Among the latest financial innovations, variety of instruments like blue bonds and brown bonds are also gaining prominence. Aimed at fulfilling sustainable development goals (SDG) of clean water and life below water, blue bonds (subset of green bonds) are a relatively newer form of sustainable bonds, financing ocean conservation projects. Brown bonds enable brown industries (companies that transmit significant emissions) to raise funds, facilitating transition to improved sustainable models. Even with the many options available in sustainable bonds, green bonds are more popular and much in demand than other similar sustainable bonds. Green bonds are certified as per the standards developed by the Climate Bonds Initiative, whereas no such framework exists for brown or blue bonds. Application of proceeds from blue bonds and brown bonds is limited, whereas green bonds offer a wider spectrum of proceeds utilization in environment related projects. The green bond market constitutes 1.5% of the total bond market with cumulative issuances at $1.79 trillion till date (King et al. 2021). According to CBI (2022), global green bonds market has reached over 1.795 trillion USD, with investments worth $145.6 billion till date in the year 2022 alone. The first green financing was done in 2007 by European Investment Bank followed by World bank investment in 2008. The European Green deal was a significant step towards reinforcement of sustainable financing. With EU’s aim to become a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, this deal intended to transform EU into a fair, sustainable, and prosperous society. With considerable focus on promoting green bonds, EU has time and again launched many initiatives. Notable among them were ‘EU Green Bonds Standards’ that aimed to enhance the transparency and standardization of green markets and promote green bonds issuance to boost investors’ confidence. Another initiative was the adoption of EU taxonomy identifying environmentally sustainable activities to smoothen the implementation of EU Green deal (Technical Expert Group 2019). With the confusion around the definition and meaning of sustainable investments, adoption of EU taxonomy was intended to provide well-established and recognized definition to the investors, companies, governments, and policymakers. It was expected that such a move would reduce greenwashing while encouraging circular economy and other climate related initiatives. EU has always led green bonds issuance, constituting 48% of total global issuances in 2020 (Spinaci, S. 2022). In terms of volume, Sweden, Spain and Germany were among the top 10 countries to issue green bonds. In the year 2021, annual green bond issuance crossed $510 billion (see Fig. 1), Europe being the highest contributor by issuing green bonds worth $265 billion. EU, over the years, has advocated the adoption of green bonds and has promoted sustainability by introducing new laws and regulations. Considering EU’s initiatives around sustainability, carbon neutrality and green financing, this study examines the top ten EU economies and examines the connectedness of green bonds with the financial markets in selected EU economies. With limited studies establishing the connection between green bonds and attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Le, and Taghizadeh-Hesary, 2020; Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino, 2019), this study aims to establish green bonds as one of the efficient ways to achieve SDGs by 2030. Source: https://www.climatebonds.net/market/data/#country-map accessed on 31st May, 2022 Global Green Bond Issuance (2008–2021). Due to the many advantages of green bonds, they constitute a significant portion of active trades in markets world over. Extensive research is being carried on green bonds, ranging from analysis of their general characteristics to exploring the association of green bonds with the equity market. The mechanism of risk transmission between equity and bond markets plays a vital role in risk management and portfolio composition. Compared to equity, bonds as an asset class are relatively stable, potentially offsetting the risk of stocks in a portfolio. Green bonds have emerged as an environment friendly instrument in the fixed income product category and are increasingly included in investors’ portfolios, for improved risk divergence and mitigation. Inclusion of Green bonds is asset management that has exhibited positive impact on equity performance, improved liquidity, and increased short-run firm value (Flammer, 2020). Much of the existing literature, therefore, has explored the dynamic relationship between the equity and bond markets (Cappiello et al., 2006; Christiansen, 2010; Chuliá and Torro, 2008). Owing to the inherent characteristics of green bonds as a stable form of investment option, analyzing the connectedness of green bond market with and stock markets becomes imminent. Such research is expected to assist investors in improved organization and management of their portfolios. However, since green bonds are relatively newer investment option, existing academic research on this topic is largely insufficient. With EU leading the pack in green bond issuance, it becomes imperative to explore the connectedness of green bond market with the stock market in European countries. With limited studies exploring the relationship in European region, this study attempts to fill in this gap by analyzing the dynamic connectedness between top ten European countries (OECD) and the green bond financial markets. Results of this study are expected to have meaningful implications both on theoretical and practical grounds in the following ways: Firstly, due to limited studies on connectedness between OECD financial markets and green bonds, this study will contribute to the existing literature by evidencing this relationship. Considering the recent developments and buzz around green bonds in European countries, it becomes crucial to understand and evaluate this connectedness. Secondly, application of both Diebold-Yilmaz (2012) and Barunik & Krehlic (2017) tests lends credence to this study. Connectedness, as suggested by Diebold and Yilmaz, would analyse the association of variables, while evaluating the share of forecast error variation in different locations due to shocks. Barunik and Krehlik test would extend this connectedness to the framework of frequency domain. Since this paper effectively employs both these tests, it is expected that the results would have meaningful implications for policymakers, investors, and academicians. Thirdly, the findings of this study can guide various investor classes like hedge funds, intra-day traders (short-term horizon), pension funds, insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds (medium- to long-term) to identify suitable investment opportunities. Finally, since, inclination for investment in safer options assumes prominence during pandemic times like COVID-19, results from this study can promote investments in countries that encourage mobilization of financial resources in green bonds to support a climate-resilient economy. The rest of the paper is divided into different sections. Next section expounds on the review of existing literature followed by methodology and Result in Sect. 3 and 4, respectively. Section 5 is of conclusion and the policy implication of the study.",4
56.0,1.0,Economic Change and Restructuring,24 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10644-022-09439-8,The relationship between education and vulnerability to poverty in South Africa,February 2023,Nicholas Ngepah,Tsholofelo Makgalemele,Charles Shaaba Saba,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"South Africa (SA) has approximately 49.2% of the adult population living below the upper bound poverty line (UBPL) (StatsSA 2020). South Africa still suffers from chronic poverty because economic activity is not generating growth at the commensurate level required to address poverty (Ngepah 2017). Moreover, the high inequality curbs growth's ability to decrease the rate at which poverty is reduced. In effect, an exposure to a shock will result in more people falling into poverty in the future (Ngepah 2017). Thus, chronic poverty remains persistent, however, at a higher rate, making it difficult for SA to meet the Millennial Development Goal of eradicating poverty. The present households' inability to have coping mechanisms in place such as insurance or savings in case of an adverse shock will increase vulnerability to poverty (Haq 2015; Swain and Floro 2012). However, to acquire these coping mechanisms households need to generate an income via educational investment. This necessitates the importance of using education as a catalyst for reducing vulnerability to poverty. In SA every learner is entitled to basic education as it is compulsory to attend school from grade 1 to 9. Even though this is the case, access to quality education is not available to all pupils as it is determined by affordability (Gumede and Biyase 2016). Thus, this can affect the probability of being accepted in universities and ultimately lowers the chances of being absorbed into the labor market. Statistically, South Africa has 33,171 uneducated citizens while 56,750 people have a primary education, 66,770 attained a secondary education whereas only 16,491 South Africans obtained tertiary education (National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS), 2017). Based on these statistics and the below Fig. 1, it is evident that majority of the population have a secondary education while only a hand full of people have a tertiary education. Proportion of levels of education in South Africa Education is a function of economic growth through human capital and a fundamental determinant of poverty. This notion is justified by the contribution of Haughton and Khandker (2009) which highlights that the lowest level of education (primary education) slightly increases the standard of living for the impoverished population. Hence, significant policy implications have stemmed from studies which suggest that advancing human capabilities increases the rate of return to educational investment via a rise in personal income (inter alia: Gumede and Biyase 2016; Haughton and Khandker 2009). There is an extensive body of literature that study education and poverty alleviation but only a handful of studies focus on vulnerability to poverty (inter alia: Brown and James 2020; Dzidza et al. 2018; Kawulur et al. 2019). In developing countries, studies show that more than 50% of the group which is vulnerable to poverty is currently non-poor (Haughton and Khandker 2009). Hence, the population that is currently poor is not an accurate indicator of those who will be poor in the next period (Haq 2015). Thus, this marks the importance of studying poverty vulnerability. In the light of recent events, the COVID-19 pandemic has left many South Africans who were previously non-poor vulnerable to transitioning into poverty. This highlights the importance of evaluating the effect that education can have on reducing vulnerability to poverty. The most efficient way to do that is by using the disaggregated approach as it captures complicated complex patterns and disparities in the education–vulnerability to poverty nexus that transpire within South Africa. Over and above that, this approach exposes the differing contexts in which this nexus occurs (Ajuruchukwu and Sanelise 2016). Moreover, this approach provides enough information required to formulate initiatives that target the most vulnerable (Hong and Sullivan 2013). In most cases, studies follow the aggregation approach in analyzing the relationship between the two variables to deduce an overview about the nexus and thus disregarding the details (Christiaensen and Boisvert 2000; Pritchett et al. 2000; Yang and Guo 2020). However, in a country that suffers from chronic poverty, it is advisable to dismantle the issue of vulnerability to poverty in order to establish the root cause of the problem. This can be done effectively by using the disaggregated approach, whereby vulnerability to poverty is analyzed across all poverty lines thus allowing the assessment of poverty variability (Ajuruchukwu and Sanelise 2016). Furthermore, this approach helps determine how much of the population falls under the most vulnerable group so that resources can be allocated effectively and efficiently. In addition to the above-mentioned benefits of disaggregating both variables, researchers can establish the impact and magnitude each level of education has on the group that is at most risk (Pritchett et al. 2000). Hence, this study is integral because it intends to fill this gap found in the literature. This study differs from the one conducted by Yang and Guo (2020) as it simultaneously disaggregates education and vulnerability to poverty. As per policy implications, the objective of government strategies should be such that they are prospective for the advancement of economic development. However, most poverty-reduction policies emanate from research that has focused on poverty alleviation which is ex-post in its nature (Yang and Guo 2020). This in essence does not account for the population that might transit into poverty or will remain stuck in the poverty trap in the future. Hence, this necessitates studying vulnerability to poverty as it is ex-ante in its approach and allows for the formation of preventative policies. This study is structured to review the existing literature in Sect. 2 on the subject matter. Subsequently, Sect. 3 discusses the methodology whereas Sect. 4 provides a discussion of the empirical results. Lastly, the fifth chapter will conclude the topic at hand with relevant policies.",1

W. Ziesemer,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Growth accounting found a strong role for the productivity residual first in Cobb–Douglas functions (Tinbergen 1942; Solow 1957, Fagerberg 1994) and recently in more general CES functions (Ziesemer 2022a). Therefore, the neoclassical growth model of Solow (1956) has taken over the role of the leading growth model from Harrod–Domar, and technical change is seen as the leading driver of closed-economy growth. A second class of growth models considers world income growth as another driving force of growth. First, the World Bank’s two-gap version of the Harrod–Domar model, based on Johnson (1953) and linear programming models (Basu 1984), and further developed during the 1960s, includes export growth (Feder 1981). Second, Bardhan and Lewis (1970) turned the two-gap model into a neoclassical version by way of assuming that there is a domestic and a foreign capital stock; the investment of the latter is imported and paid for by exports. Both models have the assumption of exports depending on the terms of trade and an exogenous export growth rate. Ziesemer (1995a) assumes that their exogenous export growth rate is the product of that of world income growth and an income elasticity, as Thirlwall (1983) did, and links the model to the literature on the ideas of Prebisch (1950, 1959) and Singer (1999). Third, Thirlwall (19791983) suggested balance-of-payments-constrained (BoPC) growth: If exports depend on world income and the terms-of-trade, and imports on domestic income and terms of trade, the equality of exports and imports on trade balance or their growth rates under constant terms of trade would imply domestic growth depending on foreign growth.Footnote 1 All these models have versions with international capital movements (see Feder 1981; Ziesemer 1995b, 1998; Thirlwall 2011). There are strongly different ways to model the supply side and the terms of trade in the above-mentioned literature. In the papers of the Harrod–Domar models with absent or fixed prices, the GDP growth rate consists of given parameters, mostly the savings ratio multiplied by the output-capital ratio. Export growth then affects only debt accumulation, the interest burden and the GNI (gross national income). The Bardhan–Lewis model has a neoclassical production function, in which technical change has been separated from efficient labour in the later literature (Ziesemer 1995a, b). Terms of trade are driven by domestic supply and world income in the export function; all arguments are therefore ultimately driven by both foreign income and exogenous technical change, allowing the terms of trade to go either up or down or stay constant depending on the relative strength of these two forces. The missing link between productivity and constrained trade (Krugman 1989) is the effect of productivity increases on terms of trade reductions allowing for more exports and imported capital goods (Ziesemer 1995b). In the BoPC literature, terms of trade are exogenous and constant, and production, labour, investment, and savings are often ignored altogether (Ziesemer 2022b). Models differ in the way output reacts to foreign growth. The BoPC models are Keynesian in spirit and output is supposed to react with additional employment, although the latter never appears explicitly in the models. In extensions of Bardhan and Lewis (1970) with vertical or horizontal labour supply, output and employment react through additional capital goods imports (Ziesemer (1995a). The question is whether employment reacts or only imported capital goods when foreign output increases. The evidence related to Thirlwall’s law allows for both, because the evidence is derived without link to the factor markets. In order to allow for both, we use Okun’s law, which allows for unemployment and has equilibrium unemployment as a special case, and we add an endogenous labour force function. We start the set-up of our model from exports, imports, and all balance of payments items. Then we add the goods market items investment, and savings, and the supply side with a production function and endogenous human capital, R&D, and technical change. There is much empirical evidence supporting the impact of world income growth on domestic income growth or the impact of exports on growth in the single-equation regression mode. For the early approaches, we refer to the well-structured survey in Dutt (2002; p. 372–374). For example, Perraton (2003) uses error-correction methods in the single equation form, but not the vector form leading to simultaneous equation systems. Alonso and Garcimartín (1998) use the vector-error-correction method to estimate the export and import functions and estimate other systems to get parameter estimates, but they do not use the power of estimation-based simulations to test the effects of world income growth and the growth reduction from the BoPC.Footnote 2 Jayme (2003) provides a VECM and analysed shocks from exports on GDP but does not include the import and export functions or other variables. Conversely, Spinola (2020b) estimates a vector-error-correction model and uses it for simulations but does not show the economic relations of BoPC models in the cointegrating equations. López and Cruz (2000), Holland et al. (2004), Britto and McCombie (2009), Garcimartín et al. (2016), Lélis et al. (2018), Spinola (2020b), and Birkan (2022) also analyse the related data in terms of VAR (vector-autoregressive) and VEC (vector-error-correction) models. These types of econometric models provide in principle a reliable data analysis for a small set of variables.Footnote 3 However, the way they are handled show several shortcomings. First, some authors have separate VAR or VEC models for import and export functions although they share the terms of trade variables and therefore should be dealt with together because this goes against the lessons of cross-unit cointegration which holds across countries and across equations (Gonzalo and Granger 1995; Banerjee et al. 2004) and mean that sets of cointegrated variables should not be analysed separately. This may require that the size of models goes beyond the standard of two to eight variables and equations (see Kilian and Lütkepohl 2017). Second, they often do not use the model for simulations but only for the purpose of getting the long-term relations. Third, their disadvantage in principle is that the more detailed mechanisms of the causality chain from world income to domestic GDP via factor and goods markets remains often unclear when only a slightly extended trade balance model is used.Footnote 4 Kennedy and Thirlwall (1979) and McCombie (1985) use only the goods market equation with exogenous exports or terms of trade and neglect of debt dynamics and interest payments. Palley (2003) suggests that capacity utilization adjusts imports or productivity growth to balance supply and demand growth. This leads to supply growth determining long-run growth via Verdoorn’s law. World GDP growth only affects capacity utilization when imports adjust, or productivity growth adjusts to world GDP growth. There is no link to labour markets and no goods market equilibrium condition. In Dávila-Fernández et al. (2018), there is a long-term ratio I/Y = i* and deviations are assumed to be a function of capacity utilization. Assuming Y = AK as from a limitational production function,Footnote 5 and \(I\equiv \dot{K}+\delta K={i}^{*}Y\), they get \(\dot{K}={i}^{*}AK-\delta K\) as weakly exogenous capital accumulation process. The limitational production function then determines the output level. Investment is linked to the trade variables through an assumption regarding the adjustment of capacity utilization. The paper starts with Thirlwall’s law in growth rates, but it has no goods or factor market equilibrium. Dávila-Fernández and Sordi (2019a) is the first paper since Kennedy and Thirlwall (1979) and McCombie (1985) that links the BoPC idea to a goods market equilibrium condition in a theoretical model. They impose that in the long run there is current-account equilibrium and therefore (i) there is no debt accumulation in the long run (and ignored in the short run), (ii) Thirlwall’s law rules, and (iii) capital goods are not imported. We deviate in regard to these latter assumptions allowing for debt dynamics and imported capital goods, and in having an empirical model where all equations are estimated. We still allow for Thirlwall’s law to work. Razmi (2016) emphasizes the need for a dynamic simultaneous equation model (DSEM). The specific causal mechanism of imported capital goods and other factors of production also using the variables of BoPC models has been shown for an estimated reduced form of the Bardhan/Lewis model with imported capital goods by Mutz and Ziesemer (2008) for Brazil, by Habiyaremye and Ziesemer (2012) for Malaysia, by Ziesemer (2018) in a DSEM analysis for Croatia, and by Hallonsten and Ziesemer (2019) for Trinidad and Tobago, using simultaneous equation estimation, baseline simulation and shock analysis. In all cases we clearly see the effects of world income changes as expected in a Prebisch–Thirlwall perspective, increases in terms of trade and GDP. As mechanisms in theoretical or empirical work, one either needs the constraint of BoPC models or, alternatively, imported capital goods suggested by Prebisch (1950) and included in the World Bank model. The heterodox model of Dutt (2002) and the neoclassical models based on Bardhan–Lewis (1970) have both, the BoP constraint without or with debt, and imported capital goods. When foreign debt is included, these models do not have a trade-balance constraint, or only a soft one with equal growth rates of exports and imports (Blecker 2021b). However, allowing for foreign debt does mean mainly that debt is used to pay for machines in the short run and that exports are used to pay debt service. In that sense, the balance of payments remains a constraint with debt allowing to postpone payment through exports (Ziesemer 1995b, 1998). Our approach for Brazil does not impose balanced trade or current account or growth rate equality for exports and imports,Footnote 6 but a balance-of-payments identity including trade, net foreign debt flows, and interest payments on debt stocks, other net factor income and transfers from abroad, and puts emphasis on the impact of foreign debt on domestic interest rates. For all but one of these equations we formulate and estimate dynamic regression equations. In regard to trade, we use data on imported capital goods and distinguish them from domestic investment and imported consumption. On the supply side we specify and estimate equations making technical change dependent on R&D, and R&D and human capital dependent on each other and on technical change, leading to semi-endogenous growth according to our estimates and simulations. Changes of inventories are an important disequilibrium variable for the goods market besides unemployment for the labour market. Inventory changes as part of ex-post investment feed back into deposit rate determination, foreign debt accumulation and net secondary income from abroad, and unemployment feeds back into equations for (precautionary) savings and inflation. We estimate equations for all these variables without imposing perfect competition, constant terms of trade or other steady-state assumptions. In Sect. 2 we explain the data choice for all variables. In Sect. 3 we briefly introduce the main aspects of econometric thinking in a non-technical manner. In Sect. 4 we present the model with 22 variables and equations in estimated form and interpret the results in detail, especially the weaknesses in education and R&D policies. In Sect. 5 we discuss the baseline simulation and show that the Brazilian economy has a long-run instability caused by its savings gap, which leads to increasing foreign debt, relative to GDP, driving up the interest rate. In Sect. 6 we show the effects from simulations of permanent intercept changes of equations for world GDP, human capital, R&D, and terms of trade; we confirm Thirlwall’s law and discuss the relation with the literature on (i) BoPC growth, (ii) growth with imported capital goods, and (iii) the reaction of unemployment, labour force, and human capital. In Sect. 7 we summarize all major results as the basis of policy conclusions.",1

Evidence from SVAR models,April 2023,Ilir Miteza,Altin Tanku,Ilir Vika,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Whether the real exchange rate acts as a shock damper or reverberator for the business cycle, this is a key question in the policy choice of the optimal exchange rate regime. This policy question would be essential for example when evaluating a decision to join a currency area such as the Eurozone. Several central and eastern European (CEE) countries—also referred to as transformation or transition economies—have joined the Eurozone. Croatia is slated to join in 2023 (European Council 2022), and a few other European Union members from the CEE group (e.g., Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania) may be considering membership in the near future. Countries that have relinquished floating exchange rates to join the euro may be facing macroeconomic stabilization costs, as may other future accession countries. A good amount of useful empirical work has already been done on the contribution of real exchange rates to macroeconomic volatility for most CEE countries, but no such studies have been done for Albania, an economy aspiring to European Union membershipFootnote 1 and potentially Eurozone accession. Our paper answers the question: Is Albania’s current floating exchange rate regime the most appropriate given its business cycle volatility? In other words, we investigate whether a potential eurozone membership will contribute to macroeconomic stability, or create more volatility. The insulating properties (i.e., shock absorbing properties) of floating exchange rates against international shocks, combined with the freedom they afford the central banks to pursue their domestic macroeconomic goals are common arguments in favor of a floating regime (Mundell 1963; Johnson 1969). But opposing views see flexible exchange rates as a troubling source of shocks and volatility, particularly for economies well integrated in global financial markets. According to these views, exchange rates are not the shock absorbers they have been assumed in traditional macroeconomic theory. Flexible exchange rates have also been identified as a destabilizing instrument transmitting monetary and financial shocks onto the real economy (Buiter 2000; Gabaix and Maggiori 2015). In this study, we examine the role of real exchange rates in Albania’s business cycle volatility offering five main contributions. First, we add to a limited literature of empirical structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) studies on the contribution of real exchange rates to macroeconomic volatility in CEE countries. Evidence about the case of Albania adds value as its economy is both similar in its transition aspects to other CEE countries, but also unique, not least because of its heavily euroized (and dollarized) economy without deep financial markets and with a considerably less open capital account than most other CEE countries.Footnote 2 Second, we employ a novel approach to estimate an SVAR with zero long-run restrictions taking into account the presence of cointegration among the variables. This enables us to reduce the number of restrictions needed for identification and a more efficient estimation. Third, by using a Bayesian SVAR model, in addition to the SVAR with zero long-run restrictions, we do not solely rely on a single model specification but can leverage results from the most probable specifications of the Bayesian model averaging method. Our Bayesian sign restrictions estimation technique is particularly suited to limited-length time series, which is an issue for all CEE economies. Fourth, we expand the VAR dimension to five variables so we can identify more shocks, or be able to better distinguish among them. No other SVAR study of CEEs on this topic, that we know of, uses a 5-variable model. Identification with five variables makes estimation challenging, but we use one of the longest data sample with about 20 years of quarterly data. Fifth, we contribute findings that are stable under three robustness checks: a simple SVAR with zero long-run restrictions; an SVAR with cointegration and zero long-run restrictions; and a Bayesian SVAR with sign restrictions. No other CEE studies that we are aware of have employed all three SVAR models as a way to check for the stability of their estimates. Typically, the most direct way to determine whether the floating exchange rate is a shock absorber or a shock reverberator involves measuring the contribution of real and nominal shocks to real exchange rate fluctuations. If real demand or supply shocks are responsible for a large proportion of the movements in the real exchange rate, then the exchange rate is a shock absorber. But, if exchange rate movements are primarily the result of monetary shocks or the foreign exchange market, then the exchange rate is a shock reverberator (Artis and Ehrmann 2006; Farrant and Peersman 2006). Our results show that real exchange rate movements in Albania are driven mainly by real economic factors, with modest effects from monetary shocks. We conclude that the real exchange rate plays a shock absorbing role in Albania, adding to macroeconomic stability and making their current flexible exchange rate regime a sensible policy choice. In addition we find that real factors, particularly aggregate demand, were mostly responsible for three episodes of large real exchange rate movements, which explains the persistent real appreciation of the LEK against the euro in the last decade. Our main findings are stable under all three SVAR specifications, but they are not always in line with what research on other CEE countries has revealed (Borghijs and Kuijs 2004; Stazka-Gawrysiak 2006; Shevchuk 2014). The paper is laid out as follows: Sect. 2 includes the literature review; Sect. 3 presents the model and methods; Sect. 4 reports our empirical findings; and Sect. 5 summarizes our conclusions and policy recommendations.",1

Novel dynamic ARDL simulation study on Bangladesh",April 2023,Preethu Rahman,Zhihe Zhang,Mohammad Musa,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"New ideas are brought to life through technological innovation by modification of existing ones or restoration of old ones. With the improvement of innovation efficiency, more goods and services are distributed to the public and the economy grows (Taques et al. 2021). By utilizing technological innovation, a country's competitive advantage can be fully maximized, resulting in high returns for capital, facilitating imports of intermediate goods, and enhancing returns to capital in less developed economies, such as Bangladesh. Researchers and policy makers have long been interested in technological innovation because it contributes to economic growth, job creation, and societal development (Mohamed et al. 2021). Therefore, new innovations are created and carried out in a socio-cultural framework and economic growth is considered a prerequisite for improving living standards and life opportunities in the future world (Skare and Porada-Rochon 2022). An innovative economy ensures economic growth and execution, tackling global concerns through product developments and service delivery, boosting efficiency, creating innovative jobs, and enhancing the quality of life of people around the world (Ascani et al. 2020). It has been a long-term focus of experts to build a bridge between economic growth and innovation (Zhou et al. 2022). The input and output dimensions of technological innovation are equally important. As Bangladesh's economic development has improved over the past few years, the world media has become increasingly positive about its progress, the country gained an additional 8% of per capita income in the fiscal year 2020–21 (Brende 2022). By enhancing the effectiveness of capital in production through technical changes in capital assets, technological progress stimulates economic growth by compensating for capital losses, increasing efficiency in capital production, and increasing the spread of knowledge in society, ultimately increasing economic productivity (Taques et al. 2021). It can be interesting to note that both less developed and developed countries are able to benefit from innovation. Research shows, foreign direct investment significantly increased productivity of the factors of production, as well as the availability of expert labors, thereby boosting economic growth in Southeast Asian countries (Sun et al. 2022). In recent years, foreign direct investment has evolved in order to include, in addition to money transfers, the transfer of technology, management capabilities, skills, marketing, and other intangible assets (Saleem et al. 2020). Consequently, innovation in technology relies heavily on human resources, and how they are managed and developed affects it greatly. Economic policy should promote economic prosperity and growth in order to achieve its ultimate goals and also corrects labor market imbalances and builds new productive capacities (Mohamed et al. 2021). In addition, Trade openness stimulates innovation and entrepreneurship by increasing competition and market access (Udeagha and Ngepah 2022b). Economic empowerment and innovation are the two most important tools for Bangladesh to flourish in the future. We choose to analyze the effects of above-mentioned microeconomic factors and see how they impact on economic growth of Bangladesh. In order to advance everyday-life at home, at work, in business, and in society, the government plays a crucial role as a facilitator and as a creator of an environment that fosters creativity. Bangladesh is deemed from lower-middle-income to middle-income country ranked in 2015 by the World Bank (Kamal Uddin 2021). It is now one of the fastest-growing countries, and we can identify some of the benefits and drawbacks from such a quick pace of expansion. The country has made tremendous progress in decreasing extreme poverty, and its per capita income might soon climb more. Our research interest in Bangladesh's technological innovation, foreign direct investment, human capital and trade and their relation with its economic development arose after revealing that Bangladesh's overall capacity for innovation and creativity had remained behind for years. The research gap is found accurate as the previous studies are based on literature works or yielded mostly conflicting results. The unavailability of critical research data is a significant disadvantage for any research. Bangladesh was ranked 116th out of 131 economies by the World Intellectual Property Organization report based on overall innovation indicators (Cornell University 2020). Global financial liberalism is measured by the Global Innovation Index (GII) using 80 innovation indicators. Bangladesh's performance on innovation shows a gradual decrease, according to the GII report in 2020. It comes in at 119th in terms of innovation inputs and 114th in terms of innovation outputs (Dutta et al. 2021). Sadly, Bangladesh's status in these disciplines has declined in recent years. Bangladesh is ranked 24th out of 29 low-income nations and 10th out of 10 in Central and Southern Asia. According to the GII, Bangladesh has underperformed in innovation and development. Each of the GII's seven assessment pillars—institution, human capital and research, infrastructure, market superiority, business complexity, knowledge and technology—scored worse than the worldwide average. While conducting this research, we could not locate research and development data for 31 consecutive years in the World Development Indicator or other databases, which could be highly beneficial in determining Bangladesh's innovativeness and innovation capacity. Drawbacks of our research reveals Bangladesh requires special attention in innovation, economic research, and data accessibility. It must reassign and examine why its performance in the GII has remained consistently low. Bangladesh's past three-year economic data and GII ranking study suggests that a comparable data set was reused. This may be one of the reasons for its continued decline. Studies by different organizations and researchers related to poor innovation capacity has piqued our curiosity in researching and determining the cause of this phenomenon. Some of Bangladesh's government policies are anti-innovation. High taxes on machinery and replacement parts imports creates obstacle conducting business in Bangladesh, new enterprises are hesitant to enter. Bangladesh studies on innovation are very weak (Uddin and Ahmed 2021). Bangladesh's unstable government and political revolutions have a higher failure rate that hampered the construction of good management and overall development (Kabadurmus 2021). Bangladesh has yet to notice a shift in policy. Bangladesh should have centralized or decentralized intellectual property policies that foster creativity and innovation (Murshed and Alam 2021). The accomplishment of a rapid innovation cycle can be made considerably easier if academics, government, and the public and commercial sectors collaborate (Tashmina 2019). Therefore, in this study, a range of economic indicators, including patents, foreign direct investment, trade openness, and human capital, will be used to examine the impact of technological innovation on economic growth. A novel methodology is employed, which is newly established and provides more robust results. Popular estimation system, developed by Jordan and Philips (2018), the Dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag (DYNARDL) simulations that is gaining more recognition, as time series data are increasingly used in economics. However, after analyzing the literatures in recent decades, it has found only a few empirical studies that have explicitly explored regarding the relevance of technological innovation, foreign direct investment, trade openness, and human capital with economic growth of Bangladesh and also the variables are not incorporated together which have generated mostly conflicting results. There is an increasingly large body of research on the beneficial effects of different growth proxies on the economy. The vast majority of these studies assume that there is only one dimension of relationship between the regressor and the regressed, either a negative or positive relationship, long or short run. Taking those study gaps into consideration, the current study makes a big difference compared to previous studies, by contributing: First, the identification of technological innovation is critical to constructing and planning strategies for Bangladesh's developing economy, which is currently experiencing a significant increase. It is, however, rare for this country to investigate the consequences of technological innovation on its economy. We are also aware of no study so far incorporates potential factors such as patents, foreign direct investment, trade, and education expenditure together into its empirical assessment of the dynamic relationship between the factors and economic development. This is an important gap our study intends to fill. Second, this paper analyzes both symmetrical and non-symmetrical relationships between the variables, considered as an important highlight. In previous studies, the ARDL approach by Pesaran et al. (2001) were widely employed, which only compute and examine short- and long-term relationships between variables. Although several limitations do exist (Jordan and Philips 2018) have developed a dynamic ARDL simulation model designed to address some of them. In this study, a dynamic ARDL simulation model is incorporated into the methodological literature. The novel dynamic ARDL simulations can resolve prevailing difficulties and interpret results in a more effective and efficient manner than using simple ARDLs. In addition to simulating and plotting the variables, this framework can estimate their long- and short-term relationships and predict graphs of symmetric and asymmetric changes. Our results are therefore considered accurate and unbiased when we adapt this method to this study. Fourth, to further check the robustness of the study we employed the nonlinear ARDL approach. We are aware of no previous studies that have used all these linear, nonlinear and dynamic simulation tests together in the Innovation, FDI, Trade, Human capital and Economic growth nexus especially in the context of Bangladesh.",2

Ekeocha,Jonathan E. Ogbuabor,Anthony Orji,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"In the decade following the 2007–2009 Global Financial Crisis, the global economy has witnessed several uncertainty inducing events. Some of these events include: the European sovereign debt crisis that peaked between 2010 and 2012, the 2015/2016 commodity price shock, the US–China trade war, the Brexit vote, and more recently, the ongoing Covid-19 Pandemic. Indeed, the ongoing Covid-19 Pandemic has caused significant spikes in uncertainty surrounding various aspects of economic life, such as the duration and potency of social distancing, business travels and physical market resumptions, whether working from home will persist, the magnitude of shifts in consumption patterns, and the speed of post-Covid economic recovery, among others (Altig et al. 2020). Consequently, these new realities have significant economic impacts on countries. The report by World Bank (2021) revealed that, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, economic activity in Africa was estimated to have contracted by 2 percent in 2020. This was driven by contractions on the production side (industry and services sector) and the demand side (private consumption and investment). Besides, Sub-Saharan Africa suffered its first recession in over 25 years, with economic activity contracting by nearly 5 percent on a per capita basis. Some studies (e.g. Ali 2001; Sahinoz and Erdogan-Cosar, 2018; Altig et al. 2020; Lin and Bai 2021; Ogbonna et al. 2022) have found significant adverse effect of uncertainty on growth, consumption, and investment. Phan et al. (2020) established that uncertainty adversely affects financial stability, while Tran et al. (2020) found that rising uncertainty promotes US banks’ diversification into non-interest income activities. Lyu et al. (2021) found that economic policy uncertainty (EPU) has a significant and positive impact on crude oil volatility, and it is most pronounced during extreme market conditions, such as the 2007–2009 Global Financial Crisis and the 2010–2012 European Sovereign Debt crisis. Conversely, Lin and Bai (2021) found that global EPU has an undulating response to oil price shocks, while it has a negatively significant impact on global oil prices. Similarly, Qin et al. (2021) found that the impact of policy uncertainty on travel and leisure undulates between a significant positive and negative effect. Also, Wu et al. (2021) used a three-dimensional wavelet approach on data of five-fragile countries (Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey) to establish that the causality between global EPU and tourism changes overtime, especially when global EPU and tourism co-move. In terms of institutions, Ali (2001) established that the effect of political instability on growth is inconclusive, but Yildirim and Gökalp (2016) found the effect of political instability on growth to be negatively significant for developing countries. These studies have also found a significantly positive effect of rule of law and regulatory quality on growth, and a unidirectional causality from political stability to economic growth for developing countries, low-income countries and lower middle-income countries (Dixit 2009; Yildirim and Gökalp 2016; Dalyop 2018; Nair et al. 2021; Arvin et al. 2021). Likewise, Kamah et al. (2021) found that the effect of institutional quality on inclusive growth is positively significant. In spite of the growing literature on the effects of uncertainty on economic activities (e.g. Altig et al. 2020 studied US and UK; Lin and Bai 2021; Xu et al. 2021; and Pan, Wang and Wang, 2021 studied China), empirical evidence in Africa remains scanty, especially following the ongoing Covid-19 Pandemic. Besides, the moderating effect of governance institutions on the uncertainty-economic performance relationship in Africa is yet to be accounted for. To close these gaps, this study builds on the works of Kamah et al. (2021), Nair et al. (2021), Arvin et al. (2021), and Sahinoz and Erdogan-Cosar (2018) in order to deepen the literature and allow for more comprehensive understanding of the uncertainty-economic performance relationship in Africa. This is particularly necessary because studies (e.g. Dixit 2009; Yildirim and Gökalp 2016; Nair et al. 2021; Arvin et al. 2021) have shown that the influence of governance institutions on economic activities can no longer be called unimportant. Indeed, these studies underline the fact that strong governance institutions can render the economic environment transparent and friendly, and thereby promote economic performance across regions. At the very minimum, it is expected that such governance institutions should at least be able to control corruption, enforce the rule of law, ensure government effectiveness, uphold high regulatory quality, maintain political stability and absence of violence and terrorism, and ensure the preservation of voice and accountability. Thus, the broad objective of this study is to investigate the effects of global economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and governance institutions on economic performance in Africa. The specific objectives are to: (1) ascertain the impacts of global EPU and governance institutions on economic performance in Africa; (2) determine if governance institutions significantly moderate the uncertainty-economic performance relationship in Africa; (3) determine if there are regional differences on the effect of EPU on economic performance in Africa; and (4) establish other significant drivers of economic performance in Africa. The choice of Africa for this study is apt as the continent consists of both very low-income countries and emerging markets with high interactions in the international market and with developed countries. Besides, the leading economies on the continent like Nigeria and South Africa have also been exposed to various uncertainty inducing events, particularly in the last decade. For instance, such events in Nigeria include: the presidential elections of 2015 and 2019; the delay in appointment of Ministers to form the Executive Council of the Federation in 2019; the delays in the submission and approval of national budgets; the fuel subsidy debacle which started in January 2012; the perennial conflicts between nomadic Fulani herdsmen and farmers leading to ethnic tensions; the economic recession of 2016; and the Boko Haram insurgency, among others. In South Africa, such uncertainty-inducing events include: the persistent problem of xenophobic violence which escalated in 2018 and 2019; the ongoing economic recession occasioned by weak manufacturing and trade; the transition from one elected president to another, especially the tensions created towards the emergence of a new president in 2018; the various episodes of bank crises (like the collapse of African Bank in 2014 and the failure of VBS Mutual Bank in 2018); the termination of the bilateral investment treaties between South Africa and European Union member countries in 2012; and the ambiguous and continually changing land reform programme in South Africa, among others. To achieve the foregoing objectives, the study used system GMM and simultaneous quantile regression frameworks.Footnote 1 The data for the study were sourced from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators and World Governance Indicators, as well as the global uncertainty index advanced by Davis (2016). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 focuses on the literature review; Sect. 3 discusses the data and methods used; Sect. 4 presents and discusses the results; and Sect. 5 concludes the paper with some policy recommendations.",

Due to governments’ initial guidance to stay home—more than a third of the global population was placed in confinement (Kaplan et al. 2020)—activities involving groups of people were momentarily suspended and, excluding purchases of products such as food, drinks, cleaning products, and medicines, the remaining purchases were postponed. On the uncertainty side, demand has retreated because people have chosen to save even because of the risk of job loss, and on the supply side, industrial production has slowed even because it requires face-to-face activity and the number of patients and people at home has increased. Changes in consumption patterns, quarantine, supply constraints and the disruption of international value chains have led to disruptions in business activities in many (private) economic sectors.Footnote 1 In short, the economy cooled, many private businesses closed, and progressively less money started circulating. Focusing the analysis on advanced economies, the private sector lost out in relative terms against the public sector because it operates primarily in activities that require physical presence (Buchanan et al. 2020) and this distinction serves as the motivation for the paper.Footnote 2 Differences in effects between the public and private sectors can undermine the economic and social cohesion and economic growth that underpins society’s standard of living. In this context, the fall in economic activity was initially an inevitable consequence of the increase in the number of patients and the government measures imposed to limit the spread of the disease. At the same time, the government was forced to impose measures to support economic activity by preserving the productive (private) sector, ensuring the possible functioning of the production machine, and avoiding excessive economic disturbances, with the intention of abolishing them upon the return to normalcy. In this process of supporting the economy, fiscal and monetary stimulus was the appropriate response in most advanced economies. A successful recovery depends on public health actions to control the virus, and also depends on policy measures by governments and central banks to stimulate income recovery for the most affected households and businesses. Such measures should ensure that businesses, jobs, and overall economic and trade networks are maintained to facilitate rapid recovery. Keeping in mind the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the paper aims to analyze the impact of the crisis on the following key macroeconomic variables: relative importance of the public and private sectors, progress and direction of technological knowledge, wage inequality between public and private sector workers, growth rate of the economy, inflation rate of the economy, and social welfare in each of the sectors. To address the differential impact of the crisis on the public and private sectors and the effects of fiscal and monetary policies on recovery, we follow, extending it, the mechanisms of the Direct Technical Change (DTC) framework—e.g., Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001), Acemoglu (2002), and Afonso (2006). Extensions to the baseline DTC model to meet the objectives contribute to several existing guidelines in the literature; in particular to the literature that examines: (i) the channels through which the current pandemic crisis may affect workers differently (e.g., Alon et al. 2020; Dingel and Neiman 2020; Mongey and Weinberg 2020; ii) the impact of economic crises on the labor market (e.g., Hoynes et al. 2012; Christiano et al. 2015; iii) the importance of policy measures to dampen economic shocks (e.g., Hoynes et al. 2012, Giupponi and Landais 2018, Cahuc et al. 2018; Kopp and Siegenthaler 2018). To further detail the methodology followed, it should be noted that, particularly since the 1980s, monetary policy has been the responsibility of central banks. Moreover, fiscal and monetary policies were constrained by binding rules aimed at avoiding excessive public deficits in the case of fiscal policy and excessive money supply in the case of monetary policy. As stated by Afonso and Forte (2021), the need for fiscal and monetary discipline was justified by the potential negative external effects resulting from excessive deficits and due to unwanted inflation. For example, in the European Monetary Union, fiscal and monetary rules were aimed at maintaining price stability to ensure external competitiveness (Baldwin and Wyplosz 2004). The need for discipline has been further reinforced by the Stability and Growth Pact rules that take, as a rule, a balanced government budget as a key medium-term objective. Fiscal discipline is therefore intended to avoid a possible increase in interest rates, avoiding pressure on central banks to implement a more expansionary monetary policy and, consequently, an increase in inflation (De Grauwe 2007), which, according to the existing theoretical and empirical literature, penalizes economic growth (e.g., Benhabib and Spiegel 2009; Afonso and Forte 2021). In any case, some public spending on R &D was encouraged (Afonso and Alves 2009; Afonso et al. 2009). In line with this procedure, to promote economic recovery, it is considered that governments can directly provide R &D subsidies by encouraging the discovery of new prototypes/designs, and they can indirectly support R &D by subsidizing the production of intermediate goods that materialize the economic use of the prototypes (Cozzi and Impullitti 2010). In the case of monetary policy, central banks have two main instruments at their disposal, which, differently, are based on increasing the amount of money in circulation in economies. The first option is to issue money, but this has little effect in the long run and causes inflation. The second option is to reduce the interest rate, stimulating credit and, consequently, consumption and investment. In general, monetary policy materializes in steering the nominal interest rate and, in this way, affects the economy—a viewpoint followed in this paper. The choice of modeling raises the question of whether liquidity matters for output in the real economy. Now the literature provides ample evidence that production requires money (Opler et al. 1999; Mikkelson and Partch 2003; Bates et al. 2009; McLean 2011). The literature that has recently introduced the demand for money into endogenous growth theory considers that money affects the economy because individuals like to have money and therefore include money in their utility function and/or money affects the economy because producers need to make payments, including cash-in-advance (CIA) constraints—Stockman (1981) and Wang and Yip (1992). In the latter case, a CIA constraint on R &D investment is generally considered (Chu and Cozzi 2014; Gil and Iglésias 2019; Afonso and Pinho 2022), since there is a strong sensitivity to R &D cash flow in firms (Brown and Petersen 2009, 2011, 2015; Brown et al. 2009, 2012; Falato and Sim 2014; Chu et al. 2017; Afonso and Pinho 2022). The effects in both cases considered by the literature—money affects the economy as individuals like to hold cash or producers/entrepreneurs need cash to make payments—are generally very similar. Thus, two different CIA constraints are considered: one faced by intermediate goods producers and the other by prototype producers in the R &D sector. Following a change in the nominal interest rate and different CIAs—between the private and public sectors, and between the intermediate goods and R &D subsectors—a force is generated that transmits inflation costs that distort incentives and the use of economic resources. In fact, private firms are considered to have greater liquidity needs and therefore need to borrow more expensive money for a given amount of investment or production. To our knowledge, there are no empirical studies that explicitly analyze the relationship between the incidence of private or public firms and their liquidity needs. However, since the government serves to ensure the fulfillment of responsibilities in the public sector, the CIA associated with the public sector is expected to be less demanding. In short, considering, (i) the abrupt fall in economic activity, expressed in the destruction of the productive capacity of the private sector in relative terms and, for us, materialized in the reduction of the respective labor productivity, and (ii) recovery driven by an increase in resources devoted to private R &D activities in the face of public intervention with subsidies and less stringent CIA constraints, we intend to analyze the effect of different packages of policy measures (scenarios) on the key variables considered, given the economic structure proposed by the DTC literature, but considering the public and private sectors. Thus, we consider that the production of final goods occurs in perfect competition in each sector and uses labor and a continuum of specific quality-adjusted intermediate goods. Intermediate goods, in turn, use prototypes (resulting from R &D activities) under monopolistic competition. Because of the close relationship between intermediate goods production and R &D, R &D can be encouraged either through direct subsidies or subsidies to intermediate goods production and can be discouraged by strong CIA constraints on R &D activity and intermediate goods production. Given the complementarity between factors of production and the substitutability between sectors, a new type of interrelationship between the above CIA constraints is introduced compared to the previous literature. Rational infinite-living dynastic households supply labor, maximize the utility obtained from the consumption of the final aggregate good, pay taxes, and obtain income from labor and investment in financial assets. In the proposed dynamic endogenous general equilibrium growth model, the aggregate final good is used in consumption and in investment. Given that public sector workers are privileged,Footnote 3 it was not without temptation to consider that they should also be sacrificed to free up resources to support the cuts borne by private sector workers. However, given that the public sector is a major employer, the prioritization of protecting all jobs, public and private,Footnote 4 pointed to the need to avoid cuts in public employment or wages as a way to escape the deepening pandemic shock. The government understanding was therefore to consider the public sector wage bill as a natural countercyclical measure. Moreover, many public sector workers provide essential services in the response to the crisis; for example, according to World Bank data, about 25% are teachers and 15% are directly or indirectly linked to health services. Finally, any reduction in the public sector workforce during the crisis would hamper economic and social recovery; that is, short-term measures to reduce the workforce and/or wage cuts create long-term distortions. As noted by Afonso and Pinho (2022), both empirical (Almus and Czarnitzki 2003; Gorg and Strobl 2007) and theoretical (Davidson and Segerstrom 1998; Zeng and Zhang 2007; Peretto 2003, 2007, 2011) studies point to the positive effects of direct and indirect R &D subsidies on economic growth, while the existing literature on the relationship between inflation and economic growth suggests otherwise (Benhabib and Spiegel 2009; Chu and Lai 2013; Chu et al. 2015). In general, there has been a positive impact of (direct and/or indirect) public intervention in R &D (Falk 2006), which has reduced the technological-knowledge gap between sectors and increased relative private sector wages. In line with the known data, the private sector is considered to have greater economic size and has recently been relatively more supported by policy measures, after having been relatively more penalized by the pandemic. The greater penalty during the pandemic justifies the differentiation in fiscal and monetary rules between sectors. We study how such intervention, conducted by the government and the central bank, can ensure a significant increase (or not) in the degree of economic cohesion. If the relationships between both types of policies—fiscal (subsidies) and monetary (nominal interest rate)—and economic growth have been widely debated among economists, the same cannot be said of the relationships between, for example, both types of policies and the other key macroeconomic variables considered. Consequently, two important questions remain: Is the relationship between both types of policies and each of these variables—technological-knowledge gap, inter-sectoral wage inequality, and welfare—conclusive? Do the sign and intensity of each relationship depend on subsidies and inflation levels? In addition to obtaining a negative relationship between inflation and the economic growth rate, the proposed model also records that private sector-oriented fiscal policy and/or an easing of CIA constraints for the private sector promote(s) a better balance across sectors in terms of technological knowledge, wage inequality, and social welfare. Despite losses in the short-to-medium run, the impact of monetary policy on economic growth, inflation, and welfare can be enhanced by introducing pecuniary transaction costs into consumption by introducing money into the utility function. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the model. Section 3 determines the equilibrium conditions. Section 4 analyses the effects of governmental intervention through numerical analysis. Section 5 extends the model by considering money demand by households and firms. Finally, Sect. 6 offers some concluding remarks.",

Nusair,Jamal A. Al-Khasawneh,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The stock market has traditionally been viewed as a barometer of economic activity (Fama 1990). It is believed that large increases in stock prices suggest a future expansion of the economy while large decreases suggest future contraction. When stock prices are rising (falling), consumer spending may increase (decrease) due to the stock market wealth effect, which, in turn, increases (decreases) business investment. For example, it is found that for every dollar increase due to stock market wealth, consumer spending rises by 3.2 cents per year (Chodorow-Reich et al. 2019). Thus, changes in stock prices affect consumer spending, which will affect the overall economy. The literature suggests that stock prices are influenced by changes in different economic and financial variables, including risk factors, business cycles, inflation, interest rates, and gross domestic product (Fama and French 1989). However, recent literature suggests that changes in oil price and EPU are two key factors that affect many economic and financial variables, including stock prices (see, for example, Kang 2022; Ziadat et al. 2022; Kwon 2020; Kang et al. 2017; Kang and Ratti 2013). Many studies examine the impact of oil price changes on stock prices with some finding a positive effect (Alamgir and Bin Amin 2021; Diaz and Perez de Gracia 2017; Le and Chang 2015; Rafailidis and Katrakilidis 2014; Narayan and Narayan 2010; Bjørnland 2009; Sadorsky 2001), others finding a negative effect (Civcir and Akkoc 2021; Joo and Park 2017; Cunado and Perez de Gracia 2014; Basher et al. 2012; Hamilton 2003), and others finding little or an insignificant effect (Kilian and Park 2009; Henriques and Sadorsky 2008). Moreover, it is also noted that the impact of oil price shocks differs depending on the source of the shock (demand versus supply shock) and whether the country is oil-importing or exporting (Hamilton 2009; Kilian 2009; Kilian and Park 2009; Wang et al. 2013). For instance, Wang et al., (2013) find a positive significant effect of demand shocks in most oil-exporting countries; an insignificant effect of oil supply shocks on the stock markets of oil-exporting countries; and a short-lived positive significant impact in oil-importing countries. Likewise, many studies examine the effect of EPU on stock prices and find a negative effect of EPU on stock prices (see, for example, Nusair and AL-Khasawneh 2022; Wen et al. 2022; Batabyal and Killins 2021; Chen and Chiang 2020; Chiang 2020; Bahmani-Oskooee and Saha 2019a, b; Peng et al. 2018). Despite their large number, most of the studies not only do not consider the joint effects of changes in oil price and EPU on stock returns, but also ignore the possibility that these effects can differ across the distribution of returns. Specifically, these studies ignore the possibility that the effects of changes in oil price and EPU may vary with stock market performance (bearish, bullish, or normal market). For example, Sim and Zhou (2015) argue that the response of stock returns to oil price changes may differ depending on whether the stock market is bearish or bullish, and the response to positive and negative oil price shocks may also be asymmetric. Therefore, oil price shocks may have heterogeneous effects on stock returns, with the effect differing with market conditions (Sim and Zhou 2015). For instance, Nusair and Al-Khasawenh (2018) find that oil price shocks have an asymmetric effect on the stock returns of the GCC countries and that the effects are affected by stock market conditions. Likewise, the effect of EPU on stock returns may be different depending on whether the market is bullish, bearish, or normal (Chang et al. 2015). Against this background, the objective of this paper is to examine the joint impact of changes in oil price and EPU on the stock market returns of the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the USA). To conduct the analysis, we use monthly data over the period 1985–2021 and utilize asymmetric quantile regression (QR) analysis to examine the asymmetric effects of changes in oil price and EPU on the stock returns of the G7 countries. The choice of the G7 countries is not surprising given that they play a vital role in the global economy as they represent the major industrialized countries in the world. In fact, events occurring in these countries are expected to have significant repercussion effects on the economies of the rest of the world. Therefore, examining the effects of changes in oil price and EPU on the stock returns of the G7 countries can provide important information for policymakers and investors not just in the G7 countries but also in other countries in the rest of the world. This paper contributes to the extant literature in several ways. First, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that examines the joint asymmetric impact of changes in oil price and EPU on the stock market returns of the G7 countries accounting for distributional heterogeneity. Second, it addresses the distributional heterogeneity of stock returns by using quantile regression (QR) analysis to examine the effects of changes in oil price and EPU on stock returns throughout the distribution of stock returns. This allows us to ascertain information on how changes in oil price and EPU may affect stock returns in different market conditions (bullish, bearish, or normal market), which can have important implications for investors in terms of risk management and predictability of stock prices. Third, it allows for asymmetries in the effects of changes in oil price and EPU by separating positive and negative changes in oil price and EPU. Examining the effects of changes in oil price and EPU on stock markets has received a great deal of attention from both investors and policymakers. Theoretically, oil price shocks can have a considerable impact on the aggregate economy as they can cause changes in relative prices, redistribute income, and change inflation expectations and real interest rates. For example, higher oil prices suggest inflationary pressures that is usually addressed by the monetary authority by raising interest rates (You et al. 2017). The higher inflation rates lead to lower real income and consumption, and higher costs of production, which hurts stock prices (Reboredo and Ugolini 2016, Narayan and Narayan 2010). Similarly, uncertainty about the future can have a considerable impact on the economy by affecting business firms and their investment decisions. Specifically, in a highly uncertain environment, business firms reduce their hiring and investment demand and postpone irreversible investments, and consumers also reduce their spending (Bernanke 1983; Bloom 2014). Moreover, uncertainty may increase financing and production costs and may affect inflation, interest rates, and risk premiums, which affects stock prices by affecting expected cash flows and discount rates (Arouri et al. 2016). Accordingly, oil price shocks and high uncertainty can have considerable impacts on the economy by affecting inflation rates, real interest rates, investment, and ultimately stock prices and stock returns. Therefore, examining how changes in oil price and EPU may affect stock returns is important for both investors and policymakers because it can provide important information on when and how to respond to these changes to minimize their negative impacts on the economy. Overall, the results show that rising and falling oil price and EPU have significant asymmetric effects on the stock returns of all the G7 countries and that these asymmetric effects are related to market conditions (whether the market is bearish, bullish, or normal). An overall negative effect of EPU and a positive effect of oil price are observed on stock returns in all the countries. The results show that while rising EPU lowers stock returns in most countries during bearish and/or normal market, falling EPU is either insignificant or increases stock returns only when stock markets are bullish. Besides, we find that stock returns in most countries are affected by rising and falling oil prices when stock markets are bearish or bullish. Furthermore, the results show that the impacts of positive changes in oil price and EPU are more important and larger than that of the negative changes and that the impacts are mainly during extreme market conditions when markets are bearish and/or bullish. Our findings have important policy implications for both investors and policymakers. The results show that changes in oil price and EPU have significant effects on the stock returns in the G7 countries and that these effects are asymmetric and related to market conditions. Therefore, investors and policymakers should pay close attention to these changes and should know when and how to respond to them. For example, while falling EPU does not affect stock returns in Canada, France, and the USA, rising EPU reduces stock returns in Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the USA only when stock markets are bearish and/or normal. This suggests that while investors and policymakers in Canada, France, and the USA should not respond to falling EPU, they should respond to rising EPU in Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the USA only when stock markets are bearish and/or normal. Moreover, the results show that the impact of positive changes in EPU is more important and larger than that of the negative changes. This suggests that policymakers should devote more attention to rising EPU than falling EPU. We also find that positive oil price changes in most countries are more important than the negative changes and that the impact is positive and mainly during extreme market conditions when stock markets are bearish and bullish. This implies that policymakers should devote more attention to rising than falling oil price and should avoid uncertain information concerning oil price changes that may lead to more volatility in stock markets, notably when markets are bearish or bullish. The remaining of the papers is structured as follows. The literature review is provided in section two and the theory and methodology in section three. The data and empirical results are discussed in section four, and section five concludes and provides policy recommendations.",1

The aim is to meet the daily needs of the population and product movements (Mitoula et al. 2008). Today, citizens’ quality of life depends on an efficient and accessible transport system. However, at the same time, transport can be detrimental to the environment and contribute to climate change (Halkos et al. 2020). Studies have shown that in the European Union, the transport sector consumes one-third of the total final energy, mainly from oil, and that transport contributes to a quarter of the total greenhouse gas emissions (Mitoula and Economou 2008). While most other economic sectors, such as electricity generation and industry, have reduced their emissions since 1990, transport emissions have increased. Cars, vans, trucks, and buses produce more than 70% of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. (Halkos et al. 2014) It is noted that the remaining emissions come mainly from shipping and air transport (New Climate Economy 2016). In addition to the above issues concerning the effects of transport on climate, there are other adverse effects: transport infrastructure occupies large areas of land, supports urban sprawl, and divides natural areas into smaller sections, with severe consequences for animals and plants. Nevertheless, urban rail networks and the Metro have grown rapidly around the world and play an essential role in the growth of cities (Ward and Skayannis 2019). Their significance stems from the numerous benefits they represent. Combined with the rapid growth of urban centres and overcrowding (Alaimo et al. 2022), these benefits have made urban railway networks and the Metro essential structural and functional elements of a modern city (Mitoula et al. 2003). The present work refers to the Athens Metro, a mega infrastructure project in the transport field (Skayannis 2021). The influence of the project on sustainable development is investigated through the opinion of its users based on the model of the fundamental pillars of sustainable development (Vardopoulos 2021). Thus, the Athens Metro provides a case study to improve our understanding of the concept of Sustainable Infrastructure as a framework for Green Growth through social opinion as the users and city experience the influence of Athens Metro in their daily life. The study’s goal is to compile data on the Athens Metro and its synergy with the city’s and country’s sustainable development so that its multifaceted impact on the locals and visitors to Athens, as well as the economy and market at large, can be better understood. Furthermore, the findings from the questionnaire collection contain sufficient and valuable information about the operation, the pros and cons of the Athens Metro, and its reputation among the citizens who use it and benefit from it in various ways. Finally, the research implications can contribute to the design of future studies for the Athens Metro, aiming to evaluate the contribution of large construction projects to sustainable development. Sustainable development’s economic, social, and environmental pillars are undeniably interdependent (Vardopoulos et al. 2020). The social pillar is a crucial and necessary component of the success of the fundamental model of three pillars, encompassing social well-being, societal and economic growth, and security. This investigation will focus primarily on social comprehension and acceptance of the Athens Metro’s effects on sustainable development. We attempt to confirm the interdependence of the three pillars model for sustainable development through public opinion and responses to our research. In comprehending the society impacted by this mega infrastructure project, we attempt to determine whether or not the economy, society, and environment are basic foundational elements of sustainable development. To support our research objectives, we developed a statistical model of the interdependence formulas of the three pillars of sustainable development, complete with dependent and independent variables, which be fed by public responses to a prototype questionnaire designed to evaluate and measure the public understanding and acceptance of mega infrastructure projects' contribution to sustainable development.",1

Chen et al. (2013), for example, highlight several factors that explain the external imbalances in the Eurozone. While the Netherlands and Germany registered significant external surpluses, Portugal and Greece had substantial external deficits, with values ​​outside the range defined in the Excessive Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure (MIP) from European Commission, i. e., between − 4 and 6% of GDP for the current account balance. In this regard, Carrasco (2018) concludes that countries such as Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands have structural external surpluses, whereas Greece, Portugal and Spain have structural external deficits. Afonso and Jalles (2018) report a negative effect of the Global Financial Crisis on the cyclical component of the current account balance for Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Latvia. As of 2010, with the sovereign debt crisis in Greece and the subsequent contagion to other peripheral economies (see Lane 2012), the external imbalances verified in some Eurozone countries faded, especially in deficit countries. Some countries also exhibited chronic and persistent budget deficits, above 3% of GDP, as stipulated in the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). In addition, public debt rose to high values ​​in some countries, in parallel with external debt, occurring twin debts, and not just twin deficits. In fact, there are several articles that study the relationship between the budget balance and the current account balance applied to the European Union and the Eurozone (see, for instance, Forte and Magazzino 2013, 2015; Vamvoukas and Spilioti 2015; Brissimis et al. 2013; and Gehringer 2015). However, the cyclically adjusted primary government balance (CAPB) is not used as a fiscal variable, only the budget balance is used. The CAPB is assumed as an adequate measure, since, on the one hand, it provides information about the structural component of the primary budget balance, and, on the one hand, it is corrected for cyclical fluctuations in output. This is particularly relevant in the context of investigating the relationship between the budget balance and the current account balance, considering that both balances are influenced by cyclical fluctuations in output. This is one of the innovative elements of this work. The other innovative element is related to the exploration of potential explanatory factors of the time-varying responses of the current account balance vis-à-vis changes in the CAPB and the budget balance. In this analysis, we assume that, to some extent, responses vary within and across countries. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review, both theoretical and empirical. Section 3 presents the methodology. Section 4 reports the empirical analysis. Section 5 concludes.",

As shown in Feijo et al. (2016), Asada (2012), and Hall (1980), stabilization policies typically focus on the variation of the cyclical component of investment rate within the economic and financial cycle. Cyclical overinvestment results from an investment boom in the upper phase of the economic/financial cycle with significant effects on (among others) increasing sovereign default rate (Park 2017), intensifying international trade conflicts (Schnabl 2019), and factor markets distortions (Gu 2014). Cyclical underinvestment is typically a result of a deep financial crisis that leads to worsening lending conditions in countries with less developed financial sectors (Corneli 2009), causing a global savings glut and large current account imbalances in a globalized world. It is also a consequence of massive austerity measures applied by the government to prevent the country’s over-indebtedness (Christodoulakis and Axioglou 2017), which leads to deep disinvestments that have serious adverse effects on long-term growth and employment in the Eurozone. Besides cyclical over/underinvestment, some countries might deal with the significant suboptimal and unsustainable long-term speed of capital accumulation of a structural (cycle-adjusted) character. Structural over/underinvestment is represented by investments that are not in line with the structural characteristics of an economy relevant to the growth of productive capital assets (like total factor productivity, potential economic growth, the marginal product of capital, cost of capital, risk, and regulation). It is difficult to identify whether the country is structurally or cyclically over/underinvested (or both), making it difficult to distinguish between cyclically or structurally oriented policy measures that policy institutions must apply to restore the equilibrium. Restrictive/expansionary stabilization policy measures that work fine for the cyclical component typically do not work for the structural one that is more micro and institution-based (for a variety of causes and policy actions, see a role of government credit guarantee for underinvestment in Adhikary et al. (2021), an impact of improvement in accounting information comparability for investment efficiency reducing the extent of underinvestment in Yang et al. (2021) and underinvestment in higher education in the US and its consequences for optimal development and economic growth as in McMahon (2018)). Current research on macroeconomic structural over/underinvestment is rather limited. The research primarily focuses on the impact of a single structural factor on the suboptimal size of investments in a single country and not on the simultaneous effects of a set of structural factors in a panel of countries. The effect of expected technological progress that increases the productivity of future generation of capital assets as a reason for current underinvestment is analyzed in Feichtinger et al. (2006). Chou et al. (2018) show that despite fast capital accumulation in emerging and transition countries, the rate of return on invested capital does not decline, which means that these countries are still underinvested. Abel and Eberly (1999) show that irreversibility and uncertainty increase the cost of capital, leading to lower-than-optimal capital stock. Investors’ irrationality and uncertainty in investment decision-making might result in over/underinvestment, as shown in Driver and Temple (2012). Dalmazzo and Marini (2000) analyze political instability and insecure proper rights as a source of underinvestment. The impact of capital assets underinvestment and labor market over-employment on the effects of higher minimum wage on capital accumulation, wage distribution, and change of employment are modeled in Bauducco and Janiak (2018).
 Because a specific phase of the investment cycle does not significantly affect the current level of the capital-to-output ratio if it is not followed by long-term investment disequilibria (capital being defined as cumulative investments reduced by cumulative capital depreciation), we chose to set structural unsustainability condition based on both the rate of investment and the capital-to-output ratio. We consider the rate of investments as structurally unsustainable (suboptimal) if it significantly over/undershoots its equilibrium level and if, at the same time, existed capital-to-output ratio is significantly higher/lower than the equilibrium one. It allows us not to consider the economies, which are cyclically over/underinvested, but their capital-to-output ratio is in line with structural characteristics of the economy, structurally over/underinvested. It also allows us to focus on the countries that struggle with over/underinvestment and avoid the countries that face up short-term deviations of investment rate out of the equilibrium. An equilibrium rate of investment is usually estimated either by theoretical derivation from the steady-state condition of the Solow-Swan growth model or the Cobb–Douglas production function (Shioji and Khai 2012) or using implied equilibrium derived from the econometric model of investment using theoretically based structural factors (Lee et al. 2012). Applying a neoclassical growth model/production function to derive the equilibrium rate of investment is highly sensitive to a selection of the method determining the equilibrium values of capital, potential economic growth rate, and equilibrium growth rate of the total factor productivity. They are directly unobservable variables either estimated mechanically by applying different kinds of filters whose parameters are difficult to justify economically as consistent with the concept of equilibrium or set as specifically targeted values at a level of capital accumulation of a mature country the economies should converge to. The fact that economies vary significantly with their structural factors further complicates setting a country’s equilibrium investment rate. Finally, the Solow-Swan growth model and the Cobb–Douglas production function do not see the equilibrium capital accumulation as a part of the intertemporal optimization of consumption/savings of rational agents to differentiate between transitory and long-term disequilibria. Resulting combinations of equilibrium values of capital, potential economic growth, and growth of the total factor productivity produce a wide range of the equilibrium investments rate, making an analysis of structural over/underinvestment potentially very fragile. The implied equilibrium allows determining the equilibrium rate of investment as a time-variable country-specific equilibrium based on the deterministic part of an econometric model of capital accumulation estimated using the country’s structural characteristics as investment’s economic fundamentals on a large sample of countries. It allows us to consider the cross-country differences in their structural factors and their different inter-temporal preferences over the current and future consumption/speed of capital accumulation. To overcome an inherent conflict between the concept of equilibrium used in macroeconomics and the optimality used in microeconomics, we employ both macroeconomic and microeconomic structural factors of capital accumulation in deriving the implied equilibrium. The equilibrium rate of investment derived in a tradition of the Solow-Swan growth model and the Cobb–Douglas production function also does not take into account that capital goods are long-term assets that rational economic agents can accumulate more/less than it would correspond to the current equilibrium when they expect significant structural changes in the economy in the future. In this case, over/underinvestment may be a transitory phenomenon that does not require any cardinal changes in economic policies and behavior of economic agents because it is in line with the intertemporal optimum of the utility-maximizing rational economic agent in his consumption/savings/capital assets production decisions. While intertemporal optimization of consumption/savings becomes an inherent part of the intertemporal approach to current account balance (Razin 1993; Obstfeld and Rogoff 1995; Milesi-Ferretti and Razin 1996) that states the current account equilibrium to be given by sustainable time-variable relation of current consumption and future savings driven by time preferences of consumers, the speed of capital accumulation, that has the same effect on the current account as the formation of saving, is not typically considered within a framework of intertemporal optimization. From the perspectives of the intertemporal approach, capital accumulation assumes that the utility of using currently purchased long-term capital assets can be consumed not only today but also in the future when changing structural characteristics of the economy might change demand for capital assets and their production and when the price of capital assets and funding costs of capital accumulation might be higher/lower than in the current period. Therefore, utility optimization can lead rational agents to purchase capital assets today in expectation of future changes in structural factors of capital accumulation, price of capital assets, and cost of funding making capital accumulation more expensive. Demographic changes associated with a change in the population’s age, size, and structure result from changes in birth and death rates, life expectancy, size of the economically active population, frequency of single-person households, and changing migration intensity. d’Albis (2007) presents an OLG model to analyze the ambiguous effects of an exogenous shift in the birth rate capital-to-capita ratio. His conclusions are tested by Lau (2009), who confirms positive relation between population growth and capital accumulation but not in the case of industrial counties. Voigtländer and Voth (2006) show that a limitation of fertility is responsible for higher per capita incomes and industrialization during England's industrial revolution using the OLG model with endogenous retirement decisions Dedry et al. (2017) show that lower fertility and higher longevity affects the speed of accumulation differently based on a type of pension system (unregulated retirement age systems or mandatory retirement systems with defined contributions fare). Ludwig and Vogel (2010) find that changes in mortality and fertility, which increases population age, lead to more education that increases the relative return of human capital over the physical capital and, subsequently, their speed of accumulation. Demographic changes that increase the age of the population are expected to occur in many countries in the nearest decades (UN 2015, 2022), which naturally affects the speed of capital accumulation (see the impact of alternative scenarios of demographic changes on the dynamics of capital accumulation in the neoclassical growth model in Mierau and Turnovsky (2014)). Such complex changes in demographic factors influence equilibrium investment through a change in the growth rate of natural employment (Cai 2015; Barnichon and Figura 2016; Crary 2000; Krashevski 1988) and labor productivity (Choudhry et al. 2016; Guest 2011; Canning 2011; Guest and Swift 2008), an adaptation of equilibrium capital-to-output ratio (Chen, and Lin 2021; Stirati 2017; Gros 2014) and real interest rate (Papetti 2021; Sudo and Takizuka 2020; Carvalho et al. 2016; Ikeda and Saito 2014), or implicitly due to changes in the capital-to-labor ratio (Pessoa and Van Reenen 2014; Nguyen and Smith 2007; Miles 1999) and the ratio of labor costs to capital costs (Cullmann and Stiel 2022; De la Croix et al. 2013). Investments are also influenced by population aging, which initiates the structural transformation of the economic system. Siliverstovs et al. (2011) identify positive effects of aging on the share of employees in the community, social, personal, and financial services and negative effects on employment in agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and mining and quarrying industries. The conclusions are confirmed by Cravino et al. (2022), who show that population aging increases the size of the service sector, which is less capital-intensive. The effects of population aging on investments could be analyzed from a broader perspective as a consequence of changing volatility of main macroeconomic factors like in Guimaraes and Tiryaki (2020), who link an increasing age of the population and increasing output volatility due to changing labor market and international volatility while consumption and investment volatility are decreasing at the same time. Jäger and Schmidt (2016) find a long-term negative relationship between the share of elderly people and public investment rates in developed countries, assuming that old-age cohorts prefer a lower investment rate than middle-aged cohorts. As far as we know, no existing research analyzes the relationship between the phenomenon of over/underinvestment and population aging using a large panel of countries. Therefore, the article’s objective is to identify over/underinvested economies using the panel of 154 countries in 2005–2017 and to verify whether identified over/underinvestment is related to expected population aging measured by the United Nations’ prediction of old dependency ratio. We figure out the size of over/underinvestment and analyze the frequency of over/underinvested countries in the dataset based on changing horizon of demographic prediction. Next, the group of long-term and middle-term over/underinvested countries is identified. In order to test stability of the OLS estimations of the benchmark model, we provide four robustness checks: (a) benchmark model is estimated by the 2SLS to consider the potential impact of endogeneity on the OLS estimations, (b) the OLS and the 2SLS models with the alternative demographic variables related to population aging (death rate, birth rate, and life expectancy at birth) are estimated to consider the effects of demographic variable choice representing population aging; (c) the OLS and the 2SLS models using country’s institutional quality (Economic freedom index and its sub-parts like Investment freedom, Business freedom and Property rights indices, and Fragility index) are estimated to analyze the effects of using alternative proxies instead of risk premium, and transaction and administrative costs, and finally, (d) the size of over/underinvestment, the frequency of over/underinvested countries, and the group of long-term and middle-term over/underinvested countries is tested in order to analyze how they are sensitive to changes in the method of model estimation and usage of alternative demographic variables representing population aging. We find that the current rate of capital accumulation is determined by expected population aging measured by the old-age dependency ratio up to a relatively long period of 31 years. The estimations also indicate that the extent of overinvestment is distinctly larger than that of underinvestment. We present that a transition between the levels of over/underinvestment and disappearance of over/underinvestment does occur in times of insignificant cyclical component in investments. It is shown that the combination of the rate of investment model and capital-to-output ratio model results in a decrease in the frequency of structurally over/underinvested countries. Finally, we identified three structurally long-term overinvested economies and nine long-term underinvested economies, while four countries are medium-term overinvested and three countries are underinvested. The robustness checks show that all these results are not significantly influenced by the methods of estimations, choice of demographic variables representing population aging, and alternative country’s institutional quality characteristics. The article is organized as follows: Part 2 provides a short discussion on structural determinants of investment based on the macroeconomic concept of equilibrium investment and the microeconomic concept of optimal capital used in the production of the optimizing agent. The next part presents a review of the literature with a focus on demographic determinants of the investment rate. Parts 4 and 5 describe data used in empirical analysis and clarify in detail the form and method of estimating the econometric model of implied equilibrium. Part 6 presents the results of the estimation and provides their interpretation. The final part comes up with conclusions.",

Since then, this relationship has been known as “Okun’s law.” Accordingly, unemployment and output are inversely related according to Okun’s law, that is, a 3 percent increase in output growth causes the unemployment rate to decline by 1 percent. Different studies pointed out that the estimated Okun’s coefficients may vary from 3 percent, as indicated in Okun (1962). Several studies have been conducted on Okun’s relationship and its stability. For instance, Knotek (2007) stated the instability of Okun’s law. In contrast, Ball et al. (2019) asserted the stability and validity of Okun’s relationships across countries. Furthermore, there might be a new aspect that drives the instability of Okun’s law. In this respect, many recent studies have introduced a sectoral approach to Okun’s relationship. These studies have considered the different responses of the unemployment rate to output growth in different economic sectors (Apap and Gravino 2017; Dimian et al. 2018; Goto and Bürgi 2020). Oil-producing countries' main economic characteristic is the substantial share of oil revenues over the total GDP that is at the same time a major source of government revenues. As a consequence, oil rents are considered as a key driver of economic growth in many oil-rich countries where the output share of the competent economic sectors, such as agriculture, industry, and services, displays reduced contribution over GDP and affects less economic growth. The oil sector leaves limited resources to the development of other non-oil sectors (Matallah 2020) within these economies. Hence, the varying sectoral behavior across countries may drive the cross-country differences in Okun's law at the aggregate and disaggregated levels. Furthermore, the theoretical and empirical studies by Amiri et al. (2019) and Corden and Neary (1982) indicated evident resource dependence of economic output as well as employment and unemployment levels in the competent sectors within an economy across oil-producing countries. Based on these findings, we can assume in our approach that oil rents as a crucial resource may drive the output and unemployment level of the competent economic sectors and to fluctuate differently over the business cycles, producing different Okun’s coefficients at the sectoral level. In this short study, we re-examine this issue by analyzing the magnitude of Okun’s coefficient at the sectoral level. We investigate the sectoral approach of Okun’s law as it relates to oil dependency. The innovation of this paper over the previous studies is the focus on “sectoral” rather than the “aggregate” Okun’s coefficient. Normally, the aggregate level of Okun’s law is examined since unemployment refers to the whole economy. However, with the view presented above, it is more meaningful to test and explore whether oil rents weaken other economic sectors and affect unemployment in resource-rich countries. Besides, this paper makes a novel contribution to the literature that studied the sectoral specification of Okun’s law, such as Apap and Gravino (2017) and Goto and Bürgi (2020). We explore the response of unemployment to different sectors’ output growth using the sectoral version of Okun’s law in the context of oil-producing countries. In this respect, countries highly dependent on oil incomes from those less dependent on such revenues are differentiated. In contrast to the above studies, our analysis includes the impact of the interaction term between oil rents and sectoral output growth to explore whether oil rents cause a different response or sensitivity of unemployment to the sectoral output changes. It is essential to understand whether the oil sector’s output succeeded in achieving sustainable economic growth and, therefore, a low unemployment rate, in other words, escaping the so-called resource curse. In this study, we consider the role of oil dependence on the responsiveness of unemployment to output growth in the manufacturing, agriculture, and service sectors by employing a panel ARDL model for 17 oil-producing countries from 2000 to 2019. Countries where oil rents contribute highly to the total GDP are chosen in the current analysis. Following Groce (2020) and Markowitz et al. (2020), oil-producing countries were defined as if oil rents account for at least 10% of GDP. By linking the oil dependence to the sectoral approach of Okun’s law, we are able to examine whether the so-called resource curse phenomenon affects the performance of the economic sectors and unemployment rates. To answer the research question, we include the interaction term in the analysis to explore whether oil rents weaken the other sectors in resource-rich countries. Since the emphasis on long-run relationships becomes a significant part of macroeconomic modeling, modern macroeconomic modeling becomes more dynamic and employs lag variables as part of panel data analysis. Thus, the current paper applied the CS-ARDL and PMG estimators to investigate the possible association between the unemployment rate and sectoral output growth in the long and short runs. The rest of the study is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the literature review and the relevant studies. The empirical methodology and data are introduced in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents the empirical results containing the baseline and the extensions analysis. Lastly, Sect. 5 concludes.",

Simultaneously, Islamic countries have become more concerned about how ethical and social consumption factors affect Islamic finance (Ahmad et al. 2018). By its nature, Islamic finance addresses sustainability and accountability. Therefore, the rules of governance were taken into account to expand the sustainable base, which has been proven in COVID-19 from a commercial point of view (Awan et al. 2011). The solid foundation of the Islamic economy, which is based on the importance of the global economy, has led to an increased demand for products and services based on Islamic law. Islamic finance helps create value for consumers and achieve global social welfare through social awareness (Ahmad et al. 2018). According to the Islamic Financial Services Industry Stability Report (IFSISR, 2020), global Islamic assets grew by 7.8% from 2014 to 2019 due to a consistent approach to Islamic finance and strong investments in infrastructure, sukuk, and Islamic funds. Global Islamic financial assets grew by 14.4% year-on-year to reach $2,875 billion in 2019, representing a 2% increase from 2018; this growth was the result of electronic transactions for financial products and services. Sukuk increased by 14.5% year-on-year to reach $538 billion in 2018 (IFSISR 2020). Iran and Saudi Arabia have a strong focus on Islamic assets, which represented 66% of total assets in 2019 in both countries. Bahrain has the highest percentage of Islamic financing assets as a percentage of GDP (124%) followed by Malaysia (53%), Iran (47%), Kuwait (43%) and Qatar (40%) (IFSISR, 2020). Islamic bank's number has increased, creating a competitive market with commercial banks in many Islamic countries where high-quality services are provided (Fakhrunnas and Ramly 2017). Muslim population increases in the Middle East and North Africa and South Asia have led to an increase in the number of banking services that are compliant with Islamic law in those regions (Fiador and Sarpong-Kumankoma 2020). Although compliance with Shari’ah is the basis of every Islamic banking institution, there are differences in the application of Shari’ah views in different countries and regions, especially between the Middle East and Malaysia. Most central banks and financial institutions have recently started to adopt Islamic accounting and auditing standards. The Islamic banking industry is considered the largest sector in the Islamic industry, with around 69.3% of the industry’s assets in 2019 (IFSISR, 2020). However, the total share of Islamic banking services decreased by 73% in 2014 due to the increased use of Sukuk and Islamic funds as Islamic capital market instruments, with a growth of 7% during the past five years. The Islamic banking sector began to grow in 2016 and rose by 14% in 2019 to reach $2 billion in global assets (IFSISR, 2020). This growth can be Rochet explained by improvements in the assets of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which witnessed the merger of many Islamic banks to enhance competitiveness, attract stable deposits, and improve banking efficiency. Globally, the GCC countries account for 45.2% of total Islamic banking assets (IFSISR 2020). Saudi Arabia (USD 551.1 billion) leads the GCC in terms of Islamic banking assets, followed by the UAE (USD 162.7 billion), Kuwait (USD 127.1 billion), and Qatar (USD 121.7 billion). Saudi Arabia recorded a double-digit growth rate in Islamic assets in 2020, while Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar remained stable amid adverse economic fluctuations due to the COVID-19 pandemic (IFSISR, 2020). Islamic banks play an important role in the sustainability of Islamic finance in Oman by enhancing their commitment to sustainable economic growth and promoting an inclusive financial and economic system. This role is in line with many of Oman Vision 2040’s principles, such as financial sector stability, economic growth, reduced poverty, wealth distribution, and financial and social inclusion. Islamic financial institutions help customers by integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into their businesses and financing activities to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By engaging in strategic collaborations on banking supervision, technology adoption, accounting, and audit standards, Islamic banks have minimised the key legal and Shari’ah governance-related challenges faced by Islamic banks and accelerated financial deepening and inclusion in Oman. Islamic banking was adopted in Oman at the end of 2012 earning huge profits and enjoying a high asset quality rating, which enabled competition with traditional banks. By the end of 2020, more than 80 Islamic bank branches and Islamic banking windows were offering services using finance tools (Central Bank of Oman 2022). The main Islamic banks were Bank Nizwa and Alizz Islamic Bank, and traditional banks operated six Islamic banking windows. The growth trend of Islamic banking increased by 11.6% in 2021, and the market share of Islamic banks and Islamic banking windows increased from 14.3% at the end of 2020 to 15.2% at the end of 2021, representing OMR 5.9 billion in total assets. The financing for Islamic banking mostly came from government and public enterprise projects, which reflect the fastest-growing in the GCC regarding Shari’ah-compliant banking services in GCC countries. Although Shari’ah-compliant banking services have a positive trajectory in the short to medium term, there are many challenges. However, the Oman Banks Association’s awareness of Islamic tools, favorable legislation, and fair and ethical practices has created a strong demand for Islamic services. According to the Central Bank of Oman (2022), the total assets of Oman Islamic banks and Islamic banking windows increased by 10.7% in 2021 to reach OMR 6 billion in 2022. Oman’s Islamic banking assets accounted for 15.4% of overall banking sector assets in 2022. Moreover, Islamic banking has boosted financial inclusivity, accelerated economic development, and increased investment stability. In Oman, despite an increase in the number of changes to the economic market, regulatory improvements and market maturity enhancements were evident in 2019 and 2020. Meanwhile, the annual growth slowed to 6% in 2020 from 11% in 2019 (IFSISR, 2020). Islamic banking continued to rise in Oman in the last three years, which was rated in 2020 as the second fastest-growing Islamic finance market in the world by Moody’s (IFSISR, 2020). Oman recorded an annual deposit growth rate of 6% in 2020, which was slower than the 2019 rate of 10% and was attributed to a drop in oil prices. Islamic bank deposits amounted to nearly four million Omani riyals, and their share of the total rose to 14% in 2020, compared to 13% in 2018 (IFSISR, 2020). Islamic finance in Oman reached 16% of total financing in 2020, with a growth rate of 9% in 2020 to reach four million Omani riyals as a result of the increasing demand for Islamic products and support from Islamic windows in traditional banks that offer Islamic products (IFSISR, 2020). The Central Bank of Oman issued a financial technology protection fund in 2020 to enhance the environment for Islamic financial entrepreneurs by providing guidance and access to investors. In that same year, Oman launched the first online Takaful platform, through which eight companies provide insurance coverage, including travel and property insurance. In recent years, Islamic finance has emerged and become associated with the traditional banking system. Islamic financial activities must be compatible with Shari’ah (Wilson 2009; Hassan, 2010; Grassa 2013), and Shari’ah governance has emerged in many countries as an important framework that supports sustainability and the needs of Islamic financial institutions. However, the absence of a unified comprehensive Shari’ah governance framework impedes global financial development. Shari’ah governance is a specific characteristic of corporate governance in the financial structure that concerns the religious aspects of the activities and conduct of Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) (Hasan 2010). According to Standard 10 of the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), a Shari’ah governance system refers to regulatory arrangements and legislation that have been created to ensure that international financial institutions respond to and comply with Shari’ah as well as their own internal provisions (IFSISR, 2020). According to Principle 3.1 of the IFSB Guiding Principles on Corporate Governance, the best mechanism should be adopted to ensure compliance with the Shari’ah principles of tawhid (the Oneness of Allah), the shura process (consultation), property rights and contractual obligations. Iqbal and Mirakhor (2004) indicated that, from an Islamic perspective, governance refers to Shari’ah governance, which covers overall governance issues as well as the protection of stakeholders’ rights, meaning in the past only stakeholder models were used to explore governance issues. The sustainability features of financing projects can be evaluated by comparing the international financing methods and sustainability practices used in different sectors and determining whether the financial policy establishes a framework to harmonise environmental issues, society, and financial sector governance (Kammer et al. 2015; Zawawi et al. 2014). The role of Islamic finance can be determined by participating in the development of infrastructure within private sources (Campisi et al. 2017). Furthermore, the Islamic financial sector was included in the fiscal policy of governments to diversify the sector and enhance its resilience against negative shocks (Abbes and Trichilli 2015; Saiti et al. 2014). Islamic finance is based on profit and loss sharing (PLS) and avoids risk as much as possible to prevent usury (Diaw 2015). Financing tools, including interest-free loans, are used to achieve real assets that provide a reasonable and fair reward for investment in the form of a fixed share, which is linked to the real economy and is not just a tool for recovering liquidity (Campisi et al. 2017). Song and Oosthuizen (2014) and López Mejía et al. (2014) argued that Islamic banks are less likely to withdraw deposits and are more stable than commercial banks; however, they noted that banking systems may differ significantly from country to country based on the policies of their banks. To measure sustainable investing, the present study used variables that were likely to have the greatest impact on the financing and returns of Shari’ah-compliant products and services: capital adequacy, risk sensitivity, and asset quality. Most studies have focused on the traditional motivations for opening Islamic banks, namely, increased profit and economic and social development. The present study employed a broader focus by examining several factors that influence the adoption of Islamic banking. The first factor was religious motivation, which influences customer behavior. The second factor, which also affects customer behaviour, concerns the quality of service and brand awareness. These attributes play key roles in Islamic products, which are all based on Shari’ah compliance. The third factor, sustainable investing, is strongly supported by Oman Vision 2040, which states that Islamic banks should promote financial stability and economic growth, reduce poverty, wealth distribution, and financial and social inclusion. The present study aimed to examine the financing and returns of Shari’ah-compliant contracts and sustainable investing in Islamic banking in Oman over quarterly periods from 2014 to 2020. Islamic financing instruments were evaluated based on three pillars: murābahah, ijārah muntahia bittamlīk, and wakālah. Murabaha represents a sales contract that is owned by a buyer at the request of a debtor and sold at a deferred price over time and at the cost of purchase plus price margins. jārah muntahia bittamlīk refers to a contract between a debtor and a creditor in which the latter buys an asset at a specified price and then rents it to the borrower for a monthly amount and receives remuneration by charging periodic fees for the leased asset. At the end of the contract, the debtor obtains ownership of the asset. In a wakālah transaction, the main account holder appoints an Islamic financing institution (agent) to carry out investment activities on his/her behalf in order to recycle liquidity in the short term within the terms of the Islamic banking system. This study also aimed to fill a research gap that emerged based on the importance of the Islamic economy in normal economic conditions and repeated financial crises over the past few decades. Over the past four decades, the Islamic economy has awoken from a stage of deep slumber, prompting a deep in economic analyses. However, the literature still needs more research on the role of Islamic finance and returns in supporting sustainable governance. This study offers four main contributions to the literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of few studies to analyse the returns of Shari’ah-compliant contracts through three proxies: the total financing and returns of murābahah, ijārah muntahia bittamlīk and wakālah Islamic banking tools. Second, this study shows the importance of investing in the sustainability of Shari’ah governance and the importance of Islamic banking. Third, the geographic location of Oman and its stable regulations have led Oman to have a high percentage of oil rents compared to other GCC countries and the rest of the world which raises the novelty of this study. Finally, the autoregressive distributive lag model (ARDL) technique and the error correction model (ECM) were applied to examine the relationship between the financing and returns of Shari’ah-compliant contracts and sustainable investing measured by Shari’ah governance. The main research question was as follows: Do the financing and returns of Shari’ah-compliant contracts promote sustainable investing in the Islamic banking system of Oman? The study findings should capture the attention of policymakers and help them rethink funding techniques, extend their analysis to different cultural and financial models, and recognise the importance of Islamic financing tools for sustainable investments based on Shari’ah governance. The findings can also drive the future application of alternative financing instruments that are able to minimise the cost of funds and sustain investments and are devoted to the reduction of risk and its negative effects on sustainability investments. This paper is organised into five sections. Section 1 presents the introduction and motivation for this research. Section 2 describes the literature review framework. Section 3 describes the methodology and econometric models used in the study. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 contains a discussion of the results. Finally, Sect. 6 includes the conclusion, policy implications, and recommendations for future research.",

These diasporas significantly affect their countries of origin, including their social, political, and economic environments, as discussed by social scientists. Economists have investigated how diasporas impact the economy of the origin countries, particularly in terms of economic development (Bahar 2020). One of the most hotly debated issues is the role of remittances, with two opposing views: an optimistic one that sees positive effects and a pessimistic one that denies them (Clemens and McKenzie 2018; Naudé et al. 2017; Yang 2011). One less explored issue regarding the role of remittances in the economy is their impact on creating new firms. This paper aims to address this gap and examine whether the economic complexity of a country is relevant for understanding the impact of remittances on new firm creation. Our research is framed around three key points. Firstly, in the last few decades, remittances have grown exponentially from $122 million in 2000 to $706 million in 2020, representing a more than fivefold increase (Fig. 1) (World Bank 2021). In many countries, remittances have become the primary financial flow, surpassing foreign direct investment and official development assistance flows. Furthermore, a significant portion of international remittances is transmitted through informal channels and goes unrecorded in official statistics.Footnote 1 The growing importance of remittances for investment purposes has drawn the attention of scholars in various fields, such as economics, management, entrepreneurship, and international development agencies (Ratha 2003, 2007). Although remittances are primarily used for non-investment purposes, such as food, housing, and education, they have been shown to stimulate new investments as a source of financial funds. In fact, many studies have suggested that remittances play a potentially positive role in new business creation. Single-country (e.g., Kiliç et al. 2009; Woodruff and Zenteno 2007) and cross-country studies (e.g., Cummings et al. 2021; Yavuz and Bahadir 2022) have found a positive correlation between remittances and new business activities. These studies hypothesize that remittances increase entrepreneurial activities by providing financial resources for new investments. Migrant remittance inflows (US$ million) Source: World Bank Secondly, new firms generate more employment than larger incumbent firms (Haltiwanger 2015), and this explains why policymakers try to design policy incentives to promote entrepreneurship (Ratinho et al. 2020). However, in many countries, particularly low-income ones, there is a lack of capital needed to start new firms. If remittances from migrants can provide an alternative and additional source of funding for new businesses, it could significantly benefit the economic and social well-being of these countries. Thirdly, it is surprising that the connection between economic complexity and entrepreneurship has received little attention in the literature. According to Nguyen et al. (2021), existing empirical studies on the determinants of entrepreneurship tend to adopt either a micro- or macro-perspective, occasionally exploring the impact of government efficiency and institutional quality. However, they overlook the crucial role of the economy’s structure in entrepreneurship. In a recent survey, Ratinho et al. (2020) suggest that future research should investigate the relationship between economic structure and entrepreneurship. In this paper, we make several contributions to the literature. Firstly, we show that the impact of real per capita remittances (REM) on new firm creation is inversely mediated by economic complexity. Since economic complexity is positively correlated with economic development, remittances are more likely to facilitate the establishment of new firms in less developed economies rather than in more advanced ones. Secondly, our sub-sample analysis for high and upper-middle-income (HUMI) countries on the one hand and low- and lower-middle-income (LLMI) countries on the other corroborates our hypothesis regarding the positive impact of REM on new limited liability company (NLLC) creation in LLMI countries and the negative impact in HUMI countries. Furthermore, in both sub-samples the economic complexity index (ECI) negatively mediates the impact of REM on NLLC. Thirdly, the sub-sample analysis at the regional level (Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean) reveals that in Africa, the average marginal effect of REM on NLLC creation is negative, despite increasing as ECI grows. In Asia, the average marginal effect of REM on NLLC creation is positive and decreases as ECI increases. In Europe, we do not find any positive or negative role, whereas, in Latin American and the Caribbean countries, we observe a consistently positive average marginal effect of REM on NLLC creation, which increases as ECI increases. Fourthly, based on our empirical results, we present and discuss some policy implications. Our findings suggest that economic policies should be tailored to the specific needs of each country to address the challenges they face. Policy initiatives such as reducing informality, improving competition, lowering remittance transfer costs, and introducing a special legal status for new firms created through remittances would facilitate the channelling of remittances toward new business creation. Additionally, institutions in origin countries should encourage the creation of diaspora networks to increase awareness of new business opportunities in their respective countries of origin. Due to data availability constraints, we examine 78 countries from 2006 to 2020 in our empirical analysis, and we use a negative binomial regression model to estimate the relationship between remittances, economic complexity, and new firm creation. This estimation strategy is suitable because our dependent variable is an over-dispersed count variable. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we review the relevant literature. Section 3 provides a detailed account of our empirical investigation, and Sect. 4 presents our results. Policy implications are discussed in Sect. 5, and the paper concludes with Sect. 6.",

It is well known that economies with high (low) levels of electricity production and consumption tend to have higher (lower) levels of economic growth and development (Akinbami et al 2021). Therefore, access to electricity is one of the most crucial services governments can provide for improving the standard of living for poor people (Mahfouh and Amar 2014). The global urgency to increase peoples access and use of electricity is re-iterated in the sustainable development goal (SDG) 7 which seeks to “…ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all…”. Over the last few decades there have been growing concerns over the worlds dependency on coal for generating most of the world’s electricity. The green-house gas emissions (GHG) and the non-renewability associated with the use of ‘dirty energy’ have prompted a global movement towards a ‘cleaner and greener’ world. Renewable energies are considered the ideal energy source for addressing the ‘twin global energy’ problems of poorer countries lacking access to electricity and richer countries with electricity access using dirty sources (International Energy Agency 2022). For instance, renewables have been argued to be more energy resilient compared to dirty energy sources and present technological advantages which can overcome problems of power outages (Anderson et al. 2018). Moreover, renewable energies have been advocated to have less harmful health effects on populations compared to non-renewable sources which are often associated with respiratory infections such as tuberculosis, low birthweight, cardiovascular problems, eye infections—all which lead to increased health expenses and reduced labour productivity (Rahut et al. 2017; Sahoo et al. 2022). However, renewables are also notorious for being high-priced and high-maintenance (Li et al. 2019). Furthermore, the slow response of developing economies towards adopting renewables and the current low usage of renewables may not be sufficient to impact long-run economic growth. Ultimately, the importance of developing countries transitioning into cleaner electricity production cannot be ignored and an important policy question is whether renewable electricity production can support socio-economic development in these countries. Amongst SSA countries, South Africa has attracted the most empirical attention on the (non)renewables-growth relationship and researchers consider the country an ideal case study for a variety of reasons. For instance, Ziramba (2008, 2009, 2015), Odhiambo (2009, 2010) and Akinbami et al. (2021) all find interest in South Africa as the largest producer, consumer and exporter of electricity in Africa which implies that any developments in the country’s domestic energy sector are most likely to spillover to many countries in the continent. Other authors highlight the country’s status as the largest emitter of carbon emissions in the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) and being amongst the top emitters in the world (Bah and Azam 2017, Akadiri et al. 2019; Bekun et al. 2019; Magazzino et al., 2021) whereas a few others highlight the country’s potential for creating clean energy such as boasting the only nuclear plant in Africa (Phiri and Nyoni 2016), being the only African country with coastal regions on both the Indian and Atlantic sides of the Oceans which gives the country a greater advantage in creating wind power (Akinbami et al. 2021) and also having abundant agricultural residual and sunshine levels for solar and biomass power generation, respectively (Ziramba 2009, 2013; Ayamolowo and Kusakana 2022). Nonetheless, the current empirical evidence on the impacts of renewable and non-renewable energy usage on economic growth for South Africa is inconclusive with some studies finding a positive impact of (non)renewables on growth (Akinboade et al. 2008; Ziramba 2013; Phiri and Nyoni 2016; Khobai and Le Roux 2018; Nyoni and Phiri (2020);;;;) whilst other studies find insignificant (Bhattacharya et al. 2016; Destek and Aslan 2017) or negative relationships (Shakouri and Yazdi 2017). Most notable these previous studies tend to use conventional cointegration models such as the FMOLS, DOLS, ARDL, VECM and granger causality tests, all which assume a linear relationship between the variables and are sensitivity to the choice of time period used for the analysis. Only a few studies employ nonlinear techniques such as the N-ARDL model and nonlinear granger causality tests which permit the researcher to evaluate certain forms of asymmetric whilst ignoring others. Our study proposes the use of more rigorous analytical tools which can capture various forms of asymmetries and whose results are not sensitivity to the choice of time period. Our study makes use of the continuous wavelet coherence methods to investigate the time–frequency relationship between renewable/non-renewable electricity production and economic growth in South Africa. Wavelets are mathematical tools which decompose a time series into different scales and thus localizes the signal in time–frequency space. This differs from econometric techniques which can only localize a series across a time (i.e. time series analysis) or a frequency plane (i.e. Fourier transforms) but not across both. The wavelet transforms of a time series can be envisioned in a three-dimensional plane consisting of time, real part and the imaginary/complex part from which the extracted amplitude and phase dynamics allows one to model the synchronization between a pair of variables in time–frequency space. The time–frequency synchronization of the series allows one to examine the co-movement between a pair of time series across 5 dimensions, namely; (i) a time-varying dimension (ii) frequency-varying dimension (iii) strength-varying dimension (iv) in-phase (positive co-movement) or anti-phase (negative co-movement) dimension (v) led-lag (causality) dimension. And whilst we acknowledge a growing number of empirical papers in the literature which use wavelet coherence analysis in energy studies (i.e. Mutascu (2018) for CO2 emissions and trade; Mata (2020) for electricity consumption and financial development; Magazzino et al. (2021) for energy and growth; Adebayo et al. (2022) for carbon emissions on economic growth, renewable energy, technological innovation and trade openness), our study is the first to make an application to the (non)renewable electricity – growth relationship. Our study uses wavelet coherence analysis to simultaneously address four empirical issues on the electricity-growth nexus, the first concerning the sign of the relationship, the second pertaining to the direction of causality between the variables, the third to whether the observed relationships are short-run or long-run, and the fourth to whether there exist time-varying and cyclical-varying asymmetries in the observed relationships. We further disaggregate electricity generation into dirty and clean sources for comparative purposes and use the findings to inform policymakers and other stakeholders if there are any economic benefits of phasing out coal in the electricity generation sector and including/increasing green energy sources on ESKOMs electricity grid. Altogether, our study presents new stylized facts on the relationship between ‘clean’ versus ‘dirty’ electricity production debate in South Africa and our findings have direct implications for the country’s electricity provider, ESKOM, who have been facing worsening ‘electricity outages’ caused by ‘breakdowns’ in local coal-based power stations. In this context, an important policy question which our study addresses is whether a shift from non-renewables to renewables electricity usage can simultaneously circumvent the load shedding problem and support long-run economic growth in an environmentally friendly manner. Moreover, our disaggregated analysis allows us to determine which source of clean electricity production is most sustainable for long-run growth and which sources need to be further developed to a level required to support such growth. The rest of the study is structured as follows. The next section of the paper presents the literature review. Section 3 presents the data and methods whilst Sect. 4 presents the empirical analysis. Section 5 presents further discussions of the results by comparing the results with previous literature providing policy implications whilst the study is concluded in Sect. 6.",1
